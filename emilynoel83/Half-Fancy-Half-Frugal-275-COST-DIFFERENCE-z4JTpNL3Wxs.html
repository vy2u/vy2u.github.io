is going to be a little bit different
kind of makeup tutorial I want to tell
you up front that one half of my face
costs more than five times the amount of
the other side the makeup used on one
side of my face totaled out to three
hundred and thirty nine dollars and on
the other side it's just sixty two
dollars and thirty four cents so by now
you're probably wondering which side is
which or maybe you've figured it out
this side is all high-end and this side
is all drugstore and in this video I'll
be showing you basically a tutorial of
how all of those drugstore products
applied right next to everything I'm
going to give you a quick rundown of
everything that's on the high-end side
of my face I'm wearing Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation that's $38 I put
on NARS radiant creamy concealer on the
under eye area and around my nose and
that's $29 Estee Lauder Double Wear
powder to set everything that's $40 $40
also for the anastacio contour palette
where I used one kind of cool tone
contour shade around the cheekbone in
the hairline and I used one highlight
shape from that palette as well and then
it's a blush I used Estee Lauder wild
sunset blush and that's $32 on the brows
I used to face bulletproof brows a $30
product which does come with its own
brush and for the eyes I used the
classic Urban Decay Naked palette which
is $54 as an eyeliner I used my tarte
precision long wear liner which is a
felt tip liner pen that costs $20 and i
finished off the eyes with mascara i
used lancome grandiose mascara which is
$32 for the lips I went with actually
one of my favorite high-end lip colors
so this was kind of a challenge to do
but I used my bite pomegranate lipstick
and that's $24 for a full size so again
the grand total for the high-end side of
my face is 339 dollars so I thought I
bet I can beat that price with drugstore
products on the other side the challenge
was really finding things that totally
matched up so now I'll take you through
that side in tutorial fashion and I did
put on my drugstore foundation right
after I applied the double wear because
I thought
if that's gonna be the overall base for
the look I don't want to like completely
have one side done and then do the other
I use Rimmel lasting finish foundation
which is $6.99 I just blended that in
with a buffing brush it's a matte finish
foundation but I do think it looks
pretty nice and natural on the skin and
then I use maybelline superstay better
skin concealer a similar format to NARS
it does have the doe foot applicator but
it's $7.99 compared to $29 and I use
that again on the under eye area and
around my nose and just blended that in
with a brush as a setting powder I use
Milani multitasker this is six dollars
and forty nine cents compared to the $40
Estee Lauder powder both a very matte
finish and both can potentially be built
up to a pretty full coverage look but I
used it pretty lightly just to set
everything for contouring I used my wet
and wild contouring palette just two
shades here compared to that full
anastacio palette but it also only cost
three dollars and ninety three cents so
I used that cool tone beige color in the
hollows of my cheeks I also went around
the hairline and then I just used that
overall kind of matte type highlight
shade on top of the cheeks and anywhere
I just wanted to brighten up then for
the blush I used my Jordana coral sandy
beach blush which costs $2.99 I just
applied that to the outer part of the
apple of my cheek it has that same kind
of satiny finish a little bit of a glow
that that Estee Lauder wild sunset blush
does moving on to the brows I used my
NYX taemin frame which is $6.99 this
does not come with the brush but I just
used that to fill in any sparse areas of
my brows a shade brunette is definitely
a color dupe for the universal brunette
shade in the Too Faced product for eyes
I stuck with one palette to get the same
look that I achieved with the Urban
Decay Naked palette I used my city color
barely exposed palette $7.99 compared to
$54 and that Brown that I used in my
crease would be a dupe for buck so I
just blended that in with my e25 brush
and then I used the equivalent of sin I
use that shade up under the brow as my
highlight I also use that really
shimmery color around my inner corner
and just up onto the lid a little bit
then I patted on a shade that's a dupe
for Dark Horse I just applied that to
deepen up the outer part of the lid and
up into the crease just a little bit and
we're putting a pause on the eyeshadow
for a second I went in with my winged
liner and I used my Milani eye tech
extreme which is the exact same shape
style intensity of product as the tarte
liner and I applied that across the
upper lash line then I really followed
that shape with a deep color from the
city color palette which is very close
to creep from Urban Decay and I just
gave myself a very deep and defined
crease I also took that just on the
lower lash line a little bit with an
angled brush to finish off the eyes I
applied my $5.99 covergirl super sizer
mascara definitely a mascara I'm loving
right now and I do think it can give the
intensity and length that I get from the
Lancome grandiose so I use that on top
and bottom
finally I've used my NYX high voltage
lipstick in Hollywood which I found to
be the exact same tone of red and a very
similar finish to my bite pomegranate
lipstick so I just applied that no liner
no glosses thrown in I just wanted you
to see what these two lipstick shades
look like side-by-side and that my
friends is the finished look it's proof
that you really can pull off a similar
look with products that cost so much
less than these high-end alternatives
and I do love the high-end products and
I think that's really what it's all
about
I so enjoy many of those Estee Lauder
products the Urban Decay Naked palette
abite lipsticks so I really wanted to
find drugstore products that I thought
could achieve that like high-level look
and I was really pleased with the
outcome if you'd like to see more videos

you guys so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
