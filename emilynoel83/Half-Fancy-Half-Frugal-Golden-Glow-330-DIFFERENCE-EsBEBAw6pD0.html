joining me for the second edition of my
half fancy half frugal series this is
where I do one side of my face with all
high-end products and then I tried to
dupe all those on the other side of my
face with drugstore items my last look
was very classic and glam and this one I
went with more of a summertime golden
glow type of look and I used more
products it's kind of crazy the price
difference between each side of my face
is 334 dollars and 22 cents so which
side do you think is which which is
drugstore which is high-end I'll tell
you now this side is high-end it cost
four hundred and thirty-five dollars
that was the grand total of products
used and then on the drugstore side it
was just over a hundred dollars one
hundred dollars and seventy eight cents
to be exact so before we get into the
drugstore half tutorial I do want to
tell you about the products I use that
were high-end first off to kind of lay
the foundation for this more lightweight
kind of dewy type look on the skin I
used my Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation that's $62 then I used my
Yves pearl dual concealer that's $39 I
used my Laura Mercier loose setting
powder to set the under eye area that's
$37 also my it cosmetics celebration
illumination powder foundation just
lightly all over the skin that's 35
Estee Lauder bronze goddess this is like
a half and half powder bronzer that's
$37 I use the benefit majorette cream
blush it's a pretty coral type shade
that's $28 and then top that with
benefit high beam which is $26 is my
highlight I use the Mac prep and prime
fix plus rose which is $22 just on the
one side of my face
he used a sigma brow pencil which was
only $9 but my low cost alternative is
even cheaper i prime my lids with bare
minerals primetime eye primer that's $18
and then used the lorac unzipped gold
palette which is $42 my eye liner is the
Kat Von D autographed liner in immortal
love
I don't think this is available anymore
but I believe that used to sell for $19
I used the benefit roller lash on my
upper and lower lashes that's $24 and
then on the lips the main color is
coming from lip liner and I used my Too
Faced perfect lips in perfect spice and
I top that off with matte cream Sheen
glass in Boyde bait which is $20 and I
have a special edition packaging on that
but again everything on this side the
face totals out to 435 dollars so now I
want to take you through in tutorial
form all the drugstore products that I
used to achieve a similar look
I used the NYX HD foundation in soft
beige all over this was sent to me by
NYX and I was kind of shocked when I
looked online and saw the $18 price tag
on this still substantially less than
the Giorgio Armani I do feel like it
gave me a similar look on the skin then
I used my Sonia Kashuk all covered up
concealer $9.99 at Target a very similar
consistency to the Yves pearl and I just
used that around my under eye area and a
little bit around my nose and I set that
with my Ben Nye luxury powder in cameo
this is nine dollars for this monstrous
size and this is a really lightweight
finishing powder and then get totally
mimics the effect of that powder from
Laura Mercier then I use this Milani
bronzer excel in fake tan which is
practically identical to that Estee
Lauder bronze goddess there's a nice
cool tone shade in here that I think
works well for contouring so I took that
around the hairline the cheekbone and I
used that little bit lighter shade just
above the hollow of the cheek and just
to kind of warm up my skin as a whole
then I use this Physicians Formula
superbee be the shade is natural peach
at $6.99 and it is like the exact same
texture and tone as benefit majorette so
I really got a similar look out of that
blush they also both have a really nice
scent to them it's kind of interesting
for my highlight I wanted that same kind
of pinky luminosity that benefit high
beam has and I found that in the Catrice
illuminating highlighter pen for 5.99 I
put a little bit on my hand and again
pick it up with a small stipple brush
and just dab it on the tops of the
cheekbones next I did my brows with the
elf instant brow lift pencil in taupe
really nice cool toned pencil and works
well for a minimal
on my brows it's only $2.00 and then to
prime my lids I use the Wet n Wild
Fergie eyeshadow primer that's $4.99 and
the shadows I used to dupe the look that
I got from the lorac unzipped gold
palette are from the covergirl go for
the gold quad so I used that very warm
kind of coppery gold shade patted that
all over my eyelid I went around my
inner corner with the yellowish gold
I used that deep dark brown and patted
that on the outer part of my eyelid and
really got that all the way into the
crease from the inner corner to the
outer corner and then really started
crafting this fairly precise outer V I
also smudged that dark shade down on the
lower lash line then I went inward with
a bit of the copper
I also took that copper and blended it
just above the dark brown so really
coming up above the crease with that
shade making it a little more dramatic
and very warm and then I took the
yellowish gold and went straight under
the brow with that shade and believe it
or not I actually found the textures of
the shadows in this $6.99 quad to be a
little bit smoother and easier to blend
than some of the lorac shades so that
was surprising for my eyeliner I used a
dark brown from NYC it's the waterproof
eyeliner pencil $3.57 I used that in my
lower inner rim I did have to work a bit
harder to build that shade up than the
Kat Von D but I applied it to my upper
lash line as well then I curl my lashes
applied covergirl super sizer mascara
which does seem to have the same curl
holding effect as the benefit roller
lash and I applied that to my upper and
lower lashes on my lips a total goop for
the Too Faced perfect spice lip liner is
the Milani color statement lip pencil in
spice and then I used my almay liquid
lip balm in rosy lifts it definitely has
the same effect as the Mac boy baked
gloss and I set the drugstore side of my
face with the elf makeup mist and set
for three dollars and you guys this look
was a really big challenge I feel like
the first time I did this half fancy
half frugal thing I really had a lot of
the products in my mind to begin with
that I wanted to use for the look and so
for this one some of the face products
came together fairly easily but then
when I was moving on to eyes I spent so
long
over the last you know week and a half
I've been experimenting with this look
and tweaking the look and I've become
very familiar with what the staying
power is like okay this is a voiceover
now I am just looking back on the
pictures from the day and just wanted to
point out a few things after four hours
I can still see a lot of the lip product
I know the glosses worn off but I can
still see the color for the most part
there so I'm pretty happy with how
things look after four hours although I
can see and I remembered seeing this in
a mirror a little smudging on the
high-end side on the lower lash line
after seven hours a lot more smudging
there as you can see lip products I
think I've totally worn off at this
point but I'm seeing a lot more of my
freckles come through over on the
high-end side I really think that
Giorgio Armani foundation looks pretty
when you first get it on but the staying
power it's just got so much moisture in
it for me and I don't have even
especially oily skin my skin's pretty
normal but it just seems to wear down
faster than what was happening on my
drugstore side I really think it's more
about the foundation than the setting
mist because I've noticed this happening
with this foundation on numerous
occasions after 11 hours sorry the
lighting is slightly different but I am
seeing a significant amount of smudging
under the eye I can tell that my wings
from my eye shadow even though I didn't
go like rubbing on my eyes it's still a
little bit better on the drugstore side
than the high-end side I don't feel like
my skin looks overly oily or greasy it's
just that I can see more wear of the
foundation on the high-end side the
finish of both of these foundations when
they were first applied seemed pretty
similar but obviously there's a
different formulation happening there so
thank you guys so much for taking time
to watch I hope this was a useful video
for you if you're looking for some
alternatives to high-end products this
might give you some ideas just seeing
things in action and I would love to
hear your requests if there's a
different themed look you'd like to see
in this series I'd be happy to try it
for you so thank you so much for
watching I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
