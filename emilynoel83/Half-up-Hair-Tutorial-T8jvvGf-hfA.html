bathroom I'm going to wear the lighting
is awful but I think it'll be good
enough to do a hair tutorial so I'm
going to show you how to do sort of a
half-up half-down look that is a little
more dressy maybe then just the average
you know pulling it back so yeah all you
need is a comb that you can write your
hair with so a very you know kind of
fine toothed comb this one I got from
Sally's and it has this little pic here
so you can give it some lift another
thing you'll need is a couple of bobby
pins and also one of these little things
it's like a sort of just your
traditional old hair pin you can get a
big pack of them at Sally's for like a
doll or something you know they
sometimes come like this you can bend
them in a little bit but that's to do
some lifting with your hair so i'll show
you that technique in a second but what
I've done for now is um you know my hair
is just kind of naturally a little bit
how it is I get hit it with a curling
iron just a little bit on the bottoms
just to give it a little bit of a curl
up cold under effect and you could do
this with completely straightened hair
or hair that is you've put in rollers so
I'm it's just whatever you prefer there
so what I've done is I've given it a
pretty deep side part and you can do
that easily with your comb and now what
I'm going to do is sort of pick a point
here where I'm going to start sort of
backcombing or teasing the hair so I'm
going to give my I'm giving myself in a
little bit of bang a few inches there
and then I'm going to just pull up right
kind of worthy you know they wear your
crown starts I guess you'd say and I'm
going to pull up a section of hair here
and this is going to be the first
section that I sort of do little teasing
lips so then I pull it straight up
straight up in the air and I'm going to
take some hairspray that I consider to
be relatively fast drying it is from vo5
extreme style and I'm going to spray the
back of it
like that just a few quick hits and
hairspray as you can see the hair that
I've pulled back it's just kind of a
thin strip there and I'm going to take
my comb sorry I'm really going to
sterling my camera angle I'm just I'm
just doing some backcombing with it I'm
just pull you know teasing the hair
going down slightly on the back ok and
I'm going like basically all the way up
to where my hand is holding it and there
we go so you can see that lift there and
then I'm going to pull another section
just to the side of that and I'm going
to do the same thing spray it splay the
back of the hair lift it up and then
back comb ok so you can see how these
are kind of blending together just a
little bit and do that in another place
on the other side spray the back and
tease it ok doesn't it's not doing what
bird at this point by any means so don't
don't expect anything to look real even
or anything and then I'm going to take
right on the short side of the part I
guess you'd say I'm going to spritz that
and just continue so basically we're
just teasing the top layer of our hair
and then even with the bangs because we
want a nice kind of blended look we're
going to switch that so well ok so
basically this is what you should look
like at this point and before we start
sort of tearing the t's aspect down
we're going to split the hair all over
with your mouth spray and then here's
where this pin comes in this pin is an
easy way to not undo all of your of the
teasing that has been done to your hair
sometimes you can go over it with a comb
and then you start losing everything
that you've done and you you know this
you want this to sort of a you
you know you want that bump in your hair
so so this is how weird you in it and
basically I'm just running it through
I'm going to sort of take those bangs
and sort of shake them down what I want
them to be and then blend parts back so
we're smoothing it we're trying to get
more of an even look and this is these
pins are just so ideal for that rather
than using a comb because as you can see
I'm still keeping a lot of the part that
I tease okay so now it would sort of
brought it down a little bit we're going
to take most of what we have been
messing with that top layer of hair and
we're going to start kind of pulling it
back to write about the middle of the
back of our head okay and so sort of as
you do that you want to be kind of
smoothing and making sure you know
everything is how it should be here and
if it's not perfect at this point no
worries we're going to be we're going to
be messing with that and making it a
little more even and what I'm going to
do at this point now that i'm at the
middle of the back of my head I'm going
to try to turn around and stay in fright
actually let me see you type hey Tyler
could you come here a second Tyler's
going to help me make sure I'm still in
frame on this could you just look at
this and tell me if I'm still when I
turn around if I'm still in the shot
yeah right in my right okay thank you
okay thanks to Tyler for doing that now
I'm going to show you how I do my bobby
pins what grab my other one sorry this
is like my first hair tutorial of this
is kind of why of state of waiver it's
so hard to make sure you're doing what
you want to do but um basically put in
one pin
they're on where you want your you're
securing your hair and the middle in the
back of your head take the other one and
we're going to basically crisscross them
right there okay so that is secure it
may not seem like two bobby pins will
you know wind up being that secure but
it really will be so now you're look at
what you got and you're thinking well
talk to even in some places that's where
this pin comes in again you're going to
kind of smooth it out and you can stick
it in and sort of manipulate how this
looks you can poke it right down in your
hair easily and poof it back up or you
want it to be and then you're also
messing with your bangs here I like to
sort of take those and get them behind
my ear but I have some short layers so
they don't all like to go behind and
that is the reason why we involve that
in the writing process when we were
doing that earlier and I picked up the
bang porn and I started writing it
because that helps kind of blend the
hair together and it also keeps you know
those short bangs hanging in there so
now that we've got the shape how we want
it we can continue to shape it with
hairspray so I'm going to first go over
the bang area and you just kind of a
slight spritz all over and definitely a
spritz where we've got those bobby pins
back there and then I'm just going to
with my hands you know you want that
shape to be so I don't know if you can
see this but you don't want a big you
don't want it to look like bottom heavy
so to speak you want it to have that
nice shape like you got lift up here not
back in here okay you want it to be hype
that is going up like that shape is so
important with any of these styles where
you've teased your hair whatsoever so
I'm going to now that I've sprayed it
you know we're just continuing to shape
it I think I've got it how I want it and
get that bang part behind make sure this
part is really smooth and sleep and this
is a hair of you that I you know will
wear all the news it's just it's
polished and it gives you a little more
interest as far
is just you know rather than having your
hair just completely flipped back and
this is also a technique that you can
take in another video I'll show you how
I do this look I start out here and then
from here you can easily pull your hair
to the side get a cute side ponytail and
you can wrap it with your own hair and
it's like your own a hair tie made out
of your hair so we'll talk about that
another time but I hope you enjoyed this
hair tutorial and thanks for watching
