is going to be a super quick very easy
hair tutorial I almost feel funny
calling at a tutorial because it's just
like one little trick that will help you
achieve this little top not half up half
down bun aka the fun bun which ever
since Tyler started referring to mine is
that that's the only thing I can think
of when I think of this hairstyle it the
nice thing about this look at least in
my opinion is that it doesn't have to be
precise at all you know it's just kind
of a very easy go with the flow type
look very beachy and it's just fun you
know like this look might not be for
everyone but whenever I've wearing it I
just feel like hey you know I have a bun
on today I'm rocking my bun then I've
still got all this hair down here and
you feel a little more glamorous I've
seen this here to a couple times on TV
and in magazines and when I first tried
to do it I felt like it was taking me
way too long to create this bun up here
because I was pulling my hair half up
but my hair is very fine so when I take
just this half up section and twist it
into a bun it looks like teeny tiny it's
like I don't know it's the size of its
like smaller than the size of this
Beauty Blender sponge on top of my head
it just I don't know it doesn't even
make sense to have it there if it's
gonna be that teensy so I started
thinking about ways i could beef it up a
little bit and you know those like mesh
doughnuts that you might use to wrap
your hair around for just a regular bun
they seem way too big but my good old
friend the scrunchie came in it does
save the day for this look and just as a
starting point you know you can wear
your hair wavy or straight I award my
hair straight with this style recently
so you can see how that looks today just
to show you you know how it looks with a
little more texture so beyond whatever
you use to style your hair you just need
a scrunchie and then an additional like
elastic hair tie preferably something
that will blend in with your hair color
in case it shows a little bit but it
shouldn't really end up showing up in
this look so the first thing you do is
just kind of section off some hair for
your half up part I go you know a couple
inches above my ear with what I pull up
and it's totally up to you you know
however you want this look to come off
and I don't feel the need to do any
really precise sectioning with
this but once you've got that sectioned
off you kind of want to make sure you're
pulling it up right on top of your head
if the bun is placed too far back on
your head of a look kind of funny so you
really want it to be like a top knot and
then take your scrunchie and I go around
my hair three times with my scrunchie
case you're wondering why I have
scrunchies on hand still they're
actually really good if you sleep with
your hair in a high ponytail at night
put a scrunchie around it and then when
you take it down in the morning your
hair's got so much more volume it
doesn't leave any kind of dent in the
hair so I think I talked about that in a
favorites video a while ago anyway now
that your hair is pulled up and do this
super fun high ponytail you know whip it
around whatever and then start wrapping
it just kind of I like to pull the
ponytail forward and then just begin
wrapping around the scrunchie and what
that scrunchie does is it gives your bun
a little extra size and just something
easy to wrap around to give you the
shade and once you finished wrapping you
know kind of tuck the ends and then I
take just a dark brown elastic band and
I go around my bun twice with that and
then you can kind of start moving things
around a bit if you still got any end
sprucing out you can tuck them in but
basically once you've done that you're
bunt feels really secure and then you
can spray it with just a little bit of
hairspray to ensure that it doesn't go
anywhere I've course got little baby
hairs that I'm doing stuff with but once
you're finished with that the look is
pretty much done for me I've really
enjoy it in the summer because I like
having my hair off of my face and this
is just like one more style that allows
me to do that and if you try this style
I really hope you'll send me some
pictures on snapchat or maybe tag me on
instagram so I can see so thank you guys
I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
