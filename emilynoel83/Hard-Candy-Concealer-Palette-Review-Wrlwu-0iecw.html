going to be reviewing something that I
mentioned I picked it up quite a while
ago and it has taken you a while to
really get a definitive opinion on this
product and it is the hard candy
concealer palette it's called nobody's
perfect and you get six different shades
it says it's the ultimate professional
make-up to old tones are perfect for
dark circles and uneven skin tone the
texture is light easy to plumb easy to
blend with a detachable brush and it is
the fair palette that's the one that i'm
using i think they had fair and medium
and medium appeared to be very dark for
my skin tone so let's just take a look
at it first it's got it just opens up as
one whole compact and then you've got
six different shades now the shades
right here are sort of like color
correcting shades so you've got a green
a yellow and a pink and then you've got
three sort of more skin tones change
shades you've got like a deep beige a
medium and say a lighter beige color so
that's your whole palette and then what
they said about the brush you get this
little thing here that little bitty
brush I have not even used this because
honestly it's way too small it's way too
small for anything i'm going to use it
for unless this was a lip brush you know
with a lip gloss palette but for a
concealer palette you know it's adorable
but not very practical so anyway as far
as the texture of these and they they
claim to be a very light easy to blend
texture and I will give them that they
are easy to blend and they are very
light however are they too light to
actually cover things up and that's the
problem i was running into in terms of
these lighter shades the color
correcting shades i didn't use these the
most by any means the yellow if anything
which yellow can kind of counteract
bluish circles in your under eye area
but the pink and the green I've never
been a big fan of the concept of using
green to cover up redness it's just
never really seemed that effective to me
and the pink I haven't hardly used it
all so I'm
don't even know what on the face I would
really need to use that pink for it
really I mean it's just kind of there
for me so I didn't find that to be an
essential part of the palette but yeah
the yellow would have been the one of
those three that I use the most and it
comes off extremely light instead of
getting a nice pigmented yellow tone
concealer you're actually just getting
something that comes off just extremely
light you know I can't tell it lets
yellow it just looks practically white
actually so I'm not not so great on
these these are a little bit better on
the ones down below they seem to have a
different texture each one of them which
i found i find pretty unusual you know
this lightest beige shade and I don't
know if maybe this is varying from
person to palate to palette that people
may have purchased but at least on mine
this one is very thin you touch it and
it's a very very thin consistency okay
like you rub it between your fingers and
it's not hardly you know it's just very
very very thin this middle one seems to
have a little more moisture to it it
almost feels a little more greasy which
I don't like just a thin Gracie
concealer that's not really doing
anything for you this one right here is
as close as I can find to a nice creamy
somewhat rich concealer and that's the
darker shade here fortunately that's the
one that actually matches my skin tone
that I've used a little bit more like
around my eye area and that actually you
know if you were to rub it between your
fingers you're feeling a little more
resistance you know it's not just
sliding around it's got a little bit of
a creamy texture to it however you go
ahead and put it on your eye area I used
it today on my eyes and honestly I can
still see the circles guys I'm in a very
unforgiving light right now I'm in
natural daylight so you're really seeing
everything and I applied it I didn't
just do one little spot I really you
know kind of blended different shades
together tried to get the best finish
and i found this time and time again
that if you don't have a big problem
with circles these would probably be
okay for you but if you really want to
get rid of some
discoloration right in here in the
inside of your eye I mean but I'm sorry
but Bobby Brown creamy concealer kit can
completely erase that on me and so can
NYX concealer in a jar it's not quite
the superior texture that Bobby Brown's
is but it can still do a better job in
my opinion than this what else at the
kat von d tattoo concealer if you're in
more a fan of like a liquidy squeezed
out kind of concealer that's a very
sheer but get the coverage in the
pigmentation in it is fantastic again if
you don't have a big problem a lot of
problem areas on face say you don't have
a lot of blemishes to cover up I had one
right here which actually looking close
up in my mirror it looks more concealed
now than it did like up close in my
mirror but I mean if you don't have huge
problems on your face to mask this may
do it for you but just be aware that
you're not going to get like full full
coverage these you've got to get to get
really great coverage on your under eye
area you need a concealer that actually
has a nice creamy texture there's one in
here that has the tech that is even
close to what I feel is the desirable
texture to really be creamy enough to
mask those under eye circles so I can
still see them somewhat here they're
kind of disguise but they're not totally
so I just want to be honest with you
guys I mean it's an adorably packaged
product and I do like the fact that
you're getting options here you're
getting the ability to blend and you
know kind of see what's what and I
really like that at first just having
the options but mooring is the more I
kind of started to think this just isn't
you know if I had to rely on this day in
and day out to be my concealer I don't
think I'd like it so anyway guys sorry
for the downer review on that it is an
adorable product but um if you only if
you really don't have a lot of under eye
problems you just have minor minor
discoloration that you want to mask will
that probably that'll this may work for
you in that case but maybe not others so
thank you guys so much for tuning in for
this review and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
