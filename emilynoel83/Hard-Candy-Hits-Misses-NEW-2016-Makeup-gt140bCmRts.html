little under the weather today got a
little bit of a stuffy nose slash runny
nose but I have been playing around with
a lot of new products from hard candy
and typical hard candy style they've
come out with a bunch all at once so I
wanted to go ahead and give you my
little reviews on all of these things
definitely a video where there are hits
and misses and a few things in between
I'm going to start out with this new
sheer envy primer it says lift and firm
so I actually am a fan of just the
original sheer envy primer that they put
out I always thought it was really silky
and just made that nice even texture to
the skin before you put foundation on
and since that original I feel like
they've come out with quite a few
versions of it and this may just be the
latest one it says moisturizes brightens
and tightens facial contours and I'm not
really sure how to take the description
it says that Titans facial contours so
skin appears rested and relaxed so it's
tightening yet relaxing I'm not sure the
lifting and firming I'm not really sure
I could notice anything happening like
that like if I didn't look at the label
on this primer and just put it on my
face all I would really think was that
okay this is a nice nourishing kind of
moisturizing primer and it's kind of
interesting because it is oil free so if
you're looking for a good oil-free
primer that still actually feels like it
adds a little hydration to the skin you
might like this I do love the way it
kind of slips across the skin I don't
notice any brightening when I use this
that was another one of the claims but
it's an OK primer and it's good from the
hydration standpoint another interesting
thing that hard-candy has come out with
is the sheer envy hydrating primer mist
it says 12 hour power
electrolytes energize and hydrate skin
this is oil free silicone free and
alcohol-free and you get two point two
fluid ounces here I've tried a couple a
different primer mists and to me you
know they just seem like interchangeable
with a lot of the different facial myths
that are out there like you could set in
just about anything and get the similar
effect is the way I felt about these
this is actually one of the few mists
that I've tried where I really do feel
and added hydrated effect even after
I've put it on and let it
kind of sit there on the skin because
obviously you could spend all day life
spritzing it on your skin and wow I feel
hydrated how about that but when you
just do a few myths of this on your skin
and then let it sink in and touch your
face you can still feel that hydration
on there so today when I put this on I
obviously used it after that other
primer but I have used it alone to
really see exactly what it's doing and I
do like formas of this I kind of go
center of the face and then each side
and even after letting that sit on there
for about a minute you can still kind of
touch your face and it just has a
different level of hydration and part of
this I think there is a cat behind me
and part of the reason for the hydrated
feeling I think is because glycerin is
so high on the ingredients list it's the
first thing after water in this product
so it does give the skin that little
added moisture boost but I don't think
it really helped my foundation go on any
more smoothly or evenly as far as the
12-hour claim I really think that's kind
of hard to gauge especially when you've
got various other products on your skin
like a regular moisturizer like a
foundation and whatever else there might
be one thing that I did notice about
this as a rehydrating mist like to spray
it later in the day or to make the skin
look dewy by using a mist
this mist with a minimal amount of
sprays actually seems to make the most
impact on the skin in terms of making it
look dewy like after makeup application
or later on the day I can really see
what this is done so for me this is
probably one of the most moisture packed
sprays that I've tried then we've got a
couple of little tins here one is the
contour and sculpt kit I have it in
light to medium it also came in a deeper
shade option and the strobing kit which
just came in one shade and with this
contour kit you get two powder products
and three creams and as far as packaging
goes it's kind of a plasticy insert here
but actual pans of product are sitting
right here and then the brush it's a
flat top brush for this contour kit kind
of nice and soft and dense but the other
side is really strange it's just this
little brush cut at an angle but it has
a lot of unevenness on mine like it's
kind of there's a little chunk out of
the side over here looks like it's been
kind of dipped down into which with
whatever method they've used to cut this
so really like a chunky odd-looking
little brush on that end
and today I did use this cream contour
shade and I do think the tone of it is
pretty good you know it's kind of on the
cool side and I picked it up with this
brush I applied it with the brush and it
was it took a little work to blend out I
won't say it's the hardest thing ever to
blend out on your skin but it definitely
took more work and I had a little more
difficulty with it than I did with the
elf contour kit which I think just had
really nice smooth easy to blend out
shades and then I used this lighter
color that's a little bit more on the
peachy side I use that kind of under my
contour and a little bit over like on
the cheekbone area to brighten and lift
a little bit and some of these things
you might even choose to go like really
light on your foundation and just use
these mores like coverage products I
feel like this lighter shade over here
might have just a bit of a satin finish
but everything else in here is matte
other than the texture of these being a
little bit drier than I would have liked
it's kind of between the NYX palette
that I talked about recently the NYX
cream contour palette that was really
really dry and the elf is over here
being very rich and creamy this kind of
lies right in the middle for me
but another thing I wasn't super huge on
was the tone of this powder product here
which i think is very very warm even for
a bronzer you know so using that or
thinking you might top off your contour
with that product or just warm up the
skin as a whole yeah it'll really warm
yet but I think it's pretty orangie and
this shade works okay for me in terms of
like a powder brightener type product
although if you're very very fair um
this is so peachy I kind of wonder if
you'll get a lot of impact on that if
you're like the fairest of the fair so I
was happy to try this but it's really
not a love for me I think there are just
so many contouring products on the
market you've got to really step your
game up
but this strobing kit I actually thought
this was pretty cool I like the brush
that they included I really liked all
the products that were inside as well
although it strikes me more as just
being like a blush and contour palette
you know everything that's come out
these days that has the contour the
blush and the highlights it's really
just that kind of a thing except they do
include a very usable brush and they
include like a liquid highlight as well
this little brush I am so happy with I
mean I would use this a lot of times for
a highlight but you know it works for
contour it really works for every
product in this palette it's soft it's a
nice cut it seems to be good quality so
while today I used a couple of the cream
products and my look from that palette I
also wanted to show you some of these in
action so I used the contour shade to
kind of top off my cream contour and I
really enjoy this color it's not too
dark it's not too light it just really
works well for my skintone and it is
totally mad there's also a nice matte
kind of deep peachy blush in here that I
think is just beautiful and I love that
if they're going to give you all these
shimmery things up here you've got a
blush that's going to be met and it's
not like shimmer overload all over your
face the - powder highlights one is more
golden once a little bit more of a deep
peachy shade and then they give you this
strobing glow all the way face of body
cream Luminizer just a mini sized and
I've used glow all the way in a couple
of different shades that they have they
tend to be very metallic but this shade
when you squeeze it out it appears to be
white but when you totally sheer it out
on the skin
it's like you see this sort of pinkish
peach very light shimmer and once I
blended out as practically like that
totally disappears
it's it's extremely subtle like you've
really got to be looking close to notice
that that's been put on your skin I
think for the purposes of this kit what
it did for me was it gave my skin a
little extra maybe doing this in texture
to where when I use this powder
highlight on top it had a little
something to stick to
I do think both of these shades are
really strong highlights though like I
said I used the lighter of the two and I
thought it really does catch the light
and again this brush worked well for
everything so I did enjoy that strobing
kit although it's not just about
highlighting you do get the contour and
the blush don't expect a lot from this
liquid but all in all including that
brush I think it's kind of a nice value
now there's yet another contouring
product in hard candies line and it's
the highlight and contour face stick
I believe this came in some other shades
as well and you got your dark matte kind
of cool toned side here I have it in the
shade light and then the other end is
matte as well it's just kind of like a
light concealer is what it makes me
think of this is the packaging that it
comes in and then on the back it kind of
guides you through where to put the
contour and the highlight and so you
could just sweep this directly onto the
face and then blend it out with a brush
the other day when David was here he
used this on me to contour and he really
just you know put it everywhere he was
going under the jawline he just had it
all over and he really liked it he said
it was a nice tone and then a couple
days later I went to use it and I found
it kind of difficult to blend out again
I think I've been spoiled by where is it
this little elf contour palette the
cream contour but this works so well and
the shades are so effortless to blend
out when you put them over a foundation
there's no extra work and this I found
to be even more dry than the shades the
cream shades in this little palette here
so just a heads up I mean it's kind of a
nice concept and I do think the colors
the tones are on point for me when I
used a brush to blend this out I felt
like I was having to do a little bit too
much work and apply too much pressure
so the other day when I was using this I
actually brought in a damp Beauty
Blender and that helped a little bit but
it's just I don't know it's just not
ideal for me
hard candy also released a line of
cheeky tints they're called sheer blush
gels and there were quite a few shades
that this came in and I got the reddish
one it says a water light gel blush that
has all-day staying power incredibly
easy to blend mistake proof I don't know
that's totally mistake proof but I will
say it's very easy to blend because it
doesn't set too quickly on the skin
don't get me wrong it does eventually
set and stain but like you have a second
to work with it sometimes with Benetint
I feel like you dab your dots onto your
cheek and before you can even put the
dang thing down like that's starting to
set on the skin
I love the effect of it but you've got
to work so quickly this is I think a
little more foolproof it's definitely
easier to blend than I expected even
easier than that product I mentioned
that stain from the one table box the
other day like I don't absolutely have
to use my ELF small stipple brush with
this I can just use my fingers this is a
really pretty fresh red shade like a
warm red did you sheer it out you know
it does definitely leave a stain I can
see stayed there on my finger you can
build up the color more on your cheeks
if you want to mark candy has a new brow
product it's called brow ink it's a
24-hour brow stain they say and I have
it in medium dark the packaging I think
is very cute here you just twist out the
applicator and it's a teensy tinsy brush
there is a very small spiral and I love
this I really think this is so cool
because the product on the wand is
basically undetectable like you can
hardly tell anything's there but then
you start going through your brows and
you're like oh I can feel the hold you
know you can tell that there is color
laying down there there is hold
happening and unlike every other brow
gel on the market I actually feel like I
can use this little tip and more
precisely fill in where I want to I'm
surprised it didn't even include that in
the claims like that you could use the
very tippy tip of this brush and like if
you've got a scar like I do or just one
little play
that really needs some attention you can
just use that little tip and it won't be
too much so the way I like to use this
is first get the bulk of your color on
like more the center part of your brow
and then pull that through to the end of
your brows so once you've unloaded a
little bit of product not that this is
very loaded up with product but once
you've gotten some off of there then you
can go in and work on the inner part of
your brow and not get too much on but
this really is one of the few things
that operates is such an all-in-one for
me because I get to brush through I get
the hold but I also get the fill-in and
just the simplicity of it the speed of
it it's really nice now an eye product
that I just I hate this I really I
picked it up and I should have known
better I mean I should have known that I
wouldn't like it it's the bold and
gorgeous dare to flick felt tip eyeliner
in blackest black and I don't know if
it's just the color of the pen drew me
in and I'm like I'm intrigued I want to
try it but look at this why brands why
are we messing with the shape of our
felt tip liners and doing goofy stuff
like this that makes a way to thick line
across the lashes let's just go straight
to the demo here because it's you've got
to be operating on off of the absolute
tip of this product to get a fine line
otherwise you will get a line that is
exactly as thick as this little
egg-shaped felt tip is and I ended up
with a line that was way thicker than I
wanted I did not feel like this made
winging things out any easier at all not
to mention the fact that when moisture
comes in contact with this it breaks
down pretty quickly I mean if you're
looking for something that makes lining
easy if you're trying to practice with
liquid liner I would really suggest
getting the Physicians Formula pen the
eye booster pen which is actually a
brush tip it really like follows the
curve of your eye it makes sense you
know it's just easy to apply it's easy
to do a wing with that with this you've
got to be like working right off the
very tip if you want to fine line and
even then like I'm not seeing the
product lay down as well so then you're
tempted to lay it on its side and
oh then you've got a massive thick line
happening there I mean it's it's like
marker thick I don't get it and we're
going to end this video on a high note
hard candy has these new evelle vut
mousse matte lip colors and they come in
these tins and all of the tins are
different i have cherry blossom and it's
just like i don't know i don't know why
they did this i don't know why having a
little tin for your liquid lip color is
absolutely necessary i guess the one
practical thing about it is that there
is a mirror on the inside so that's kind
of cool but talking about the product
itself i really really like it it is
actually matte there have been a couple
of other brands i think either
maybelline or l'oreal maybe both i need
to spend more time with it because i'm
not real familiar yet but i remember
putting on some other matte products and
thinking they're not mad at all now
granted you can apply these products
blot them off and they look a whole lot
more matte but you have wasted some
product in that process this one
actually does dry matte it does so
pretty quickly after you apply it it's
not completely transfer resistant and
that's not a total requirement for me
but i'm just pointing that out in case
that was what you were expecting
obviously it feels more dry on the lips
than like a creamy lipstick would but
it's not overly drying like it's not
uncomfortable for me now I regularly
exfoliate my lips I treat them with
balms when I'm not wearing other lip
products so that I think can make a
difference for how comfortable a matte
lip color is going to feel on top of
your lips you want to put them in the
best condition possible to receive that
net lip product but I was so pleased
with how this wore throughout the day
didn't drift outside the lip line and
wore so surprisingly evenly and I have
worn this on like three or four
different occasions to check this but it
wears like it doesn't look patchy as it
wears off it doesn't like peel off of my
lips it's like after 5-6 hours it looks
like this color just kind of lightened
up a little bit across the board you
know it just really looks great I would
buy more of this for sure this cherry
blossom Shea is just a beautiful like
kind of pinky reddish rose type color I
also really like the applique
it's nice and flat one side when you
pull it out one side is holding some
product and the other side seems to be
basically free of products so that's
nice to kind of neaten up your line
without applying too much to the lips
and that my friends wraps up my little
hard candy haul and reviews again
something I liked
I enjoyed the strobing kit I thought
most of what was in there worked really
well this hydrating primer miss one of
the most hydrating facial mist that I've
tried that with minimal miss actually
makes the skin look pretty dewy this
lifted for a primer I'm kind of soso on
like I might have to use it longer to
feel like I'm noticing some of the
effects it claims to have but it felt
nice on the skin and I'll continue using
it but I just don't feel like it's
really changing my life you know wasn't
a huge fan of the contour and sculpt kit
again I found the creams to be a little
on the dry side and I didn't love the
tone of that powder either the brush for
me I mean maybe the brush you get will
be cut perfectly even but that was a
little strange on my the stick I found
to be kind of dry and a little difficult
to blend and absolutely would not
recommend this liner thank you guys so
much for spending time with me today I
hope this video helped you out and I
will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
