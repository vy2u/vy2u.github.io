delay i'm putting up videos there i
guess it's only been a couple of days
but i had a horrible camera malfunction
i just kind of posted something real
quickly about it yesterday on my blog
and the issue was basically i wasn't
having any problems with my camera and
then all of a sudden one day I turned it
on and it was totally would not work for
me so I decided that I you know didn't
want any more time to pass and I went
ahead and got a new camera a better
camera so I'm pretty excited about this
we'll see how it goes i'm not quite
familiar with all the controls yet so
it's still kind of working on that
getting accustomed to it but so far i
really like it so um anyway thank you
for bearing with me um but over the
weekend i did have a lot of fun tyler
and i went to st. Louis we went to a
blues st. louis blues hockey game so
that was really fun I'd never been to a
hockey game before so we had a great
time and I also was able to stop by the
Sephora store and the mac store there
because I don't we don't have a sephora
and mac down here where I live so I was
really really excited um I spent a lot
of time just browsing around the Sephora
and didn't really end up getting
anything they're just because I had
gotten so much for xmas from Sephora
that I was like well I'm gonna go to the
mac store and there were a few things I
had in mind that I wanted to get and I
just wanted to show them to you in this
quick um haul video first off I knew I
wanted to get one of the paint pots and
I'd never tried them before but I'd
heard really good things and I like the
sort of product that you can get a lot
of good out of you know that's not just
going to sit there and especially if
you're gonna pay you know decent money
who are so I got the paint pot they look
like this you've probably seen him in
other people's videos the color i got
was rubenesque and this is why i like
this camera it actually shows the color
you can see how pretty that is you kind
of turn it into the light and it gets
golden Ian light like that and that's
really what it looks like it's like a
skin tone on
with some really pretty Pete iridescent
peachy tones to it almost and I was
talking to the girl I was thinking about
getting I know there's a shape called
soft ochre that would really probably
match my skin tone but the girl I was
talking to you know I kind of was like
well if I use this I can wear it alone
too so and it'll still kind of have a
little bit of you know shimmer to it and
that sort of thing so I'm really excited
about that I actually have that on right
now the eye products i'm going to talk
to you but i got three things for mac
and i use them all today for the very
first time so really exciting um I got a
light shade that I used both on my brow
bone here and keep in mind like if this
doesn't look perfect I mean I've gone
through a whole day of work so far but
I've used it on my lid and also the brow
bone and the shade is called um and I
also use the Paint Pot underneath so I
really like how it's coming off right
now um even after a whole day and it's
called Naked Lunch you may have seen the
shade described by people and it's just
a nice oops kind of you know light
highlight shade it's a frost there is
like a little bit of shimmer to it but
it's just perfect for on your lid i feel
like and i thought was a great color to
start out with and would be versatile
for me and then the other shade I love
plummy brown shades and this shade is
called sketch and this is gorgeous it's
got um it's a velvet shade and you can
see as it hits the light it does have a
little bit of you know kind of a gleam
to it and I love how this shade is so
versatile I have it there in my crease
and sort of on the outer half and it
just is so buildable like I used it
pretty lightly I thought but I could
easily build that up and make a really
pretty smoky eye out of this so anyway
um my only two minute I shadows right
now so I'm pretty excited about that but
what I am perhaps even more enthusiastic
about when I went to Sephora I didn't
want to go there and get some of the Too
Faced shadow insurance as you know I've
been using the Mary Kay
primer for quite some time and I've
really liked it but it has been the only
I primer that I have kind of like I mean
with these eyeshadows I kind of wanted
to be able to compare back to what i
have and kind of have more of a gauge on
quality wise and then maybe give you
guys some comparisons continue to give
you some low price comparisons you know
but i wanted to see between the shat two
faced shadow insurance and the Mary Kay
eye primer which I thought was better
and so I've only used the two face stuff
for one day I used it today and
considering that a whole day has gone by
and the look of my eye shadow has not
even changed and I don't see any
creasing um you know I'm really pleased
with how it's worked so far so I can't
really say anything bad about it yet but
I'm not quite ready to review yet but i
ended up getting that since the four was
out completely off the shelves you know
and the girls like yeah it's just been
flying off so i wanted i I was kind of
between this in the Urban Decay primer
potion but I decided on this because
this little tube here because I can
squeeze every last bit out of it and
that totally irritates me you know if
you spend good money on a product and
then you can't get it all entirely out
of the container you bought it in so
that's kind of frustrating so that's why
I ultimately went with this and I have
heard some good reviews recently hear
from people i really trust so um a
couple of drug store things that I got
also that I've only used like once so I
can't quite review these yet either but
I promise I will I got the outlast
lipstain from covergirl I hate when they
don't put the shade on name on here but
it's number four hundred and it's
basically it is a marker and this stayed
on my lips all day I wore it all day
yesterday and it totally stayed there
was one little I only I felt like it
stayed more on the border of my lips at
times than right in the center because I
had been eating and stuff like that but
you put a gloss over especially gloss
that's a little more opaque and you're
not going to notice it as much so you
can kind of cover up for it but it's
really good it feels really I mean
really lightweight it's like you
basically colored on your lips with
something that is weightless so that was
really nice and then I got the
maybelline lash stiletto this was
actually upon request of my mom she was
like I've been seeing the commercials I
figured you've you know tried that by
now but I hadn't and what I do like
about it so far is the brush I like how
it gets a more narrow at the tip and um
it's still definitely it takes me a
while to understand whether or not I
like a mascara or not so I'm going to
give that some more time but um anyway I
just want to show you guys what I got
recently and tell you about my little
new camera experience so hopefully it
all continues to work well and thank you
guys so much for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
