video with you and I have a lot of
different things to share it's sort of a
collective haul so I'm going to go ahead
and get started first I'm going to tell
you about some things from Coastal
Scents you may have noticed if you
regularly check their website there's a
new product called the brush guard and
this is exactly what it says keeping
brushes keeping bristles safe and you
get these packages and there are 4 95
and some of them are their website
really describes it best because you can
check there and see exactly how they
work how you should use them all the
different varieties but I have kind of a
variety pack here that comes with all
these different sizes and basically
these fit over your brushes and they
keep them in good condition if you
wanted to toss them into your purse
travel with them whatever and these if
you get this you get this little sort of
pamphlet telling you how to care for
them how you can dry your brushes using
these and just all of that info so
definitely if you're interested in these
they're really inexpensive so check out
their website you can see how they work
but just to show you here with a couple
of my brushes there's this bigger size
here and you don't slide them down over
the top you would go down this way and
as you can see it's sort of expands to
fit your supposed to pull them with
about a quarter what did they say there
see I have to always check extend it a
quarter inch beyond the bristles so just
a little bit further than that and then
this is great you can just pop this in
your makeup bag if you don't have a
special like brush holder section in
your bag that's really great to maintain
the shape and to show you how like a
smaller brush would work this is an
eyeshadow brush just take this little
bitty one and you just slide it up it's
so satisfying to it's like okay there we
go oops I slighted that one to slip that
one too far just slide it up just past
the bristles like that and they're so
easy to use I think it's a great idea
because like I said not everybody has a
great way to store them in their house
let alone to travel with so really
inexpensive and
and available on coastal scents calm so
like I said check that out you will see
I think they have I'm checking their
website right now it tells you yeah what
all they have I have that variety pack
what's the one I showed you there but it
shows has some great pictures of how to
use them and a video too so that's worth
a look probably and another new thing at
Coastal Scents um is there new custom
palettes that you can make I am so
pumped about this because I made one
here you can get first off you can get a
12 pan or a for pan just palette in
itself okay so they come with the little
metal pants you can take those out and
put these individual shadows in them the
12 pan container is 795 and then there's
a for pan container that also comes with
a mirror on it in an applicator for 495
for that so relatively inexpensive for
the palettes and then you can fill them
with a wide variety of shades whatever
shade you want their 495 a piece and so
if you think about this I mean these are
amazing quality so you might think what
would cost to fill up a Mac palette
versus what you can fill up one of these
for you have tons to choose from and
they're called hot pots and so i'm going
to show you what i did with mine and i
will probably get I mean this is another
thing check the website browse through
all the shades they have but I built one
with sort of shades that I really liked
that I thought I would use a lot and I
haven't used I've only used a few of
these so far so look for more maybe on
my blog about this or tutorials
definitely using these but I've got like
I made a smoky side here sort of a
purplish side some some matte kind of
neutrals and then sort of um so warm
neutrals over here so you have so many
options with this like I went with sort
of a neutral palette like something i
would use on a daily basis but you can
get colorful stuff to that's totally an
option here and you might think well you
know i already have an 88 palette or
already have you know the neutral
palette but the nice thing about these
are is how small they are this is not
very big so I would feel comfortable
tossing this in my makeup bag and taking
it to work with me whereas I might not
want to take my bigger palettes just
because they're bigger and a little bit
harder to manage so anyway nice little
palette and if you look closely there's
these little notches in them and for me
see if it works I can stick my finger
down in that notch and I fingernail or
you could use like some little small
like tweezers maybe or something and get
the shade out and then when you want to
put it in you can see it's like already
magnetizing it fits right in nothing
falls out so um really really nice
little palettes and it would be what a
fun gift idea that would be to get
somebody like maybe the for pan palette
and then get them a few different like
you know four or five different colors
so they could switch in and out if they
wanted to I think it's awesome and
you're getting exactly what you want
great quality so far from like the ones
i've used there's this gorgeous like
purple shade here and they're not
exactly like what's already in say the
shimmer palette or the neutral palette
there's somewhere I can see the
similarities but then others i'm like
i've never seen that shape before so
keep that in mind that you're not there
are some new things so definitely worth
checking that out on coastal scents
website as well so next I want to tell
you about some everyday mineral stuff
that I got I always like ordering from
everyday minerals because they're so
prompt with their service and they give
you like some nice free little samples
and things like that here and there but
couple things I wanted to get were some
brushes called the skunk lyst optic
brush but it's what it is basically a
stippling brush kind of a narrow
stippling brush I have a bigger one that
I kind of reserved for foundation and I
thought wouldn't be nice to have one for
my blushes that I wanted to go on a
little more sheer and this is just
incredibly soft just your kind of
classic
stippling brush so I've been really
enjoying it so far I'm incredibly soft
on the face and just a really nice
option these are such nice quality
brushes and nice big wooden handle just
really well made so I love that but the
one that I might like even better is
there their standard flat top brush look
how cute that is I mean it's so tight
like this is what it looks like up next
to this guy so it's a flat brush with
really really soft dense bristles which
is kind of rare to find you know that
kind of quality like very dense but
extremely soft and so flat top means you
know you can use this and get some
really good coverage I had a flat top
one from Sally's that I was kind of
using and I think at a point where I
wasn't really quite sure what else was
out there and I was like oh it's working
fine but in reality the breath the
bristles were very stiff and this is
very very soft so it gave me great
coverage when I used this with my
everyday minerals intensive foundation
so definitely a good deal there then I
wanted to try out several of the
eyeshadows and I haven't used but one of
these actually on my eye so far so this
isn't like a review yet i will probably
review these soon though because i
really am excited about them but
everyday minerals eyeshadows come in
oops just a second phones ringing all
right sorry guys uh my phone rang so i
had to take a call it was tyler in case
you were wondering but anyway these
eyeshadows i'm not quite sure why they
have different tops on them but either
way they do so these are the mini size 2
so this is I think it's kind of like the
standard eyeshadow size the 1i have you
so far is called baby bath and it's just
a light a light shimmer with a little
bit of it's kind of like got a little
bit of silver shimmer in it and this
goes on super sheer it went on a lot
more sheer actually than I was
anticipating because I started like
packing it on my eyelid and then I
realized that that might not be what
this one's best for this would maybe be
good for like a wash of
of light shimmer if you just wanted to
kind of illuminate your eye area right
up in here like over your like on your
highlight I think it would make a great
highlight but if you're trying to pack
it on you might spend a little too much
time doing that the other one I have is
this is the one that's for sure matt is
the shade is wallaby and it's like a
reddish or a maroonish purple love that
kind of shade so i'm sure i'll like that
once i try it out get in the lid on here
okay the other one I had this one it
looks so gorgeous it's called mystic
night and what it is is a deep purplish
blue with shimmer and it's so pretty
like I think that is going to be so
pretty on I haven't actually tried it on
yet I've taken a little seal off but
i'll let you know how I like that
probably used in a tutorial or something
because it's so pretty so those are the
eyeshadows um got a cheek color because
i was just i love their blushes so much
i wanted to try one and i got this in
salon fun and this is a shimmer and so
it's kind of a pinky it's like a true
pink shade with maybe just a hint of
like a purplish undertone obviously not
like drastic purple but maybe a little
bit of a plum undertone and then it was
like oh my gosh they're doing a new
thing with their packaging they have
this little instead of just being open
and everything sifting out they have
this little slider guy here so it you
know you it's somewhat contained I mean
a little bit can still sift out but it's
not getting all over the place when you
go to open this up this stays basically
clean and until you you know undo that
so that's pretty outstanding i think the
packaging has changed a little bit too
that's what it looks like on the outside
there um I got one of these jars one of
these mixing jars so it has the same
deal on there just cuz when you get the
samples which are tiny and I'll show you
those in a minute um it can be hard to
use them in their tiny little form you
know to get a brush in there and
whatever so this you
you know put some in there and use your
brush and clean it out and whatever so
that is available on their website also
I got some of their cosmetic wet wipes
natural skin cleansing and gentle makeup
removal towelettes and this is a big
thing of them try and see how many there
are in there um-hmm okay i'm not sure
but it's a big it's a big thing of them
you know it's pretty big in I used one
actually when I was doing some squatches
the other day I kind of used it as just
something I could wipe my hand down with
so that worked really nicely and then as
you may know about everyday minerals
they have a free sample kit that you can
get you can get three foundations a
concealer and a blush you can't really
mix-and-match more than that it has to
be that ratio of things but they're all
entirely free if you just wanted to get
that you would pay shipping but um you
know you you can get it and not pay a
dime so I did that because I was like
well I'm already getting this stuff so
you might as well try out the sample
kitten so you get these five adorable
little samples they're this big like
like I said earlier you can see why that
might be hard to swirl your brush in
there but I was just curious to try out
a few different foundation shades just
as the seasons are changing you know
maybe I'm changing colors too but I got
um just a few different ones I got light
Martian intensive foundation perfect
intensive foundation and fairly summer
original glow foundation to learn more
about the different finishes go on there
but and I'll just tell you right now
intensive is the heaviest coverage and
if I do if one of these don't work for
me I thought you know I could hand that
to my mom and let her try it or my
sister or whatever so that's a nice
option you have there I got the
concealer in pearl beige yeah which is
basically like just a light color that
you can use to kind of highlight under
your eye over your eye wherever sort of
more than a concealer it's kind of like
a highlighter and then this blush and
snuggle and it is
sort of a light peach a little bit of a
golden undertone to it very hard to tell
in the packaging what it is but like i
said i'll try those things out let you
know how it goes they also gave me two
free lip balms when i got into my
package one is in butterfly garden and
one is in cozy nights and it says
natural lip gloss I'm wearing the one in
cozy nice right now didn't even really
know about these so they just came in
there so that was nice of them but
anyway that's all for this haul video I
believe so thank you guys so much for
watching this gives you an idea of some
things that I might be reviewing or
doing tutorials on Elmo said tutorial
link in the future so I keep checking
back on my channel and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
