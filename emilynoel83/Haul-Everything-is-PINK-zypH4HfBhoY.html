like no other haul I've done before
because it all centers around one color
and that color is pink I was just
thinking today about a couple different
things I picked up over the weekend and
just here lately and I'm like it's all
pink we're talking about from makeup
products to you know close to a storage
container I got I mean it all just
happens to be pink stuff and that is my
favorite color but I just thought wow
this is kind of crazy and so I thought I
would do a whole video showing you what
I got and the first thing it's showing
up a lot more purple in this video but I
think if this is like a purpley sort of
pinky violet shade but I got this cute
top and whether or not it qualifies I
don't know okay I got this from JCPenney
and it is Supes it's like a 3/4 sleeve
top and it's kind of like a little
sweater it's like a really soft sweater
material and it's ruffled all the way
around does it go no it stops like kind
of right back here but it's ruffled
right around here and then it kind of
gathers with this flower here on the
side I just thought it was really cute
it's from East Fifth I saved the tag
it's called the hollyhock shirt and it
was originally $30 but I got it for I
think at least $10 off of that I've been
looking for a new bag for a while and I
wanted something kind of medium sized I
didn't want a gigantic bag but medium
size and I wanted a nice pink bag okay
in the words of malli pink is a neutral
for me so I found this bag and I had
looked at different like high-end
websites and I was thinking about you
know possibly investing in in you know a
high-end bag but I ran across this bag
at Target over the weekend for $20 and I
just thought I'm going for this one
because this is the one that I honestly
thought was the cutest and this is the
bag what is the brand on this
let me see the brand is Moroni so that's
a target brand that they sell but this
is such a cute little tote and it's
actually got really nice organization on
the inside and as far as the outside
goes I mean I'm guessing you know some
kind of faux leather thing going on here
but size-wise this is kind of how it
looks for me so it's not real big but
it's perfect I mean I we have like a
little mini laptop and I think that
could fit in here just fine and anything
else that I'm taking and maybe I should
do a what's in my first video in a
different one but it's neat because it
has one two three big compartments and
one of them this is a zippered
compartment like a big one so anything
that you really want concealed there can
go down that shopping with or like I
said I'm out on stories reporting or
whatever I can fit a notepad in here I
can fit a little laptop in there so yeah
I mean I just was thrilled that I found
something at a low cost that I liked
after looking so long for a cute pink
bag I don't know how many times have
been out shopping I mean like Tyler I
really want to get a pink bag and I just
haven't been able to come up with
something that didn't have some kind of
loud print on it that I really didn't
think I would like in the long term or
whatever so very happy with this bag
from Target next pink purchase are these
neat little storage containers and these
are kind of typical of you know what you
might store your makeup in they come
often in white but at Hobby Lobby I
found these in hot pink and I thought
they were so cute for my drawers they
fit really well if you have any of those
Sterilite drawers like they stand maybe
you know five drawers and one and I've
gotten another one of those to help me
store my makeup and spread it out so
it's actually um sorted out the way I
want it so I'm getting closer to that
collection video but I've been getting
asked for um but anyways I found these
and they fit really nicely to organize
those drawers and I just love them
because they're actually hot pink and I
think they had some other colors too but
this size it's kind of a good size like
as you can see I've stored some powders
in here I mean you can further divide
this up if you wanted to but it's a
great length for storing anything
or if you've got compact you can get
several rows of compacts in there so
really like this little container next
up a couple of pink nail polishes one of
them is one that I've gotten asked about
a lot in and I pat it on in recent
videos and it is called the Sally Hansen
complete salon manicure love that
formulation love all the polishes and
this may not all the polishes in this
line but I do like the finish that this
that this type of polish creates I like
the brush I just really enjoy the
texture of these I like that there are a
lot of creamy colors and so this one
shrimp Lee divine is the one that I've
had on in a lot of recent videos and
have gotten more questions perhaps about
this polish which is a really nice
bright pink got it on my toes now and
it's just it it makes you think summer I
mean I know it's barely spring yet but
it makes you think of some another
product I've gotten questions on and I
have it on right now
and what this is is actually those Sally
Hansen salon effects real nail polish
strips so I just did these yesterday got
will scratch there sorry I'm like this
in this little container you've probably
seen these they have a lot that come
with different prints and stuff like
that things that you probably like would
take forever to do on your own nails and
these are like a pink glitter and I saw
them and I thought man it always anytime
I wanted glory nails oh it always felt
like it took forever to get coat after
coat to get that thick glitter and so
now here I have them but if you really
get a close look at this um you might
notice that like my tips are already I
just put these on not 24 hours ago and
the tips of my nails are already showing
so basically the concept is you get
these and I'll need to review these or
do an actual video on them but let me
just show you this is how they come you
peel off like a top coat and you peel it
off of the back and they're not overly
sticky but they do cling to your nail
and so you would lay this over your nail
and kind of press it down
and then you would file off the excess
or kind of try to peel it off whatever
you need to do to get it going so you
know the whole mail is covered and
initially I thought I kind of had it
going good but the more I did with my
hands I kind of felt like up on at least
one side here mainly my right hand I
think my right hand gets used maybe a
little harder but I'm getting a little
bit of Chiba there but I at that point I
was like oh these are gonna be gone
before the end of the day but they
actually have lasted I mean I have them
all on all my fingers now but I just
thought was a gorgeous look I mean when
you look at when you glance at you think
that's metallic pink but then you get a
close look at and you're like it's
glitter so um I don't know I'm kind of
not in a place to really review these
yet but I'm testing them out and we will
see how long they last that will
probably determine what kind of a review
they get a few quick pink makeup
purchases as well I've got a new Mac eye
shadow and it's not out-and-out pink but
I use it whenever I'm wearing you know
some sort of pink outfit and it's called
star violet and some of you may be fans
of this shade but it's so pretty and
when I watch it you'll see it looks kind
of pink more pink in the swatch than it
did in the container but I have used
this today actually to kind of fade my
eye shadow up a little bit I had like a
darker shade in the crease and then I
used star violet to warm it up right in
there and I really really loved it and I
just have found myself like I've only
had this for I don't know maybe a week
and any time I've worn pink or some kind
of warm color like that I've used this
and I really liked it also a pink blush
from ELF I noticed that my target is
selling some of the different elf things
that I had in my haul like the tinted
moisturizer and just a few other things
that were new there in the studio line
and I think they had a new shade of pink
blush I'm pretty sure they didn't have
this before and it is called what's it
called pink passion check this out
bright matte pink blush and I have it on
right now and
so I mean you can tell it's kind of a
far cry what you see on my cheeks to
what you see in the packaging but I do
like this I was excited to buy it
I just love for three dollars how you
can try a blush like that low risk you
know you don't feel like you're shelling
out a whole lot for a color that
possibly might not work but I do think
that it you know you can wear this sheer
and it can look you know pretty natural
like what I have on my lip product is a
repackaged product from NYC
it's called the kiss gloss they used to
have this and a little bit I don't know
if it was a smaller size but it was a
different squeeze tube and what I have
here this shade is called a city sorbet
and if you get a close look at it you
can see it's like a gel kind of pinky
shimmer so I have that on my lips and I
like it it's nice for him it's got a
good texture to it a nice kind of
natural look just a hint of shimmer and
a really nice glossy finish so that
wraps up my 100 percent pink haul again
I have never had a video like this
before I don't know if I will do one in
the future but it was fun and it was
kind of fun to take note of the color
scheme of a lot of the things I've been
buying lately so thank you so much for
tuning in and have a wonderful day and
I'll talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
