nuggets section if you guys wanted to
see a hole and a lot of people said yes
so I'm here doing a hole for you by the
way if you don't check out my blog it's
totally different content from what you
see here on my channel so new reviews
aces of the day things like that so I
hope you'll give it a look if you
haven't already stuff we have my brother
to thank for the first part of this hole
he got me a Sephora gift card and fellas
you cannot miss with a Sephora gift card
I tell you thinking about Valentine's
Day maybe yeah it's just fun to be able
to browse the site and think I'm not
paying for this stuff I was looking at
Sephora's website and I think there was
a special thing on the front page about
this makeup forever
Pro finish multi-use powder foundation
and I really haven't used much from
makeup forever and I want to this year
sort of start branching out into some
different brands that you don't
typically hear me talk about and
basically this says it's the first
multi-use powder foundation that allows
you to fully customize your finish and
coverage level breakthrough formula that
can be used wet or dry
I remember Revlon used to have a wet dry
foundation on it in the shade neutral
sand and it's actually a little bit dark
for me right now
so anyway it looks the compact looks
like this and there's the product and
you flip that up and you've got a sponge
right down there
so I've realized that I can use this if
I use it like with a brush for a lighter
application but in full coverage mode
it's definitely a little bit dark for me
right now if I get back into my sunless
tanning and stuff like that I think you
know it's gonna be just fine just kind
of swirl my finger in it I mean you can
see that that could really be extremely
full coverage when you use it dry and
when you apply it like you know with the
sponge so I'm interested to get some use
out of that and let you guys know how it
works also the other thing I got from
Sephora was this little palette which I
was intrigued by it's from Josie Marans
line
which we know is based in argan oil and
it is the I love you
palace our argon infused eyeshadows and
I thought that was an interesting
concept I thought you know is this gonna
be better for my eyes or he's gonna have
some kind of skincare benefits in there
so it's got a large mirror and eight eye
shadows and as you can see you've got
some kind of light sort of springy
colors and some nice deep shades as well
so here are the colors and you can see
we've got some kind of like a little bit
pearly finish like satiny finish colors
here that's what most of these seem like
the black has a little bit of sparkle in
it and I would say my favorites hi
cupcake just made her grand entrance but
I really like these deeper shades here
like using these four is a quad I really
like I haven't really delved into the
lighter ones yet see me may be putting
together like a Valentine's look like
with the plum and these shades wouldn't
that be pretty so that would be fun plus
it's it's the I love you palette so that
would make a lot of sense right I've got
a bunch of like bonus stuff with the
Sephora purchase it's awesome and one
thing that was thrown in there and it
wasn't one of like the three free
samples that you get it was like some
additional I guess sample thing they're
trying to get out there but it's from
Tarte and it's a little sample pack like
you get several shades of their BB
tinted treatment 12-hour primer and I
haven't tried these yet so you get four
different shades to sample they're fair
light medium and tan so that'll be fun
to try and then also in this little
pouch you get a sample of the Tarte
smooth operator Amazonian clay finishing
powder
so just a little guy at that but I
already have one of these and it's
lasting me up really long I'm not sure
if this is available outside of the
realm of beauty points and insider
points for Sephora but I saw it was
buxom and I thought hey I'm actually
gonna go for that I think that sounds
pretty cool so I didn't have to pay for
this either this is the buxom shimmer
shine and smoke kit and it's a four
piece
comes with something new that I haven't
tried which is the divine goddess
Luminizer in Venus a really nice size
here this is like the size of a typical
you know foundation and use this on your
face you can use it on your body as well
there's a little swatch but like really
pretty luminous finish but no glitter in
there so I think that's cool also came
with the buxom lipgloss in sugar I
already have one in this shade and I
absolutely love it so here's a look at
what that is like it's it's a great
wearable neutral and super reflective so
it just makes the look lips look very
juicy and nice and to other brand new
things that I've never tried from buxom
one is the buxom lash mascara in
blackest black so let's see what that
brush is looking like your oh it's a big
brush really thick yet it is a rubber
bristle brush so there's that this is
the waterproof smokey eye stick
silversword is the shape this is in so
it's one of those it's just like the big
and healthy lipsticks only it's an eye
stick so there's a swatch of that and
it's apparently waterproof so we'll test
that out in the near future next up one
thing that I got oh I would say several
weeks ago from QVC I know I am my Emily
awards for lips raved about the it
cosmetics vitality lip flush kind of
like a really moisturizing wonderful lip
stain well like I think the day I posted
that I was watching QVC and they came
out with a trio of it cosmetics lip
butters so these don't claim to have the
staining effect but I guess they're just
meant to feel even lighter on the lips
and just maybe give you a little bit
even softer color so I have three shades
they came in a trio it was a really good
deal that in one shade is called pillow
like your really natural almost like
nude lip sort of effect darling is
really pretty it's kind of like a sheer
rosy color you can see these are like
really nice sheer colors the other one
is called
in love and it's got more of a reddish
tone to it a little bit deeper than the
other two and these are a little bit
buildable I found like you
you sweet swipe over your lips one time
and you've got a good amount of color
but you can go over again and build up
more so they're super comfortable on I'm
gonna keep trying them some more so I
can like get a review together for you
on them and maybe compare them to the
vitality lip flush but I just wanted to
point out these are not stains like
those are so they don't quite have the
stain I've got some new drugstore stuff
some of its new some of it I'm just now
getting in on one of those new things is
from covergirl and it's the outlast stay
fabulous foundation had lots of
questions about this my shade is natural
beige this says lasting power of a
primer coverage of a concealer blend
ability of a foundation in one Shan free
my initial reaction on this which I
don't like to delve too much into that
because sometimes my opinions change but
I will I promise I will review this
either in a video or on my blog but I am
really liking this so far it has a pump
there so that's always handy and I found
that this reminds me a lot of actually
my Mac Pro Longwear foundation a really
similar consistency in the foundation
itself and it just behaves the same way
throughout the day on my face I feel
like it goes on really nice and evenly
it doesn't have like an unnatural cakey
or dry appearance on the skin hasn't
broken me out like the clean foundation
actually did it just has good solid
staying power so I've been applying this
with my Sigma f80 brush that's one of my
favorite foundation brushes or I've been
using also my Real Techniques expert
face brush kind of alternating there and
it just applies really nicely oh I've
been enjoying that a lot so far another
thing I found new in drugstores and
you've probably seen them too are these
new L'Oreal color riche eyeshadow quads
this shade that I have it's from the
brazen bolds collection and it's called
shopping spree and I just this shade up
here really caught my eye this matte
coral it's also got a matte black and
too shimmery shades here sort of a
peachy gold and a charcoal gray and it
does tell you on the back it gives you a
little guide there
as to how they've been designed to be
applied and here's a look at the
swatches I've only used this once so far
I've thought that the texture wasn't
exactly that rich creamy kind of
high-end feel that I get from say the
bombs eyeshadows but they're really kind
of a step up from some of the other
L'Oreal shadows that I've tried in the
past I'm really impressed with the way
that black comes out and the charcoal
this shades a little bit weak but I do
like that coral a pink shade whoa
just about elbowed my whole little
basket of what I have luck anyway I'm
gonna use this some more and let you
know how it goes and maybe do like a
face of the day blog using then picked
up another one of these Neutrogena
moisture smooth color sticks raved and
raved about these in my Emily awards for
lips these one for jumbo lip pencil from
the drugstore they're just so
comfortable so wonderful on the lips and
I picked up the shade and fresh papaya
so here we're looking at kind of a
peachy Coral a color very wearable I
thought what a great springtime shade it
looks beautiful on the lips as do the
other shades I really don't think and I
just watched the table gosh I am a mess
well yeah put the cap on for safe I
don't think you can miss on the shades
in this collection they all go on
beautifully have a just a slight bit of
shimmer to that I also picked up a
couple of the new maybelline color
whispers I have a review on my blog on
these going really in-depth showing
swatches of the three shades that I
already have which are pinup peach and
cherry on top and what was the other one
lust for blush was the other one but I
kind of demonstrated how these are very
buildable lip products and they have a
very lightweight feel on the lips so I'm
really enjoying them and I got a couple
more one is mocha muse and the other one
is rose of attraction so I'll swatch
those for you I mean they just feel so
nice and lightweight and they're just
the absolute definition of buildable
color because you can get a very light
look and with some of the more intense
shades like you can get a totally
different look on your lips if you just
apply a little bit more so these are the
two that I got there's the mocha mocha
muse this I wore yesterday on my lips
and I was like wow that's like a great
nude I looked at some of the lighter
shades cuz I wanted to try sort of a
nude family lip color from this line and
some of the lighter ones I sort of
doubted whether or not they would
actually show up this one actually does
it's a really nice neutral nude color
and then here's that rose which I
haven't worn on my lips yet and that
just looks like a classic pink to me
I think only wrapping this up with a
product do you ever have those products
where like you spot them in the store
and you keep walking past them like
weeks if not months can go by and you
think about them probably every time
you're in the store but you never pick
them up and then you finally do well
that's what I what happened with me with
these products from Physicians Formula
they are the custom eye enhancing Kohl
Kajal eyeliner trio in nude eyes and I
just was so intrigued by these and I
finally had to pick them up and they are
these Kohl eyeliners here so you can see
you know this is all plastic
it's eyeliner for about I don't know an
inch to maybe an inch and a quarter of
eyeliner there on the top and then they
don't twist or move or anything it's
like that's what you get so it's a
little concerning to me and this was
probably what held me up on purchasing
because I'm like well when this point
stops being such a wonderful point you
don't use sharpen it what do you do or
do you just run out it doesn't seem like
you get a lot of product or maybe I
won't use it up very fast I don't know
but anyway there's a black a brown and
kind of a taupe they're also kind of
smudge about too so like this lightest
shade I could see you know maybe going
all over the eye with with this lightest
shade lining the upper part with the
black lining the lower lash line with
the brown and you know maybe I'll just
try a whole look just using these just
for
the heck of it to see what happens but I
did wear one of these on my upper lash
line when I traveled to North Dakota
last week put it through probably some
of the toughest conditions it was like
windy incredibly cold my eyes were
starting to water a little bit and I
felt like this black really started to
fade quite a bit even on my upper
lashline but the texture is it's like
it's drier than some of those really
creamy pencils that are out there but
yet it still glides on so it's it's hard
to put my finger on what's happening
here so that's my hull if there's
anything you're really interested in
that I haven't done a review on yet that
you want some more information on let me
know in the comments section and I will
try to get something together for you so
thanks so much for watching guys and
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
