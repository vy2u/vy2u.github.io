thank you so much for the nice responses
to my last video on the tarp stuff I
really am enjoying that stuff loving the
foundation and the blush and all that so
thanks for your feedback on the tart
products and also this video is going to
be a halt and it's a real mix of
high-end and drugstore type products so
depending on what you like there's
something for everybody here I have some
stuff from Ulta and mac and walgreens
thing with ulta stuff and this is not
stuff that I picked up all at once i did
go and got to go to ulta and mac
recently and there's none like really
close to me so we had to travel a bit
but i did get to you know experience
some new makeup territory so that was
fun and what i did pick up was this
little palette from nicks and it's
called bronze smoky look so they had all
these different palettes and I think
they were all like smokey look whatever
and this is the bronze one and these are
just the colors that kind of appealed to
me the most and it's really neat because
it's such a small palette but you get a
really nice arrangement of colors there
some arm at summer shimmer and these
just looked really pretty to me and I
thought it'd be really nice for summer
and then you have a little tray that
pulls out and I also like the lip colors
that come with it because you get like a
kind of a bronzy tan and then a bright
pink as well so I really like this I
think it's so great it's so travel
friendly because it just really does all
kind of fold right up snap together and
then you've just got this little bitty
palette to toss in your makeup so from
NYX I have never tried the powder blush
is the one that I just kind of liked
right off the bat it's called mocha and
this looks it's coming off I think kind
of brighter than than it actually is but
it appears to be just kind of a medium
matte pink so I have that on right now
if that gives you some indication of how
it goes on it's not real dramatic or
anything but it is nicely pigmented so
excited about this highlighter I picked
up because I think I'm in
it recently as being a absolute favorite
highlight I already have the mini size
in it and now I got the full size of the
lorac perfectly lit it's an oil-free
highlight and the shade i got is called
spotlight and it's just a gorgeous
powder if I get it really close maybe
you can tell kind of its it's got like
this just the most subtle shimmer
otherwise it actually almost provides
some coverage it's amazing like I put it
on here and I feel like I dusted on with
like a blush brush and it almost
minimizes the look of my pores there
it's it's crazy it's like it actually
gives you the glow and most of the time
products that give you any kind of glow
or shimmer tend to make pores and
imperfections a little more visible but
this is so interesting how it can
actually blur them it makes it blurs the
imperfections but it also makes you glow
so it's a really unique product I feel
like and it comes with just a little
flat sponge but I like just using it
with a smallish brush and yeah this is
the this is the mini and I'll probably
keep using this one but now I have the
full size it's just you know it's
something good when you really don't
want to run out if I also noticed a new
brand of false eyelashes in ulta and it
these costs I don't know somewhere
around like three or four dollars and it
says number one in the UK so UK viewers
are probably familiar with these and I
had one pack of them and I don't have
them here but I already bore them and
loved them and I also love the way they
package them it's like instead of being
I don't know if you can see this instead
of being like um having an adhesive here
on the lashes and in there adhering to
like a little semi circle thing like
most lashes do there's actually just
little tiny um like just very light
adhesive right here and they pull off so
easily so you don't have to worry about
pulling lashes off with tweezers
sometimes the adhesive gets so stuck to
the plastic that you might bend to lash
out or kind of get it out of whack and
these are so nicely put on there so this
is the
seven the other kind of hand is a 101 so
I really like the 10 ones I think I'm
gonna like the 107 stew but um I just
really appreciate how they put those in
there I've been doing my nails a lot
more lightly and with that comes the
frustration of waiting for nail polish
to dry and so I came across this from
Nicole by OPI and it's drying drops and
I know there's something else out there
called like drip dry i think it is i
haven't tried that before but i saw this
and it was at a really good price it was
like probably six or seven dollars for
this and what the claim is that it will
be dry to the touch in 60 seconds and it
will be completely dry in five minutes
so this has vitamin e in it as well to
treat the cuticle so I thought it was
interesting I thought be a fun thing to
kind of review and let you guys know how
well it works because it was
considerably less than the drip dry that
I found there um so we'll see how it
works and this was new this was kind of
a new display area and finally from Ulta
i got from philosophy a mini size of
hope in a jar this is a moisturizer that
kind of has a cult following and i love
the philosophy like shower gels and the
three-in-one shower gels that they have
with the really yummy like since that
smell like different desserts and
margaritas and all that stuff and I've
heard good things about hope in a jar
moisturizer and I know like Oprah had it
on her list of favorite things and stuff
like that so I thought well maybe it'd
be worth a try and so I picked this up
and I've used it a couple days feels
really nice it's a nice moisturizer and
I think maybe with long-term use maybe I
will figure out the amazing thing about
it that people love so much but I will
keep you posted on how this works just
really seems like a decent amount of
product for a small setback I just
picked up a couple things I got a new
lipstick which is the lipstick I have on
right now and I am in love with this
pink I seriously love this pink so much
and it majors prompt me to do a light
favorite MAC lipsticks video because I'm
kind of building up my collection of
those lipsticks a little bit and there
are some that i really think are
standouts and this one is
one of them it's a cream sheen and I
really do like that texture and the
shade is called speed dial and it's such
a pretty pink it is like classic medium
pink I just love it so much and I feel
like it comes off maybe as having I
don't know I feel like the more sheer
you put this on the more it seems to
have like a hint of almost a lie like
just a touch otherwise it looks like a
really nice thinking I feel like it
makes your teeth look a little wider to
also from mech I picked up a blot powder
and this is like a pressed powder that's
supposed to offer and you know not too
much coverage or whatever this is called
medium dark and it's not like a very
dark powder I have it on right now I
just kind of touched up my t-zone area
but it's just kind of like oil control
touch-up type powder and I really wanted
to sort of test this against some of my
other powders that I have because I have
some powders and I realized I started to
realize that the ones that really give
me the mat coverage are actually like
powder foundations not just a typical
pressed powder so it's kind of like well
yeah they should be giving you more
coverage because they're I powder
foundation so I'm kind of looking for a
good just general powder that can really
make you Matt and so far I've only used
this like I'm only had this a few days
so I can't really tell you too much but
I am happy with the you know it's making
me mad but it's not making me look caked
up and I don't apply it with this I just
apply it with a brush because I feel
like I get an even wider application
lastly a couple nail polishes i got from
walgreens one is the one I have on right
now and its top speed in peachy so I
thought this was a gorgeous color I have
it on right now but it is already
starting to get a little chippy around
my tips which doesn't necessarily
surprised me because revlon nail
polishes tend to not hold up the
greatest on me all the time but I do
think the shade is just a really great i
was looking through colors I noticed
that Revlon has a line of scented nail
polishes and I got the one in cotton
candy which is a real light pink and it
has actually like a
little slight iridescent sheen to it I
already have colors like this I did not
need this nail polish but I did need to
see if it really smelled like cotton
candy so I haven't used it yet but you
can bet i will tell you if that turns
out to actually be scented i'll be kind
of surprised but i would love it if
that's the way it turns out mascara that
i'm going to try out and it's the
telescopic explosion carbon black I've
tried telescopic explosion it was a long
time ago and actually it really started
to grow on me and I actually kind of
liked it but then I used it up and as I
do I go out and get a different kind
instead of going back to the other kind
so this one is carbon black so that
makes it i guess a little different but
this if you're not familiar is the kind
of mascara that has that little
spherical end on the one so it does make
it easy to get into outer corners and
inner corners and really fan out the
lashes how you want to thank you so much
guys for tuning in for this whole i hope
it was a good balance of high-end and
drugstore products for you have a great
day and I'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
