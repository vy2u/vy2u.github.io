know a lot of you guys like watching
haul videos and I like making them
everything in this video that I'm
talking about turns out to actually be
really affordable so that's cool first
thing I'm going to mention are my nails
I recently tweeted about that pinkish
color i had on in the last few videos i
posted on my facebook page as well so if
you want to see a picture and what brand
those were they were from kiss and they
were like artists nails so yeah that
wasn't nail polish those were just the
glue on nails as well I really like
those got a lot of people asking what
color that was so look me up on Twitter
or Facebook for that but I've since
changed my nails I put these on on
Saturday I just couldn't resist when I
saw them in the stores they are these
cute uh barragan the glue on nails
they're from nailin and they're like the
nailing a couture I think and they have
a little zebra print on the tips so I
just I don't know I just felt the need
you know I may not be the most practical
nail option but I really do like these
and I just I'm kind of crazy about zebra
print if you continue to look around my
makeup room here you will realize that
so um yeah really like those i'll also
let you know what's on my lips because
that is the product of a haul as well
i've gotten into some of these revlon
super lustrous lipsticks and I've got to
say they don't have the most wonderful
staying power but I do like the range of
shades I just think that there's a lot
to choose from and it's fun to try out
different ones and they're really
inexpensive so you can just find them in
the drugstore but they're the ones that
look like this in the black tube and the
one I have on right now is shade for 15
it's a cream shade so that means it
doesn't really have shimmer but it's
just it is still kind of shiny and it's
called pink in the afternoon and this is
the color pink so a classic kind of
creamy pink not too bright it really
does kind of smooth out the appearance
of your lips so I do like that but I
really like that shade i also got just
enough buff which is a really good nude
on me
I think medium tones skin this is a
pretty good nude shade for you and it's
again a creamy shade yeah it's a cream
there's no shimmer in it it's just a
nice kind of peachy knew that doesn't
you know it gets your lips nude but I
don't feel like it washes out your whole
face so that's good and then the other
one I have is a pearl shade and it's
called Rosa do so that means it has a
little bit of shimmer and it's kind of
like it's kind of a peachy pink really
so you can see it's got a little bit of
a sheen to it if you compare that to the
one I have on now you can see the
difference this has a rose do has a
little more quarrel to it I've also been
experimenting with a few new brushes and
because I get a lot of people asking me
you know i know you recommend coastal
scents and sigma brushes which i do i
love them i think they're great prices
for a really great quality product i
feel like sigma you know is well it's a
little more in the mid middle price
range I think you're getting fantastic
quality and brushes that can really
really last you so that's a great thing
but there are other people that just do
want the convenience of going out into
their drug store and finding good
brushes and you'll go into target and
walmart and you'll see brands that you
know that store puts out and some of
those are good brushes in fact one that
I found and keep in mind this is a whole
video I'm not necessarily reviewing all
this stuff but I have kind of forms of
opinions on some of it but at walmart I
was there the other day and for i think
around two dollars they have this thing
called a smoky eye duo and so it's a
double ended brush for blending and
smudging your eye look and it looks like
this if you can see that up against my
background here um one end is fluffy and
it kind of comes to a little point it's
really soft and the other end is a great
smallish brush if you look at how about
how this works with the size of my eye
the smaller one would be pretty good for
smudging under it's just slightly bigger
than um that essence of beauty crease
brush that I love so much but it's kind
of similar but anyway it's fairly small
it would be good for doing an outer V in
fact I did
over the weekend and then this bigger
one is interesting because it comes to
that tip so you could actually apply
color in a somewhat concentrated and
focused way I guess but then you can
still blend it out you've still got a
very tapered brush that is really
capable of blending and going back and
forth and stuff like that so I do like
this brush I think if you're trying to
kind of finish your collection maybe
you've got like a classic brush to just
apply your eyeshadow but you want
something you really blend and smoke it
out that's just a couple dollars and
again it's no real brand here I mean
it's just one of the you know regular
brushes that walmart has there and
they've got they've expanded what they
offer so that's nice another brand of
drugstore brushes is available in target
and I've seen it in walmart 22 and the
brand is called eco tools and it's earth
friendly beauty so you're looking at
largely natural products here
cruelty-free things like that so here's
like what the packaging looks like I got
mine from a target and it's the bamboo
five piece brush set and they are the
brushes that look like this so it came
in a little gives you a little pouch
thing and then you get these brushes
that have that sort of appearance they
also had some that were longer handled
they said great for minerals on them so
I use these today getting ready and I
think they are so good it's really soft
it's probably probably the softest brush
um drugstore you know just bought
actually at the drugstore that I found
in the feel of it kind of reminds me of
the everyday minerals brushes and they
also have kind of that dual toned brush
and it really does have a similar feel
the everyday minerals brushes are some
of the softer brushes that I found they
really do a good job of a lot of dense
density with the brushes and they blend
really well and I noticed that with
these two they're so super soft like I
use this brush to put on my bronzer
today and I just thought was fantastic
and then you get
a little baby kabuki brush which is just
as soft and really you can see just
dense would be great for blending in
your mineral makeup and then you get a
brush you could use as a concealer brush
or I think you could use this as an
eyeshadow this was the one I didn't use
today but it could be like applying
eyeshadow like a flat shader type brush
or you could do it with concealer and
then I use this one and this is a
fantastic blender um I blending brush
great size you see that kind of for
scale up with my I kind of used it to
blend out my shadow there so I'm very
impressed with the eco tools brushes
haven't tried them until yesterday and a
lot of people would say you know when
people were asking for like brush
recommendations sometimes on facebook or
comments or whatever and people would
say eco tools are really good and I just
kind of never tried them because I've
got a pretty extensive brush selection
here already but it's neat it comes with
a little pouch so you could just kind of
carry those around with you and
relatively inexpensive this set was
about ten dollars so you're kind of you
got five brushes about 22 bucks per
brush and you also get a little case for
them so pretty great deal there I think
for the quality another random haul item
this tiny tresemme um I don't know if
I've talked about this before or not but
i just recently picked up another one so
it's in my hole um these little really
small size cans are great for your purse
just make sure the cap stays on some of
them you'll find in like the little
travel bin section and oh my goodness a
giant grasshopper just jumped on the
window all right sorry um anyway make
sure the cat stays on because you don't
want this like accidentally squirting
all over your stuff but this works great
in a purse if you've ever thought you
know man if I just had my hair spray
yeah you've got it it's i love the
Tresemme at trade to all day humidity
resistance hairspray anyway so have it
at my fingertips at all times is a good
thing
um kind of talked about a cup of a few
natural products here with the eco tools
stuff and I'm also trying out a brand
called yes to carrots that's another
target item that you may have seen
they've got some lip products that I was
kind of interested in and I really
haven't tried them yet so I'm not sure
this isn't a review by any means I'll
review them later but what is the see me
shine lipgloss in red hot look at the
color on that I think that has the
potential to be a gorgeous red lip gloss
let's watch it and see how it looks oh
oh it's kind of an orange II read but
it's really pigmented look at that nice
shine smells kind of Burt's Bees ish
minting if you were wondering um so I
got that and then I got this um see me
blush lip tint in chocolate kiss so I
was assuming this would be kind of like
a neutrally nude tinted lip balm there I
just swatched it it's going to be kind
of like a bronzy nude I think so that
also has sort of that minty feel looks
really kind of scary in the packaging I
guess looking right at it here I was
like thats dark but not really anyway
I'll tell you how I like those coming up
um I'm also trying out the summer
vanillas lemon collection from bath and
body works because you know with my EOS
lip balm in the lemon drop that I'm
loving so much right now I'm really on
to this lemon scent for summer so I
picked up the summer vanillas lemon body
lotion and also the body spray oh my
gosh it smells so good i love layering
these two and i just feel like man I
smell good you know what I put this on
all of the set is just kind of like a
lemon lemon cookie lemon bar type thing
I mean it's just delicious so I love
those and you know it i got the lip balm
to so the limo is kind of interesting
I'll go ahead and swatch that next to my
other stuff here it's got a little bit
of sparkle to it you can see it right
there so it's not just a shiny gloss it
actually has a little bit of shimmer
it's one of those great lip glosses for
like right in the center of your lower
lip to make everything look plump and
beautiful and i also got some aveeno
lotion I know this isn't super exciting
but when I was doing my eczema video a
lot of people were recommending aveeno
is just a great general brand for lotion
and I'm never I always get a little
concerned about irritating my skin like
after I shaved my legs and get out of
the shower putting on a super scented
lotion like that might not be when I
apply the summer vanilla stuff I want
something a little more mild so I got
the skin relief moisturizing lotion says
reliefs itchy extra die skin moisturizes
for 24 hours so i'll test that and see
if I really do feel moisture I serve 24
hours but it's just supposed to be
really skin friendly and not gonna
irritate you or anything like that so
lots of people love aveeno so I'm going
to test that and I have a couple of
books and get this I was so annoyed with
myself I did a full review on all of my
beauty related books that I had and then
I went back and I was unloading my
memory card completely forgot i had
recorded it and i lost oh all of that
review that i did so i will do that full
review for you soon but for now I
thought in this hall I would just
mention the two books I got most
recently one is by Carmindy and this is
the one that I haven't really gotten
into yet but it's called crazy busy
beautiful beauty secrets for getting
gorgeous fast and so this is kind of it
appears to be like a typical novel type
book but what you get is basically tons
of beauty tips all centered around
getting ready quickly quick fixes that
kind of thing there's different um
makeup scenarios I guess whether you're
talking about foundation or makeup all
skin makeup it said there
are just all kinds of things budget
Beauty there's a portion on that as well
so I think that'll be a good book just
for some good tips for me to pass along
to you and I also got I believe this is
the latest bobby brown book it's called
living beauty and I love the bobby brown
books love the makeup manual um that was
just a great all-encompassing beauty
book bobby brown beauty is another good
one what makes this one different is it
focuses a little more on mature skin at
the aging process you hear a lot about
that in this book and I think it's
really interesting because you know what
God willing we're all going to get old
and our skin is going to age and there's
always going to be something to learn
about so I just kind of thought it would
be interesting to start learning these
things now and not only would they be
beneficial to me in the future but they
could help my viewers now just knowing
more about it if I were ever do makeup
on someone who was you know a little bit
older just the different things you have
to think about my mom always tells me oh
you'll learn so much more about you know
what you need to do with your skin like
makeup will be even more if your friend
you know when you get to be a little
older and so um I just think there's
this book is filled with useful advice I
was reading it the other day and I told
Tyler us like I'm learning more in this
makeup but like more things that I
really had no idea about before than I
ever have with any makeup look I've
gotten so I think that says a lot
there's just really cool like four and
afters in this too so um I just love
going to see that getting to see Bobby
Brown's approach to so many of these
things you learn tons about skincare
tons about just quick makeup fixes that
are amazing like the facelift without
surgery that kind of information is just
awesome in there so that's my whole
while lots of stuff there but um lots of
stuff that I can potentially review for
you soon let me know what you're
interested in let me know what new
things you've picked up and are loving
right now I would love to hear about it
so thanks for watching guys have a
be doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
