near and that means back to school
makeup tutorials lots of people kind of
want to revamp their look as
back-to-school time comes closer I know
before school especially in high school
and college like before I went back to
school I always wanted to kind of change
up my look a little bit you know I
wanted a haircut or I wanted something
different with my hair and I wanted um
you know a fresh makeup look as well and
so what I'm excited to share and what
kind of makes this a special makeup look
is I'm going to take you through it step
by step from beginning to end so through
all the face products to every single
thing I used in this is a drugstore
priced product available at your local
drugstore so that's a huge bonus and I
also really tried to take into
consideration stuff that would be pretty
long wearing because when you're at
school you know you're going for applies
to class you don't always have a lot of
time to touch up your makeup looks so
something that can kind of stand on its
own and get you through the day so I
hope you enjoy this look thanks so much
for tuning in for my videos and keep on
watching
first thing to do is apply a tinted
moisturizer all over your skin I like
using this especially if I'm in a hurry
because i feel like it combines sort of
the foundation step and the moisturizers
step now not all tinted moisturizers
have the right ratio between the two
some have too much coverage and not
enough moisture or vice versa so one
that I'm enjoying and I actually just
recently purchased it it's from a vino
and it's the positively radiant tinted
moisturizer they have it in medium and I
think light to medium maybe so this is
medium and it has SPF 30 too so that's
really good to get you through a day
especially if you might be outside so I
put that on just smoothed it all over
you'll notice it gives a little bit of a
glow as well as just that light coverage
so once you have that you may still have
some areas that you want to give a
little more coverage to so i'm using my
maybelline dream mousse concealer my
shade is like four dash five i'm just
going to get a little bit of that on my
finger and one area i know i need to
have a little more coverage as my under
eye area so i'm just using my finger
because i think with the texture this
product using your finger helps it kind
of melt into the skin a little more so
I'm just kind of going all around my eye
and I'll do that on my other eye as well
and I also go around my nose a little
bit got a little redness and broken
capillaries around there but i think the
eye area is especially important because
a lot of people kind of rely on i think
i make up to make their eyes look more
wide awake but a big part of making your
eyes look awake is really getting rid of
those under eye circles so this is a
good way to conceal those with an
inexpensive product to cut down on shine
i recommend using any sort of matte
powder you can find a really inexpensive
one that's really good quality is from
elf it's the translucent mattifying
powder comes with a little sponge here
or you can use a brush and it just
basically this is kind of like one color
fits all it's not going to make a
difference if you have dark skin or
light skin but
I just like to take a powder brush kind
of go over my eye area they're super
sheer so just go around my nose pay
special attention to my t zone where I
might tend to get more shiny than other
areas of my face next you want to think
about bronzer something that can perk up
your skin a little bit especially right
after you wake up sometimes your skin
looks a little more doe i guess and so
rimmel natural bronzer is a good choice
and i think the shade called sunlight is
nice it kind of reminds me of NYC sunny
kind of running low on my sunny right
now so this is the one that I've been
reaching for and it's really almost the
same so just take any powder brush you
like to use and as you can see i'm
applying this sort of right around my
hairline you want to think about where
the Sun would naturally hit and give you
a little bit of a tan and apply it in
those areas since this is such a light
bronzer you can really get away with
just applying this all over your face
for a little glow you can also use it as
a little bit of a contour but I'm going
to have a better product for that to
show you here in just a second I just
mentioned contouring and there's another
great product from ELF that you guys
know I like to use a lot it's the
contouring blush and bronzer duo I
really like this bronzer and as you can
tell compared to the one I was just
using this one is quite a bit darker so
I like to use this kind of strictly as a
cheek contour or maybe around the jaw so
get a little bit of that on a smaller
brush I'm using a blush brush here kind
of sucking your cheeks find where that
cheekbone area is and I like to kind of
get the product on and then swirl back
in circular motions to really blend it
in and then if you like to go around
your jaw there to go for it do that
again on the other side get the product
on and swirl to blend next you've got a
really nice blush here and hoist sheds
on me it's kind of a peachy blush with a
little bit of sparkle which is nice
because we have kind of given our skin
that matt appearance so it's okay to use
a blush that gives you a little glow
here so I'm just going to get a little
bit of that on my brush smile and go on
the apple of my cheeks being careful not
to get too close to my nose so we don't
give ourselves any redness we don't need
there in the other cheek just kind of
swirl it on its kind of buildable if you
want a little more color you can go in
for more and that's the base
step one you want to apply a primer all
over your lid a really reasonably priced
one that ranks right up there for me
with the higher-end versions is the
palladio herbal i shadow primer and you
can find it at sally beauty supply just
take the applicator kind of dot it there
on your lid blend it out with your
finger and if you feel like you still
have too much on there just start
blending it up through your crease and
beyond depending on how much you put
there on your lid okay then we're going
to grab a really inexpensive but great
palette that you can find now at target
stores it's by elf and I think you may
be able to find these online to this is
the neutrals palette and it's just a six
color eyeshadow palette because it has a
mix of really highly shimmery shades
couple of matte shades and a dark shade
we're going to take a golden tone shade
in this kit which is in the middle on
the bottom right here I'm actually
taking my ELF I shadow brush another
really expensive inexpensive brush
option and I just looked down into a
mirror that's what helps you see the
largest surface area of your eyelid
there without having to like blink and
go like that I start on the inside
because that's where I want the biggest
concentration of that shimmery color to
really make my eyes look wide open and
really pop so I'm patting that shade
right there on the inner corner and if I
want to go back for more which I think I
do just continue to apply that all over
the lid just like so and you've got this
really pretty golden pop of color there
looks really nice because we've gotten
this we've achieved this sort of
flawless skin look and then we have this
pretty pop of color on the I it's going
to be nice and then I'm going to take
that same shade but a bigger brush I'm
using my Sephora rounded crease brush
but any large brush that looks sort of
like this will do get a little bit of
that product on there go right up under
the brow that nice golden shimmer is
really going to shine through it's not
going to be one of those um kind of
pasty looking bright white highlights
but rather
a golden look that's going to kind of
glow and shine so get that all up there
and then take a crease brush maybe not
your smallest crease brush but one that
looks about like this for example in the
a really great brush do that i recommend
people look into is by essence of beauty
it's available at CVS and there are a
couple of different there's this brush
do it you can get four priests brushes
one gives you a very small crease brush
if there is more of a medium-sized i'm
going to use that medium sized brush and
go into the deepest shade in the palette
which is actually kind of a pretty navy
blue that has just a hint of sparkle
just slightly tap your brush in there
you don't have to scrub back and forth
because a little bit of the products in
this palette go a really long way i'm
going to go right to the center of my
crease and dot that color and then i'm
going to start to pull it downward and
then once I've pulled it down I'm going
to go the whole length of my crease okay
the idea is you want it to look blended
not like you've just got one dark streak
going on there but you want it to be to
blend from left to right but also a
little bit from top to bottom like I
said to make it look like you didn't
just streak a line of color there so
that's kind of what I'm doing as you can
see I kind of pulled it out to the outer
side I haven't really gone up like this
with a big kind of V shape because I
want to keep it somewhat natural but I
still want that pretty definition clean
off just kind of dust off your fluffier
brush there and really blend that out
some more these colors are really soft
and blendable so you're not going to
have a problem with that next I'm going
to take an eyeliner here and i'm going
to use it's a really affordable option
it's from wet and wild and it is the
dark brown coal eyeliner pencil you can
use this as a brow pencil too but it's
very soft and very easy to smudge or
blend and I chose brown just because I
think it's a little less intense than
black and maybe you don't want ads
intents of a look when you're going to
school so I'm going to start in the
center of my upper lash line
and just start applying that color you
can see it's really soft it comes off
really well and just kind of pull it to
the outer corner and then kind of
overlap as I go towards the inside
sometimes it's just easier to start in
the most available area which is right
there in the middle and we're going to
pull it down to the inner corner just
slightly so we're pretty much going the
length of our upper lash line but
getting much lighter as we get in
towards that inner corner it's going to
keep our eyes looking wide awake okay
and then we're going to go to their
lower lash line but we're only going to
be lining a portion of that so we go
down here and we want to connect at the
outer corner with what we did up top and
we're only going to go i would say about
maybe a third to half of the way in
there on your lower lash line and then I
would suggest probably grabbing a q-tip
and using that q-tip to blend out what
you've put on the lower lash line what's
nice is that you don't have to rush with
this product once you get it on there
you know it's still going to be a little
bit smudge able so you don't have to
feel like okay I got a line really fast
and then that's when you start making
mistakes so you can take your time and
then go back at your convenience and
sort of give it just a little bit of a
blended look and q tips are one of the
most affordable things to pick up and
buy big box of them have them stashed
away to blend out anything then this is
kind of an optional step but i would
recommend it if you're in a real hurry
you might not want to do it but take
your darkest shade remember what we put
in the crease i'm going to use an angled
liner brush you can find these in the
drugstore very easily too and i'm just
going to go over that liner that we did
so just part of the way there and this
is a very easy step you just kind of dot
it over next this is again totally
optional but I like to take a white
liner and put it on my waterline
especially for the news because I feel
like I
look as wide awake as possible and
basically what this does is make your
eyes look a little wider you just apply
that to your waterline and it basically
extends the whites of your eyes out
making your eyes look a little bit wide
more wide awake some people don't like
this some people do the one in case
you're wondering the one that I used is
Rimmel soft coal in pure white very easy
very quick step um then I'm going to
curl my eyelashes i'm using my almay one
coat nourishing mascara triple effect so
it looks like this and if the brush is
interesting it has long bristles on one
end here's my unibrow and short bristles
on the other so I'm going to take the
long bristles side first which is going
to be my lengthening side and apply that
to my lashes first I'm flipping it over
to the other side which is shorter which
is more of a volumizing one final thing
if you want to take your translucent
powder or any powder that you used
earlier on in the face step take a
little sponge or a little brush or
whatever I do recommend dabbing that
right under your eye area and that way
you can also ensure that you're
absorbing any oils that might come down
off of that liner as the day goes on
now on to lips this step isn't something
you have to do but i really like before
i start doing my lip look i like to
apply a lip balm i'm using my eos lemon
drop lip balm as you can see it's just
kind of in a round circle you may find
this at your local walgreens store but
yeah go to school with this in your book
bag and all your friends will be like
what's that lip balm you're using you
know that will happen then i'm going to
take a lipstick that i think is so
pretty and it's from l'oreal and it's
the color is organza and it's kind of a
cross between a neutral lip stick with
just a little bit of pink to it and you
can apply it straight from the tube and
it's just really pretty it really
catches the light it brightens up the
face because it isn't just one of those
purely nude lipsticks it has a little
bit of color to it it's just really
pretty you don't have to put a gloss
over this but if you want to put a gloss
over this I really really love these new
glosses from Bath and Body Works their
the lipless cupcakes and they have a
variety of shades um let's see which one
would probably look I think I'm going to
take the cookies and cream one actually
for this and it's kind of neutrally but
it has the same sort of a little bit of
mob undertone like this lipstick has and
just go over the top with that just for
a little added shine really pretty lies
here is the finished look I hope you
enjoy it also with the lips if you
prefer to use a lip liner one that goes
really well with this look is the NYX
lip liner in mahogany it's sort of just
a little bit deeper neutral shade and
it's really really pretty and I just
kind of went over my lips a little bit
just kind of line them a little with
that and I really like the inference alt
there so if you don't want to use a lip
liner obviously that will cut out
sometime if you just skip that step 2
but yeah this is a really natural look
for school it still leaves you looking
polished and I sort of designed it so it
would be a long wearing look as well and
something you don't have to pay a lot of
money for either so that's always a good
thing if you're wondering how I did my
hair I basically just took my
straightener and Iker
my hair my hair's about this long I
don't have my extensions in I curled my
hair out away from my face and my hair
has layers so that's sort of why you're
seeing curls like up in here and down
here but i took my straightener you know
ran it down my hair curled it away from
my face on both sides and then i took
this little it's like it actually blends
right in with my hair so that's kind of
neat because it's it's sort of subtle
but it's a little black flower on a
bobby pin i got it from forever 21 super
cheap it came with a white one too and
you just pop that in and pull part of
your hair back for a little different
look and it goes with my shirt to which
has sort of a rose print there on it I
can't quite remember where the shirt
came from but anyway I hope you enjoyed
this look for back-to-school I hope you
all start your years on a good note and
and started off with some fun makeup so
thanks so much for watching guys have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
