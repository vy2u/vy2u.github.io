video this is going to address one of my
most frequently asked hair questions
which is how can I get healthy hair how
can I at least give my hair the
appearance of being healthy so I'm going
to get sort of two different categories
of advice on this one sort of to make
your hair truly healthy and then kind of
another set of tips sort of to give your
give your hair the appearance of being
healthy in case you have made some
mistakes in the past or maybe not done
things quite the way you would have
wanted to so but first I am going to
tell you what's on my lips and my nails
since I sometimes forget to say that and
if maybe this will just answer your
questions right off the bat I have this
awesome like kind of minty green looking
nail going on it's the China Glaze shade
in for Aubree for Audrey and it's just
kind of a creamy like mint green but I
went over that with this shade from
Sally girl both these I got it sally
beauty supply in champaign kisses and
this is a really light but kind of
shimmering mint green it's very sheer
and so when I went over the top of that
I gave it a little Sheen and I think
it's really pretty so anyway on my lips
is Revlon super lustrous lip gloss in
pink afterglow it's very sheer kind of
pink with just a little hint of sparkle
to it so anyway um the first tips that
I'm going to share with you about
healthy hair are pretty basic and
probably something you've heard before
um keeping your ends trimmed if you're
looking at your hair and you're thinking
gosh you know looks alright except when
i get to the ends i see things looking
dry and kind of frayed and frizzed out
you need to get a regular trim you might
think well I want my hair to be really
nice and long but you do need those
periodic trims just to give your hair
that appearance of of health from root
to tip really so that's one thing that
really I as far as having split ends you
do need to get just get rid of them at
some point you know you can do all of
the you know split and treatments or
whatever that you can find that's out
there but ultimately cutting them off
will rid you of that worry and you'll
have beautiful hair you know all the way
down another thing is to
keep coloring really to a minimum you're
damaging your hair when you when you put
a lot of coloring in it and I use
occasionally I will use a semi-permanent
color from it's it's from Clairol and
it's the natural instincts and it's
really just the same shade as my hair
color it's in the dark brown shade and
i'll put a link to the blog post i did
all about this you know what the color
is i use and stuff but i wanted to use
that because as the pretty much the
exact same same shaves my natural hair
color which I like but it gave me a
little more thickness so there are
certain extensive coloring that you can
do and some will damage your hair less
than others so semi-permanent methods
will be a little more gentle on your
hair so that might be something to think
about but like I said maybe you've
already been coloring your hair and you
just that's something that you're just
going to do you can still get healthy
looking hair so you'll see that through
some of my tips here that I give later
on but less heat styling / blow-drying I
definitely I'm not as huge into
blow-drying because I shower the night
before and and that's a really good way
to kind of eliminate that from your
routine I mean I will sometimes just hit
it with the blow dryer if I do have any
dampness still in the morning or just to
kind of bring a little more life to the
hair if you've been laying on it you
know sleeping on it one way so I'm
hitting it with a blow dryer real quick
can kind of you know give it a little
more oomph but if you can ultimately you
know keep from going from soaking my
hair and having to blow dry at all yeah
that can be very damaging on your hair
all that heat styling so if you can find
sort of a way in your routine to cut
back on that that's helpful but in terms
of the actual styling say with a flat
iron or a curling iron obviously if you
do less of that you're doing less damage
to your hair so but I know like I am
reliance upon me you know using a
curling iron or a straightener for
different things and so
I still feel like I maintain a decently
healthy hair those so some of these tips
I give you now are going to kind of help
you still have that healthy hair even if
you do have some of those habits that i
mentioned above the first is using a
deep conditioner and now i'm going to
suggest some products specifically the
aussie three minute miracle it says for
normal to dry hair but this is something
that you put it on in the shower and you
basically put it on your hair leave it
in for three minutes you could shave
your legs or you know whatever and leave
that in there and then rinse it out and
you've gotten a nice deep conditioning
treatment I do this about once a week on
a regular basis I shampoo and condition
my hair I use the generic value products
from Sally's for matrix amplify so it's
about half the price you get them each
where you would pay fifteen dollars a
piece you're paying like five so that's
awesome but that's what I do regularly
so and then one day a week I'll do this
and I'll keep it mainly on the length of
my hair like from here and down um and
it just it just really brings health
back to the hair it makes it more
manageable the next time you go to style
it I feel like anyway so it especially
when winter time comes you know I might
be able to skip a couple weeks on this
in the summer but winter this is the
type of thing you really want to use
religiously if you're in a very cold
climate where the air gets very very dry
so that's one of those great products to
have for healthy hair also heat defense
sprays the type of thing that you would
spray on before you used a curling iron
or before you use your flat iron and
many of these are sort of designed with
a dual purpose and that they help
protect your hair from the heat but they
also help lock in the style a little
better so I have a couple here that I
like one is more geared toward flat
irons one more towards curling however I
feel like they can both work
interchangeably I mean I've used them
both in different scenarios the la·cu
hair care line these are available like
ulta I've talked I've reviewed all of
their thermal products before but this
spray is probably the one I use the most
I will use it even though it says flat
iron on there
use this even when I curl or straighten
just to have something on my hair that
is going to sort of protect the style
and my hair itself so that's a good one
if you don't have access to those
products the Tresemme line creates some
good I think you're called thermal
creations at least this one that I have
this might be a little older I'm not
sure but I have something called curl
activator spray so you could put that on
before you use your curling iron a lot
of these do work interchangeably curler
straighteners whatever blow-drying even
and it just I feel like they help in
locking in the style a little bit more
too um lastly when you finish your look
and you've done all the things above and
you've tried to you know be really
conscious of having healthy hair a nice
finishing touch can be to give your hair
some shine and this is kind of a fine
line because nobody wants to have Gracie
looking hair but you do want that nice
Sheen to it that makes it appear to not
be dry and brittle and I run across a
product that I really like and it's from
tresemme and it's called the no frizz
ultra light shine spray and this can be
nice for taming those flyaways that you
might have you know right in here where
we all part our hair then you've got
those few little hairs sprouting up but
just one or two spritzes for me and
gives my hair shine but it and it has a
nice fresh scent but it doesn't go
overboard and there are also shine
serums out there that might be a little
a little bit heavy for some people who
have fine hair like mine but this spray
I think could be a universally good
thing for people who just want that
little extra polish to their look and it
really can give your hair a look of
health so I hope you enjoy these tips
and we'll be able to implement some of
these in your everyday strategy for
healthier hair thank you to everybody
who asked this question really pushed me
to go ahead and do a video on it I hope
it helps so thanks for watching guys
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
