video featuring a new makeup brand
that's out there it's called
heartbreaker cosmetics for more
information on the line you can go to
heartbreaker cosmetics com I learned
about it from my friend Susan here on
YouTube as she is actually the owner of
the company and she sent me some amazing
samples here like some really awesome
colors of eyeshadow and there's a
foundation shade in there and finishing
powder and I I was checking out the
website too and there's actually like
different categories there's so many
shadows like I like doing a lot of
neutral looks I mean that's what I get
the most use out of for work and stuff
like that but there are some really
colorful shades there are a lot of
different categories that all kind of go
under the love theme it's heartbreaker
cosmetics so a new love eyes love junkie
eyes forever love eyes and those all
mean I think they have like a different
level of like um sparkle in them maybe
or they're just I mean the website will
will kind of guide you through all that
but I'm just letting you know that just
cuz this look is neutral there are a lot
of colorful looks and this is what I
call kind of like a your eyes but better
but look I did it here on my right eye
and I just loved it it was so easy to
blend um I just think this is a great
look that I could use for every day and
it's just one of those you know look
should you kind of take anywhere and
anyway I'm going to just show you and
this is all mineral to mineral eyeshadow
so I wanna make that clear as well so
what I'm going to do here I'm just going
to go ahead and get started um I'm going
to start out actually using my hip cream
shadow paint and the color is 807
secretive and it's just kind of a pearly
white shade and I like using this
sometimes because when i'm using loose
shadows like these are i think it um
tends to cling to my eye more when i use
a creamy base like this I've also put on
my normal primer which is the Mary Kay
eye primer but I'm
going to kind of paint this on this
little paintbrush thing that actually
comes with the Loreal hip shadow paint
which actually actually does a decent
job of spreading it out okay just kind
of spread that all over your lid to get
going and then I'm going to use a color
that it's kind of hard to tell through
the little packet what color I'm talking
about because I it doesn't really allow
the shimmer to show through so I kind of
have to look inside to really see and
describe what i'm going to use here but
what this this color is a sweetheart
it's the new love eyes collection and
what this is is a shimmery light pink
it's really really pretty the the
shimmer is very fine it's not like
chunky glitter sparkles and I'm going to
just use a shadow brush to put this all
over my lid and as you can see it shows
up even though it is such a light shade
he shows up really well so just kind of
put that all over your wood it just
gives you a nice in terms got that light
shade on your lid it really gives you
that wide awake look and then i'm going
to use in the forever love eyes
collection the color is for keeps and it
looks here you may not be able to tell
but what it's it looks to me like kind
of a deep mavi plum shade and i love
those plum colors for eyes and it's a
little sparkle to it too and the sparkle
and some of these or the shimmer in it
makes it very user friendly i find so
i'm just going to use i'm using my
sephora rounded crease brush here and
basically just going to take this all
over the crease and this color because
it does have that hint of the pinky and
the purpley tones to it it really is
natural because these are the tones that
we all have in our skin and you can see
how easily and flawlessly that's
lending out and I'm just going to go
over a little more it's so buildable on
building up the intensity as we speak
here and I'm just you know adding to it
as I go okay so I'm kind of looking at
the other I'm what I want to do with
this shade since this is one of the
deeper shades that I'm using I want to
build it up a little more on the outside
creating sort of that outer V look to
the corner so I'm gonna build it up a
little on the outer half all right
that's just coming along great so soft
but gives me that nice contour there you
can see how it's completely I mean it
blends out so easily i love it in
mineral shadows I mean I are really easy
to use I mean don't be discouraged by
the fact they're loose shadows and nuts
in a little you know compact together
but um and then I'm going to use a color
it's sort of aid a rusty golden a shade
it's got some tones of brown some reds
some golds in it it's very very warm and
it's great to kind of warm up your
entire I and it's the love junkie eyes
in crazed and this has probably the most
sparkle in it of any of them and this is
just going to go all over the crease and
you're going to see how it really warms
that whole area up it just really
creates this kind of halo effect around
your eye I really like that one
and so next what I'm going to do to give
it myself a little highlight I'm going
to use the new love eyes and puppy love
and what this is is just it pearly it
seems like a very very light beige curly
shade and this is good to use as your
highlight so here goes I feel like I'm
really close to the light on my makeup
mirror so you might even be able to tell
more I'm doing when I get back here
because i think when i get so close you
can see that the light kind of maybe
washes this look out a little bit so i'm
just putting this all over kind of the
border of the color and concentrating it
on the highest point of the arch so here
you can see what we're doing and i'm
going to go over one more time because i
did this on the other eye to eye kind of
did the look and then i came back and
decided i wanted just a little more
depth out of that V for keeps shade
these kind of plumbing color so I'm
going over that just a little bit and
that's the good part about that's
especially if you're a beginner and you
want to experiment with some mineral
shadows this is one where you can you're
not it's hard to screw it up because I
mean so anyway there's the shadow look
as far as this what goes and then I'm
going to use some liquid line since this
is a very soft look I still want some
definition to my eye so I'm going to use
my Revlon Colorstay a liquid liner and
I'm just going to do a thin line across
the top with that know if you can see
what I'm doing I'm just looking down
into a little mirror I always hold a
little mirror up close to my face so I
can really see what I'm dealing with my
liner is considered I'm just thickening
it out a little bit towards the corner
and I'm going to just extend it ever so
slightly past the corner of my eye kind
of have to work with this a little bit
and everyone's eye is different as far
as how well this will work for you but
um basically it looks kind of unfinished
now because we're going to come up and
connect it with a pencil so the pencil
I'm going to use is where did it go my
web one and color state pencil in black
brown and I'm going to start at the
corner and just connect up to what I
just did right here just connect up and
then when i use a smudge tip too so
don't fear back into my mirror now
and now i'm just going to smudge that
out with my smudge tip which can remove
a lot of the excess product that you may
have put on there and help that little
connection you're making at the corner
so just gonna smudge it out and if you
wanted to even more soft looking you can
see as I get back from the camera a
little bit that looks a little more
realistic here looks a little bit dark
here not quite so much okay so just so
you're getting some frame of reference
of what this really will look like in
person I'm just continuing to smudge out
the liner and Revlon Colorstay since it
does stay so well it's not the easiest
of the liners to smudge but it still
will do some smudging for you and if you
wanted to learn say was if you wanted to
tone it down even more you could take
one of those mineral shadows and just
kind of sweep it over and you might get
an even softer look out of it but wow
okay taking a long time on this tutorial
I think I'm talking a lot I'm going to
curl my lashes next and i'm going to use
today my covergirl super thick lash
mascara it's super cheap it's not
amazingly lengthening but it is very
thickening so come in put someone on
really thickens up quickly okay so
here's your look it's like I said it's
kind of one of those your eyes but
better looks it's got some nice neutral
shades in it we're not really using
Browns that we're using some tones that
truly your face heads in them so when
you put this shadow on it looks so
natural and it just blends right away if
you're not the first type of person that
likes to look like you've got a real
defined eyeshadow look going on this is
a look you're gonna really like and a
brand you're going to like even if you
do like colorful shapes I encourage you
to just stop by the website and see what
they have its heartbreaker cosmetics
calm thanks so much for watching guys
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
