all about some cheap cheap make ups of
dollar store stuff some really
surprising items that I think you're
going to be like what that's really a
dollar you know there are some great
things that I've found also some
not-so-great things I've got like an
equally sized pile of some duds that I'm
going to tell you about also it's a lot
of this stuff it's LA Colors brand
because that is a brand that's heavily
sold in different dollar stores where I
live
I've also got a few things from shop
myths a which is a website it's kind of
like an online beauty accessories dollar
store and I've got a few things to share
from there also but sort of the new
dollar store makeup news to tell you
about is that LA Colors has launched a
little like $1 kiosk or $1 little makeup
stand where certain products and I think
a lot of them are newer things that
they've put out specifically for this
one dollar line I will let you know when
we come across some of those items in
this video a lot of those things were
sent to me and then I was kind of
intrigued enough by what else you know
from LA Colors is out there because they
still have a full line in a store such
as Family Dollar or Fred super dollar
wherever you are so I investigated a
little further and I've got some of that
stuff to tell you about as well so I'm
going to jump in them and try not to
spend too much time on any one thing
because I've got a lot to talk about but
I'm going to get the Misses out of the
way first a lot of these things are
coverage type products that just did not
work for me you're saying this LA Colors
liquid makeup this product is not from
the $1 line I have it in creamy beige I
am wearing it today and any coverage you
see on my skin is kind of from a
mishmash of other things that I put on
to get coverage because this makes me
think of just a glorified tinted
moisturizer I mean it really after I put
it on I thought what's on my skin
besides a little added moisture it
really did not show up so that's a no-go
for me also they have something called
wet to dry makeup I think they kind of
branded this like a cream to powder type
thing and I have this in the shade light
it's a little sponge and then just the
thickest cream you've ever felt feels
kind of like clay I don't see it going
from cream to powder at all it's just
thick kind of cakey it's too heavy on
the skin the same can be said for the LA
Colors concealer stick all this stuff is
LA color so far by the way
all of this is part of their regular
line not the one-dollar stuff but this
concealer stick in light the smell it
does have that strong like kind of
grandma's floral perfume type scent
which is really strange but a lot of you
know cheaper makeup products have that
and when you think concealer from the
dollar store I mean this is it you know
it's thick it's not very creamy there's
not a nice slip to this product across
the skin once you get it on it just
looks very makeup II there are other
great drugstore stick concealers out
there this is just not one of them
additionally this concealer this is
there you know concealer that's a little
more liquidy with a wand it's probably
the least bed out of the you know face
products I've tried it did okay for a
little bit of brightening but there's
just no coverage and it is called a
concealer so I kind of want it to you
know cover some things but I had this in
the shade light and it's just you know
I'm not going to be using that now from
the little special new $1 stuff they
have come out with various sticks that
say contour stick on them I've got one
that looks like a classic kind of
contouring shade or like a deep bronzy
color one that says bronzer and this has
shimmer also a little bit of glitter in
that stick you've got a highlighter that
is a soft kind of pearly color and then
you've got a light to medium shade for
your highlighting this does not have
shimmer this is the only one in the set
that seemed to be workable for me these
others I found to be really difficult to
blend and it might be that this is the
kind of thing I would use maybe hand in
hand with a concealer product to get
right in here in this area brighten it
up work nicely in contrast with my skin
tone it was just a little bit lighter
than my skin I was able to blend it it
does have some coverage the highlighter
stick just I couldn't make that show up
enough so that's a little too subtle for
me and then the contour stick I found
very difficult to blend out keep in mind
you know you're gonna probably already
have some sort of foundation on your
skin and then you go putting this on I
found it very hard to blend and the
bronzer formula just the look of this
product is not my style I don't like to
see the flecks of glitter another no-go
for me would be this volume flash
mascara and it does look kind of like a
mini sized this is being sold for a
dollar
my main gripe is this kind of a brush
there's some pretty wide gaps in between
those spiraled around bristles and that
doesn't lend itself to really good
separation so needless to say this gives
me a very like barely there look to my
lashes I'm not a big fan also kind of a
big letdown for me and these are one
dollar products they've got these pout
lip glosses matte so these are their
matte liquid lipsticks and they have
some beautiful shades like I love this
color and it's called let's kiss and I
had high hopes where I put it on I'm
like yes this looks beautiful it's
pigmented it goes on you know very full
color with the applicator it's got a
nice little flattened doe foot that I
really enjoy but my issue with this is
that it doesn't really dry down it just
becomes so sticky I even took like a
little video on my phone of my lips like
trying to pull them apart and there's
that very uncomfortable cling between
your lips as they just sit there because
it just stays sticky it doesn't totally
dry down it doesn't stay nice and creamy
it just gets to this weird sticky place
and it's the kind of product you just
want to take off your lips right away
it's unfortunate because they've got
some gorgeous shades available now perk
your ears up because I've got some
things that definitely are a hit and in
this same one dollar range and you're
going to find this again in like a
free-standing little display in family
dollar from LA Colors they've got the
pout lip gloss super shine these are
great these are full color glosses
they're comfortable on the lips I'm
wearing one of them today let's see I'm
wearing this one in mah mah and it's a
pretty berry shade you know just one
pass around the lips I feel like I got
really good color they're very
comfortable non sticky and to have a
nice little range of shades this red
one's really pretty too called hot lips
it's a red with a little bit of shimmer
like it also from the $1 selection
they've got some false lashes anytime I
see falsies for a dollar and they look
remotely workable I'm all-in you know
I'm gonna go for that a lot of times I
swear you're getting some of the very
same styles that you see sold by Ardell
for you know several dollars more so I
am wearing a set of these lashes today I
think the style I've got on is called
diva I also have this style called the
light
and that definitely reminds me of like a
salon perfect or a nard l110 are selling
some matte eyeshadow quads for a dollar
and they are surprisingly good I would
highly recommend these I'm wearing one
of these little quads today in the shade
mattifying so this is going to be like
your classic neutral you've got that you
know nice easy medium brown dark brown
peach and cream it's so basic but really
good stuff easy to blend easy to work
with maybe a little bit powdery but it's
nothing I'm not used to you know tap off
the excess people they also have in
comparison to this one this would be
you're like cool neutrals this is called
matter if ik you got a couple of topes a
cream kind of a charcoal gray I also was
really impressed with this kit for kind
of a smoky look this is called Matta
Rama and you have a pop of blue there a
matte black a gray and a white plenty of
impact from all of those shades and the
one quad that didn't quite hit the mark
for me so much was this one in
magnificent it's not bad but I wanted a
little more out of those purples and
Purple's are a hard shade for a lot of
brands to get right so you know you'll
have that huh but the Purple's are more
sheer and then you've got this navy blue
and light pink as well but all the
shades truly are matte they're not satin
finishes they're not just borderline
they are matte quad and for $1 I mean I
was really pleased with those even not
just for one dollar you know these are
good quality Matt drugstore shadows what
else do I have here from that one dollar
stand I've got a brow product this is
the LA Colors brow pencil and I have it
in medium I like this just fine I mean
this tone was not too warm for my brows
it's just like a nice cool medium brown
and for me to just fill in a few key
places it worked fine now I will say I
know some of you are completely
recreating a brow and it might not be
quite so easy from that respect this is
the kind of color it gives off and well
yes you can sharpen it you're not going
to have maybe that precision that you're
used to if you often pick up a NYX micro
brow on estancia brow Wiz that new
L'Oreal pencil is just like the other
two and this is a pencil that you got to
sharpen and that may be a pain to some
people but it does have the little brush
on the end and for just a few little key
areas if you're kind
like me and you just have small places
to fill in this worked fine Oh another
$1.00 thing this is not LA Colors but I
got a body fantasies vanilla body spray
just so I could be taken back to my days
of junior high when I was always wearing
like vanilla fields all the time yeah
it's totally that scent now some non one
dollar products but still very
affordable products from LA Colors that
I turned up and that I really like this
brush duo this is such a hidden gem this
is the ice shader and blender brush duo
and these are really soft brushes they
are just super great to work with this
blending brush a lot of times I get
asked for an alternative to the Sigma
e-40 because that's kind of you know
like 95% of the time the thing I pick up
to blend out and I look but this one I
tell you the size is right you could
apply a little shadow with this if you
wanted to but it's not too big but it's
very soft it's very nicely tapered and
it works great just blending out your
eye look and then this other one it's
kind of like one of those flat brushes
but it's still a little bit full so I
could see this packing some shadow on
the lid or getting it up into the crease
if you've got really small eyes you
might find this just a little bit
oversized but overall just the quality
the cut of these the evenness of the cut
the taper the feel of the bristles these
really really surprised me I got just a
very basic pressed powder that I really
liked from this line it looks like this
and it's in the shade nude for me and
this has kind of gotten into my rotation
for a little under eye setting powder or
just a little light you know t-zone
powder very matte you know it's not the
kind of thing I would probably throw on
all over the face just because I don't
know I try to stay away from that if I
can because a lot of powders just look
do powdery all over your face but you
know the areas where you need some
powder and this has worked fine and it
was just a couple dollars I got this
cool mosaic bronzing powder it's in the
shade sunkissed bronze and something
about this tone I think looks really
good on my skin tone it's very golden II
I don't know that I would really use
this as a contour but something about it
lightly all over the skin it seems to
look really nice
and it's pigmented it's not one of those
hard as a rock powders where you've got
to scrub your brush onto it to pick
anything up and one of the biggest
shockers of this whole little experiment
for me was probably this duo blush from
LA Colors because I've got an LA Colors
like single blush in my collection and
it just it's a does nothing product like
you can't get color off of it's so hard
it's just not good to work with and this
is in papaya and nutmeg not sure which
is which but this blush over here this
little bit deeper side it reminds me of
the bombs hot mama I'm wearing it today
you get that pinky peachy thing
happening on the cheeks with a little
golden sheen and then I do find myself
going for this soft peach shade just
kind of blending up over the top it
gives kind of a a little bit more
perfected look now before I move on to
the shop miss a stuff I want to talk
about a few of the products that were
just in the middle as you guys know you
know not everything's a total hit or a
total mess and these are again things
from just the $1 collection from LA
Colors they've got these little nail
duets and they are so cute so you got
like two little bottles they are kind of
enclosed in this plastic cap and these
are there okay they look nice on my
nails right after application I just
found them to chip very quickly you've
got like this little mint green duo
you've got a pinky duo they got a black
and a gold here I think there was a nude
and gold glitter that I've got
downstairs but I'd used the nude one and
the mint when I found it both to ship
very quickly now in addition to those
matte liquid lipsticks that I could not
go for they've got just some matte
regular lipsticks some good shades you
know like a very sort of purplish color
or red and nude these are good but not
great you know they do feel a little
drying on the lips they don't feel
uncomfortable and sticky like those
others but you know there are definitely
better matte lipstick options they have
kind of that drying feeling a little bit
of a skip across your lips as you try to
put them on another thing they've got
are these lip duos so it's a like
classic full-size lipstick on one side
and a gloss on the other side while
these are nice comfortable creamy
lipsticks and I do think they're
pigmented the
azar very slippery lipglosses need to
have enough of a cling on your lips to
last and that doesn't have to feel
uncomfortable but it's like there's got
to be just enough thickness to a gloss
so you don't feel like gosh it's just
slipping outside my lips constantly and
these are very thin almost a little bit
greasy feeling glosses so I don't hate
these products but I think you need to
be pretty careful particularly if you're
going for one that's got like a bright
red gloss underneath I carefully that
now from shot miss a I freaking love
this bag that I got for $1 little canvas
bag blending is my cardio these days yes
yes it is all the stuff on shop miss a
is a dollar so for a dollar each I got
these Santi Sunkist mineral formula SPF
20 and they look like little blush duo
type things remind me a lot of something
Milani had out years ago and they're
great there's nice pigmentation I love
this kind of Mavi shade with that
neutral peach this one looks like kind
of a satiny finish in the pan that comes
off very matte on my skin and then I
also got sunrise and so here you've got
that nice Coralie shade and a little bit
deeper more brownish tone there now they
also have this line of princesa
eyeshadows and they're just single
shadows and I thought okay I'll just get
a couple turns out the couple that I
chose are very close in color but the
quality on these is really good really
nice pigmentation this is 836 this is
kind of a satiny finish like rusty Brown
type color then I have 827 which seems
to be just a classic like matte Brown
maybe a little bit of a satiny finish to
that one but they're super soft they're
only a dollar I was really impressed
with those and like I said they seemed
to have a pretty big selection of colors
there and because we just can't get away
from LA colors in this video I saw they
were selling some of these five color
palettes for a dollar on shop misae so I
got this tea-time one and it's not
necessarily that I would do a full look
with all of these shades because
everything is equally metallic and shiny
but there are certain ones that I just
thought wow these are so pretty I wonder
if everybody
knows about them like these pretty like
rosy deep dusty Rose taupe you know kind
of interesting things and even this
color right here could be like a fun
highlight shade and if you wanted to
just add some interesting metallics to
your collection I thought well that's
kind of a neat thing for a dollar so
there you have it everybody some hits
and misses from the dollar store price
range I hope this was helpful to you
maybe you discovered a few things that
you might look into the next time you're
at the dollar store and you know me I
just love finding those unlikely good
products those products that surprised
me love being surprised by some cheap
thing that really works well oh I forgot
there was one thing that I left out of
my little discussion of average products
and that was this eyeliner it's the one
of the one dollar things from LA Colors
says just liquid eyeliner and I have it
in black this is a pretty good product
it's not 100% waterproof but it does
wear well throughout the day my only
gripe about it is that it doesn't dry
down matte and I've tried enough like
pretty cheap eyeliners like from Jordana
that totally satisfy me and do the job
so I don't really feel like I need to
scramble for a one dollar liner but it
does have just a little pointed felt tip
thing going on there and it applies
easily but I just wish it dried down
totally matte this does seem to just
have a little unusual shine to it and
when you're not putting lashes on top
and you see that it's like it hits the
light in certain ways and your liner
looks uneven okay now I'm really done
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
