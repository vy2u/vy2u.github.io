kind of getting over my cold so my voice
is still a little bit low but hey check
this out oops
okay I'm Moroccan some kind of bright
purple shadow liner just want to tell
you this is elf purple passion wowza
so I layered purple passion and purple
blaze lighter from NYX on here I was
kind of inspired by something I saw in
the Avon catalog so I blogged about this
look it's on beauty broadcast no but I
was just like oh this is fun so let's be
honest I've been blowing my nose a lot
so it's kind of red so I'm sure you
don't mind hope you don't mind cuz it's
red it's video kind of something fun and
different cuz I know many people who
watch Beauty broadcast our drugstore
makeup lovers and I titled this hidden
gems of the drugstore not so much
because I'm because nobody knows about
this stuff because I'm sure they're
gonna be some of you who know a lot
about this stuff but they were new to me
things I never really pursued from the
drugstore those things I think go under
the radar and what brought these all to
my attention this past weekend I had a
chance to chat with my friend David he
is a makeup artist for Estee Lauder in
New York but he is a lover of all kinds
of makeup and we talked for hours he's a
friend of my sisters as well and so we
just talked and talked about all things
makeup picking each other's brains
talking about you know favorite products
and he would mention you know a few
different things from the drugstore I'm
like oh I haven't tried that I haven't
tried that Oh like so he opened my eyes
to some products that I feel like have
been around in the drugstore potentially
for a long time that I just haven't been
looking and I thought it'd be fun to
share this little haul with you inspired
by some of those things we talked about
like I said new to me may or may not be
new to you as well one thing he brought
up we're talking about bright lips right
and everybody loves the Vivid's and
stuff he's like well if you like that
kind of thing you should check out the
Revlon moon drops lipsticks yes these
lipsticks that kind of smell like
grandma's perfume because he's like you
know there
you're out there you know there you're
way down low under all the other stuff
and that he's like they come in a bunch
of like exciting colors and fun bright
shades that if you want to rock a bright
lip you know these colors are great and
I was playing with them yesterday
and seriously you put them on they do
have a very staining effect they don't
feel overly slick like they're gonna
slide off your lips like the nice
texture of Revlon Super Lustrous
lipsticks but even more like
pigmentation and brightness so anyway he
gave me some specific kinds to try out
one of them is love that pink I was
wearing this yesterday yeah it's bright
it's bright baby and these are creamy
shades there's really no shimmer in this
just really bright see some of these
ended up being in darker green tubes I
don't know if that's new or older but
Persian melon I feel like this is also
kind of a bright pink but a little bit
lighter then love that pink but like wow
I got these and yeah even with a
stopped-up nose I can smell the
grandma's perfume thing going on there
but I mean once you're gonna bind your
lips I don't really notice that that
much and the colors are saturated as
I'll get out hot coral now we're getting
a little bit oranjee here you can tell
so much more orange still super bright
and bold and the last one I got was
where is it orange flip and this one is
definitely the most orange eat of the
bunch so the most orange this one might
be kind of hard to tell but that's got a
little more red to it and then the pinks
so mood drops lipstick really would not
have thought to pick one of those up had
it not been for David's advice love that
I have these now I love that they're
kind of you know that sort of off the
beaten path makeup product that nobody
seems to really talk about much but
Kapow if you like bright colors check
them out another thing we're talking
about it's the black radiance line which
is made by Mark winds that's the company
that also makes wet and wild
and David was like you know you should
try those eight pan palates you know
they're great they've got the bright
colors they've got really deep you know
intense colors actually did come by one
of these in my Dollar General randomly I
don't know why it was there but because
I don't usually spot this line at any of
my local stores but I would said admire
where I found some others but this was
the one I previously had and I really
was wanting more and this is the
downtown Browns gorgeous colors in here
yes that quality that you like and enjoy
from just the the wet and wild color
icon palette then the ones that I was
able to find and that I was inspired to
really get on a search for thanks to
David where the urban jungle set look at
this and that yellow is no joke in there
the greens the Browns kind of a burgundy
burgundy ish Brown down there pretty
pretty stuff these are I'm talking to
you people who can't get enough of the
wet and wild color icon eye shadows to
where you feel the need to pursue
another brand who makes basically the
same thing that's what this is all about
and then this set is posh plums so this
kind of reminds me a little bit of it's
got some similar shades from the petal
pusher one and then there was a limited
edition wet and wild but had some of
these pinky kind of vibrant bluish tones
but this one you know still kind of a
different configuration of it like I
said that's a brand that I have to kind
of seek out because a lot of my local
stores don't have it but Black Radiance
making the same kind of stuff is wet and
wild and while I was there at Meijer
enjoying the wonderful makeup selection
I also saw Black Radiance has something
called continuous cream eye color and
this shade called champagne this is a
really I don't know if you can tell by
like my finger imprint there but kind of
a I don't know a little bit of a whipped
very creamy eye color and it comes off
like sort of a metallic gold let's show
you here but really pretty cream shadow
stuff going on there so I just wanted to
try that I tried it out on a whim
and the other thing here that David said
he really enjoyed and I believe he was
specifically referring to some of the
singles but I wasn't quite sure which
singles I should get and I saw this quad
and just thought it was really pretty
but the covergirl Queen collection so
here we're talking about more bold
shades and I must say this is a nicely
pigmented little quad here in brass and
sass yes that's the name brass and sass
and beautiful shades like this purple
and the blue nice stuff as much as I
love drugstore makeup it really thrills
me to find out things that I have still
not tried and that somebody thinks are
really awesome so I just wanted to share
that with you I would love to hear about
your hidden gems from the drugstore
those things that you know maybe they've
been around for a while but you just
don't hear a lot of people talking about
them because maybe if I do this video
again and I try something you told me to
try you will get the shout out for
telling me to try it so thank you so
much for watching I hope the next time I
join you in a video my voice doesn't
sound like Joan Rivers that's what
somebody said when they were watching
Beauty broadcast live this past week
they're like you sound like Joan Rivers
but I like it thank you
so I have great day guys I don't see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
