come on just give me a lipstick gift if
you give me a lipstick super super so
fun these bad boys paint these bad boys
you know what I'm talking about
friends today bring you high end
products worth trying this is my third
time doing this video I did a first way
back in 2008 then I did it again in 2011
and I thought it was time to give you an
update I think this particular video
just really lays it out there when it
comes to the high end makeup and says
hey what is truly worth that kind of a
price too also I've already done the
drugstore companion to this video and
that is dirt cheap products worth trying
everything this last time that I did it
was under three dollars so that was just
a couple videos ago so I'll link to that
below if you want to check it out in
this video I'm gonna give you my top ten
high-end products worth trying and I
really thought long and hard about this
list and I wanted it to be things that
had the greatest probability of working
across the board no matter who you are
you know what I mean like there are some
things that I think really suit specific
needs and maybe that's just gonna be
workable for one person or one kind of
skin type or one problem area and I one
of the things I mentioned here to be
very Universal if you know what I also
really wanted these to be like the least
do pible things and that's getting
harder and harder as I think drugstore
makeup is getting better and sometimes
it can be hard to find those truly
unique high-end things that just don't
have a drugstore counterpart you know
unique is the name of the game for this
video
things that are living up to the hype
the expectation the price tag all of it
so I hope you enjoy my recommendations
and here we go I'm gonna kick this off
with a couple of lip products and when
you think about what you want in a lip
product something that's gonna stay
pretty well on your lips and feel
absolutely comfortable the thing I would
recommend to you is the it cosmetics
vitality lip flush these may look like a
typical lipstick but what these are
going to do is give your lips one of the
most intense hydrating experiences you
probably felt on your lips I mean lips
feel so soft so nourished they're loaded
with great ingredients but there's also
a staining element in these so you put
them on and as you can see this one was
recently applied this shade is called
damsel it's one of my favorites and you
can see a little bit of shine coming off
there but once that starts to wear away
you're still going to have color on your
lips and it's also not going to be a
drying thing even after you lose the
appearance of shine your lips are gonna
feel really really nice so I think
that's such a nice perk with these insel
is probably one of the more muted ones
at the bunch it's kind of like a soft
rose color and then another one that I
think is great as Janice a quoi I
believe this might be the bestseller of
the line and it's weird because it looks
like it might just be like a transparent
bomb or something but when this kind of
combines with the heat of your body of
your lips it turns out to be more of a
bright pink but my mom is in her 60s she
worries about products going up into the
lines around her lips she says these do
not do that for her so I'm glad about
that I'm glad I love them too so I think
they're well worth it another lip
product that I think is just so unique
and fun are the OCC lip tars I've really
been enjoying these lately I love the
consistency of them they're a really
thin texture yet super pigmented
you can mix them and blend them and make
new shades bottom line the color on your
lips when you use these would be so rich
and saturated it's just wonder these
kind of products become like a lip
junkies playground because they are so
fun to play with the shades that I like
and I feel like can get me the widest
range of colors when I mix them I have
this shade called trollop and this is
just kind of a classic pink might even
have a little hint of coral in there I
also have vintage which is a really
really deep red I combined these and of
course you can do different amounts of
each one I can get a full range of berry
colors and pinks it's great and then the
other one that I think is great is
called cava cava and this is a nude
shade pretty on its own but when you
start adding in a little bit of pink you
get the perfect pinky nude and blogged
about my little DIY Physicians Formula
palate turned lip tar palate so these
come with little brushes and this just
happens to fit the brush perfectly and
then you can mix on the gut one do
whatever mean if you're watching all
this business saying come on just give
me a lipstick I get that this may not be
for everybody but if you really get kind
of a kick out of creating your own kind
of customized shade and you really want
color color color these are fun number
three let's talk about a palette lorac
Pro palette and I have so many loved
palettes in my collection but for me to
narrow it down to this one I think is
really saying some what makes us worth
trying is probably the fact that it's so
versatile a lot of people will say
should I try this through the Naked
palette this earth or whatever palette
and I say really if you want the most
the biggest variety of looks you would
probably go with this one because you
get all matte all shimmer this has been
talked and talked and talked about I
think about this from the standpoint of
a person who had zero eyeshadows in
their collection what should they pick
up to have the best variety of looks
probably this is just getting so many
shades in this that I think are
essentials like matte black dark matte
Brown your white and cream colors and
then these shimmery shades that can
really punch the look up a little bit so
warm shades cool shades it's just all in
I'm wearing this palette today on my
eyes I used the garnet shade and the
gold a little bit on the lids and that I
blended these deeper Browns
into the crease palette just doesn't get
old if you have it you know what I'm
talking about number four I have another
eye product and this just continues to
reign supreme in the land of cream
eyeshadows for me and it's the Mallee
ever color shadow sticks you know
Malley's come in to Ulta I've gotten
tons of questions what should I try what
should I try give one of these shadow
sticks a chance or find a kit that
contains one of these you will not be
sorry in my opinion are just the perfect
format for cream eyeshadow you don't
have to sharpen them they're a twist up
stick they're not so jumbo that you
couldn't take it under the eye for a
smudgy smokey eye so it's just size wise
the shade range
found a great drugstore line of cream
shadows that had the most gorgeous
shades as these I may not have mentioned
these here because they be you know kind
of do pible but these really are
stunningly gorgeous shades you and my
favorites if you're looking for some
neutral basics this is bronze that turns
out to be a gorgeous like rose gold
champagne
that's really pretty around the inner
corner of your eye and saddle shimmer is
that deep kind of brownish bronze and
the really seriously best part about
these is that they can be worn totally
alone okay so you take one of these
little sticks and let's say you want to
go all over your lid bring it up into
the crease blend it out a little bit
with your finger I don't need to top it
off with a powder shadow because these
do not budge shade range is huge with
these there are so many different colors
and also if you do want to top them with
the shadow you're gonna find you have an
extra long wearing look using one of
these as a base five I have a really
unique and awesome blush to tell you
about and it is the in stain blush from
the balm okay this is a blush that is
powder but it's gonna stain your cheeks
so I love when stuff can wear a long
time and still continue to look
beautiful you know not just be there but
look really fresh just as fresh as when
you put it on so these are some of the
most pigmented blushes you're gonna find
love the bumps regular blushes you know
frat boy hot mama they're all good but
these are just the next level up in
pigmentation and staying power so you
see how bright this shade is called lace
this bright pink actually makes you look
like you've had some Sun when you put it
on like the legit look of like maybe
you've gotten a little bit of a sunburn
it's kind of cool
swatch this okay let me see a little
powder and I demoed this in my full
review I did on these but you can rub
over it and that stuff is that powder
swatch is actually still there on the
skin you like Coralie blushes this shade
called 12 it looks like this see how
pretty that is as well so let me just
show you the two side-by-side so a
little bit warmer more peachy Coral this
one's really just pure pink you want to
see all the colors check out my review
of the end
our line of these but they're amazing
four six this is a one-of-a-kind product
guys and it's the Mallee poreless face
defender I've talked about this quite
often in my like Emily awards videos but
this is a clear product here so totally
clear and it's kind of like the texture
of maybe a I don't know a clear
deodorant or something but not as greasy
this is not a greasy product but you
take your sponge I like to twist it on
there so I know I'm picking up some
product and then I can blot this over my
face to completely refresh to take away
the look of oiliness to just basically
touch up the skin minimize pores but
you're not putting any extra powder on
your face
so a touch-up product that is the main
way I use this if you feel like you're
touching up with powder and you're not
looking better after that powder
touch-up but you're looking dry this
would be a good thing to use one thing I
want to be clear about with this though
and no pun intended because it is clear
but this product is not like a hydration
product even though your you can put it
on and it kind of restarts your your
look and it doesn't look dry it's not
something that's going to like put
hydration back in your skin so I've
talked about like the elf daily moisture
stick and using that to rehydrate the
under-eye area that's a product with a
lot of hydration it's just something I
would use all over the face if I tend to
get oily I'm and maybe blot it over my
t-zone I'm going to be able to look at
my face and say I can't see a trace of
powder on top of my skin but yet I'm not
seeing pores and I don't look oil
alright number seven let's talk coverage
this is long wearing foundation full
coverage foundation absolutely full
coverage foundation by the way I hate it
when brand say this product is full
coverage and it's not full coverage this
is it's Estee Lauder Double Wear I
really think this is the ultimate if you
are looking for the foundation that will
cover cover cover almost taking you to
the point where you don't even need a
powder on top of it it will minimize
your need for concealers on my biggest
days where it's most important for the
foundation to look flawless and I don't
want it to change as the day
goes on this is the thing I go fee and
it really put coverage in a new
perspective for me you know when I when
I saw how full coverage this was I
thought oh that's what that means
I got a note for number eight I've got
to give a mention to the double wear
concealer because I have been kind of
going through a big concealer testing
phase here I feel like especially on the
under eye area because there are a lot
of things I think sometimes we just come
to expect that concealers are going to
settle into the lines look more obvious
by day's end and whatever but this
concealer I've really noticed that this
does not seem to crease like the others
do it seems to just stay looking fresh
regardless of where you put it this can
be absolute maximum coverage for problem
areas like scars just this like pinpoint
areas if you name it if you've got a big
issue to cover it can do that but if you
also want to use this on under-eye
darkness I find that it does very well
without creasing that's definitely one
of the most prominent concerns about
under-eye concealer is it starts looking
bad in just a little while after I put
it on this one really along with the
foundation stays looking fresh number
nine another truly unique product and
this is from the bare minerals line I've
talked about it before but it is the
line of multitasking minerals known as
bisque well rested is kind of in that
category and then you've got bisque
summer bisque and so on into deeper
shades well rested is going to be your
light shade that's the one I just picked
up here and this is going to be kind of
an eye brightening shade this is a
powder product you can use it really
lightly I like to use it as light as
possible with like this big fluffy
crease type brush and just use hardly
any you're gonna find this area become
mattified and more perfective I also use
just the summer bisque if I've got
something elsewhere on my face I want to
add a little added coverage to more I
feel like it's not necessarily the kind
of thing I need every single day
especially if you're bringing in these
bad boys who just want that little extra
boost of coverage or you've got a lot of
you know subpar concealers everything
well I guess I'll use them up this could
be a nice little enhancement applied on
top of them too
proof staying power improved coverage
just make sure you don't overuse it
really go for the least amount possible
like I said the bisque the summer
bisko's are gonna be more skintone
shades this is gonna be more of a
brightener when used around the last
thing and this is an all-star brush in
my collection and this is the Sigma f80
brush I just cleaned it and it is still
kind of damp but basically this is a
flat top brush that you can use to buff
in your foundation I like to use this
with liquid or cream foundation what's
special about it is first off the
surface area on this brush is kind of
big you know see how much room that kind
of takes up on my face so I feel like
when you apply this you're gonna find
two things it gets the the foundation
applied so evenly on the skin because it
is kind of a large brush and also it
goes by pretty fast the job gets done
pretty quickly because this covers
everything gives you the flawless look
none of the Sigma brushes work in
circular motions quite like this one
does because they've got a whole line of
these brushes and different cuts and
shapes and they're nice I mean it's same
great quality of the fibers and what
note this is the one for me that can
really buff in foundation and make it
look natural even no chance of splotches
I mean and it can really you know the
edge of this the fact that it's just you
know flat cut the edge really can you
know get around the eye and I've used a
lot of comparable brushes out there and
there are a lot of good ones but in my
opinion this one's the best right that's
all I got that's my top ten high-end
products worth trying this would be the
third edition of this video that I've
done since 2008 so I hope you liked it
forget I have my dirt cheap products
we're trying all under three dollars if
you want to give that video a look and
I'll see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
