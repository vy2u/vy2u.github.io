last video I talked about a whole lot of
different high-end products all
different kinds of products from the
face to the eyes to the lips and talked
about those high-end items that I think
are a little overrated and actually have
a low cost alternative that might even
be better and then I thought what about
a video about those high-end items that
I really think are worth the money so
that's what I'm gonna talk about I've
got a little grouping of them here and
there's not a lot products that I rely
on they serve kind of a special function
it was almost like I looked around at
other things in my collection and I
really didn't find anything that
compared or came close so that's where
I'm coming from with this feel like
having a salmon II coloured creamy
concealer is a great thing to have for
the under eye area because it's not
gonna dry you out and make you look
really crepey under this area but it is
going to have the coverage to get rid of
those dark almost bluish tone circles so
a couple that I wanted to suggest that I
do really like and this might just be
preference with brands or whatever but
there's Bobby Brown corrector in bisque
which I have loved I want to see how
much I loved it
yeah pretty much all gone but it has
that perfect peachy tone and then I like
benefit erased paste my shade is medium
if you're looking for a value I think
these both perform a lot alike but any
race pace you get a little more product
in here so um I like them a lot and I
find that you know on those days when
you've got a lot of Darkness going on
maybe right there in that inner corner
these conceal it very well in fact I did
use some array space today
there's a really unique product from
laura geller called balance and bride
and i know i've referenced this before
this is the small size I have a large
size as well but this is a really
interesting product now this is a baked
powder it's not a mineral powder but
just a powder it actually began as a
cream and then it was baked and you get
this sort of an effect so yes this is
powder right here you can see it's got a
lot of like yellowish tone to it as well
and I find that to be very corrective
when I put this on my shade is is
regular by the way and there's not a lot
of shades to choose from I know they've
recently introduced porcelain which is
even lighter than their former lightest
shades so if you've got really light
skin maybe check back in with laura
geller and see if that options available
for you but what I like about it so much
is that I feel like when I put it on my
skin truly is balanced and that the skin
tone is very evened out and it is
brightened I don't get it this is not a
shimmery product yet just the whole tone
of your skin is kind of revived I like
that this can be used alone an ultimate
summertime combo might be to put on some
tinted moisturizer and then buff this
all over your face or if you want a
really flawless high coverage look put
on your foundation and then put some of
this on nobody's gonna see any of your
problems after that so great coverage
great product I think it's totally worth
it from laura geller oh yeah and it
lasts a really long time this is my
small one and I still haven't hit the
pan they're very light and domed up like
this so it takes a while to get through
I talked about this bronzer a lot I
think you guys can probably guess what
it is it involves chocolate too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer oh my gosh ah
it smells so good I swear I'm not only
recommending this for the smell though I
mean this is a matte deep bronzer so
this can be your contour product or this
can be used with a big brush lightly all
over your face for a nice glow but I
love it for that reason because I feel
like there are matte bronzers out there
there are some great ones like NYC sunny
and stuff like that but they are very
light for those of us that maybe are
medium too even a little more tan
complexions
but you still want something that can
provide a contour for your skin this is
really really nice and it's just I mean
it's totally matte you're not getting
any sparkle if you use this as your
contour it will look very natural but it
also has that added touch of smelling
delicious
another base product that I really enjoy
is from bareMinerals and I do have a
whole video on how I use this but this
is a product called summer bisque
it's a multitasking mineral it could be
used alone kind of like a mineral
concealer but what I love to do for
great coverage on the under eye you
could take the erase paste or the Bobbi
Brown like I mentioned dab that on the
under eye area and set it with this or
take those cheaper concealers that
haven't really been you know what you
thought was good enough coverage for you
top it off with this and it just
modifies the area so much and really
cancels out any opportunity for those
circles to come through so I love this
and I love that it has allowed me to use
concealers that I thought were lesser
quality
and still you know be able to get a good
look with them I love this product from
lorac and yes it is pronounced lorac oh
sorry L called perfectly lit and the
shade I have is called spot light and
this is awesome for being a highlight
that is not too crazy light glittery and
whatever you know I mean so often they
snow seem like you know you're just a
ball of shimmer after you put them on
this is great because you can put it on
and it practically provides some strange
amount of coverage when you use it and
it still gives you that little bit of a
glow I mean if you look at it on my
finger here you can there is some glow
but there's not that much and it seems
to just have a little bit of coverage
and I love that about it I think it's a
unique product I know I have mentioned
Physicians Formula happy booster
translucent powder as being kind of
close to this the one difference is that
this is a little more golden whereas
that came off with a little more of a
cool
pinky tint so keep
four eyes I mean we think of different
eyeshadows of course here and there
there are different shadows where I
think oh this is totally one-of-a-kind I
love this but one product as a whole
that I think the Mallee brand has really
done a great job with are the ever color
shadow sticks and what these are are a
cream shadow that is truly long wearing
and can be used actually on its own
without topping it off with another
product and the shades that she's come
up with a really gorgeous so she's got a
great you know rainbow of colors there I
love you know this shade called saddle
shimmer it's awesome I mean they're very
pretty the way they go on and there are
some deep smoky shades there are some
medium shades like I just watched or
there's this light shade called
champagne that is out of this world
pretty shimmery right around that
tearduct it can be gorgeous and so I
love the fact that you can wear them
they are creamy they can be very much
like a one-step product and you don't
have to feel like you must top them off
with a shadow now you can and you can
get different looks and different
effects you know on top of them with
using different colors like for example
taking champagne and using some sort of
colored shadow on top of that could give
a really pretty look so be creative but
realize that these are very long wearing
cream shadow products
by only a lip product that I think is
really unique and I just love it so much
and it's the buxom lips from bare
essentials and this is a small size the
large size is actually much taller this
is the one I have on right now and the
shade is Denise and it's a light pink
but I like these plumping lip glosses
because they don't burn your lips in
fact they give off kind of a cooling
effect like they feel a little bit minty
on your lips so I like them
I know plumpers aren't for everybody and
they do have a little bit of thickness
to them but they also wear a really long
time as well so for staying power for
the cute colors they have and just for
the fact that I feel like it does fill
up my lips without any stress on me
they're really great so thank you so
much for joining me for this video make
sure if you haven't watched it yet to
check out my video of the high-end
products and their low cost alternatives
so you have an idea of what things you
can save some money on as well so thanks
for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
