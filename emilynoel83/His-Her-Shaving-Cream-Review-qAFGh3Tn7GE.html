good day today we are going to each be
reviewing our own product which is it
kind of a new thing for Tyler right this
is my first one first product review for
him and but our products are sort of
connected they're both the be luscious
shaving cream for her and for him Tyler
you slit him and basically it's a four
ounce tub of shaving cream but it's not
your typical shaving cream because they
say like after you use it you should be
able to rub it into your skin for added
moisturization and it's just more of a
moisturizing agent than it is so much a
pure shaving cream type of thing and I'm
going to start off and do the women's
first ok ladies first um this is says
for normal shaving ideal for the bikini
area and that says use warm we're not
immature it says these warm water only I
don't you don't need to use any other
kind of soap um oops we're running
longer we're back we're back Tyler went
and got the battery thingy so we're all
plugged in and ready to go now so saving
the day Nicole is saving the day uh
where were we what was I you talking to
shaving products yes the be luscious
shaving cream for her that's that was
the one we were on right now and um yeah
basically i would say on my body i'm
kind of strange because i think my legs
are more sensitive than my face actually
is you know like i have usually don't
have a lot of issues with sensitive skin
on my face or getting irritated with
moisturizers and things like that but I
do get tend to get more irritated with
heavily fragranced shaving creams and
body lotions when I use them on my legs
and obviously I think a lot of that
comes from shaving you know you've
shaved and you know maybe there's
there's Nick's here and there and things
like that but you also have the ingrown
hair is you and all that stuff so um
yeah you may be more prone to being
sensitive on your legs kind of like I am
so I was a little you know wondering
about this because to smell the product
it is a wonderfully scented products
kind of that floral scent to it so very
very pleasant I really actually love the
scent and so you got it in this tub and
the consistency um Tyler will talk about
if it's different for the guys but this
is kind of like a really light whipped
mousse but kind of a moisturizing moose
wouldn't you say like the same thing to
me yeah yours is maybe I think yours is
a little bit thicker maybe than mine and
yours is green too but anyways um oh
shoot the memory card oh hey Rachel
how's it going doing good alright guys
we is the last time you swear this is
the last time we're trying this because
we have had the battery on the camera
what ran out the memory card fill up and
right when we were getting ready to
start something cold so I got a phone
call so anyway we are totally ready to
go now I do everyone I remember what I
was talking about though I was talking
about the kind of the consistency of the
shaving cream it's really unique because
it is more moisturizing with normal
phones you know you're dealing with
something either really light or
sometimes the gels that turn into foam
and they're thick and sometimes you know
they don't it doesn't wash right idea
razor always super easily this is not
like that it is not incredibly thick but
it does have a wonderful scent it your
razor will glide right along and my legs
felt really really smooth afterwards and
it was more than just smooth from
shaving but smoothness from being
moisturised the only thing I had to say
is I typically shave my legs in the
shower and so therefore this is going to
be in the shower and this is a screw off
lid and so what I mean you can probably
understand what the obstacle is going to
be there you know we got water coming
down maybe not a great place in your
shower to sit this in terms
yeah and then this is like you take this
off because you're dipping back into it
and then water kind of gets in there so
that is my only thing is with the
packaging however if you're taking a
nice leisurely I don't know just shaving
your legs and maybe not showering or
something I think this to be fine for
that like I said it's something that you
don't necessarily need water to you to
use they say so um but anyway did not
irritate my skin and that was probably
my biggest concern so that's what I have
to say what about your step well um I
think the consistency of it and the
texture is pretty much the same you
couldn't know um it's not foaming it's
more of its kind of like a whipped like
if you were whipping a really light
light frosting or something whipped
cream yes a totally whipped cream yeah
but it smells as like I'm menthol kinda
yeah it smells basically like like vicks
vapor a little bit yeah but kind of like
with a minty like that Mindy twist what
you get with that is it had a really
cool tingly feeling on the face and I
really like that and your face is very
very smooth yeah I didn't really take it
easy on it either i did about a week's
worth a facial hair goes it doesn't do
some work and it did a good job I liked
it so it was I mean do you have
sensitive skin like for guys yeah usual
have some irritation after i shave but
really have any with this so had kind of
that soothing feel I mean I think that's
great I think that's really great and
again there is a special deal going on
with these right now on the be luscious
website in terms of if you're thinking
about maybe getting the his and hers you
can get a special deal had the details
on that in the sidebar but keep in mind
fathers days coming up and if you wanted
to get them guide of a unique gift I
mean you know maybe are something to
toss in with another gift that you're
giving him this is a really nice product
would your dad like that i imagining
what it felt really good we don't talk
about shaving very often hey i don't
have a lot of Congress
to the amount of shavings are really
neat products and I think if you are a
sensitive skin person you don't have to
worry with these so thank you guys so
much for watching and thanks to Tyler
for taking the time to it to review the
product and think about it and then come
on and do the video I think people
really appreciate that I hope so well
thank you guys so much for watching have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
