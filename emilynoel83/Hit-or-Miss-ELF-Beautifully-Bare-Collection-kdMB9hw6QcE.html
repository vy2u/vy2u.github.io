I'm going to be talking about the newest
collection from elf
they sent me their new beautifully bear
stuff and so this consists of a serum
foundation or foundation serum with SPF
25 there are a couple of cream blushes
I've got this little blending brush and
also there are two different mascaras in
this line so I used pretty much all of
this I just used one of the blush shades
and as far as other things I pulled into
this look I tried to keep it super
minimal because I really wanted to stick
to the beautifully bare concept and give
you a good idea of the type of look you
would get with only these things I did
that in a concealer a little bit of
powder I did my brows and I used a
little bit of a brightener in the lower
inner rim that's all that I added in and
I still feel like I have a pretty bear
look going on you know hmm
and also as many of you guys know if you
watch my videos a characteristic I like
in foundations is coverage so I mean
that is something I enjoy but that's not
really something I can compare to this
you know this claims to be that really
light barely-there makeup look I think
for me it's a matter of thinking okay as
far as lightweight makeup looks go do I
like this how well do the products
perform so let's jump in and get to it I
don't know what that little move is
about but let's get going the first
thing the foundation serum this
packaging wise is just the same size and
shape same kind of pump basically as
some of their primers it also has the
SPF 25 sunscreen it says my shade is
light and this is SuperDuper liquidy so
you pump it out like onto a finger be
prepared for it to nearly run off your
finger with one pump but I did kind of
try to stick to basically one pump all
over the face I just dabbed it all over
and I used the blending brush to
basically buff it out all over my skin I
will expand on that blending brush in a
moment but as far as the foundation goes
you know it has kind of a silky soft
feel to it I was looking at the end
Radiance I noticed it does contain
dimethicone as one of the main
ingredients higher up on the list and
that is something in a lot of primers
that gives them that silky soft feel so
I could definitely sense that in this
product it blended out easily with the
brush but it also goes on very easily
with fingers as well overall finish that
I get from this they claim that it's
kind of a dewy look I didn't really get
that feel from it and I thought it was
maybe a sort of satin semi matte finish
actually I didn't pick up on a lot of
glow from this product and I'm kind of
glad for that actually because I have
sort of normal to combo skin the combo
side of my skin is coming out a little
more as we get more heat and humidity
happening all the times I've worn this
even though it starts not seeming super
glowy at the end of the day I really do
notice some oil on my forehead in my
nose area something they also say in the
claims about this though is that it's
buildable and so I thought I would
demonstrate that for you by adding a
little extra product to the under eye
area and around my nose just some places
where there might be a little
discoloration a little redness I think
it built up a little more coverage but
not much I mean again this is the
thinnest thinnest foundation possible
and I would definitely say it gives
light coverage it also claims to
minimize the appearance of pores and
fine lines but I really disagree with
that I put this all over and I get an
up-close look at my skin and I can
definitely see more pores like I feel
like it almost exaggerated the pores
like sunk into them a little bit more
around the sides of my nose so it
applies easily I like that it has the
SPF in it it's a pretty good skin tone
match for me if not on the verge of just
being a little light like the pump style
to the packaging but for the overall
look I just like I said I personally
like a little more coverage but even as
far as light coverage products go I
thought it just sort of sunk into the
places where it wasn't supposed to and I
honestly think that you just have to
have pretty darn perfect skin to put
just this on and feel like okay I'm good
you know so that leads me to concealer
but first I do want to talk about this
blending brush which is what I used for
the foundation this little thing I love
um
love the shape of it you can see it's
got a little different design to the
ferrule see how it's got notches on each
side and that's what's giving it that
fan shape kind of reminds me of that
massive it cosmetics fan brush but just
downsize to something really manageable
that I think is very easy to use I
actually like using this with foundation
because you can take that little tip and
get around the eyes very easily as
you'll see in a bit I use this for blush
it worked well there it can also be
great for contouring as well cream or
powder and I think this cut and size of
a brush is something that a lot of
people probably don't already have in
their collection so if you're looking
for a little something different to
experiment with you might give it a go
I've already got quite a few synthetic
buffing foundation brushes that I really
enjoy using but if you're like me you
kind of go through a bit of a rotation
with those brushes you know they get
dirty you set them aside till it's time
to wash them you pull in you know your
backups your second string if you will
and so this will probably go into that
rotation for me I really enjoyed this
this was one of the highlights of this
whole collection for me if not the best
thing to come out of this but as far as
the face routine goes I did want to add
in a little bit of concealer because I
thought you know realistically if I'm
going out of the house with this look I
would add in some concealer and this was
not part of the line this is from
covergirl I used a little concealer balm
stick and just went around the under eye
and a little bit around the nose those
would be two zones where I just want the
little bit extra coverage so I blended
that out and then having worn this serum
foundation and as I mentioned seeing it
kind of break down and get a little
greasy on the t-zone I did go over the
center part of my face with some ben nye
cameo powder just a really lightweight
powder that I think helps the staying
power of this product a bit dry skin
folks may not want to even add any
powder to this but I think if your combo
to pretty oily you're going to want to
do that then we move on to these cream
blushes and they're in the shades peach
perfection which is a peach with a very
very subtle golden shimmer to it
honestly it doesn't show up much on the
skin but if you're looking really close
at the product in the packaging you can
see that and then this one is called
rose Roy
see it's just a creamy pink these are
described as a unique cream to powder
blush it's weightless formula is infused
with argan oil and vitamin E to help
nourish and hydrate the skin and they
say you can use your fingers a brush or
a sponge to apply it and also I noticed
on the website they said it can double
as a lip product now I think there
actually is a lip product in this
beautifully bare line but I checked
online and it is currently out of stock
and that wasn't sent to me either so I
did take him up on that little
suggestion and used the peach both on
the cheeks and the lips
what's strange to me and I don't know if
anybody else noticed this who has both
of these I feel like they're two
different consistencies if you
blindfolded me and had me like put my
finger in each one I'd be like those are
two different formulas because the Rose
royalty I think has a rather waxy feel
to it and I actually kind of struggled
to blend this out on my skin I mean
maybe it has a little bit of a cream to
powder thing going on feels pretty thick
it was a little bit of a struggle to
pick up with the brush not today because
I was using the peach but a different
day when I was wearing this I just
didn't think it blended out well on the
skin I even had a little trouble
swatching it the peach I found to be
much more silky and texture a little bit
thinner in consistency and more of that
cream to powder texture that they
described so for the application I just
dabbed into this with the blending brush
and that was provided and swept that on
the cheeks I thought it transferred onto
the cheeks pretty nicely gave me a nice
very soft peachy color you know these
are subtle look so that definitely
brought a little life to the skin and
then I dabbed into it with my finger and
just used it also as my lip color from a
distance it looks alright as a lip color
I don't know if I'd necessarily
recommend using this as a lip color
because as you look closely at my lips
my goodness do they look dry because
this cream to powder thing it doesn't
really translate well to the lips I
think as far as this beautifully bare
line goes the peach blush was pretty
good as far as cream blushes throughout
my collection I don't love it the eyes
um this is truly just a mascara look I
mean when I was using the serum
foundation I think I miss
some of that over the eye area but I
wanted to keep it basically bare because
this line didn't include any sort of eye
product beyond the mascaras so did the
brows and as I'm looking up close at
this I feel like I'm seeing a little bit
of a little transfer already of some of
that lower lash mascara and that was one
of my gripes about this that I noticed
when I was wearing this before but it
took like a full day for it to get down
there the other day now it's really
transferred quickly anyway two mascaras
in this line one is the defining mascara
one is the lash tint mascara the
defining is more of just a rubber brush
like a traditional mascara and the lash
tint is a very very super skinny brush
it's actually the same size as the new
NYX skinny mascara which I reviewed on
the Express channel both are designed to
give a natural look and just to
demonstrate them both today I used the
defining what was it called the defining
mascara gets on the upper lashes and I
used the lash tint on the lower lashes
so starting with the defining mascara I
do really like the brush it's not too
big and it is kind of tapered toward the
tip it's not a super unique brush it's
got a lot of bristles they're kind of
short but I thought this did a really
fantastic job of actually defining each
lash not really clumping them together
lengthening them out somewhat I mean the
look is overall I think still pretty
natural I've not had great luck with any
elf mascaras that I've ever tried and
this one I thought did a really nice job
and I was reading up on this online and
they said like apply it to one eye go to
the other eye and then if you want
another coat go back and it gives it
like just enough time to get nearly set
to where it builds on itself a little
better and so I thought when I went back
for another coat that's when I really
saw some great lengths happening and I
was just really impressed with the
overall look of that I have worn this on
the lower lashes like the lash tint it
does transfer down below on me so
neither of these are really going to be
candidates for the lower lash line but
this lash tint is exactly that I mean
this does not add any length to my
lashes I've worn it
the upper lashes I've even tried this is
like a primer under that other mascara
and I didn't love that effect first off
I really thought it straightened out the
curl when I wore it on my upper lashes
but also it doesn't add any length like
it really is just darkening up the color
of your lashes today I just put a little
bit on the lower lashes so you can kind
of see it in action not thrilled about
it because again I know it transfers but
just not something I would recommend I
think there are better tiny mascara
wands on the market that can do a better
job for you so I don't know guys what do
you think this is the finished look that
you end up with when you pretty much
just stick to the products in this line
you know it is lightweight serum
foundation is what I would classify as
light coverage it's a barely-there type
of look if you generally need to use a
concealer to cover up certain things I
think you're still going to need to grab
for that concealer when you're using
that foundation now it is so thin and
has that really nice slip across the
skin I've used it as a primer and have
liked it and that may be the way I
continue getting use out of this product
because I did like the way other
foundations went on on top of it and I
thought you know staying power actually
ended up being pretty decent when I've
done that it's not going to be the kind
of thing that I'm raving about or
wanting to repurchase the blushes again
nothing outstanding as far as the world
of cream blushes goes but I thought the
formula of the peach was better than the
Rose gives it pretty look to the cheeks
but it's the kind of look that's very do
pible you know what I mean makeup
marketplaces not hurting for peach
blushes that kind of look is out there
the mascaras like I said the lash tint
was kind of a dud for me but really did
enjoy the defining mascara I would say
the defining mascara and this blending
brush were the two highlights of this
collection for me because I think this
blending brush is just really unique
it's versatile even for as many brushes
as I have in my collection I didn't
already own something like this so I
really like is so soft very very dense
with this video I just wanted to give
you a closer look at everything in this
beautifully bear Collection thank you to
elf for sending me this stuff so I could
try it all out for you as we all know
makeup works
a little differently for every person so
what didn't work for me could very well
still work for you but these are just
the products I've been testing lately
and wanted to report my findings to you
so thank you for watching guys and I'll
see you later
