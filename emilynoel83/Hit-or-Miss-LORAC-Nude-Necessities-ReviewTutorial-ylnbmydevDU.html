in this video I'm talking about one of
those products where you know there are
some purchases where you'll just jump at
the chance to get the thing it just
instantly speaks to you you know you
want it you just go after it and then
there are other things that you keep
kind of looking back on you're like do I
need that I don't know it doesn't excite
me very much and then you just kind of
end up with okay I'll buy it that's the
way I felt about this product and I
would say my opinion has changed
somewhat as I've continued to use it and
I'm talking about this newest eyeshadow
palette from lorac it's called new
necessities this is what the box looks
like and you're thinking oh great
yes tell me about another nude eyeshadow
palette well this one it's kind of funny
when I first opened it up I was looking
over all the shades and I thought wow
it's kind of lacking some really deep
dark shades and then I about wanted to
smack myself and say no this is the one
palette that's come out that has nude in
the name and it actually looks nude you
know it doesn't have those are really
dark smoky colors and it's gonna really
keep your eye look in a very nude
natural naturally contoured looking zone
so let's talk specifics I'm gonna shine
up my palette here for a second online
pyjama pants you can end up with a lot
of fingerprints on this one it's kind of
like a gunmetal mirrored finish and then
it has a nicely sized mirror on the
inside really love that and then you've
got your four eight twelve shadows in
here I'm just gonna point out the
finishes real quick and then show you
the swatches but the matte shades that
you're working with in this palette are
this white a slightly like off-white
beige just below that right in here you
go a little bit deeper than that color
on the outside you've got a matte warm
Brown right over here a matte cooler
brown and then this matte very soft
brown up in the top corner this one is
so close to seeming like a satin finish
I almost can't decide which one it is
like if I see a really concentrated
swatch I might think that's a satin
shadow but it really performs like a
matte on the lids these two soft taupe
colors are I think like textbook satin
Finn
nothing at all metallic about them but
just a little more Sheen than a matte
shadow and then your shimmery shadows
these two up here you've got a golden
champagne a little bit deeper more
classic gold down here a shimmery peach
and then a little bit deeper shimmery
peach paper why did that come out funny
anyways the shadows I think swatch
really nicely they do remind me of the
classic feel of lorac eyeshadows some of
the mattes and don't seem quite as rich
just in the texture to touch them with
your hands they don't seem quite as rich
it's like a regular lorac Pro palette
would but I still feel like they perform
very much the same on the ice and as you
look at the swatches they are one swipe
swatches I'm trying to just create some
level of consistency with you know the
way they're going on so all of these I
just swirl my finger in each shade and
then swiped it once on my arm when
you're going into any of these shadows
with a brush you will notice which is
pretty typical of lorac shadows you dip
a brush in they do kick up a little bit
of powder not all of them kick up a lot
but just something to be ready for and
definitely tap off the excess as you
start to apply them like I said the
start nothing in this palette goes too
dark I mean these shades would be your
deepest ones and they're nothing more
than medium Browns you know one a little
bit cooler one a little bit warmer and
so what I think this lends itself to is
a super natural looking eye look that's
just going to mimic the natural contours
of your eyes the natural shadows that
you know your crease creates and that
kind of thing you're not gonna be
creating a major major contrast you're
not gonna be using these shades as
liners you know there is some
versatility that goes out the window
when you're lacking really deep in dark
shades however you do definitely have
some differences in tone to work with I
look at the top and I think you know
this contains some more golden shades
then you've got really a cool taupe Iiro
and then more of a warm Brown going into
peach type Road you can get different
looks with this but maybe the pattern
that you use to apply them on your eyes
isn't going to be drastically different
because you know your crease shades are
probably going to be one of these two or
three colors down in here but you could
easily create a
Matt look or pull in one of the pups of
shimmer so who is this pallet for I
would say if you're a person who grabs
your eyeshadow palettes and you never
find yourself using the darkest colors
this palette might be for you if you
work in a professional environment where
you want your eyeshadow looks on a daily
basis to look super natural nothing
overdone this palette might be for you I
feel like I'm doing a Jeff Foxworthy you
might be a redneck here but there is a
crowd out there who I think would really
appreciate this palette and it's the
people who just like these super natural
looks every day I think even if you are
a hardcore mat user I don't think you'd
be to put off by the shimmers in this
because they're not too loud now another
thought is for a naturally contoured
look like they talk about the shade +
light eye palette from Kat Von D as
being an eye contour palette
well that contains some really deep deep
dark colors as well that could double as
liners or maybe you just like using
darker shadows I do think that palette
gives you a lot of versatility I love
that palette I love that palette more
than I love this palette but I can also
realize that not everyone wants or needs
the dark dark shadows some problems with
this palette might be the fact that the
shades are not very uncommon at all you
know you probably have a lot of colors
like this either in singles within other
palettes if you have a big eyeshadow
collection there's nothing really like
wow that's just off the charts different
but that's not what this palette really
sets out to be so I don't hold it
against it so much and I do think some
people might find a lot of convenience
and having all of these shades
altogether another possible problem as
I've talked about like contouring your
eye and stuff like that if you've got a
really rich skin tone or a very deep tan
skin tone I wonder if these medium brown
shades would provide you enough contrast
you know what I'm saying like you might
get a nice pop out of one of these
champagne colors those are really pretty
very vibrant but when you're looking for
contrast would those be enough I would
love to hear your feedback if you've got
a deeper skin tone pick this up did this
do enough for you but if you're my skin
tone
a little darker a little lighter I think
it could be right on the money for
creating a natural-looking crease so
that being said I'm going to cut to my
little demo where I show you how I use
it
first off I'm just applying a base I'm
using this city proof stick from NYC
it's you know claims to be like
colorless base but it does do a little
bit of neutralizing as you can see on
the lid so I get it on the lid kind of
pull it up through the crease as well so
you have that protection from creasing
I'm going to use this kind of warm matte
Brown in my crease so I'll go into that
with my e25 brush from sigma tap off
some excess there and just start wedging
this right in my crease
then right next to that there's a
shimmery peach so I'm gonna pick that up
with my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow brush
and I'll just Pat that all over the lid
and this shade right here can be a
really vivid highlight if you want it to
I'm gonna apply a pretty sheer with my
e-40 brush just up under the brow it's
definitely not like a glittery frosty
shade but it does have some shimmer but
I just like to use it lightly so it just
catches the light a little bit I'm also
gonna use just a little angled brush and
you know any small detail type brush
would work here and I'm just taking it
right around the innermost corner I
think it provides a lot of brightness
there and then I'm gonna just pick up a
little bit of that shade on my finger
and I'm gonna give it a little dab on
the center of the lid and then with the
bear finger just kind of dad back over
that then I'm gonna take one of these
satiny finish taupe shades with a pencil
brush and I'm just going to take that
across the lower lash line I want it to
be like an undetectable little bit of
super soft definition down there that's
kind of what I'm going for and one other
thing that you can do if you want to
like deepen up the crease just a little
bit more I was just kind of playing
around on the other eye and I used this
exact blend a thirty-two from Sigma
something like a Sonia Kashuk small
shadow brush could do this also but I'm
going back into this shade but because
this is a little bit smaller brush you
can get a bit more impact from that
color and I just kind of wedge that
right out here in my just the outermost
corner and you can get a little more
depth
and then I'm going to use my Milani
shadow eyes and almond cream and I'm
just going to do a quick sweep of that
on the lower inner rim and then I'm
using this Physicians Formula I booster
pin is actually a very fine brush tip I
find it very easy to use and very
similar to the Kat Von D tattoo liner so
I'm just going to go all the way across
the lash line here
and I'm just gonna give the lashes a
quick curl and for just a more natural
look all around the other day I just
skipped the liner applied only this
mascara and my lashes still looked you
know nice and lengthened out but I'm
gonna add a false lash on top of this
today so that's why the liners they're a
little clump crusher water-resistant on
the lower lashes
in my huda beauty lashes in Samantha I'm
just gonna pop those on and I'll be
right back so I realize this isn't maybe
the most cut and dry review I guess my
overall thought is that this is a nice
palette I like it better than I did when
I was just thinking I saw it on the
website will I buy will I go for it I've
been very happy with the looks that I've
created I do feel like I can come up
with different looks in different tones
today I went warmer I've gone cooler
with other looks and I've been very
happy with those also like I was saying
before I think there's a specific crowd
for this palette and it's the people who
like a they're neutrals be there light
to medium shades and see maybe you just
got a reason day after day to be wearing
a very natural understated muted but
still pretty eye looks anyway that's my
take on the nude necessities palette I
would love to open this up for
discussion in the comments section let
me know what you think about this thing
and I will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
