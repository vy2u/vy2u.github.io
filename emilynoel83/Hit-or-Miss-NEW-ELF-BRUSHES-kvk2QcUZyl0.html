some new brushes from ELF these were
sent to me recently and they are $6
brushes so double the price of the
regular Studio line brushes but they are
a little different in that you'll see
they have this kind of two-tone fiber
going on here they are really really
soft I will say the cut of all of them
seems very nice very consistent you're
not seeing like little stray hairs
poking up and as I've been using these
over the past about week and a half I
have not experienced any shedding with
these and they seem to be constructed
pretty nicely as well so I can't really
complain about the way they're put
together I think for me it's more a
question of are these worthwhile like do
these have a place in my current brush
routine where I already have so many
different brushes to choose from and so
many brushes that I like even from elfs
own line you know I've got brushes that
I feel like are currently doing the job
I wasn't really looking for more and a
couple of these brushes have the term
selfie ready in the title which I find
to be very gimmicky and kind of annoying
so I'm kind of like cringe when I say
that but whatever we can get past the
title I suppose I've got the selfie
ready foundation blurring brush I also
have the selfie ready powder blurring
brush the sculpting face brush for
contouring and the flawless face brush
so the way I want to review these is
just kind of talk about each one as I
show you different application methods
with them so the first one we're going
to talk about is this foundation
blurring brush one thing I do think is
lacking from the design of the brush is
just the name written on the outside I
think that'd be helpful the ferrule is
not pinched in at all at the top so very
rounded in that way
extremely tapered all the way around the
brush size wise it reminds me so much of
my Real Techniques buffing brush and
except it's more tapered up besides
you've got more like shorter lengths
leading up to the longest lengths in the
center whereas this brush is a little
bit tapered around the edges but not as
much down the sides now I use this to
apply my foundation and because of that
taper that's a little more steep it's
not maybe the most ideal brush for
buffing and circular motions I feel
like a flat top brush or a brush that
doesn't have quite as much taper like
that buffing brush from Real Techniques
can do that job just a little bit more
seamlessly this really may be a little
bit better just in terms of sweeping
across the skin not necessarily doing
that circular buffing but it did a good
job with my foundation I really thought
it blended everything out evenly rather
quickly I would say I like this brush I
could see it being used to blend out
like larger patches of concealer on your
skin or even applying you know a contour
cream or powder but just in terms of the
shape and size it is pretty similar to a
lot of different brushes that are out
there now like it's just not an
extremely unique cut if you really got
to looking through your collection I
think you would find maybe some brushes
you already have from brands like Sigma
Real Techniques that are nice and soft
like that and a similar shape and size
and kind of perform the same way now the
next brush that I want to talk about is
this sculpting brush and as you can see
there's kind of an interesting little
dip to the cut of this brush it's
definitely a flat brush in terms of not
having any taper down the sides but
they've done this interesting like
little just cut just like a chunk right
out of the brush that is designed to
sort of cup the cheekbone area and my
issue with this is that if I'm going to
pick up product on the whole brush you
know from a powder or a cream and then
apply it to my cheek then I'm getting
contour powder like all the way up high
here you know like higher than I would
want it so when I use with this with the
cream contour I tried to focus it more
toward the bottom part of the brush with
the shorter bristles so that can find my
contour more to the area where I wanted
it after that application I needed to
bring in another brush to help me blend
it out the bristles are just so
concentrated and compact it's going to
be difficult to get a blend with that
kind of a thing so I brought in one of
the other brushes from this line which
is actually the powder blurring brush
and I like the shape of this brush
because it is pinched in a bit at the
ferrule but it's relatively short and
it's very dense when you turn it
sideways it actually really nicely fits
the contour of your cheek so I just use
that to blend out any of my cream
contour that I used all over my face and
I thought it did an awesome job and as
far as this brush goes the sculpting
brush for what this did I
feel like I could have just swiped the
product on with my finger you know and
pretty much got it in the exact place
where I wanted it and really felt for my
cheekbone and all that and then just
brought in a different buffing brush to
blend it all out and just to show you
the difference between this one and the
foundation brush see how the ferrule at
the top you know you're a little more
pinched in over here it kind of widens
the the fan of the bristles and this one
well there is a slight taper on the
sides they stay a bit more uniform in
length and actually I think this blends
out foundation in a buffing manner even
better than the other one and these are
all like the same style of synthetic
brush hairs and so one may be labeled
for foundation but it works better for
something else or this one was labeled
powder and it works maybe better for
foundation that's fine you can use them
any way you want to I know I didn't
demonstrate this with foundation in this
video but I think it works really well
for that as far as an actual application
of powder maybe if you were applying
powder from a powder foundation
standpoint and you really wanted maximum
coverage from something but I'm finding
most of the time I want a lighter
application of powder not something from
a brush like this that's going to give
it such a concentrated application on
the skin but that little bit of narrow
shape that this brush has I love it for
applying contour either cream or powder
I went over my cream contour with a
little bit of powder just to show you
that so this is probably one of my
favorites of the bunch just for the fact
that it's a little different shape than
anything else I have I like how it
applies everything from foundation to
cream or powder contours oh and I almost
forgot it's also nice and just for
gently blending out your concealer
because again the shape of this it can
really get in there around the sides of
the nose surprisingly well now the final
brush is the flawless face brush and I
would see this as kind of a powder brush
multitasker I was really interested when
I saw this as soon as I got it I thought
I'm going to have to bust out my ELF
complexion brush and see how these two
compare because this is kind of my
current like powder multitasker I'll use
it for face powder bronzer contour
occasionally the complexion brush sort
of fans out left to right a little bit
more whereas this one domes upward
somewhat more there honestly both
extremely
soft I feel like my complexion brush is
very soft I've never had any complaints
about that this one just seems to stay a
little bit more domed and compact in
terms of the shape and that can make it
more versatile for the application of
things like highlight and blush which
are a couple of things that I wouldn't
normally use this brush to apply so just
to see it in action for me on my look
today this did an all-over dusting of
like just a little bit of powder to set
my foundation I applied my blush with
this also within my little covergirl
blush there's a bit of a highlight and
due to the slightly more dome nature of
this brush I can use that top tip to
kind of isolate it right there in the
highlight and really get that
application over just a small area so in
a sense I think this is kind of more
versatile than my ELF complexion brush
and I really do like it so just to wrap
this all up you got again your
foundation brush I thought it performed
well you know it did a good job for what
I needed it to do I just don't find it
as a real standout compared to the many
different foundation buffing brushes
that I own the sculpting brush to me I
just don't see this as a major priority
in my collection for what this does like
I said I could do it with my fingers and
then you need another brush to come in
and blend things out anyway so that's
just not a very important brush for me
to have the powder blurring brush is
really one of the stars of this new
collection I think because the shape is
a little bit different just the cut of
it it allows it to do quite a few
different things including the
application of foundation so it's like
it's doing what the foundation brush did
plus I think it really is a nice shape
for getting right in here for contouring
cream or powder and the other one that I
really did like was this flawless face
brush because it reminds me of the
complexion brush just a bit more
downsized it's just got the right amount
of fluff paired with the right cut to
handle like any powder step that you
need to do on your face so I think
that's pretty remarkable so just my
opinion on these brushes if you've been
eyeing them on elfs website I hope this
helped you out and I will see you again
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
