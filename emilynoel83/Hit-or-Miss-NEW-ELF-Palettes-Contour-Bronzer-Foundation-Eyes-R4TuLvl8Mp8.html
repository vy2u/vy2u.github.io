the new stuff that comes out on elfs
website you know that there are a ton of
new palates out in fact there are three
new face palettes and four new eyeshadow
palettes and I went ahead and placed an
order lickety-split on that stuff so I
could test it out and pass along my
reviews to youth I've just gotten so
many questions about all of them I
thought I would just put together my
reviews into one video show you demos
swatches the whole nine yards so if
you're wondering about any of these you
can get all the info here three face
palettes are a foundation a bronzer and
a contouring palette and these are in
the same style as the blush palettes
that came out like about a year or so
ago got the little pans that can pop out
so if you wanted to you know buy up a
bunch of these switch out the shades you
could do something like that and then
the eyeshadow palettes are in more of a
long skinny style this is the everyday
smoky one for example they each contain
ten different shades so I will show you
a little demo using a couple of
different ones in this video and
swatches of all of them today so
starting in with the face palettes and
there's only one of them that comes in
multiple shade options and that is the
foundation palette so I have this in
light - medium you can refer to elfs
website to kind of browse what else is
available where that's concerned again
the pans pop out from the back you just
apply some pressure like with your thumb
on the back side of the palette you can
pry the product out very easily and
switch them around if you wanted to
another thing about these there is a
really good size mirror here so if you
were holding this in front of your face
I mean you can really get your whole
face in there to see and do your makeup
if you wanted to use it that way I don't
really have any complaints in terms of
how well these worked to match my skin
tone because I thought I was able to use
the lighter ones and places where I
wanted to be slightly lighter the deeper
colors everywhere else but don't expect
to have so much contrast in one of these
to wear like you're going to be doing
cream highlighting cream contouring
because I mean at least for my skin tone
there's not enough drastic contrast
between the colors to do something like
that but in terms of the texture the
consistency they're very thin to the
touch and they almost have a little bit
of a greasy feel to them
and that's something that I kind of
remember feeling in the HD mattifying
cream foundation I'm pretty sure that
these are the same kind of formula I
mean I can't say for sure that they're
the exact exact same but if you've tried
this the HD mattifying cream foundation
you'll have an idea of what to expect
with this palette it's that thin
lightweight kind of cream formula as I
put it on the skin I use my sigma f84
brush and just dabbed into the different
ones starting with the lighter ones like
under my eyes and you know just the high
points of my face and then really buffed
in the slightly deeper shades elsewhere
on my face and the coverage is
definitely I think a straight up medium
coverage even when I do try to build
these up a bit more I still don't think
they get to a full coverage place for me
and I have tried this with a sponge as
well and that's a decent way to apply
them you could also swipe in these with
your fingers if you wanted to but
regardless of the method I feel like I'm
not really exceeding medium coverage
with this able to even out general
skintone problems but if you needed to
conceal things with a regular concealer
you're probably still going to need to
do that sun spots freckles I can still
see that kind of thing through this
blemishes to really the deal-breaker for
me on this palette was the staying power
I feel like I have to set the crap out
of this with powder to actually get some
decent staying power as the day goes on
because if I just lightly set it like I
have the first few times I've used this
I feel like the product practically
disappears like I get a close look at my
face and it's not like it was huge huge
coverage to begin with but the staying
power is just not there for me and I
don't have especially oily skin I've got
really pretty normal skin right now
maybe a little oily in the t-zone but
the areas I was even honing in on to see
it staying power wise we're like right
here on my cheek you know and I didn't
feel like I was seeing any more product
today I added in on top of this some
concealer on the under eye area and
anywhere else I needed it I used my Mac
Pro Longwear and then I used my Milani
multitasker powder on top of that so for
me this is just kind of a nothing I
would repurchase moving on to the
bronzer this was something I didn't use
too heavily in this video because I
really wanted to show off the contour
palette as well and if you really wanted
to you could use this bronzer palette in
a contour
fashion also and this just comes in the
one shade who of them are met the ones
that are right here and then you've got
one that's got quite a bit of shimmer in
it a golden e shimmer and then right
down here is a satin finish I feel like
if each of these shades were SuperDuper
pigmented there might be enough
difference between them to constitute
having four different shades of bronzer
and a palette but I don't think they're
quite intense enough and as you see the
swatches it's like wow they don't really
stand out too much one from the next for
the purposes are just warming up my skin
a little bit in this video I used the
satiny finish one and just dusted that
around I did use a mix of the matte
shades and kind of took those down my
neck and decollete area the touch and
you wouldn't think there's any real
quality issues with them it's just that
there's not quite enough of a color
punch for me to make all of these shades
worthwhile you definitely can add a
little bronzy touch to my skin tone
which would be I'd say light to medium
but if you were um tan or richer skin
tone these really wouldn't show up for
you so along with the foundation palette
here's another thing that I really
wasn't too thrilled with wouldn't
repurchase but the tide starts to turn
with the contour palette really really
happy with this one here I think you've
got four distinct products that are all
worth having in the palette and I think
they all perform really well and they're
basically dupes for a product that I
really really love for contouring my
Emily award-winning contour product my
Smashbox palette here the one thing
about this as you might have seen if you
watched my get ready with me video one
of these which I haven't gone ahead and
glued it back in yet I just popped right
out and it wasn't the whole pan you know
from the back popping out but it just
like came unglued so I need to glue that
back in but this one that I'm going to
go ahead and set aside is just a light
cream shade with a little bit of shimmer
and then the remaining three are all
matte this one's kind of a yellowish
toned beige powder your cool tone
contour and then more of a bronzey type
contour those three shades i tell you
i've swatched them right side by side
with my Smashbox palette so so impressed
with the quality of them so
six books yeah I'll take that couple
things to be aware of when you tap your
brush into this light shape for whatever
reason this one kicks up way way more
powder than anything else I didn't
notice that dustiness with the other
ones be aware you only need to barely
tap your brush into that and also this
shimmery shade is not like crazy
glowy shimmery got a little more glow
compared to the other ones just a little
bit though I've got a little bit of this
on my cheeks I wore a matte blush today
so this could kind of stand out you
might be seeing just the tiniest bit of
glow out of this it's very very subtle
so I almost wish that because all this
stuff was matte I wish they would have
put in a highlight that had a little
more punch to it still not complaining
really like the results from this so
I'll show you how I used it I used my
ELF angled studio brush with the cool
tone contour went right there in the
hollows of the cheeks loved the way it
really chiseled them out use that up
around my hairline as well you can
easily go under the jaw with that shade
that would be a nice shade for
contouring the nose as well and then
also the bronze e-1 I like taking this
on the cheeks just above where I use
that deepest contour and also warming up
the whole forehead area I think this
works great for that unable to use this
palette really in the same way i use the
smashbox one and then that light shade
can be nice if you wanted to use that as
an under eye setting powder again use a
very light hand because it can pick up a
lot of product your brush will the
slightest shade really might be the one
that people with fair-skinned find the
most contrast with with their skin tone
because it does give off quite a bit of
color just not a ton of shimmer
now for these eye palettes i want to
start off with the mad format palette
these are all ten color palettes this
one being 100% matte as you can see it's
got a great range of neutrals here going
from you know couple of light highlight
shades some nice mid tones with a brown
kind of a rusty warm brown shade into
some cooler Browns a deep eggplant type
color and then a grey and a near black
charcoal type shade
I was really impressed with the feel of
these they kind of remind me in texture
of the elf mineral shadow singles which
I've really been a fan of over the years
and it kind of seems to me like they've
placed that formula in a 10 color
palette so I'm happy with that I think
these are great basics these palettes
are $10 apiece whereas the other ones
were $6 the face ones these are 10 so I
think that's something to think about
that's a rather high price tag for elf
but I do find this matte palette to be
worth it I've used it in quite a few
different ways this is a nice lineup of
basics that can be used alongside all
sorts of different shimmery looks I
actually did use a couple shades in this
look today and I'll get to that in the
demo this was my favorite out of all of
these elf eyeshadow palettes that I
tried and something that kind of caught
my eye when I first glanced at this it
made me think of the mÃ©tro of the lorac
pro 1 palette so I did go ahead and
swatch some of those underneath not
really so you could identify dupes or
anything but just to sort of see the
overall quality comparison the color
scheme comparison if you already have
the lorac Pro 1 you've already got a
really nice selection of matte neutrals
there so I wouldn't say you need to race
out and get this one but if your
question is could you do the same matte
look with this as you could do with the
matte part of that palette I think you
absolutely could I really think I could
do one eye with this one eye with the
other one and you wouldn't know the
difference
potential video idea I think so I've
already got some things cooking on that
front an area where you might need to
work a little harder with this palette
then Laura let's say would be the
lighter shades there's a little bit
easier color payoff with lorac than this
but still I feel like these work just
fine and I'm very happy with that let's
move on to the party ready palette
that's the other one I have on my eyes
today this one gosh it looks super fun
at a glance you've got bronzy colors and
neutrals then several shades that are
really like berry type grape blueberry
pink shades and then several really dark
and smoky ones unfortunately I was a
little underwhelmed by this palette the
colors in here that you really expect to
pop I just don't think did quite enough
for me I am wearing that true blue
on my lids I've got the pink actually on
my lower lashline you'll see that in
action also and it just you know didn't
quite give me enough something I like
the elf did here is that they did put in
a variety of different textures so like
this peachy shade right here is matte
you've got a couple of mattes right here
in this palette some metallic finishes
some that have a little bit of sparkle
so I love that they want that extra step
to actually give some variety in the
finishes but like I was hoping for so
much more out of this pink shade and I
mean you can see for yourself in the
swatches it's just not quite enough
intensity the other palettes that are
available needed nude this is one that
if you want to see a full demo using
this I use this in my last get ready
with me video but I mean it's a pretty
layout of colors a very kind of sunset
type look here with the bronze II shades
some very yellowish golden colors some
chocolatey Browns a nice mix of matte
and shimmer here because you've got your
light matte highlight shade kind of a
pinky toned matte and then a couple of
nice dark brown mattes
I actually expected a little more
pigmentation in some of these metallics
and just the overall palette to look at
it if you already own a lot of neutral
eyeshadow palettes you're glancing at
this thinking yeah I already got a lot
of that I see this is something yeah I
can get a pretty look out of it but 10
bucks for this I'm not thinking so and
the everyday smoky palette that's what
this one's called I've got a lot of the
same opinions on this one as I do on the
last one not to sound like a broken
record but as with the other palettes
they did do a good job of giving you a
great balance of dark medium and light
and a lot of different finishes I mean
every one of these palettes contains
mattes of course the 100% matte one does
but all the rest do too and I appreciate
that
but like this shade just really really
flaky all over the place I could
absolutely do a good smoky eye with this
but it's kind of like I feel like these
pallets need to bring a little bit
something different you know maybe just
a few different shades thrown in instead
of just the whole monochromatic color
scheme so in competition with everything
else on the market you look at one of
these and think oh I need that because
it's got you know that little different
shade maybe a twist of Burgundy or a
twist of like a four
Green type shade you know something kind
of makes you take a second look at it
that's just my opinion for this I look I
went between two different pallets I
used the party ready and the Med format
palette and I did prime my lids I would
advise priming your eyelids with any
eyeshadow you use and the same goes for
these elf shadows so I used from the
party-ready palette that royal blue
color i padded that all over the lids
didn't give me quite the color payoff I
was hoping for I was wanting just a
little more intensity and then I used
the lightest shade in that palette to
just go around the inner corner and
brighten that up and I used the navy
blue which has some shimmer in this
palette on the outer corner and I
noticed that didn't really pack on much
color I had to build that up quite a bit
in my crease
I used the matte palette and I went to
the sort of dark dusty eggplant color
and then I blended just above that with
the kind of pinky toned beige color
right under the brow I used the light
cream shade as my highlight on the lower
lash line I went back to the party ready
palette and I used the pink with a
smudge brush down along the lower lash
line and I finished the look with black
liquid liner on the upper lash line and
black liner on the lower inner rim
smudging it downwards somewhat to kind
of blend in with that pink so again the
overall thought on these eyeshadow
palettes is that elfs charging $10 for
each of these so I think they really
needed to step up their game I can
absolutely turn out something that I
think I'm gonna like but when I look at
these from the perspective of all the
other shadows I have in my collection
I'm not seeing these as worth the $10
with the exception of the matte palette
which i think was really well done it's
a nice selection of basics and I think
they really did a great job with that
matte texture the other ones as you saw
in a lot of the swatches just a little
bit light in pigmentation and especially
just the lighter shades in these
palettes I thought that was especially
where the pigmentation was lacking I do
think if it's been a while since you've
tried elf stuff and then you swatch
these with your finger you know there is
a nice kind of smooth buttery creaminess
to a lot of these shadows that is pretty
impressive I think for half this price
tag and you can go out and find wet and
wilds comfort zone palettes and other
color icon
those are great from the drugstore and
they're a huge bargain so for me my two
top picks out of everything I've
mentioned would be the matte shadow
palette but the grand prize winner the
contour palette really happy with this
and just love how similar that was to my
Smashbox one so thank you guys so much
for watching I hope this was an
informative video if it was I'd
appreciate a thumbs up and I'll see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
