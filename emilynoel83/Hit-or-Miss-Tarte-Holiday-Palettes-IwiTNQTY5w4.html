video is all about a couple of the big
tart holiday sets for 2015 the two that
I'll be talking about are light of the
party and this is $59 at Sephora this
set and then the other one is called
greatest glitz and it's $49 whoa going
crazy with the camera there forty nine
bucks at Ulta for that one over the
years you know I've been doing lots of
these holiday reviews trying a lot of
what different brands put out and you
kind of get a feel for each brands
holiday vibe you know and for Tarte they
go for cute packaging for sure but they
also will always put out a very neutral
very like universally wearable color
palette and there are some other smaller
kits that tart is offering as well but I
just chose to purchase and test out the
ones that just personally intrigued me
the most I personally have a distinct
preference one palette over the other I
do think one palette just seems to have
a little bit better quality overall and
just you know the way it's set up the
way it's all thought out I think is even
more practical so the one that I'm
talking about the one that I really like
best is the greatest glitz this is
actually the less expensive of the two
it's the $49 palette available at Ulta
and the way this works you've got this
sequined top here on top of the pelt
which really coordinates nicely with my
nails I did I did jamberry last night
and these are the rose gold sparkle so
it went pretty well
but I've got real short nails so it was
a little little tricky with the file
inking stuff but I think it turned out
alright anyway a brand puts out yet
another you know packaging set up that
looks gorgeous in my makeup room so
thank you and then this opens up with a
really big mirror on the inside and
you've got this ribbon here that's kind
of keeping it held at just a certain
angle and this actually is really nice
if you were to sit this box on a table
or you know any area that you were
standing at that would be kind of I
level this is a great sized mirror to
just have right in front of you and be
able to see your entire face also
there's a little drawer in the bottom
and now keep in mind once your palettes
are out of here and once this little
plastic inserts out of here you could
put whatever you want it in this box but
what they give you is a
surgence in the shade flashy it's a lip
surgence lip cream so it's very opaque
on the lips and that's just a pretty
classic pink color and also a mini
lights camera lashes mascara now I first
really got attached to lights camera
lashes mascara through a little sample
like that so I think it's nice that they
put that in there but each of these mini
palettes are a very small lightweight no
mirror on the inside of those but you
are getting eight eye shadows and a
blush in each one and each one has you
know their own separate kind of color
scheme the gold I'm seeing a lot of
Brown kind of warm Browns that is the
one that I'm wearing today actually I've
got let's see some vixen on the lids
I've got dipped in chocolate in the
crease a little bit of the violet shade
just blended lightly into the crease as
well toasted marshmallow is my highlight
and a little bit of spiked cider on the
lower lash line and as you can tell all
of the shade names are very very holiday
themed I couldn't help but compare these
mini palettes to the ones in the Too
Faced set that had the three separate
palettes that came out of it
and I feel like every one of them in
this tart kit is a better balance
overall better balance of light to dark
better balance of matte and shimmer also
where I thought the blushes were lacking
in the Too Faced ones I love all of the
blushes in these they're really really
good I love that they didn't just throw
in just some random blush just to take
up space you know it's really good stuff
the texture of tart shadows I think
you'll notice like when you put your
brush into the matte shades particularly
I noticed this the same way with lorac
shadows they kick up a little bit of
powder particularly with the more
intense shades I think you're gonna want
to tap off the excess there that's just
a habit I get into in general with all
of my products but nothing is overly
sparkly they didn't throw in a bunch of
really glittery shades I would say the
most sparkly shade in this little set is
vixen but it still packs on well you
know and it's not Sparkle as in large
flecks of glitter it's just got a little
more pronounced you know shimmer going
on there as opposed to just the
straight-up metallic shades and the
blush in here warmhearted a really nice
bold rich pink I just loved it I was
really surprised that that one had as
much
color payoff as it did next paladin here
is rose in color and all of the shades
in here do definitely take on kind of a
rose gold theme love it this might be my
favorite palette of the bunch
I'm just really attracted to these kinds
of colors you've got a matte light shade
you've got a couple of really great deep
matte colors down here Rose such a
clatter I love that color kind of a
purpley like deep mauve and then evening
a fair your darkest shade is actually a
really really dark plum so this has been
fun to play with the blush in here I
think you're gonna love this one as well
really classic rhodes definitely it
looks good on everyone type shade so I
love that little mini palette and then
the third one is silver and that's got
all of your cool tone type colors so for
a cool smoky eye you're getting your
light shades as you would want but also
very very dark shades the one thing I
didn't really understand is they gave
you two shades that are like I can
hardly tell the difference between them
one might look a little more black in
the palette than the other but
ultimately they come off the same
smoke-and-mirrors and black tie beauty
there are a couple of kind of unique
shades in here right in this row mint
sprig and bedazzled spruce those shades
just have a hint of green and it's kind
of interesting I don't have a lot of
colors that are quite that subtle with
the green influence going on but I
really like that that's in here people
who love cool topes are really gonna
enjoy this but I am so thrilled with the
blush here this was the blush that I
thought okay here's the blush that I'm
not gonna like but it's it's kind of
coppery and I love it and I chose to
wear that one today and I think it's so
beautiful I tried to achieve like you
know the chrissy teigen really full
pretty cheek look today and I just I
love that blush so as you can tell I'm
rather enthusiastic about this kit I
think these travel well I think I could
just grab one and I love the fact that
just taking one of these I would have
everything I needed I would have you
know the darkest shadows the lightest
shadows of blush you know it would be
very complete but yet if I chose to take
all three of them it wouldn't be any big
you know space issue because they're all
so small it would be nothing to just be
like okay I want all those options I'm
just gonna take those out and pop them
in my bag
it seems to be a tricky thing for brands
to be able to really nail this whole
lift out concept and make each piece you
know stand alone really well but make it
also travel well and everything in there
you know is it good quality I think tart
really did a good job with this one and
I mentioned you know being able to gift
this to someone whether they really
understand a lot about makeup or not and
the reason why I say that is because
these individual pallets you know there
are some massive pallets and the other
one I'm going to talk about has a big
big open palette to it something about
having just a little smaller selection
it's a little less intimidating you're
like okay these are the shades that work
well together I would feel comfortable
gifting this to someone I would feel
like I was gifting them something of
good quality but also something that I
legit thought they could use now this
other one also sequined but it is zip
around and it has more of a pattern
going on on the outside now you unzip it
and you have twenty-four eyes shadow zin
the bottom a mini lights camera lashes
mascara a little double-ended brush
which I'm not wild about it's kind of
oddly flat at the top of that blending
brush and then you've got a little bit
smaller brush not saying it's unusable
it's just you know a little bit awkward
for me let me just set this on my
shoulder while I talk here there's the
mirror but this is what lifted out and
this is a little mini palette travel
palette got a couple of the Amazonian
clay products this is like a bronzer
it's called social butterfly blush and
amazed and a highlight in pink champagne
and your shadow selection for this
travel palette very very classic Tarte
you've got your Browns plums done I
don't mind these kinds of shades I mean
they are easy you know kind of
no-brainer type looks for sure not super
wowed by this palette for a couple of
reasons I didn't think the bronzer was
very pigmented at all I was having
trouble getting it to show up on my skin
I didn't like the blush as well as any
of the blushes in the other palette you
do have this pink champagne highlight
which is kind of nice and I have that in
another palette I think they put that in
there little Park Avenue princess
palette so needless to say this isn't
going to be the first thing I want to
grab for when I'm like oh I'm traveling
somewhere I just need a little palette
like another thing that I should have
pointed out early on I do believe this
is the first year that Tarte is actually
printed the shade names on the palette
instead of just giving you that dang
clear sheet that has to lift over the
top so I love that thank start I
mentioned you know having the
individualized palates I think gives you
a little more direction when you're
trying to choose shadows and it's a
little less overwhelming but I do think
there's a clear color scheme going on
here if you just look vertically you
know topes
plums berry like golden black brown and
then like a really cool brownish Roe
over here looking horizontally your top
three rows you're gonna have you know
matte shimmer all mixed in there some
metallic shades some shades that have a
bit more sparkle but your entire bottom
row is a hundred percent men I have
achieved some looks that I've liked out
of this palette for sure but there are
some shades in here that I was kind of
disappointed with that I was really
wanting to be extra good and I'm talking
about like these four right in here
these mid-tones peach on earth a lot of
people are going to be looking to that
shade to be that kind of soft warm brown
type color they're gonna put in their
crease and I didn't think that one
showed up nearly enough and kind of the
same deal with rum plum plum and Tartini
these two are mattes right here and
they're kind of on the pinky side and I
just didn't think they were showing up
enough and then baby it's gold outside I
love a good gold and this one you know
it's a little bit flaky it's gonna give
you some gold feeling but it's very soft
and it's not gonna be that all out like
metallic true gold a few other light
shades like in a flurry and it's snow
time I thought were kind of lacking how
it was honestly just a little too hit
and miss for me among the light to
medium tone shades I thought a lot of
these darker shades were really rich and
applied very you know evenly and with a
lot of good intensity I don't really
feel like the quality is as good among
the other shades and for whatever reason
I'm not sure why I do feel like things
were pretty consistent with the little
palettes in here so if you're wanting
something small to take with you here
it's like the decision has been made for
you it's going to be you know these six
eyeshadows and we got these blushes in
here here it's like okay I could easily
take all three of those itty-bitty guys
and not take up much room or if I'm only
taking one I've got three totally
different color scheme options in here
if you really want to be taking options
with you you're gonna have to take this
whole fairly bulky palette so
these two again grade school it's
definitely getting the thumbs up for me
it's the kind of thing that I personally
think I'm going to continue to get use
out of it's also the kind of thing that
I think would make a really nice gift
for someone particularly like I said the
neutral lovers if you or the person
you're gifting to it wants to be a lot
more adventurous with their eyeshadows
or you already feel like you've got a
ton of neutrals as is this may not be
worth it but it is one of those lifts
out separated uptight palettes that I
think was executed well especially in
comparison to the one I talked about a
little bit earlier this week from Too
Faced this one while I've still gotten
some decent looks with it I think it's
more hit and miss quality-wise don't
like the packaging setup as much so
wouldn't recommend it so thank you guys
so much for tuning in for this review I
still got lots more holiday stuff to
come and looking at my box over here
I've got some Kat Von D sim bare
minerals some Clinique some Sephora
favorites so I'll keep on cranking out
their reviews thank you guys for
watching I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
