in the holiday spirit I'm sure as we get
closer to Christmas and I wanted to do a
look sort of an entire face look that
was inspired by the holidays and so I
want to focus today I've already put on
my foundation and some powder and just a
little dusting of bronzer as you can see
I've done this I and the rest of my face
I'm going to do here for you and just
give you some ideas for a really classic
holiday look it's going to be the red
lips sort of a simple I and some really
fresh cheeks so I've already like I said
just done a light dusting of some matte
bronzer so if you want to go ahead and
do that my next step will be the blush
so what I'm going to start off with is a
cream blush this is from Revlon and the
color is first blush and it's really a
like a red cream shade basically so
don't be intimidated by it I'm going to
swell my finger in it a little bit get a
little bit on my finger like that and
then just kind of rub a little bit right
into the apple of my cheek and it blends
easily it's still subtle that just keep
it on the apple of your cheek and you
can see you know kind of your kind of
getting that plush but you can really
only get from a shade like this it's
really interesting how the red shades
give you a really natural one so I'm
just blending and
there we go so that's kind of going to
act as our base color and then for a
little pop of color on top of that I'm
going to use my elf natural radiance
blusher and the color is flushed and it
is kind of a deep sort of it has a
little bit of a you should tone to it
almost so once again don't be scared of
the color just tap your brush in a
little bit goes a long way with this
product and just sweep that on the apple
of your cheek and just back slightly
and now you should be getting that nice
glow as if you were just outside in the
cold and you came in and you're in your
cheeks are red and then if you like to
have a little contour I know I usually
talk about my covergirl cheekers blush
in golden pink as a contour shade but if
you want one more option that it's very
similar to that try the Neutrogena soft
color blush in blushing mocha it's very
similar to that shade just get a little
on the brush and of course the regular
contour position squeezing the cheeks
and just go where the shadow you know
sort of starts to form just like that
feel free to use this to kind of contour
other areas it's not shimmery so you can
get away with that and then lastly
what's you know a holiday look without
just a little bit of shimmer so I'm
going to use my Sally girl shimmer
stripes in LOL it's kind of a pinky
shimmer and just dust your brush in it
and kind of go right on top of the
cheekbone is where I like to apply some
shimmer and just kind of across the
forehead just keep it light don't go
overboard with it but that's kind of
getting you all right your face is kind
of in the mode of the it's kind of a
glow it's getting those sort of red
cheeks for straying a little bit from a
super blondie look that I usually use
kind of go for the more tan look this is
sort of a little more fresh faced with
just a sort of reddish tone to the
cheeks now for lips um I'm going to
really be using a chapstick first I just
any chapstick will do this is the true
shimmer from chapstick but it's really
not that morning so don't worry
about it just anything to get your lips
ready for some liner because it's going
to be basically liner and glosses all
we're doing here this is another even
less expensive to the alternative to the
Rimmel uh
made in ravish it's the Rimmel
exaggerated lip liner in ravish this is
Jordana easy liner in plush plum Jordana
liners come two for three dollars so
it's quite a bit cheaper than just
buying the one of the others I kind of
realized sometimes I recommend the same
products over and over so I do want to
give you some alternatives that may not
necessarily all the time be cheaper but
just another similar product if maybe
you don't have access to that other
brand in your store so just go ahead and
line your lips with this
basically what you are going to end up
with here is the classic very lip and
the lip will be a little stronger than
the I in this look which is a little
different from my usual tutorials
so I'm just really defining that Cupid's
bow area I can always do the bottom a
lot faster this is just a gorgeous
reddish plum shade i just really like
this shade and then over the top of that
since that really just it's creamy it
feels almost went by the time you're
done filling in your whole mouth with it
it feels like a lipstick and then over
the top I'm going to use my ELF plumping
lip glaze and blue be kids so I am
pretty much just going to use this shade
which I believe does not have the
plumping Asia but that's not exactly
what I'm going for I just want that red
gloss over the top so apply that all
over now you got a nice shine there feel
free to blot if you feel like you need
to after that but how's that for the red
you know holiday lips so now we're going
to move on to I so I'm going to switch
up my camera angle a little bit here for
you so you can really see what I'm
talking about so this the eye look we
went with that I went with to start off
I'm just going to blend this out just a
little bit more basically what it is
it's so so easy we're not going
overboard on color obviously we're
keeping it just kind of really letting
the liner be the statement here and and
just using some very neutral easy-to-use
shades from my NYX trio we're using the
white pearl shade in this this is the
white pearl silver and charcoal we're
just going to using white pearl and
charcoal so go ahead and take the white
pull and put that all over your lid
and this is also going to be our
highlight so feel free to you know just
get a little bit up there on the brow
bone as well not don't put it on thick
but just give a little light to that
area and then we're going to take these
so easy this is so not like an extensive
tutorial here dip into the charcoal
shade that deep deeper gray and we're
just going to basically go back and
forth in our crease keeping it really
not much of a factor here or just we
just want to deepen the crease shade and
keep it kind of natural like nobody
would really point to this and say oh
that's really smoky or anything like
that we just want to naturally just
enhance the shadow that we that are I
already creates there okay so as you can
see there we are very easy simple and
then I'm going to take my maybelline
define a line liner and go from inner
corner to outer corner i'm actually use
my little mirror in here for ya this
glides on really easy and it's more
smudge able than colorstay and that's
why i'm using it here staying power may
not be quite as good as revlon colorstay
but it creates a really nice effect and
especially for those you know events
that you're that you're going to and
that kind of thing it will get you
through the night sorry if i'm covering
it up and just lightly i'm going really
light actually I mean I know it's coming
up with more contracts because we're up
so close to the camera but I'm really
lightly kind of dotting that basically
between my lower lashes it has a a handy
little smudger at the end and I'm just
going to smudge all out
not necessarily I wouldn't call it
really smoky we're just softening the
line and then we're going to curl our
lashes and always lift up as you do so
and do it for about 15 seconds within
that time kind of lift up and extend you
know to another point on the lashes so
you really get an easy curve there and
then I'm just going to apply my Max
Factor 2,000 calorie mascara just a
great classic black mascara
and just kind of wiggle it from root to
tip of the lashes this really has a
great volumizing effect and it's just I
just really like Christmas care i kind
of used it for a while kind of forgot
about it actually i'm going to go ahead
and do a second coat on my other eye
while we're here
and do one more on this other eye and
there you go you can see the eye we just
kept it naturally kept it pretty neutral
the lips are kind of the statement for
this was I hope you guys like this I
hope you find it as something that you
can use during the holidays just to kind
of give your face some glow you know use
those those blushes that you may not
normally use you want the color here and
here and then just keep the ice pretty
you know focus on the lashes do a little
bit of dark liner but you can see why
this would be a nice look to take to
your holiday parties and gatherings and
it's just very appropriate for the
season so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
