on some holiday gift videos I think this
is a key time of year for people wear
makeup buying is concerned because maybe
you're wondering what do I want to put
on my own gift list or what do I want to
get for somebody else and especially
when you're buying for somebody else you
know you don't want to screw it up you
want to make sure you got a good product
so I feel like this is one of those
times of year when I can be especially
useful to you I guess so i did go ahead
and i've purchased various holiday kits
already because i feel like i go and i
asked for him for christmas and then do
a halt on them and then that turns out
to be sometimes not so useful because
certain things were limited edition and
it's like okay I would have liked to
have known that before Christmas time so
I'm going to be doing both this video on
some lip kits and then I'm going to have
another one on various holiday pallets
you know like actual makeup palettes and
kits and stuff like that and I'll
probably have some other videos between
Thanksgiving and Christmas just like
maybe makeup gifts for different price
ranges so we can work in some drug store
things so some stocking stuffer gift
ideas and probably on my vlog channel
just other non makeup related gifts for
this video I've got five different lip
kits to review for you I can't say
they're all favorites because they're
just not they're not all things that I
think are awesome but I think it's
important to tell you about the not so
awesome things as well as thing I want
to mention i actually was kind of
mistaken on this when I was shooting a
little bit of video beforehand to the
products and I had this great six-piece
lip kit from it cosmetics the vitality
lip flush these are kind of like a lip
stain like a really really hydrating lip
product but kind of stains your lips as
well and I've gotten this kit several
months ago i tweeted i facebooked about
it when it came available I told you all
but now it's not available anymore and I
just kind of realized that like right
before doing this video but there is
still a set of three of these that you
can get that i think would still make an
outstanding gift I mean these are like
nvp lip products like I'm going to call
it right now it's probably going to win
an inlay award
when I start going through like
favorites of the year because these are
so wonderful feel like they are super
hydrating and feels so comfortable on
the lips the colors are gorgeous and the
staying power is good now like I just
applied one of these I applied pretty
woman that I have here and this is like
a pretty kind of deep reddish Co is
freshly applied you do have that little
bit of shine going on and throughout the
day that's going to wear off a little
bit but for the longest time like
throughout a whole like day at work I
will find I still have color hanging
around on my lips which i think is great
because it's virtually you know
weightless on your lips but you still
have the color but at the start your
lips feel very hydrated these never
leave your lips feeling dried out or
like even after they've worn off some
you don't have a dry feel they are
loaded with ingredients like plum oil
cherry oil shea butter argan oil
vitamins different kinds of tea green
tea white tea ala set of three comes
with three different colors one is jenna
sake want a really light color that
looks like it would be almost
transparent I know I've talked about
this before but when it goes on your
lips it actually gets a little bit
deeper these sort of interact with your
body temperature somewhat I think and
they deepen up just a bit but and that's
a beautiful pink the center one is kind
of like your rosy more neutral type
shade and that's called love story this
is one along with the one I'm wearing
now I gave two of these to my mom from
that larger set and she loves him too
because she's got issues sometimes with
lip products going up in her fine lines
around her lips and she said these
totally stayed put didn't men for your
pretty read that I'm wearing now it's
just a little bit deeper which I think
makes it pretty wearable that is pretty
woman I know talked a lot about like the
Revlon just bitten kissable balm stains
I love those but these are a lot more
hydrating than that it is like a lip
treatment plus the gorgeous color so I
just can't get enough of these love them
so much another great product is from
Tarte and it's called lipsurgence these
are kind of like these jumbo pencils and
you just twist them up when you
you don't sharpen these but you twist
them up from the bottom and they have
this kind of jumbo pencil format so it's
sort of like a lipstick but with a
little bit more control makes these in
several different finishes and in this
kit where you get five of them you do
get to experience several of those so
you've got a couple of the lip tints
that are just kind of like a sheer wash
of color they don't have any shimmer you
do get a couple of the lustres that do
have that little bit of sparkle and for
this they've actually thrown in a kind
that I've never tried before which is
one of the matte lip tint I really enjoy
the lipsurgence products if I were to
compare them to the product I was just
talking about from it cosmetics they
have a very similar feel when you first
put them on I don't feel like these last
as long on the lips or have that same
kind of long-term staining effect but
there's still really nice products thing
about this kit is that they're all kind
of in the same color family here there
is some variants I mean even with the
matte shade you know that's a little
more neutral but they're all kind of a
pinky neutrally type lip color so if you
were hoping for big variety in this
likes one shade that's really really
light and then like a nice deep berry
color or something like that everything
you're getting here is kind of middle of
the road and that can't make it in a way
a good gift products and my favorites
from this kit I actually really like the
mat lipton I think that's a really
pretty wearable neutral color and i also
love sweet i had this one already and
it's a great peachy pinky shimmer use
the shade on people for weddings and
bridesmaids and stuff like that and
people just loved it it was a beautiful
glow on the lips practically without too
much color every year I love checking
out the set from buxom by bare
essentials because i love the plumping
quality of these glosses and they
usually put together a great set around
the holidays it gives you a lot of
different colors to try this year it was
a set of six different shades two of the
shades were a different finish they were
actually the buxom lip creams which
instead of feeling like you're putting
on more of a gel type of lip product
these really do feel like very creamy
very opaque I love the color payoff of
those like that's really kind of the
highlight of this kit for me were those
although i do like several of the other
colors is we do like the sort of berry
pink color here and that one is called
Gina beautiful shimmer and sparkle there
love that one and I really like the more
neutral shade they threw into this kit
as well and that one is called sugar i
believe it's kind of hard they're
written so small on there but that has a
pretty almost metallic type sheet and
the others that you have our kind of a
light pink and a peach which this peachy
color here in Katie doesn't give off
much color you know would have liked if
there was maybe a red or something like
that thrown into this kit but still I
think you're getting a pretty good
variety and quite a bit for the price
and just something to keep in mind these
do have kind of a minty sort of tingle
on the lips so if you're not a fan of
that you may want to stay away from me I
am wholeheartedly a fan of the buxom
glosses I love their shine and I think
they've got pretty darn good staying
power for being a gloss as well so I
wear these often on the news I think
they just give your lips a really juicy
full look and this kit is no exception
benefit put out a set of six mini sized
glosses the ones that are fairly new and
they're named after those box powders
that already exists so you've got sugar
bum dandelion coralista Dallas hula and
Bella bomba so you get all of these in
the kit they've got the same little like
varying font and design that shows up on
all of those little box powders so I
love the coordination there I think
that's really cool but as far as the
formula on these glasses I feel like
they don't show up quite well enough
there's just not enough color payoff for
me I feel like Dallas really tends to
show up on my lips coral East is ok but
as far as the others I just feel like
they're kind of like a little pricey for
just what they are got a person that
just loves Benefit Cosmetics and would
go for the you know just natural sheer
glossy look they may like these they
have a pleasant scent they're not sticky
I just wish there was more color last
thing I want to
mission is from malli I know I talked
about this in my big kind of makeup kit
and palette review i did not all that
long ago but i just wanted to mention it
again because it really fit with this
category i'm talking about in the video
but this is Malley's 10 color lip gloss
libraries Lee calls these high shine
liquid lipsticks because they are rather
opaque they come in that pin format kind
of like Stila lip glaze these are not as
sticky as Stila lip glaze those are a
little bit smaller than the normal size
but you do get 10 and variety wise it's
probably the best thing that I've talked
about so far that's really important to
you in a lip kit is to have like every
different shade this kind of does it for
you because not only if you have your
peaches and your light neutral type
colors but you get some berry shades on
several different pinks a really bright
red and a nice deep berry as well so I
love this formula this is one of my
favorite gloss formulas actually and i
love the delivery method to coming out
of that brett really like that what you
see is what you get color wise even on
this red like if possible that maybe
even more intense than it appears here
in the packaging the deep berry colors
you know they are not just sheer washes
on your lips you actually get the colors
as they appear so I love that I think
that's a great gloss overall I was
really impressed with everything I
talked about except the benefit set my
top couple of things would probably be
the it cosmetics vitality lip flush
number one followed by the Mallee for a
gloss still love my buxom everything so
always love my tart lipsurgence but just
know that in that kit there's not a lot
of color variety you so much for
watching this video there's much more
holiday themed stuff to come so
definitely stay tuned and have a great
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
