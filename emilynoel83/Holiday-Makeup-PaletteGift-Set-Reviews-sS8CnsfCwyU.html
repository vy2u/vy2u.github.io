great makeup set for Christmas I mean I
just think that is the ultimate gift I
love makeup you guys know that but now
is the time of year when you can come up
with some really great sets that give
you all kinds of things to try in just
one purchase so I am going to tell you
about some of the makeup sets that I've
been playing with recently that have cut
out for the holidays and in case you
haven't already seen it I do have one
out specifically for lip product kits so
glosses lipsticks a lot of those are a
little bit less expensive than the ones
I'm talking about today which contain
eyeshadows some of them are face
products some of them do contain some
lip products as well so just these multi
kits that give you just every makeup
galore I love it so much and this in my
last video but I just went ahead and got
some of these kits so I could review
them and tell you about them before the
holidays roll around that way you know
what you might want to put on your wish
list or what you want to get somebody
else a lot of times I get so many
questions and it's like I don't know I
don't have it yet I can't tell you
anything about it so I just wanted to be
able to answer questions and just make a
really informative video for it they
have six different kits or pallets that
I'm going to be talking about today just
hand pick favorites for this video
because I think I want to pass along
whatever information I have on anything
I have so you'll get the good and the
bad sides to this stuff the first kit I
want to talk about is one of these
Sephora favorites kits I looked through
all of the different ones Sephora
offered and this was the one that
appealed to me the most maybe because it
already contains some things that I know
and love but it is the Indiglo kit and
it contains blush bronzer and Luminizer
samples it just pops open and there's
your samples I feel like they're pretty
good size really on for $45 I think you
get really a lot to work with here
basically like three highlights three
bronzer type products and three blushes
all different forms get lorac perfectly
lip powder in spotlight emily
award-winner
talked about this before love this
highlight for the fact that it gives the
skin a glow but is not overly shimmery
you get benefit
beam and it's not even one of the teeny
tiny samples I mean it's still that's
quite a bit there because it doesn't
take much when you use High Beam so
that's like a liquid highlight product
and then you get from bareMinerals you
get something called pure radiance nude
color not SuperDuper light like you
could dust this all over your face for
like a little bit of all over globe as
you can tell it's kind of got a peachy
beige sort of tone - it's not totally
like a white ship from Laura Mercier you
get the shimmer block in golden mosaic
and so what that is is four different
shades you could also use each of these
individually as eyeshadows I mean this
is a pretty good sized little compact
you could brush your blush or bronzer
brush through you know maybe some of the
deeper shades to get more of a bronzer
effect or you could just use this
lighter shade for more like a highlight
but I think that's really cool it's got
a mirror and everything I feel like
that's such a great deal to be getting
that in there and I have never tried
NARS Laguna bronzer I was really eager
to test it out so it comes in this kit
adorable little mini Laguna bronzer I
mean this is so cute like if my cat
cupcake could possess a NARS compact
like this would be like her size it's
okay you know a decent amount of product
you can see this bronzer is not totally
mad it has kind of a satiny almost
golden glow to it but it's still rather
deep it is the kind of thing I think you
could contour what another one of my
all-time favorites too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer is in here this is a
totally matte bronzer great for
contouring great for just an all-over
sort of perk up for the skin if you want
to use it lightly I love that that's
included art has thrown in one of the
Amazonian clay 12-hour blushes I was so
excited about this it's in the shade
called splendor and the shade I think is
gorgeous I just wish it didn't contain
as much glitter so that's kind of the
downside to that one I was really hoping
it would be a nice wearable color but
there's just so much glitter in this one
I don't just like brushing glitter onto
my cheeks but still a really pretty
color it also has one of their cheek
stains in the shade called flush this is
a pretty sort of berry pink gel type
cheek stain stick so you can just like
put pop it on your cheeks blend it in a
little bit and get just a really
nice natural glow there Stila there is a
convertible color in the shade peony
this doesn't have shimmer it's just a
really nice natural like creamy pinky
mathtype color you could use that on
cheeks or lips or eyes or whatever you
wanted but that's a really versatile
product so overall I am really impressed
with this kit if you've been longing to
try some different high-end products for
the face I think this gives you a great
opportunity like I said many of these
are tried-and-true products that I love
and then I also found some new ones next
why I want to talk about is a palette I
think I mentioned it in a favorites
video but it's a new palette from the
balm and it's called Bon Jovi's it is so
awesome this is such a compact palette
like by the time I get done telling you
everything that's in it it's like can
you believe it's that skinny but it's
the rock star face palette so it does
have eyes shadows a highlight of blush
and sub lips / cheek products in here so
everything is a play on kind of a rock
and roll theme like you open it up it's
got that adorable little mirror there
and then you've got all these eyeshadows
I feel the same way about the quality of
these shadows as I do the other on the
balm kits like the nude tude palette the
Shady Lady Palace I think they're all
great and these really definitely follow
suit with being great eye shadows down
the side you've got heavy metal shadows
so you can see all the names are fun
like Alice copper and everything down
the middle is matte 100% matte easy to
work with great matte colors and then
everything down this side is kind of
some different shades like a really
pretty mom a gorgeous unbeatable navy
blue a purpley shade a kind of shimmery
pink so this is so awesome it's kind of
like new too but with some great deep
rich shades through this disco disco
highlight that's just like mary lou
manizer the pop pop blush is just like
frat boy blush so a couple of classic
face products are thrown into this and
then separate flat for the cream
products nice consideration there you
have milli and Vanilli lip / cheek cream
products there then just like a
billboard chart at the bottom you get to
see all different ideas
how to put looks together with all the
different shades so I think this is such
a great little palette I feel like the
bomb is just the quality of these
shadows are right up there with your
Urban Decay many other high-end brand
that I've tried I like the balm shadows
just as well you like instead of bulking
this up with a bunch of excess packaging
they put just smart funny cool stuff
onto this palette this is a great little
gift to face has a big kit this year and
is called sweet indulgences and it's a
metal tin so that's definitely something
different it seems like an old-school
like candy tin or something like that
but you pop it open and it's a
double-decker situation your top you're
talking about your eyeshadows you lift a
little ribbon up and there's your face
products as well just starting with
what's on the bottom here you are
getting a couple of different shades of
bronzer one is sort of like a deeper
matte color the other is a little bit
more satiny finish a little bit of
shimmer and a lighter color to blush
shades one pink one peach which i think
is nice and then the candlelight glow
highlight full-size shadow insurance
which is a great deal and then also
several little cards that you can look
at and get ideas for what kind of looks
you want to do the little brush thing
here is one side sponge tip and one side
is like a small eyeshadow brush
eyeshadow selection here is pretty
extensive if you're getting 16 shades
granted some of these shades are going
to be once you've seen before if you
collect a lot of Too Faced products in
the buff peach fuzz teddy bear
lovey-dovey those are a few of the
shades that I recognize from some other
palettes but as a whole you get a good
variety of colors and you get a good
variety of finishes as well on some of
the shades blatantly have sparkle in
them some of the shades teddy bear is a
completely matte shade with a texture I
mean I wish they would put out something
with more shades of this matte texture
because that is so non flaky and so
creamy but still mad like kind of the
green yellowish thing going on down in
this sort of area here nice stems is a
beautiful green and then I feel like
path steel it really sets it off this
really pretty emerald
these two shades down here really deep
shades cherry cola and black sugar it's
like they're matte shades with some
sparkle embedded in them it's not like
they come off with a metallic finish but
they're really deep rich colors with
just just the sparkle not all in all a
pearl finish or anything like that the
pink paired with the cherry cola pink
and maroon I think is so pretty to get
just a nice selection of colors neutrals
and finishes so I really like that they
come up with a creative way to package
it although it is a little bulky like if
you were gonna travel with this tin
container I mean it just seems like
you'd really have to create some space
in your tote bag or your travel bag or
whatever to take this along with you but
I do think it's very high quality
product inside now for the kit that just
screams class high-end luxurious product
it's from lorac and it's the eye candy
kit here look at this all the way around
it looks like there could be something
really expensive in there maybe it's
chocolates maybe it's some perfectly
wrapped high-end product that was bought
at the mall but this is really cool
because as you undo this which is a
little magnet there with that ribbon it
looks like a box of chocolates
I love it if I were a makeup product
creator like this is the kind of idea I
would want to come up with it's
something that looks like a bunch of
freaking candy bars inside here I love
this
I look like the packaging makes me giddy
I think this is so smart and I also love
in a practical sense the fact that if
you want one eyeshadow palette two
eyeshadow palettes pop them in your
purse they look like candy bars and they
don't take any up any more space than a
candy bar sort of the showcased bar if
you will that is right there at the
front of the palette is mesmerizing dark
chocolate cream eyeliner palette in here
this is your four cream eyeliners you're
getting a navy a plum a brown and a
black these are not exactly built for
service type eyeliners that are
completely smudge free you can wear them
throughout the course of a day and they
can look fine at the end of the day but
if you were rubbing your eyes there are
some eyeliners that will
go anywhere there are some that will
smudge these can smudge they can lose a
little bit of intensity so this is not
really my highlight of the kit but it is
there for you and I had never tried any
lorac cream liners before so I'm not
sure how fast these might dry out on you
so I can't really tell you that but the
color wise they go on with a good amount
of color next we've got four different
eyeshadow quads one is the ooh la la
vanilla and this is going to be your
neutrals without a lot of bronze thrown
in kind of like a cool palette that has
a little bit of a pinky color a beige
brown which is as close to matte as
we're getting in this whole kit I think
it pretty much is matte maybe just a
little sheen to it but hardly any and
then you've got sort of a rich
chocolatey Brown there my little
criticism here is that the next one look
how similar this this one is to the one
I just told you about like the shades
are really like along the same lines
this was called a la la vanilla and this
one's called tantalizing cocoa as I look
at them the darkest shade and the cocoa
one is darker the shade that was mat
here is shimmery here but other than
that they're they're pretty similar I
like it I like to use it it looks
beautiful on the swatches are very rich
and luxurious but they are there's not a
ton of variety between these two caramel
one is getting into more of a coppery
look here you've got kind of a reddish
rust type color a medium brown a golden
shade and a light color arcing all
shimmer here and it's gonna be all
shimmer from here on out I don't feel
like it's overly shimmery because I feel
like the darkest shades can give you a
really great looking contrast in the
crease and they do do a good job in each
of these pallets of really taking you
from extreme light to extreme dark so
you don't feel like you necessarily need
anything else this palette is gorgeous
the BlackBerry truffle seduction here
they've worked in a plum shade a really
light color and sort of two tones of
charcoal one more a little bit silvery
and one just deep dark grayish almost on
the border of black and so those are the
eye shadows there are four eye shadow
palettes you've got the cream
eyeliners and then the last thing in
here is indulge in berry kisses and this
is the cheek and lip tint they do have
the texture that you can imagine from a
typical like cream blush they're creamy
but they're not the losses watch as I
show are obviously full color not here
now I just wanted you to see what the
colors look like they're all creamy
except the peach one does have a little
bit of shimmer I love the concept here
and I love the products as I've been
using them I can find a few flaws in
this in the fact that the eyeliners
aren't hardcore long long wearing liners
and a couple of the palettes kind of
have some similar shades other than that
I still really enjoy the concept of this
the creativity behind if you are looking
for a more matte colors or be really
colorful shades this may not be
something you want just because it
doesn't have those kinds of things in it
next up I've got two kits from Tarte
one is readily available at Sephora
stores the other is going to be a QVC
today's special values starting on these
28th of November I believe I just want
to sort of compare these kits for you so
you might know which one you want or if
you even want them at all the first one
is the carried away with Tarte kit I
think it's called and this is kind of
like a makeup bag like a rollup makeup
bag and you got different compartments
and a lot of products in here so here's
the way it looks all folded out you can
see my camera in there you got a nice
big mirror you can use so this is
extremely travel friendly I feel like a
lot of times the fault that I have with
different makeup palettes is Portability
and the ability to dude if you just want
one thing out of that palette the
thought that you can lift it out and
take it with you so what's nice about
this is if you want one lip gloss or
just you know the mascara maybe take
that brush or the eyeshadow comes right
out of there
it's all very portable this is a nice
flat easy to take with you eyeshadow
packing a six full-size eyeshadow quads
variety of colors variety of textures
yes you are getting matte here you're
getting some that have a little bit of
sparkle you're getting some that are
just pearly a few that look
iridescent I'm
variety is the name of the game you've
got you know kind of a classic looking
palette up here one working in some
really pretty this is a very vibrant
purpley blue color great coppers and
maroon I love this this is one of my
favorite parts of it great plums blues
and green within each section there is
variety and most of these there is at
least one matte shade and there's at
least one sort of metallic finish shape
I feel like the quality of these shades
are better than some of the other Tarte
gift palette things that have come out
in say the past couple of years I don't
know if they've changed it maybe made
these the Amazonian clay versions of
their shadows or whatever but I feel
like overall pigmentation is pretty darn
good with in this kit you also get eight
lip glosses I'm actually wearing one of
them I'm wearing this pinky one with the
maracuja lip glosses they have kind of a
minty scent real pretty good staying
power on the lips yet they're very
glossy a little bit sticky but not
uncomfortably sticky like that's a
problem for me if I feel like my lips
are just sticking together every time
they touch I talk a lot
clearly it's a doe foot applicator on
all of these there's four that are just
creamy colors and then three that have a
little bit of sparkle over a little bit
sheer for my liking but as a whole I
really love them I already knew I liked
this kind of gloss that they put out I
had a big giveaway if you recall with
these they kind of in their regular
sites come out in like a pin form you
click them at the bottom and the product
comes out so I'm glad they included
these and those are just in this pocket
here obviously you could rework this
whole kit and put in other products you
liked but that's just the way they come
in the palette over on the other side
you're getting a full-sized really soft
blush brush I mean high marks on and
then on the other side you've got three
products here that I'll tell you about
real quick lights camera lashes mascara
love it you're gonna love it too I think
you got the blush and adventure to love
this shade it's almost like you want to
contour your cheek with it just a little
bit it's just a little deep really
really pretty
rosy color I love that and then
something I've never tried before from
Tarte it's the smooth operator Amazonian
clay finishing powder it seems to
operate a lot for me like the Make Up
For Ever HD or the elf HD powder I
haven't used this a whole lot but you
are getting a small size of that there's
a lot of gold this season I think the
print on here with the gold and the
purple it's just so pretty this is
actually one I am considering getting
someone in my family so really really
like this I want to tell you about the
today's special value that's going to be
coming up on QVC Tarte sent me this
ahead of time to try so I'm gonna tell
you what I think about it what's neat
about this is something I haven't really
seen done and make up a whole lot but
it's like the boxes are Mac magnetized
on there so like you take one off like
it's an absolute magnet so that's kind
of a neat presentation although I
probably wouldn't keep my products in
these boxes like I mean there's your
eyeliners but I would probably just take
them and put them in my little eyeliner
bin you know but these are the cashmere
waterproof gliding eyeliners you're
getting a black a brown kind of a
bronzey shade and a plum they go on grey
and the staying power is pretty hardcore
like you can rub your hands on it and it
does not move so there's four full-size
good quality shades you're gonna wear
eyeliners so I think that's cool and you
do have a mirror in that little box here
by the way this will lift out this
cardboard part here and you could store
other stuff in there the other side the
other small side of this is for lip
glosses these are the maracuja lip
glosses same formula as those minis but
here you're getting 4 full-size darling
is kind of like a peachy pink shade
genuine is like a deep new kitty is a
nice peach and then brazen is a really
juicy pink kind of watermelon type color
so those all click up from the bottom
and give you that really high shine
glossy look just like those little ones
in the other but here you're getting
four there you were getting eight but
they were small stuff is so shiny I'm
sorry if I'm blinding you but this is
the eyeshadow palette and that just
pulls apart and it leaves you with five
10 15 20 eyeshadows here other one
you're getting six quads which would be
24 look at me doing math so you're
getting a little more on the other
palate and in this you can see it's a
lot of neutrals here it's a lot of
neutrals basically with some pops of
purple that's what's sort of notable
about the way this palette is you are
getting matte and shimmer and here her
all I feel like there's more color
variety and the other palette and I just
kind of like the colors better not that
I wouldn't use this I mean I feel like
there are some really good neutrals I'm
liking what's going on down here with a
really bold purple and kind of a dark
like dark teal black shade which is
interesting but a lot of what's going on
up here is a little bit bland this big
kind of cardboard box it's almost a
little bit bulky just to take with you
like that's big the other one put more
shadows in but it was super duper
streamlined just for my preference of
the products and the other one and the
way you can take stuff out and it's just
really travel friendly I would say I
prefer the carried away set over the
today's special values as a whole guys
this is a lot of great stuff here so I
think what you won't need to think is
what do I want or need or what do I
think my gift recipients want or need if
it's face products you're into and you
want some you know try some new blushes
bronzers and whatever at the end the
glow kit is awesome if you are looking
to try something from the balm because
you know I've raved and raved about this
I would really suggest checking out bon
jovi because it's a wide range of
eyeshadows you're kidding if you were on
HauteLook recently that was down to like
19 bucks so you got to keep an eye out
for that both the Too Faced and the
lorac here are very luxe see Mia greens
blues pinks
plums neutrals - I mean everything's
there plus those face products it's not
my favorite for portability but it is
great for quality of shadows and variety
of shadows lorac palette I mean we're
talking the same kinds of quality that
was in the shimmery shades of the lorac
Pro there's not a lot of matte in here
so that's something to keep in mind
there's just not a lot of bright bold
colors but this is neutral this is very
classy in the lighter shades they chose
to the lip and cheek kind of creamy
products there it's all going to create
a very neutral classic look from smokey
to sort of light nude if you got a
couple of kids from Tarte that are
basically trying to give you everything
and I think that the carried away kit
does it best it gives you not only the
great bag full eyes shadow palette a
bunch of lip colors several other great
products from the line like lights
camera lashes and an Amazonian clay
blush so this is kind of the ultimate
for watching guys I feel like I talk
forever but I hope it helped you and let
me know what you think of any of these
palettes or anything else that's new and
I will have more gift videos coming
something for even more price ranges
from the high high-end to the drugstore
type so people look out for that thank
you so much I'll see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
