dreary where I am right now but I wanted
to share with you a really fun cheery
sparkly bright I look that you can use
for your holiday parties the basis of it
is really a pretty typical smokey eye
trio from wet and wild and I chose to
pop it with a great kind of jade green a
really pretty jewel tone type color and
I would encourage you to use like any
color you love to sub in for that if you
don't want to do green you know I think
purple could be beautiful as sort of the
spotlight color or a sapphire blue or a
really pretty kind of burgundy shade so
just keep in mind that you know you can
use this look to highlight any color you
love in terms of what you might wear
with a green I like this I love to use
green and purple together whether it's
purple on the eyes or green in the
outfit i'm using a really dark plum top
here alongside this green eye and i just
love that combination so i will walk you
through exactly how to do this so keep
on watching
for sort of a color base I'm using this
double ended pencil from coastal send is
metallic silver and one end is like a
sparkly silver glitter so these are
really inexpensive on the Coastal Scents
website and they come in a huge color
range and I'm just going to take that
and basically draw that pencil on the
metallic side all over my lid also
taking the metallic side kind of right
around the Terre des time taking my wet
and wild trio this is don't steal my son
I'm going to take the white just with a
sponge tip applicator it's got a little
bit of sparkler just a little shimmer to
it and I'm going to dab that right on
this inner part here and the sponge tip
really just gives you a lot of control
as you can see for those small area
using the glittery end of this pencil
adding that right on top of what I just
did just to give a little extra spark
next we're going to start playing with
some color I'm going to be using this
single from NYX it's called wild it's
not your typical like Christmas green
it's a little bit more of a jewel tone
to me so I'm just again going to use a
sponge tip with this because I think it
gives a great concentration of color and
it's just very easy kind of overlapping
most of what happened right here on the
inner corner and then you're going to
notice because there's less brightness I
didn't use that white shade over toward
this side the green is going to start to
appear darker as you pack it on through
the outer portion and then I'm going to
use my pencil brush just to continue
that green right underneath oops didn't
get enough there we go and i'm just
going to carry that all the way just
about to the tear duct now we're going
to start playing with our deeper color
in this mix and that is the crease shade
here in the don't steal my thunder trio
and i'm going to be using my fine crease
brush from essence of beauty this is the
smaller of the two that come into duo I
find that brand at CVS first going to
just Pat that right on the outer corner
here and we're just going to pull that
colour in and this is more of
the application mode and then and then
we're going to blend it with a larger
breasts I like to bring it up just a bit
and out a little bit as well and then
I'm going to use that same brush since
it's so small picking up color just on
the tip so I just went right down into
the product like that and then I'm
taking that right over my green that we
put on the lower lash line now you can
bring in your larger bear fluffy brush
and this is where we don't want to see
any harsh edges so we just take it right
over the pulling back to the shade that
says brow bone dust this over all the
remaining skin next we're going to just
make it a little more interesting by
going back to our green and pick up a
little bit of that on your large brush
not too much and just lightly apply this
sort of on the border of our dark
charcoal shade and this is just going to
give the a little illusion of some green
kind of just coming up and one more
option if you really want to get festive
with this which I know not everyone will
but some people will taking the glittery
side of this pencil and I'm just doing
really soft quick strokes right along
this area under my brow and what that's
giving me is just a slight glittery
finna taking a little bit more the white
shadow then on a sponge tip and it's
really going to give you that light
frosty look up minor i'm using my
maybelline master drama pencil in
midnight master that's a deep black by
that right actually on the waterline on
the inner rim here then getting a ride
into that inner corner I'm going to take
this all across my upper lash line next
I'm going to curl my lashes then apply a
coat of mascara to your upper lashes i'm
using almaz get up and grow it's an
emerging favorite of mine I didn't like
it when I first bought it I'm not sure
why because I'm absolutely loving it now
I've had really good luck with several
al my mascaras and this one is just
really really nice gives your lashes
just a really nice too
find look but it builds a lot of length
a lot of volume so there's your mini
review I just recommended this to a
friend who texted me and said I need
some new I need to revamp my makeup and
this is one of the first things I
mentioned for a new mascara and a
longtime favorite for my lower lashes is
Maybelline lash discovery and with this
look on our lower lashes I mean we want
all the lashes to be kind of defined
kind of apply a little more
concentration of mascara to those outer
part to the outer part there because
it's going to be a nice fanned out look
because we're going to put on some
falsies here in a sec the false lashes
i'm using are the Select i'm going to
use automatic trim out trim off the
outer to kind of segments of lashes
there to make them really fit my i bet
and i apply my revlon precision lash
glue it has a great little wand here and
i just put that all across the lash band
and let that get tacky for about 20
seconds or so in a quick tip for your
false lash application i like to grab my
lashes right in the center of the lash
band and then when i put them on my eye
I just Center my finger up with the
center of my eye ok and then that's the
first part I concentrate on setting on
there ok the center is on then I use my
fingers to just place this right on top
of my eyeliner it's close to the lash
line as possible and then do the same
right on the inside just like that and
you're going to see a little glue as
that continues to dry but there's your
false lash application
I hope you enjoy this I look I really
love jewel tones this time of year on
the eyes I think holiday parties are a
great opportunity to play with color and
you know people might expect you to look
a little more festive so why not do it
through your I make used my Revlon lip
butter in strawberry shortcake so that's
going to be sort of your light pink base
to this look and then a great liner that
I've been enjoying alongside that lip
butter is the Jordana in baby beri just
a little bit deeper than strawberry
shortcake and then to give it more of a
high gloss finish I usenix mega shine
lipgloss in beige pearl just on the
center of the lower lip makes the lips
look a little fuller and just adds kind
of finishes off the whole sparkling
nature of this look so happy holidays
everyone we're really getting into the
season now so let me know if you try
this look like what color you would like
to use bet whether it's the green that I
used or a purple or blue or pink I think
any of those colors would look really
really pretty with this look so thanks
for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
