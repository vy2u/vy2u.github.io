closer to the holidays now and you can
expect a lot of glam party looks from me
but I wanted to do something today that
was sort of for those days where it's
cold outside you've pulled on your
favorite sweater maybe you're heading
out to do some last-minute Christmas
shopping or you're just cuddling up for
a movie for the day staying inside or
you just you know want something that is
going to make your features look really
polished but not over-the-top NOT you
know going nuts with the with the
metallics and the you know those kinds
of shades that I will be doing some of
that but that's not what this look is
about today this is about a very matte
brown shade that's being used all over
the lids to create an illusion of a lot
of depth and kind of a sultry look there
and then using a pop of the light
shimmery shade to really bring out the
eyes we've done it in the center of the
eyes it's a new technique for me and I
want to introduce it to you as well I'm
going to tell you how I got this lip
look as well that I'm really enjoying
and by the way guys I was kind of
messing around with the concept of how I
was going to do this look and I pulled
out you know I'm gonna use a little from
this palette and a little over here and
this and that and I thought let's make
it easy let's just use two shades of
eyeshadow readily available I'll tell
you what these are keep on why the very
first thing i did was applied my
smashbox photo finish lid primer all
over my eyelid it really neutralizes any
discoloration on your eye and then I'm
going to take on this shade from
covergirl it's called brown smolder it's
one of the perfect toned deep matte
brown shades out there so I really like
using this color just in an all-purpose
kind of crease way but I'm actually
going to be using it all over the lid
right now kind of a different approach
for and I look for me but I'm going to
just use the sponge tip applicator
because it really has a nice little
point to it that follows the shape of my
eye in that inner corner quite well so
I'm just going to pack that on here you
can see that nice matte finish just
building all over the lid this is a
pigmented shadow from covergirl they've
really improved I don't know if you've
watched you know a lot of my videos
in the past but I've noted how they have
really improved the the formulation of
their eyeshadows recently so i'm really
liking them and I'm just kind of see how
I've gotten the bulk of the product on
the lid and then I'm kind of looking
down into my mirror and lightly padding
around there just to kind of take the
excess that might still be on the
applicator and move it around you can
totally blend with a sponge tip you know
it's it's a it's a myth if someone's
telling you you can't i'm also going to
use my Smashbox number 15 brush it's
just a nice kind of full crease brush
and I'm going to get a little bit more
of that brown smolder on there and this
is just nice a nice brush for following
the natural shade or hair shape of your
crease here I'm not really creating an
outer V I'm just building that color up
and as the band as I get less and less
on my brush just continue to blend
upward and that will just kind of buff
right off and blend seamlessly there ok
we are going to come back to the brown
smolder momentarily but first I'm going
to move on to a lighter shade here in a
second I'm going to be taking a shade
called mink I really really love mink on
it just kind of a daily basis shade as
well what this is is a nice kind of a
cross between a light champagne shade
and a taupe it's just it it's a gorgeous
kind of you know as it hits the light
you mean you might think ok that's light
brown but no it's champagne and then
it's looking got that little hint of
taupe gray so it's a very
multi-dimensional pretty shimmery shade
that we're going to pair with this nice
dark matte brown and I'm going to use my
Coastal Scents mini contour brush this
is that teeny tiny brush a q-tip could
do this a small just sort of smallish
applicator a sponge tip could do this as
well but you'll notice on this I how
we've got overall darkness on the lid
except for in the middle we're getting
that little you know reflective note
that kind of makes your eyes really pop
and so we're going to do that over here
as well I'm just taking this at this
brush which gives me excellent control
and you can see I'm just dotting that
right there in the middle it almost
gives an otherwise matte shade a very
glossy look right there pack on as much
as you want but remember you're not
looking to blend this side to side
big-time over the top of what you're
doing just over the top of the middle
there okay looks really nice and then
you can also use that little brush to go
right in here i'm always a fan of
lightening up the tear duct a little bit
you can always do that as an end step
sometimes I do it at the end sometimes
that just for convenience i'll go ahead
and do this while i've just you know
used the brush for something else
another way we want to use Minka's as a
highlight so take any fluffy crease
brush I'm using my Sephora rounded
crease brush and this just blends
famously on top of that brown and just
go all the way up to your brow and
you're just going to get a really soft
kind of warm look here I really really
like this now we're going to go to our
upper liner and then we're going to come
back to some other things so this might
seem a little out of step but I know
that you you guys know I sometimes like
to do my liner and then kind of play off
of that for more shadow so I'm going to
take a brown liquid liner use whatever
you like but I find that the femme
Couture liquid liner from Sally's in
brown is an extremely smooth liner it's
very rich and creamy this is not the
type of liquid liner you have to go back
over again and again so I'm just going
to use that has a nice little brush tip
here and i just go all the way from
inner to outer corner i did not win this
out but i did gradually thicken it as I
got toward the end there so I'm looking
down into my mirror and just carry it
all the way over okay we've got our
liner we've thickened it out a little
bit at the edge and then just for the
purpose of going just like a fingernails
length in here i'm using my revlon
colorstay pencil liner in black brown
just to make this connection and make
this look though it is kind of smoky on
the bottom we want to make it look
finished
and we will be going over this but see
what I'm doing there I'm just kind of
making that connection they're getting
it nice and deep in the outer corner and
now what we're going to do is use an
angled liner brush this is my tackle on
liner brush from Coastal Scents we're
going back to the brown smolder and I'm
going to pick up some of that on the
brush and we are just going to go very
simply and easily from inner corner to
outer corner just topping off what we
just did there this is so simple i love
lining with with shadows i mean if it's
a shadow like this that's nice and rich
and pigmented that can handle it then by
all means go ahead and do that if that
is what you know the kind of softer look
you're going for so just touching up a
bit here there we go okay now like I
said I do want to go back to the brown
smolder and sort of a contouring sense
just kind of see what shape we're
working with with the eye now that we've
gotten the liner on there i'm taking my
essence of beauty fine crease brush one
of the smallest crease brushes i have
and deepening it up from inner quarter
I'm getting the shadow on there and then
I'm working it out in circular motions
and feel free to kind of dip it down a
little bit see how we're kind of working
around the outer corner of that of the I
just kind of really giving a nice halo
of color around the eye area now you
want to give your eye look a real close
assessment here I guess and see if there
are any other places you personally want
to highlight more if you feel like you
know since you've used some different
shadows and liners if you want to go
back and highlight what's right in the
center of your lid remember we want that
glossy kind of look that just makes the
eyes look open go feel free to go over
that or go over your inner corner I am
going to just touch this up just
slightly here just bring a little more
light to that area it's a it's such a
subtle thing and it's something I should
really I probably will work into my
videos
often because you can you can get darker
here in here and then that light right
in the center I like that and so what
we're going to do next is curl the curl
the lashes and then I'm going to be
putting on this mascara from be luscious
it is the gosh the name is escaping me
right now what the exact name is because
it's not labeled on the container but I
will put it in the sidebar for you it's
like the ultimate lash experience I
believe but it's got this tapered brush
and it just really lengthens and
thickens so I'm going to put that on and
I will join you with the finished look
at some suggestions for lips and some
finishing touches for the face
alright guys welcome back here is the
finished I look as you can see it's you
know i'm calling it hot chocolate
because it kind of makes you think of
the holidays and winter and things like
that but i think this is a hot look as
well because you could take this out but
this is sort of that look that kind of
makes you want to cuddle up in your
sweater and and feel warm and fuzzy and
you know it's just a very wearable
neutral look basically and another thing
that I like about this is that this
brown that we used here is it's so dark
I mean it doesn't scream brown if you
know what I mean like this you put this
on your eyes and it just gives you that
dark contoured natural look but it
doesn't make you think ok this girl
slapped on brown eyeshadow I mean it
just has that kind of natural earthy
darkness that I really like about it
some finishing touches for the face that
i would suggest um you know feel free to
contour with with bronzer the elf blush
bronzer duo from the studio collection
was what i use to kind of contour my
cheeks and then i use my Milani minerals
blush in my tie to get sort of this this
warmth going on on the cheek area and
then i want a little darker on the lips
just because i kind of like the way you
know even though this is a dark i look
we did kind of keep a little bit of
natural softness going on i mean it's
very deep but it's not over-the-top I
thought let's go a little darker on the
lips and the liner I use to get this
overall deep color is from NYC it's the
automatic lip pencil in naughty nude and
you're going to see here I mean you it
might make you think okay that should be
lighter but it's actually pretty dark if
I swatch it for you on my hand there
that's about how dark it really is so
you're going to get kind of a brownish
tone on your lips with this that's the
one I don't usually I don't recall using
very much in a lot of my tutorials but I
put that on topped it off with the elf
super glossy lip shine in mauve Lux this
shade is gorgeous because it's kind of a
deepesh burgundy that has sort of a
metallic finish the shade got an entire
blog devoted to it a while ago probably
i don't know more than
ago but got that's where I get that nice
gloss from and then kind of going with
the theme of the way our eyes are with
that nice hint of lightness right in the
middle that's exactly what we did with
the bottom lip just take a light
shimmery gloss that you feel can kind of
give you that see if I just stop talking
stop moving my lips room in it you can
see where the light really hits right
there in the middle I'm using the liquid
lustre lip gloss the liquid metallics
from be luscious and pink champagne
really it doesn't make me think pink at
all it's more like just a light pearly
nude color and just dot that right there
in the middle kind of use your finger to
dab it in there and make it kind of look
natural with the rest of the look but I
hope you guys enjoyed this look I had
fun putting it together like I said
there are many more kind of party fun
looks more festive and glam to come but
I think this is nice for every day but
it still looks very very hot and fun and
I hope you enjoyed it and thanks for
watching so much guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
