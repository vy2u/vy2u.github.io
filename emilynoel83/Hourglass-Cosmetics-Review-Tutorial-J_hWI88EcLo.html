review slash tutorial of a brand called
hourglass perhaps you've seen our glass
in your Sephora store or online at
Sephora calm but they have some really
cool products I was sent a few different
things to try an eyeliner and eyeshadow
duo and a lip gloss and you know I think
that there are some very very positive
points to this brand but it also is a
little more expensive brand so that's
something to keep in mind but basically
I'm going to show you how these products
apply and sort of review them along the
way and give you some final thoughts at
the end stay tuned till the end because
that's when I'll talk about this lip
gloss which is it's some pretty
phenomenal packaging so I'll explain how
this works the first thing I did I
applied a primer to this eyelid I used
my Urban Decay primer potion and then
I'm gonna get out my visionary eyeshadow
in this shade is in prison it's actually
an eyeshadow duo and as you can see the
packaging is very like me refinish
metallic and stuff and what's really
neat about this is that you open it up
and it opens up like that but you can
also spin this around this little mirror
or lay it down flat and there's your
shadow on the inside so it's kind of
like a 303 hundred and sixty degree
mirror there that you can just pop up
and use it you know however you want to
but ultimately it twists back down and
closes and holds clothes like that so
yeah I'm gonna start out you can see the
colors that you get here you get kind of
a metallic light blue shade and then you
get this really unique black that
actually appears to have like a navy and
light blue sparkle to it so it's really
interesting the I love the texture of
these eyeshadows I think it's amazing
how they blend together and even other
shades if you bring in other colors with
these they manage to blend it's just
they're very pigmented very soft but
they're not so soft to where you put
them on your eye and you've got fallout
everywhere you also get a small brush
with this set which as you can see yes
it is very small but it's actually
cut so that it is tapered the little
bristles on the sides are actually
shorter here than they are right at the
top and that's really a nice
consideration most brushes are just kind
of cut blunt straight across the top you
couldn't probably use them to blend
anything this I actually the other day
did the entire eye look just with this
brush but anyway what I'm gonna do first
is use this little brush to pick up some
of the light blue and I'm actually going
to just apply that all over my eyelid
here and as you can see I'm just kind of
using a patting motion because I want to
pack it on with as much intensity as I
can and it's just this gorgeous you know
doesn't take a lot of work to put on
pretty metallic tight blue so once I've
gotten it all over my lid then I'm kind
of wanting to pull it up into my crease
so this is not something I usually do I
don't usually take my lightest shade and
pull it all the way through to the
crease but I'm doing something a little
different with this look so yes as you
can see the lightest shade is going up
and what's interesting is because it's
so metallic even though that's the
lightest shade do you see how it almost
appears like there's been a contour
color put in there and that's just
because it's it works with the light so
well so you can take your lightest shade
put it all the way up through the crease
and it appears just because of the way
the light catches it that you've got a
darker shade in there I love the I love
that aspect it's really nice and then
I'm gonna take a fluffier brush I'm just
gonna use a crease brush from my
Ecotools brush set and just use that to
buff it out a little bit you're not
going to need to do a whole lot of work
with that though next thing I'm gonna do
is kind of clean off that brush real
quickly and go back using the same small
brush to the sparkly shade and for this
what I'm first going to do is just put a
little bit of that on the outer part of
my eyelid so I meet ooh look down into a
mirror and I'm using just a little
compact here and just kind of patting in
a patting motion just deepening that
outer part there I'm not taking it into
the crease at all although you could I
mean I
did a smokey look where I'd only used
the dark shade a while back and I just
you know smoked it out outer-v I mean
it's capable of a lot but I'm kind of
doing a more sort of wearable smokey eye
here for you today so there we go on the
outer half of the lid there then I'm
gonna take my small take any small brush
like even smaller than the one I was
just using almost more of a liner type
brush this one is from my Ecotools brush
set and just get a little more of that
dark shade on and kind of go right along
your lash line with that kind of deepen
up the lash line just a little bit more
it's gonna give the illusion of thicker
lashes and it's gonna also look really
nice when we lay down a more precise
liner on top of this it's gonna appear
to have like a just a little bit of a
smoky border so I'm just taking this
small brush and kind of just tapping it
along and go about 3/4 of the way in
with that then we're gonna take it
underneath same brush same dark powder
and just start blending that just under
the eye kind of make a little connection
there at the outer corner but then just
start blending it don't go back for more
product you don't need a lot a little
bit of this color goes a long way and go
to blend until you get about halfway in
down here now with that same brush kind
of clean off some of the dark and go to
the light shade this is gorgeous and
this is a step that is going to make
brown eyes really pop go under the eye
with that lighter shade about halfway in
it's smokey but it's if it's just
gorgeous light blue I mean there was a
reason why I mean I could quite put my
finger on it at the time but like in
eighth grade I loved putting light blue
eyeshadow on and there was a reason it
was making my eyes look different than
any other shade really did and I've kind
of gotten away from it but this palette
is definitely bringing me back so anyway
I've just put that on there
you know blend it out do what you feel
like you need to do there but that is
basically the smoky shadow look what's
going to enhance the
now is the liner and the liner is this
pin it's called the calligraphy liquid
eyeliner in Ebony it again has this
really neat kind of like I don't know
it's sort of like an earth toned
metallic finish that's kind of like the
way the pallet is - they're really
really gorgeous packaging I wonder a
little bit if maybe on this product you
aren't paying for the packaging a little
bit because this is a $32 product it
claims to be waterproof and the other
day when I was um I had it on I had a
swatch of it on my hand I took a bubble
bath I noticed that it had not come off
and I was like wow that's really good
but I touched it just gently rubbed on
it and then it did come off so it makes
me think that yeah maybe it can be
water-resistant until you touch it and
then that's all it takes to really break
it down so anyway it draws a very thin
line for some people that's gonna be
really good for me I like it to be just
a little thicker so you'll notice what
I'm going to do here as I use it and you
can see it's got just that tight fine
tip there I'm going to draw my eyeliner
just a little bit above my lash line
here see how I'm going up just a little
bit higher and that's gonna give me a
thicker line because then I can just
fill in underneath it so a little bit
more of a step there I guess to go
through it's not just one line if you
want it thicker you've got to kind of
cater to the product a little bit but
I'm basing this would be a great thing
for a cat eye it is intense and black
and that's great what I'm gonna do here
is kind of go extend it just a little
bit past my natural lash line see how
there's just a little tip sticking out
there we're to go ahead and blend that
right around here we're gonna bring
actually take this down this is
something I rarely do with liner pins
but this is the advantage I guess to a
really fine line because I'm going to
take it down and just bring it see how I
just brought it under the eye just a
little bit to deepen it up and really
make that give you great def
in there then what you can always do is
take a small brush again in with the
dark shadow shade and you've got ultra
smoky really dark and nice kind of going
back to the eye shadow now um I like I
like eye shadow duos and I think this is
a really really great one
can't complain one bit about the way it
goes on but I do have to bring in a
separate shade if I want to highlight
I'm using Mac shroom any light shade
it's not like we don't I'll probably
have a you know one light shadow we can
call on for a highlight but you couldn't
just pick up this palette and think
that's all the shadow I need for this
look so I'm just going to take a dab of
that this is kind of this white shade
appears kind of like almost gives you
that glossy Sheen there and I think it
really works nicely with the way that
metallic blue is on the lid so I'm just
putting it under the highest part of my
arch there next I'm going to curl my
lashes with my little elf eyelash curler
there then I'm gonna use actually a
mascara that I had from a lower glass
already it's the superficial lash
mascara in carbon and this was something
that came as part of a Sephora lash kit
the lash stash but I hadn't really used
it much until now and I was kind of
investigating other Hourglass products
but this is what the brush looks like
the formula is slightly drier than a lot
of mascaras I've tried I also like that
the tip gets smaller at the end because
it makes it easy to get into the small
places but anyway the formula is a
little more dry and that does allow I
feel like for a little more volume and
it does it separates the lashes more it
doesn't make them all bunched together
like sometimes I'm really wet mascara
you put it on and you look like you got
five eyelashes so that's the good part
about this it does separate and lengthen
and so I'm going to put that on and then
I'll show you the finished look
alright guys here is the finished look
just applied the superficial lash
mascara from hourglass and it's a really
neat mascara in that it lengthens a lot
it gives your lashes a lot of body but
it also it doesn't come off all that
easily like you kind it reminds me a
little bit of lash blast in that it's
not necessarily a waterproof mascara or
I don't think it claims it doesn't say
it's a waterproof but yet it is very
smudge proof and when you go to take it
off you have to try a little bit harder
to get it off so you know an eye makeup
remover might be a good thing to use
there but as a whole you can I mean you
can put it on your lower lashes like I
just gave a coat of that on my lower
lashes and it really lengthens them out
but it you don't have to worry that much
about smudging I mean I was out the
other day in some really hot and humid
weather and it seemed to hold up so good
reviews on that I again love the
eyeshadow palette it's so neat how that
whole packaging works they're very cool
and they're just so super smooth and
another thing I like is that you know
this is a somewhat like natural slightly
smoky look here that could be great for
a daytime but you can go so dramatic
with this shade right here I mean it is
awesome they blend so easily I mean this
is a great you know kind of splurge
product for you know you want to buy
yourself something nice or you have a
birthday coming up I mean this would be
a great thing to put on that birthday
list um so just can't say enough good
things about the way that shadow goes on
as for the liquid liner pin I got to
give it props for staying staying on my
hand a little swatch of it stayed on my
hand through like a 20 minute bubble
bath and did not come up until I went
like that so I mean it will last you on
your eyes you know you're not obviously
leaving your eyes submerged in water
continuously so I think that this is a
really great liner it's a very precise
liner it's probably more precise than
any of the drugstore ones that I have it
just seems to naturally give you that
finer line however this is not these
liquid liner pins are becoming a little
less of a special product because
are coming out more drugstore brands are
putting them out I think wet-and-wild
has one I know for sure Revlon Colorstay
has a really good one but I don't know
that they all probably last as well as
this one does but I mean you just kind
of got away it for you how important is
that for you the packaging is again
amazing on this but just keep in mind if
you do want like a thicker line then you
may want to look to some of those liquid
liners that have a little brush tip
applicator sometimes those you can give
just a little more pressure and get a
thicker line with these you just kind of
have to draw your line up fill in kind
of like I did if you want it thicker now
the lip gloss is awesome look at this
this is a really pretty like corally
pink shade and it has some golden
sparkle in it as you can kind of see
right here but is this not like the
coolest packaging is you've ever seen
four lip gloss I love it it first
stopped just to talk about the important
points of the lip gloss the color is
great they get that you're not gonna
like squeeze this out of the tube and
think oh it's gonna look awesome like
that and then it's like basically clear
no it is pigmented you get a lot of
shine and it's not sticky at all now
this lasted me thinking about like the
staying power for example yesterday I
had this on went to lunch definitely
needed to reapply this after I ate so
it's not necessarily gonna be one of
those super super long wearing but it
also has is very comfortable on your
lips and when you do take it out and
reapply it I mean you look awesome
because it's like oh this is the coolest
look nice packaging ever but basically
the premise here is it's got a neat
little cap and you just press this is
very like soft I guess you could say you
can really apply some pressure there and
then the gloss comes out the top like
that okay so you can apply that directly
on your lips sometimes I like get it on
my finger and put it on but this is kind
of curved to kind of fit the shape of
your lips so it is comfortable easy to
apply this could slip in a pocket or in
a purse so easily
Edie I just think it's adorable so that
would be how great of a light little
gift product would that be for someone
as well
so overall very positive thoughts on the
hourglass makeup brand it is a little
bit pricey I think especially where the
eyeliner is concerned just because this
isn't necessarily as unique of an item
as the quality of this eyeshadow is or
the lip gloss so anyway thanks so much
for tuning in for this video I hope you
enjoyed my application techniques for
these products and for more information
