hi everybody thanks a lot for joining me
for this video this one's gonna be a
little bit different I'm actually going
to be taking you behind the scenes of
one of my videos so you're gonna see
this one from a few different angles I
wanted to show you all about the
equipment that I'm using also my
lighting how I do the editing and all
sorts of things like that so these are
the things I get questions about a lot
so hopefully this video will answer some
of them I'm still a little bit decorated
for Christmas and I just like these
lights here so I wanted to keep them my
little Christmas tree is still over here
on the stool as well but I do want to
show you the lighting that I'm working
with most of the time when you see my
videos I have these vertical blinds here
and this is actually a great way to
manipulate the lighting in a room right
now the blinds are just kind of angled
as you can see so most of the light is
coming through right over here where the
video gets shot but if I want to direct
the light a little more this direction
over here and maybe I want to sit in
front of this wall now you can see I've
just twisted the blinds and this area is
more well lit than this area I've had
the opportunity to shoot in an area
where you have vertical blinds I think
it can be really useful for getting the
light directed to just the right part of
the room where you want it and another
area that I will use for light is my
makeup mirror here I'll try to sort of
stay away from using this lighted mirror
for videos because I feel like it just
isn't quite the right diameter anything
so I will try to steer clear of using
this as my sole lighting source for a
lot of my videos just because I feel
like it does warm things up too much and
then people say you look yellow or you
look orange or whatever so anyway I'll
only use that if I really have to yeah a
ceiling fan up here if I were to only
use light from above is my soul lighting
source it would cast a lot of shadows on
my face so it's great about
in front of a window is that light is
coming directly at you or what's nice
about being a friend of you know if
you're doing your makeup to do it in a
mirror where you've got lighting on both
sides as opposed to above you because
it's gonna give you that look the most
even lighting effect on your face so
when I'm shooting a video I use this
little mirror a whole lot so if I've got
my camera right over here on top of this
tripod I'm often looking down into this
mirror and I am using that to get a
closer look at my makeup application as
I'm doing a tutorial or whatever other
things I have on hand I mean I will
usually have the products I'm talking
about sitting right out here I don't
script anything in these videos I mean
the only cue card so to speak is the
next product I'm moving on to got my
brushes here I've got a coaster here
always so I have something to drink
I love this candle this is a wood wick
lavender candle but I've been enjoying
having on just while I shoot videos and
if you listen to it it actually makes
noise it's like a crackling fire so I
think that's really cool I keep these
wipes on hand because chances are during
a video i'm swatching something i've got
a lot of goop on my hands by the end of
the video sometimes so I've got that
there
I also keep packaging from different
products so I can quickly refer to the
details I know I could probably look
this up online as well but it's so quick
when I'm sitting here just doing a video
okay what were the details on the
illegal length mascara so I keep that
stuff around for a little while
almost all the time when I'm doing these
videos and this is almost a little
embarrassing I mean I am wearing like
the comfiest pants possible and slippers
usually so I mean I do not dress up
fully for these videos even though
that's the way it might seem at times
because it's just more comfortable like
today for 1:30 in the morning till about
you know noon I was in tights and a
skirt and I'm like get me out of these
things so when I'm doing a video I want
to be as comfortable as possible so the
only way to really show off what kind of
camera I'm using is to find another
camera to shoot this part of the video
with some using my iPhone here to show
you basically the
I have when I'm sitting here doing a
video so basically I have a monitor here
on my camera it's a flip around screen a
lot of cameras have them and so I'm
doing my video if you ever seen me
looking just a little bit off to the
side and not right here at the lens it's
because I may be checking to make sure
whatever I'm holding up or whatever is
you know actually coming into the shot I
set up basically consists of a tripod
this is a small kind of tabletop style
tripod that I got from Best Buy and my
camera is a canon vixia hf s 200 and
it's an HD camera I've had it for about
a year now I love it so much this
actually is a touchscreen here lies wise
I mean it's a type of thing you can kind
of fit your hand around but it holds a
memory card here so all of my video is
going onto that card I'm actually low on
battery so I've got it plugged into the
wall but there is a battery there's um
yeah that's basically how my video
making go now I do have another camera
that I use from time to time for my
still pictures it's just really easy to
basically hold in my hand and take a
picture of myself because all of my
shots that you might see in a tutorial a
still picture forgive me for not meeting
your great photographer because I'm
taking them all of myself so I used this
camera from Kodak for those and I've had
this one for quite a long time this is a
easyshare C 7-6 3 like I said I've had
it a while it's held up really well for
me anytime I'm taking a picture you know
I'm sitting here trying to take
advantage of the lighting that I have
through the window and I'm usually
holding holding it out here and and just
taking the shot just like that so that's
what it comes down to a you take
probably I don't know a dozen or so
pictures and just try to pick like two
or three or four of the best ones and
then I will add those into tutorial
because sometimes it helps to see it
from not just one camera's view which is
your video camera but to also see it
from just another
cameras view so I use this a lot I'll
also use this a lot for taking pictures
of things for my blog as well as the
camera on my iPhone which is actually a
pretty good still cameras okay now we're
in our bedroom and we have a little sort
of office nook portion of the bedroom
here where I have an iMac computer where
I do a lot of my editing so I edit on a
program called iMovie iMovie just tends
to come standard on a lot of Mac
computers I wanted to give you an
indication of how much I actually shoot
and how much gets used for example in my
latest video
it was my Maybelline kind of haul and
with you it is sort of the form they're
in so I want to demonstrate how that
works so things I'll be showing you in
this video are the Maybelline Dream nude
air foam foundation so basically there
you've seen you know some of the
finished products but down here this is
the raw video you're looking at is
everything but what has a yellow line
through it is actually what got used
what got pulled up into the actual
project happening up here so I mean as
you can see I shoot a lot I did
basically my full face makeup and I just
pulled little bits and pieces of what I
actually wanted to demonstrate on camera
Nell so I want to explain and I don't
think it's anything I've talked about
before but it's totally a TV news thing
and it's the the thought of saying three
to one before you go on with the next
statement you're gonna say so like you
may stop and start a lot throughout a
video and you're like I want to start
over and it's just a matter of 3 2 1 I'm
just gonna give a little review on
everything 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 and then
when you're editing I would just go
through here right 2 1 and 1 and then I
would cut that part so after app and
then I'm right at the start of a new
statement so it just kind of speeds it
up it's kind of hard to explain but
that's where that comes for uploading
videos on YouTube for me I'm shooting
them in high-definition so it's a very
large file and it
take like for my lap that maybelline
video it was more than ten minutes long
it took about four hours to upload so I
am constantly coming in I'll be checking
you know the status of the video there's
a little kind of progress bar that goes
across here and I can see what
percentage of the video is uploaded and
you don't want it to fail because then
you have to start over it yes I hope
this was somewhat useful for you getting
to see a little bit behind the scenes of
what I do here when I put a video
together in some cases it's very
complicated in some cases it's not
complicated at all if you have any
questions let me know down below I will
try to keep tabs on what people are
asking about a lot and maybe do a
follow-up blog on anything I forgot
because I'm sure I did forget some
things here just kind of to give you
some insight on how I go about making
videos I'm sure there are some other
people that have a much more advanced or
professional way to do it but this is
just what works for me so have a great
day guys and I'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
