so far mine's going pretty well I am a
little under the weather but I still
really wanted to do this video for you
because even though it seems like such a
common-sense topic when you think about
it how I review makeup you know it's
really not that common sense so when I
started to think about it more and more
I thought there are actually a lot of
different things that I'm thinking about
when it comes to testing the product
first off and then sharing a review so
there's kind of two spaces to it and
this all kind of came to me this past
weekend I saw a lot of family and an
aunt one of Tyler's aunts um she asked
me you know so how do you review makeup
and I was really kind of like you know
you would think that would be an easy
thing for me to answer but I was sort of
dumbfounded I was like well you know I I
try it I use it a lot I talk about how
it worked for me and the wallet line it
just came out of this kind of jumbled
mess and I thought I've got to just
write it down on paper you know for
myself how do I do this because it I've
been doing videos for more than four
years now I've got close to 700 videos
I've done a lot of reviews both blog
reviews and videos I thought this would
just be useful for viewers to know you
know what am I thinking about when I'm
trying to determine if a product is good
or not so I hope you find it interesting
if you know I'm sorry but I just wanted
to share this with you sure there's a
bunch of ways to go about reviewing
something I'm not claiming I have the
right way it's just the way that I've
been doing it and the way I like to do
it so that's what it is
but just starting off talking about
testing first off you want to read about
the claims this may be on the packaging
of your product or you maybe don't have
the packaging or it doesn't say so you
go online and you look it up you find
out what does the brand say this product
should do you know there may be bullet
points on the outside of packaging that
says something like you know it's gonna
lengthen your lashes by this much or
it's gonna wear for this many hours you
know those kinds of things are the
things you want to know about before you
start trying a product so as you try it
you can keep them keep it all in the
back of your mind about what it's
supposed to be doing and I wear the
product as it's intended to be worn and
this might sound really common sense but
I come across a lot of reviews where a
product was simply swatched and then
reviewed and I mean a swatch might tell
you color but it there's formulas to
think about they're staying power
there's other factors that you don't
know about unless you've worn it and
oftentimes it's gonna take me quite a
few times to wear something and really
know what I think about it I don't think
there has to be any hard and fast rule
in terms of exactly how many times you
need to you know be wearing this
foundation or or this lipstick before
you can develop an opinion on it I think
you're continuously developing opinions
on it and I think you can almost get
more accurate the longer you wear
something the more experience you've had
with a product and I think there are
some products for me personally it takes
me longer to get an opinion on it kind
of brings me to my other point here
which is considering the variables so
what are the other things I'm not trying
to get too scientific here like oh we're
doing a science experiment but but what
are the other things that are possibly
interacting with the product you have on
for example maybe you decide I'm gonna
try this foundation you're gonna put it
on top of a certain primer well was it
the foundation you didn't end up liking
or was it the primer you paired it with
you know there's these different things
that are interacting just kind of try to
isolate the one product I'm trying to
review
get the best opinion I might have to try
it multiple times with multiple primers
the blush that was giving me that look
or the bronzer did the powder do
something weird as it were throughout
the day or was that the foundation so
there's just a lot of things that you
kind of have to sort through try things
different ways and that can take a lot
the next part of reviewing something is
sharing it and that may happen for me
through a blog post or a video review or
something like that but the first thing
I try to do is describe the product so
just you know without my own opinions
thrown in what is it then I just try to
share what my experience was with the
product how did it work for me but being
careful to put it in context as in like
if I'm going to sit here and say gosh I
hated this foundation it only lasted
like three hours on me but then again
you know I have really really oily skin
or you know I hated this colorful
eyeshadow palette but I tend to only
really like neutrals so you kind of put
things in context with your preferences
your skin type your different qualities
so the outside viewer who's seeing it
can think oh well I don't have the same
skin type as him then they're able to
take a little bit more away from your
review and the claims of the product the
claims that you know I'm keeping in mind
as I'm trying a product then I'm gonna
see you know as I express my review
whether it's written or videos did it
deliver on those claims also you know I
kind of try not to feel confined by what
the claims might be sometimes products
do unexpected things good or bad
sometimes it claims to do one thing and
maybe you find oh but I've got this
really great little you know side
benefit in this way you know maybe this
mascara I didn't like using it on its
own but man was a great layered over
this other cup that's what you can offer
that a brand can't you know that's what
personal experience and that's what
makes YouTube great and bloggers and
reviewers great is that you know you're
hearing someone's personal experience
with so what outside of the basic claims
did you notice or or really stood out to
you something I've tried to do
especially within the past year is
demonstrate if possible I've gotten into
doing a lot more review toriel's I guess
you might come for me if I'm gonna watch
a video I'm gonna learn a lot more
probably if I watch the product being
used instead of just listen
to somewhat talk about and finally what
can I compare this product to I remember
you know and this is an easy example but
when I had the Naked 2 palette I
compared it to the naked 1 if I've got
something out there similar to what I'm
talking about maybe it's a drugstore
dupe of something that I would've met
maybe you compare it to something that's
been around a little longer that more
people who are watching your video might
already have and then when they see you
say well compared to this thing this is
a lot better and then it can be like oh
and then you know it's kind of like that
aha moment so it makes sense and if you
can make something click for somebody
like that that can more easily help them
make a decision to purchase or not to
purchase and ultimately this is why
reviews should be taken really seriously
whether or not all of us realize it on
YouTube or on blogs and things like that
but you know you are influential when
you're sharing your opinion you know
there's somebody out there listening to
that and they're gonna spend their
hard-earned money or not based on what
you say and I think I think review
should not be taken lightly I think if
you're gonna talk about something you
should definitely know what you're
talking about and one more thing I'd
like to mention before I go on my vlog
Channel Beauty vlog cast I've started up
my series on confidence building it's
based on a talk that I gave recently at
a teen conference but I really think
this applies to all ages and the title
was so long that I kind of brought it
down to call this my best self series
and it's gonna be six parts and pretty
much so I've started with part one
that's already up there on my channel so
if you want to check that out if you're
struggling with confidence self-esteem
issues just kind of achieving your
potential things like that this is just
kind of based on personal experiences
that I passed just want to let you know
that that's out there now I know I
talked about it when I first launched my
channel and now it's happening so thanks
for watching guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
