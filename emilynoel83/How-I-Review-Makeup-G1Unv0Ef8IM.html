so far mine's going pretty well I am a
little under the weather but I still
really wanted to do this video for you
because even though it seems like such a
common sense topic when you think about
it how I review makeup you know it's
really not that common sense when I
started to think about it more and more
I thought there are actually a lot of
different things that I'm thinking about
when it comes to testing the product
first off and then sharing a review so
there's kind of two spaces to it and
this all kind of came to me this past
weekend I saw a lot of family and an ant
one of tyler's ants um she asked me you
know so how do you review makeup and I
was really kind of like you know you
would think that would be an easy thing
for me to answer but I was sort of
dumbfounded I was like well you know I I
try it I use it a lot I talked about how
it worked for me and the blah blah blah
and it just came out of this kind of
jumbled mess and I thought I've got to
just write it down on paper you know for
myself how do I do this because it I've
been doing videos for more than four
years now I've got close to 700 videos
I've done a lot of reviews both blog
reviews and videos I thought this would
just be useful for viewers to know you
know what am I thinking about when I'm
trying to determine if a product is good
or not so i hope you find it interesting
if you don't i'm sorry but i just wanted
to share this with you sure there's a
bunch of ways to go about reviewing
something i'm not claiming i have the
right way it's just the way that I've
been doing it and the way I like to do
it so that's what it is
but just starting off talking about
testing first off you want to read about
the claims this may be on the packaging
of your product or you maybe don't have
the packaging or it doesn't say so you
go online and you look it up you find
out what does the brand say this product
should do you know there may be bullet
points on the outside of packaging that
says something like you know it's gonna
lengthen your lashes by this much or
it's going to wear for this many hours
you know those kinds of things are the
things you want to know about before you
start trying a product so as you try it
you can keep that keep it all in the
back of your mind about what it's
supposed to be doing and I where the
product as its intended to be worn and
this might sound really common sense but
I come across a lot of reviews where a
product was simply swatched and then
reviewed and I mean a swatch might tell
you color but it there's formulas to
think about their staying power there's
other factors that you don't know about
unless you've worn it and oftentimes
it's going to take me quite a few times
to wear something and really know what I
think about it I don't think there has
to be any hard-and-fast rule in terms of
exactly how many times you need to you
know be wearing this foundation or or
this lipstick before you can develop an
opinion on it I think you're
continuously developing opinions on it
and I think you can almost get more
accurate the longer you wear something
the more experience you've had with a
product and I think there are some
products for me personally it takes me
longer to get an opinion on it kind of
brings me to my other point here which
is considering the variables so what are
the other things i'm not trying to get
to scientific you're like oh we're doing
a science experiment but but what are
the other things that are possibly
interacting with the product you have on
for example maybe you decide i'm going
to try this foundation you're going to
put it on top of a certain primer well
was it the foundation you didn't end up
liking or was it the primer you paired
it with you know there's these different
things that are interacting just kind of
try to isolate the one product i'm
trying to review
get the best opinion I might have to try
it multiple times with multiple primers
a blush that was giving me that look or
the bronzer did the powder do something
weird as it were throughout the day or
was that the foundation so there's just
a lot of things that you kind of have to
sort through try things different ways
and that can take a lot
the next part of reviewing something is
sharing it and that may happen for me
through a blog post or a video review or
something like that but the first thing
I try to do is describe the product so
just you know without my own opinions
thrown in what is then I just try to
share what my experience was with the
product how did it work for me but being
careful to put it in context as in like
if I'm going to sit here and say gosh I
hated this foundation it only lasted
like three hours on me but then again
you know I have really really oily skin
or you know I hated this colorful
eyeshadow palette but I tend to only
really like neutrals so you kind of put
things in context with your preferences
your skin type you're different
qualities so the outside viewer who's
seeing it can think oh well I don't have
the same skin type as him then they're
able to take a little bit more away from
your review in the claims of the product
the claims that you know I'm keeping in
mind as I'm trying a product then I'm
going to see you know as i express my
review whether it's written or videos
achill II did it deliver on those claims
so you know I kind of try not to feel
confined by what the claims might be
sometimes products do unexpected things
good or bad sometimes it claims to do
one thing and maybe you find oh but I've
got this really great little you know
side benefit in this way you know maybe
this mascara I didn't like using it on
its own but man was it great layered
over this other kind that's what you can
offer that a brand can't you know that's
what personal experience and that's what
makes YouTube great and bloggers and
reviewers great is that you know you're
hearing someone's personal experience
with so what outside of the basic claims
did you notice or or really stood out to
you something I've tried to do
especially within the past year is
demonstrate if possible I've gotten into
doing a lot more review torial zai guess
you might call for me if I'm going to
watch a video I'm going to learn a lot
more probably if i watch the product
being used instead of just listen
to someone talk about and finally what
can I compare this product to I remember
you know this is an easy example but
when i had the Naked 2 palette I
compared it to the naked one if I've got
something out there similar to what I'm
talking about maybe it's a drugstore
dupe of something that I wanted men
maybe you compare it to something that's
been around a little longer that more
people who are watching your video my
already have and then when they see you
say well compared to this thing this is
a lot better and then they can be like
oh and then you know it's kind of like
that aha moment so it makes sense and if
you can make something click for
somebody like that that can more easily
help them make a decision to purchase or
not to purchase and ultimately this is
why reviews should be taken really
seriously whether or not all of us
realize it on youtube or on blogs and
things like that but you know you are
influential when you're sharing your
opinion you know there's somebody out
there listening to that and they're
going to spend their hard-earned money
or not based on what you say and I think
I think reviews should not be taken
lightly I think if you're going to talk
about something you should definitely
know what you're talking about and one
more thing I'd like to mention before i
go on my vlog channel beauty vlog cast
I've started up my series on confidence
building it's based on a talk that I
gave recently at a teen conference but I
really think this applies to all ages
and the title was so long that I kind of
brought it down to call this my best
self series and it's going to be six
parts pretty much so I've started with
part one that's already up there on my
channel so if you want to check that out
if you're struggling with confidence
self-esteem issues just kind of
achieving your potential things like
that this is just kind of based on
personal experiences that iPad just want
to let you know that that's out there
now I know I talked about it when I
first launched my channel and now it's
happening so thanks for watching guys
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
