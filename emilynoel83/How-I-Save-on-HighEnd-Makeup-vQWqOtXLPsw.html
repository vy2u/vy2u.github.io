different kind of video I'm not gonna be
really recommending specific products to
you or showing you how to apply them but
I am gonna be talking about makeup more
from the shopping perspective because I
love makeup and I love shopping for it
and whether it's drugstore which you
know I love or high-end I feel like I've
developed some kind of shopping
strategies to get the most value for
your money
and I feel like with the drugstore you
know we can identify that you know
something for two bucks or a dollar or
three dollars you know that's a good
deal but I think with high-end it can be
a little bit harder to identify when you
walk into a Sephora and one thing is
like 25 bucks and you're like gosh you
don't want to spend that and I feel like
I have this mental conversation every
time I look and I see that one thing
that I want and then I find a way to
sort of maximize the value that I'm
getting and get to experiment and try
more things and really get myself a
better deal you're not into really
experimenting with makeup you don't care
to build up a collection of makeup you
don't care to try a lot of new things
this may not be for you if you do want
to sort of expand your horizons where a
particular brands are concerned that
might be high-end I think this will be
informative for you
my first tip is to look for kits when
we're talking high-end makeup because
you will find some amazing values when
you start looking around for example and
what kind of brought this whole video to
my mind actually it kind of inspired me
to do this was I was in a Sephora not
too long ago and I was wanting to try
this particular eyeliner here from Tarte
and it's the Amazonian clay emphasize
like gel liner in black 22 23 bucks just
for this and this is full-size and I
just kind of thought man you know I wish
I didn't have to pay that and then I got
near the checkout area look what I found
I found this in with this with one to
three other products for 25 bucks so for
two or three dollars more than just
getting the eyeliner I got to try a
couple things I know I love actually
which is the lights camera lashes
mascara and the lip surgence
but I also got a cheek stain in there
for just a few dollars more and I just
thought my goodness and that's a 67
dollar retail value it says on here and
I've run into this a lot you know I'm
always looking for pallets and kits if
I'm in an Ulta or a Sephora or if I'm
looking at their websites and there's
one particular thing I'm after or a
couple of things you know you don't just
need to go through and say okay I'm
gonna get this one thing over here and
this here you know see what's already
been compiled into some sort of value
kit because usually those are really
good deals is something small if you're
just trying to test something out you
don't really know if you'll like it or
anything I had a blog I wrote about
several benefit primers and I wanted to
try the Porefessional and I didn't
really want to just get the whole big
thing I didn't even know if I'd like it
and then they had a little kit with
three minis that one and two others
altogether for ten bucks turns out I
didn't really like any of them all that
much but I'm not out that much money and
I'm getting to try you guys know I like
to try things cuz I'm always reviewing
things and I think other people are kind
of in my same boat sometimes because you
just like to try new for
I think I want to talk about this QVC
and I know some of you out there are
well aware PVC is a channel on TV and
you can go to QVC comm and they're
selling products 24 hours a day seven
days a week on there and they actually
have a really nice range of beauty
brands many brands that you know and
love from Bobby Brown to philosophy to
laura geller Tarte Malley the list goes
on and on I mean they have a lot of
brands available skin care hair beauty I
mean you check on their you're gonna
find a lot of the same things you find
in different high-end makeup retailers
if you stay up to speed on their today's
special values every day QVC has their
there what they're calling their best
value of the day it'll be featured
multiple times throughout the day they
have a beauty today's special value it
is almost always all full-size stuff I
know it's some kids from Sephora or
Ulta you know you you open it up and
it's like oh I didn't know everything
was gonna be this tiny but they will be
selling more often than not all
full-size things in this kit
usually it's somewhere between six and
eight products it usually comes in some
sort of bag or whatever but you know
every brand is a little bit different
but it's usually a lot of products and
it may cost you know somewhere between
forty to sixty bucks but you're getting
a lot of things for the price of what
maybe two or three might I just feel
like they're kits are some of the best
deals out there where high-end makeup is
concerned also there is an option there
called Easy Pay which is available
sometimes and that's basically splitting
up your payment's so for example that
big Smashbox mega palette that I know I
recommended like crazy around Christmas
time I just love that palette love the
eyeshadows that was a tremendous value
you can split that up I believe it's
available right now on Easy Pay I mean
you can't go to Sephora and say oh can I
not pay for all this right now can I
just pay for little fractions of it
throughout the coming months I mean that
doesn't happen so just something to be
aware of if you're if you've got a brand
you're interested in see if so see f QVC
carries it and you can like subscribe to
emails where you'll be updated when that
brand
today's special value also debut things
on there oftentimes with some of these
brands it is long before it's out in
stores like Sephora for example tartes
Amazonian clay foundation I tried that
months before that was out in stores
because they sort of premiered that
product and in today's special value
that I got so it's just definitely worth
looking into just worth staying informed
on I'm not saying every one of those
you're going to be interested in but
it's good to know about because then
that's keeping you from buying a bunch
of individual products which is the
ultimate I think money sucker you know
taking your money away when you get just
of everything individually so I'm Hugh
Lisi I want to mention something called
the test tube and this is something I've
gotten several times I have a whole
video where I showed what was in one of
them and I kind of reviewed everything
that was in there so if you want an
example of what one of these is like but
it comes packed with I don't know eight
or ten different products several are
usually full size they come out once
every couple of months every two or
three months I think they discovered so
many favorites through that I mean I
just think of like in my Emily awards
how many things that earned Emily awards
were things that I discovered from the
Beauty test tube that I absolutely loved
plus you get new Beauty magazine with
each one of those I mean I've heard of
what people's experiences have been like
with Birchbox and these different things
where you're getting sent high-end
samples and I got to tell you like the
stuff you get in the test tube is pretty
good stuff even when it's not full-size
and I mean the stuff in there is like
editor favorite you know top quality
selected things it's never just a teeny
tiny sample of something you have
great websites for discontinued products
and that's another way you can save on
high-end things sites like I'll link to
some of them below but there's a site
called like be flirt and I know it's
lots of markdown makeup products that
maybe you you mean you missed out on it
you know what it was kind of in its
prime but you think yeah I kind of want
to try that and now it's at a much more
discounted price through these websites
so those can be good places to look and
not pay the full price for high-end
makeup it's probably the thing that
everybody has already thought of before
as well but it's the gift with purchase
at your high-end beauty counters and
department stores if you buy you know
one maybe two things you can qualify
during different times for a whole lot
of other things on top of that you know
and these can make great gifts as well
that's something I haven't really
mentioned but you know when you do find
things in kits and maybe not everything
appeals to you you know if it's
something you maybe already have a lot
of and you want to give it to somebody
else you know these can turn into gifts
and other things those are my tricks for
saving money on high-end makeup or
getting the best value might be the best
way to put that you like it's part of my
life trying makeup and testing new
things out and I just really feel good
when I feel like I'm getting a lot more
for my money so I hope you enjoyed this
video if you've got any strategies to
share with me I sure like to hear them
so just put them in the comments section
below
and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
