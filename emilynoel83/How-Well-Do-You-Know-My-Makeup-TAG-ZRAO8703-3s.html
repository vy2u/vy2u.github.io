having so much fun today we did our
makeup in here and we did Beauty
broadcasts live this morning so much fun
on the day that we're shooting this no
um we've been talking and we've been
wanting to do some sort of fun tango and
so we thought about some ideas and we
decided this challenge would be fun so
you don't want to explain what our
challenge is going to be all right so we
decided that we would each pick ten
products from our makeup collections and
blindfold the other person they have to
guess what those products are just by
the Johanna feel so on
Emily channel so here you're going to
see me try to guess her makeup products
so you see how well I know her stuff
yeah and then over on my channel you'll
be able to see her guess some of my
major products might be a little easier
for her because I just need to travel
products with me but I did bring a lot
of my oh my god I think I'm gonna be
really bad I think I have two product
number one for Kristen I'll show it to
the camera first see if you all are
familiar with that
can you really I know I don't have this
I feel like it seems like it's one of
those like that rebel palette or
something that two-faced and I could be
accepting the product not touching the
mirror yeah I'm sorry no it's okay yeah
you can touch it hmm that's just a
little I'll get their brand not never
haven't seen that my best guess is says
let to face where I think is two-faced
rebel oh wait wait we may have a break I
still don't know my best guess is that
rebel palette okay what is it
it is the Tarte blush Amazonian clay
yeah I think if I would have actually
touched it
we might have felt the texture you know
what that's like Oh Mac so far I'm all
for one
alright next product this is the it
cosmetics I'm fairly certain because
this is rubbery the it cosmetics face
fire that came with the bye-bye pores
powder yes you know this brush I'm one
of those much well nice full brush
really nice crunch fun are you enjoyed
yes well I think I would have sent us
looking so devious over here on the side
like like you know that's what I thought
I would guess but it's not actually the
head that's what I feel like it is and I
don't know anything else has that shape
so that's my guess
I got look oh this is the dudes one of
the little greens the watermelon look at
like look look at it oh it's pink do you
like it oh it smells I like it it smells
it smells like bubblegum it's so good as
her next item do you guys know what that
is this is a Maybelline Color
sensational lip gloss and what color is
it the color guessing the go I want to
guess that it's very brilliant no but it
is but it is totally one of the colors
but the aid is blitzing up pink I
believe is this one yeah so I'm two in
one that's awesome
but you got that because I didn't think
of all the lip glosses that are I'm
gonna swear it off I say goes next
product and I'll show it
camera you can see you there L'Oreal
True Match splush want power what do you
think what do you feel like that is what
they what is your heart telling you that
my heart tells me that it's not a blush
or else.you Madge powder foundation no
no you said it earlier oh it is the
blush man no another thing but you
powder breasts out breasts powder first
of all yes you're right you're right and
they are very similar
she knows my stuff oh you're 3 out of 5
now not bad that's quite good that's
good okay I have a fear that when I do
this on Kristin's channel I'm gonna like
opener stuff up and then accidentally
like break awful I can quit the lip
product okay I want to guess essence but
it's too long no it's not angled enough
to you rim all my makeup hasn't gotten
this much action and I have to guess the
essence I know that Sonny but I don't
know what else okay take a look
oh this is the OL of the mouth I don't
even have one of these I was like sure
if you did or not it's the NYX matte
lipstick guy and that I forgot to longer
the shade is Alabama it's that nice deep
red but yeah it's got a little different
shape to check those up okay next up
guys this is what she is feeling
don't wanna ruin anything
no it's okay you won't okay oh it isn't
she says oh oh it's a very much change
in ya know oh the know what this is is
this the it cosmetics the new brow power
that I don't have I have the thicker one
yeah this is a skinny one yeah that's a
bit better skinny pencil it's got the
little tip on one end and then the brush
on the other you cats I'll help you
thank you thank you very much I'm so
excited I got you're doing such a good
job
oh my gosh okay okay here's her next
perfect
Oh a sniff test I'm surprised this is
the first sniff damn surprised myself I
feel like I need to ask a question as
it's been in your collection for less
than 12 hours
No malee shadow stick yes you are right
oh my gosh it's such a I mean the
packaging on this is so what am I trying
to say it's like it's like berry
naan was around the script exactly but
if there's a product that you love
mm-hmm it was a Mallee shadow stick do
you know what I get what why I asked my
question because she gave me Laura
Mercier caviar stick but it's in like my
nose I figure I think are more markers
that's the next one guys just wanting to
focus on Kristen back there and her
awesome blindfold okay here we go
any any initial thoughts a gel eyeliner
of some sort maybe or a cream shadow but
it's plastic I think essence has cream
shadows maybe it's a cream I don't
know
because the plastic I'm gonna give them
an essence cream shadow no why don't you
give it a look Oh mother you're his
space I've never actually has it yeah
benefit erased Facebook's shoot bang
okay this will be your last run or at
one two three four five and so five
lines and four not so much and so I'll
be the last I can't be 500 I have to be
about ficon okay guys sure the last
product I'm feeling the pressure
oh is this the
estee lauder madmen blush yes good yeah
guys this is the Estee Lauder madmen
limited edition blush the shade is light
show and I thought maybe the design
would be interesting yeah well I have to
pick up on but thank you yeah yeah six
out of ten not badly if you guys enjoyed
watching this maybe you can get together
with somebody and do it we're not good
just like have your husband braid your
slow though maybe bag of stuff for you
