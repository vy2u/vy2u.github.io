this video because this is about a
frequently frequently asked question
that I've answered to individuals so
many times and I figured it is well past
time to make a video on this to let
people know how to find the right shade
of foundation when you're in the
drugstore and you can't just crack open
every container you see you know it's
not the department store you don't have
you know a nice lady standing behind a
counter you know helping match you and
testing it on your face but yet there
are great great drugstore foundations
out there to be found but it doesn't
help you if you can't find the right
shade but there are two things two
factors that I think come into play when
you're trying to find the right
foundation number one is formulation and
number two is shade so you're talking
about the formula there are different
key words that you will see that can
kind of tip you off as to whether or not
that foundation will be right for your
skin type so if you have oily skin
you're going to want to be looking for
foundations that say something like
oil-free on them or maybe long wearing
all they wear a lot of times those kinds
of foundations that claim to be long
wearing such as like Revlon Colorstay
they make a formulation for combination
to oily skin and this is known to be a
very long wearing foundation and oil can
tend to break down products on your face
so you want something that can stand up
to that on all day wearing long wear can
be good for everybody if you're a normal
skin type you know that can be great for
you because I don't know anybody who
does want to be touching up their makeup
all day if you have dry skin some key
words that you'll want to look for are
hydrating this one Maybelline Dream
smooth mousse describes itself right on
the packaging as ultra hydrating cream
also refers to itself is a cream whipped
foundation that's something that's going
to be a little more rich a little more
thick maybe hydrating is going to give
back to your skin and there are some
foundations out there that claim to have
that hydration factor or maybe a
moisturizing fact this is not a
guarantee that just because you find one
that says oil-free and hey I have oily
skin that's going to work great for me I
can't guarantee that but I'm just saying
you're going to give yourself a better
shot at succeeding with that found a
if you can find one that's going to work
for your skin's needs the other thing is
shade and that's really the biggie that
I think a lot of people struggle with
and here's my tip if you're shopping in
the drugstore let's say I have tried
Rimmel lasting finish and shade 200 soft
beige works for me so you have a
foundation at home and you think okay
this is the one that's closest the
closest fit for me but maybe I want to
try something else
take this to the drugstore with you when
you're browsing through the foundations
there hold it up and decide does that
look pretty close to this shade you know
are those pretty similar well I want to
try Neutrogena Healthy Skin so those
look pretty close I think I'm going to
go for that and this is for my skin type
I wanted something with SPF so these you
know somewhat match now are you going to
run into obstacles with this absolutely
there's going to be foundations like
this that don't let you see inside and
fortunately this one claims to be
intuitive so it will figure out your
shade supposedly not really but that's a
whole other video you know it's not
going to work for every foundation but
there are so many foundations in the
drugstore that come in glass bottles
that you can do this comparison with and
then you might be saying but Emily I
don't currently have a foundation at
home that does work for me that's why
I'm going out and trying to find a
foundation because I have nothing that
works okay do you have something that's
a little off from what you need alright
I had this foundation at home this is
fresh beige from Revlon Colorstay this
is a little bit light for me right now
you can still take this to the drugstore
and use this as your frame of reference
maybe I want to hold it up to this okay
I think I'm going to try a different
kind and I know this was too light so if
this is what I'm using currently and
this is too light and this comparison
you know this one's darker that's the
one I'm going to try I'm going to try
that shade so it's basically about
knowing just knowing if what I have
currently is just right too light or too
dark so you can take it in the store and
make the comparisons because I know how
hard it is to
see a big lineup of all kinds of
foundations and you're looking at you're
like where do I stand here so you have
to get some sort of basis about where
you're at and so and if you've never
tried foundation before if you have none
at home you're going to have to do a
little trial and error with this I'm not
sure that there's anybody out there that
maybe his 100% has a total winning
record with drugstore foundations
because I know I've gone through a lot
that haven't been just right and if they
aren't just right I might save it for
another season or there are a lot of
stores that have return policies as
bottom line if there's something you've
tried and you're frustrated and it
hasn't been right for you just try to
decide is it too light is it too dark
and another thing to think about is it
too pink is it too yellow you know if
you can just make the determination of
what's wrong with that foundation you
can take that to the store and you can
use that as your comparison guide there
are so many awesome drugstore
foundations out there if you're wanting
a mini mini mini review here I love
Rimmel lasting finish for a great long
wearing foundation that works well for
most skin types Revlon Colorstay has a
couple of formulations for dry skin or
oily skin if you like a little bit of a
dewy finish something a little more
luminous Revlon Photoready I really like
that as well anyway thanks a lot for
watching please share this with people
in your life that have struggled with
finding the right foundation shade and
have a great day see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
