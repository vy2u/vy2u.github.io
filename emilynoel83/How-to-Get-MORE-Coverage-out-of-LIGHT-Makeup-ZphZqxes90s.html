roll around we're usually looking for a
little more lightweight approach to our
foundation concealer powder that whole
routine and so that's kind of what I
wanted to focus on in this video except
I think sometimes the thing we run into
is just because we want something more
lightweight on our skin it doesn't
necessarily mean we want to let go of
the coverage we've come to expect and
enjoy from certain products maybe during
the winter months or really you know
whenever so I've kind of been working on
some tips and tricks for how to apply
those more lightweight products and
still achieve the maximum coverage level
they can deliver even if you're not
using the exact products I'm mentioning
in this video I think this is really a
technique focused things really all
about the brushes and just the method of
application as you put these things on
that can really be the difference
between a lightweight product just
melting into your skin and not even
really being visible and actually being
something that has some coverage and
with my finished look I mean I feel like
I've got nothing next to nothing on my
skin I really have chosen some very
liquid consistency lightweight products
and just built them up in a way that
gives me more coverage so to start
things off I got my skin moisturized
really well I also had applied some of
this Garnier 5-second blur and mainly
did that over my t-zone that's a good
product to use anywhere where you have
visible pores you know the nose the
sides of the nose I think this makes
foundation go on really smoothly and if
you're combo skin or have a tendency to
get oily in certain areas which for me
is the t-zone this is a nice little
thing to throw on there I don't think
it's an absolute necessity for everyone
but just something I like to do and I'm
using my Estee Lauder perfectionist
youth infusing makeup this has an SPF of
25 and I am in the shade two in one
desert beige and this has a pump to it
it's a really great foundation it's
super light on the skin I think it gives
a really natural skin like finish but
I've noticed I get really different
looks depending on how I apply it
fingers is one way a sponge is another
way at buffing type foundation brush
gives me a different kind of look and
something I've really realized is with
very liquidy consistency foundations
this there is a certain brush that I've
just fallen in love with and it's this
brush from Tarte and it came with my
found a sealer I think this is actually
called the found sealer brush and that's
a pretty liquidy foundation too it's
probably a little bit thicker than
perfectionist but I absolutely love the
shape of this it's very unique and it
really like Pat's on the product and I
think that's really the technique you
want to try if you want to get maximum
coverage out of something that's kind of
thin and liquidy because I feel like
sponges actually soak up too much of the
product so all in all I probably used
one and a half pumps of this foundation
all over my face and I paid special
attention to the areas where I wanted
the most coverage which would probably
be the under eye area and around the
nose where I have a little bit of
redness but basically spreading it out
everywhere and then I take the found
sealer brush and just Pat that over the
areas literally just patting it I'm not
making sweeping motions with it
whatsoever and that's what's really
maintaining coverage like I said around
the eyes the nose wherever you need it
most
and then where I need a little less
coverage that is where I kind of sweep
it and spread it out pull it downward
you know under the jaw so we have that
nice blended look around the hairline as
well but this has just been a fabulous
brush for this foundation and any others
that I think have a really thin liquid
like consistency and I think the end
result is a very skin-like finish next
up I want a little coverage on the under
eye area so I used my benefit array
space you might be thinking whoa whoa
whoa I thought were talking like thin
lightweight makeup this product actually
if you use this very sparingly I think
it has a very lightweight feel on the
skin and I'm just using the tiniest
amount to target any areas where I am
the darkest around my eyes so inner
corner kind of under the eye and I just
pressed it in with my finger and I do
think that melts the product down
somewhat I'm still maintaining coverage
with it but I only intended to use a
little bit of this product so I'm
keeping it very light with that method
of application then a product that I
think is the queen of lightweight
concealers is my Maybelline instant age
rewind and I have this in the brightener
because this is a step where I want to
kind of take the high points of the face
and just lift them
a little bit more and I love this
because I do think it kind of makes my
skin look a bit more glowy but it's not
with shimmer or anything like that it's
just the fact that this shade is gonna
be so much lighter than everything else
on my skin so I just dab that around
down the nose sort of a little bit
center of the forehead tops of the
cheekbones upper lip chin and then
blending it out is key to maintaining
the coverage I think you want to use a
brush that might be a little bit larger
than your typical concealer brush I love
this one from up and up it's called the
round foundation Oh current brush like
this that they're selling same shape of
the brush and everything but it's like a
silvery handle but it's still out there
on the market and again with the patting
motion I just like to Pat this right
over that brightener that I've put on
really buffing that in or sweeping left
to right with this kind of a brush it's
gonna thin that product out a whole lot
but just patting over it you're gonna
maximize your coverage if this is the
queen of lightweight concealers this is
the queen of lightweight powders this is
the most finely milled loose powder that
I have so it's really great for the
under eye area
it's my Ben Nye luxury powder in the
shade cameo which is pretty light it's a
lighter than any face powder I would put
all over my face but it's just perfect
for setting the under eye area no I want
to still maintain some of the brightness
I had going on this is not a shimmery
powder this is completely matte and it
just works really well to take away any
tackiness that any of those concealers
left behind so when I'm patting this on
I like to use what basically is like a
jumbo fluffy crease brush for the eye I
use that on this area because it does
add some coverage out of this product
but not too much it does not lay on the
powder too thick because it is a pretty
wispy brush you'll find it's functional
and that your concealer is no longer
tacky but your area looks nice and matte
and even finally for all over the face
something I've recently reviewed on the
Express channel and a new total love of
mine is this Estee Lauder Double Wear
loose powder I have this in intensity
2.0 and I love how customizable this
product is because I think you could
apply this like a powder foundation get
really good coverage in this product in
itself and also over foundation in just
a very lightweight manner you can
still add coverage with just a minimal
amount of product so I like to use this
with my elf complexion brush just
tapping a little bit into the cap and
then dusting this all over the face
using kind of a dabbing approach over
any areas where I want the most coverage
and then you can kind of sweep or buff
this around other areas where that's not
so much of a concern so that's basically
the foundation the concealer the powder
routine where I feel like I'm getting
such a lightweight feel on the skin it
really doesn't feel like makeups on
there at the same time I've worked these
products in such a way where I feel like
I'm still getting good coverage on the
skin so I love that if you're curious as
to what else is on my skin I just
followed up with a little bit of bronzer
just kind of around the hairline the
cheekbones use two faced chocolate
soleil there and then on my lips and
cheeks I use this venable I've never
tried this on my cheeks till today
normally I just used Benetint if I
wanted that kind of look but I use my
ELF small stipple brush on the lips I
had on a little bit of Mac rural lip
liner which is very neutral and then
just topped it off with this so I've got
kind of that rosy neutral effect
happening I didn't mention what was on
the eyes I'm trying out this showstopper
palette from Tarte Alive you asked me
about this after I reviewed the Poppy
picnic palette over on the other channel
you're like how does it compare to this
one so now I'm trying this out and let's
see I put this shade on the lid a little
bit of this highlight around the inner
corner some of this matte bronzer in the
crease and let's see a little bit of
this warm brown in the crease as well
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope this video was useful as you head
throughout the spring and summer months
or really any type of year and you just
want that really lightweight feel on the
skin but still some coverage out of your
makeup so thanks again and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
