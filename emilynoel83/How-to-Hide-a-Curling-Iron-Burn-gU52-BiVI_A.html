by my youtube channel had a little bit
of an issue while I was getting ready
this morning I was getting ready to go
to work to do the news for the morning
show and I am curling my hair with my
curling iron and my curling iron hits me
right here like on the collarbone area
and leaves a red mark this is the mark I
have right here doesn't look too good
might resemble something you know
somewhat of a hickey there so not
something we want to be walking around
with especially if you're on the news
and guess what it was also picture day
today so we got our pictures taken for
the website and a few other things and
so this was not something I wanted
showing and I got to thinking you know I
need to cover this up and somebody on
Twitter actually said yeah how do you
cover that up you should do a video on
it and so I'm like well why not you know
this is a random thing that can happen
to anyone who is curling you know longer
hair you know just getting the curling
iron anywhere around your face you know
you just have to be careful and it's
easy to just do that stuff without
thinking and then you hit yourself
whether it's on your arm or your your
face god forbid or your neck
so um just thought I would go ahead and
share some strategies for dealing with
that one thing obviously you can do is
if your hair can cover up that area
that's great or like for me today my
jacket actually covered that up you can
see the mark right there and my jacket
just kind of came right over that so I
was you know kind of out of the woods
with this problem but now I am still
left with that mark there from my
curling iron burn which is you know it
was very warm too it was it felt really
hot for like a couple of hours after I
did this so first thing you want to do
is put some sort of like um
aloe vera type gel on there something
that can just kind of cool it down and
just lessen the feel you know lessen the
discomfort you're feeling so go ahead
and do that or some kind of lotion and
once you've got that on there I would
recommend taking a concealer that is not
too thick something that you know may be
able to spread over a little bit broader
area like this which you know is larger
than the size of a typical zit so you're
going to have more product on
if you want to conceal this area so
basically I'm taking a more liquidy form
I'm using my Maybelline mineral power
concealer so it comes in one of these
containers and these tend to be you know
not quite as thick and creamy you don't
want a cake you look you know especially
like right here where you don't usually
wear makeup so what I'm going to do is
just sort of dot this on just dot a
little bit of that on the inner I'm just
going to basically blend that in and if
you have a concealer that is just a
little bit darker you know something
that maybe wouldn't necessarily work for
under-eye or your skin tone has changed
somewhat you know that may be something
to do here so I just patted it in you'll
notice I wasn't doing a real rubbing
back and forth motion
I just patted it in and looking I'm kind
of looking in my own mirror right here
in front of me and I'm not able to see
it really as much it's I mean this area
was where that was and now it's
basically gone and so to kind of go over
that and make this really look natural
and this is something I do anyway for
the news because I feel like I have a
decent amount of face makeup on one
everything to match so I might take a
little bronzer and just dust it you know
on my decollete area so I'm using just
my NYC sunny just a cheap fluffy kabuki
brush the fluffy are the better so you
can really get this thinly dispersed
over the area and just kind of blend
some of that right over the affected
basically to sum it up don't use a
concealer that's going to be too thick
and creamy remember you're covering you
know sometimes sort of a broad area if
you if you hit yourself with that
curling iron you know you could really
do some damage there on your skin so use
something that can evenly spread out and
underneath that use some sort of like an
aloe gel or something that can also help
the feel of your skin then take just a
light sort of bronzer or really any
powder you want to use but I just kind
of use this because it's what I'm used
to NYC sunny a fluffy brush you don't
want that color too concentrated and you
don't want to take away the things
you've done with the concealer to
neutralize the area but just dust it on
over the top and now as you can see that
area is hardly noticeable and of course
if you have
with any of this or you don't have the
products you need on hand you can do
something with your hair or you can do
something with your wardrobe to sort of
cover that up so thanks for tuning in
for this video guys and I hope you have
a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
