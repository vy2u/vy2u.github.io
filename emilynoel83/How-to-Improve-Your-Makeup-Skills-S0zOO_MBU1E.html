day so far I've got to start out this
video by giving a shout out to Hannah
Osbourne
she has been active on my Facebook page
not the beauty broadcast one but the one
that's kind of an extension of my friend
page facebook.com slash Emily Eddington
TV and she got on there and was telling
me about how she gets ready for school
every morning and will when she gets
ready she'll watch a video and so I just
thought that was really sweet so thank
you so much Hanna for watching and thank
you to everybody that makes me part of
their daily routine as well so I'm
excited to share this video with you
because it's really kind of basic but I
hope that the insight I give in this
video you find to be extremely helpful
and I must start off by saying I am
wearing my I love makeup shirt so I got
to get in the right mindset here because
this is all about tips for getting
better at makeup tips for improving when
it comes to being your own best makeup
artist you know what I mean
I'm not talking about how to be better
at doing someone else's makeup or how to
you know this or that it's nothing
specific it's just how to get better at
doing your makeup because I got to
thinking about my channel and what
people actually see on my channel and if
you go back to my early videos I mean
what it is is really an evolution of
someone someone's makeup skills you know
I don't feel like I've reached any sort
of professional status right now but I
mean I feel like over the years that
I've been on YouTube since November oh
seven I feel like I've gotten better at
some things and some of thats from
practice so that's from learning from
other people and all kinds of if you
have the interest level there and you
have the desire to get better at doing
makeup on yourself I want to give you
some tips that I hope you can use and
these are five basic tips so number one
study and find inspiration okay so there
are so many resources out there to help
you with your makeup you got YouTube you
got so many great books there are
wonderful bloggers out there so just
kind of
you have spare time let yourself kind of
browse around and look at different
techniques different ways of doing
things and you will find inspiration in
the way other people have done things
and you know how you can put your own
spin on that and I will sometimes as I'm
sitting by my computer I will have a
notepad there I'll have a legal pad and
just kind of use this to jot down you
know any little thing I see maybe it's a
product I saw that's that I saw somebody
used and I really liked it
there's someone mentioned an interesting
website or somebody you know gave a
great application tip you know I am
always taking notes and still to this
day I mean I'm always always going
through this learning process so know
that you always want to study and you
always want to be taking in new
information you don't want to reach that
point where it's just like yeah you know
I know at all because makeup products
are always changing makeup techniques
techniques can always be changing so
that's just something to think about
number two is practice makeup is not
some god-given skill that just because
you may be a woman or you may just have
the interest level doesn't mean you know
how to do it and it doesn't mean you're
just going to be graced with some
amazing inherent ability to be good at
it so it does take practice and I always
recommend to people if you have if you
if you have some day on a weekend or
it's an off day that you have and you
have a couple hours maybe that you can
just sit down and not care about getting
out in public or getting out in front of
anybody but just sitting down at your
mirror and messing around with some
products and just trying totally
different looks you know you've got to
give yourself an opportunity to
experiment every time you put on makeup
should not necessarily be a time when
you have to go out and be thinking oh
well you know maybe people think I look
weird with bright pink lipstick so I
don't want to do that you know you've
got to allow yourself some opportunities
to just do whatever you want to do so
that comes under the heading of practice
number three don't go on autopilot
autopilot is a dangerous thing I think
we get into this in so many parts of
life you know and sometimes it matter
more than others it's okay to probably
go on autopilot while you're washing
your dishes or you know you're cleaning
off the stove or different things like
that I know what it's like to go on
autopilot while you're reading the news
that's the worst thing of all because
sometimes you know your mind may be
preoccupied with something and yes it is
it is something that can happen when
you're reading the teleprompter and you
realize oh my gosh I am just reading I'm
not really thinking about it it's like
when you're hearing a person talk versus
really listening to what they're saying
okay so when you're doing your makeup
don't just always sit there and think
okay foundation blush mascara you know
kind of us your if you're trying to
improve and you're trying to get better
at it be conscious and aware of the way
you're putting on different products and
you know does that look better did that
look worse you know you've got to be
continually making little assessments on
how you're doing it not just slapping it
on there and again this is my advice to
people who want to get better if you
really don't care about getting better
than you know brush this aside but these
are things that I feel like I have done
over over the years to improve my skills
someone number four vary your products
don't always reach for the same exact
thing and with the quality of fantastic
drugstore products that are out there
you know you may be able to afford to
you know find that buy one get one free
deal take advantage of trying a new
lipstick share trying a new blush shade
you know I'm not saying you know go out
and spend money you don't have for
anything like that that's not what I'm
saying at all but sometimes it just
comes down to looking in your collection
and saying I never reach for that why is
that why do I never try that eyeshadow
shade why don't why do I use and you
know nothing but black eyeliner so
you've got to start to work out of the
box because sometimes you will realize
oh my god this is like the perfect color
for me and I never thought about it
because I never reached for it I got in
that habit I've talked about getting in
a makeup rut that's kind of what I'm
referring to it this one and number five
is take pictures and possibly even take
video and of yourself and you know I'm
not just speaking to people who want to
be YouTube gurus or anything like that
that's not specifically who this is
targeted toward at all this is targeted
toward the everyday person that wants to
get better and doing their own makeup
and even if you don't you don't have a
professional camera or something like
that if you've got a phone and you know
occasionally occasionally after you get
done doing a particular makeup look snap
a picture of it and then take a picture
of the next day when you try something
totally different look at the to see why
do I like this picture better than this
picture you know what did i do
differently what could I have done
better
and I'm not saying be critical and pick
yourself apart because that's not what
this whole thing is about it's about
having fun and learning and improving
but so you can't beat yourself up about
it or else this whole thing stops being
fun and that's what I hate to see when I
do see people that will post videos and
then you know somebody's nitpicking them
on one little thing or another it's like
why can't we just encourage people
because everybody's just trying to get
better and and let's just be supportive
but you be your own biggest fan instead
of your worst critic but try to assess
things and try to look at things kind of
step out of the picture for a second and
think okay and I did this makeup look I
did this makeup look oh hey they're both
pretty good you know but I think I'm
gonna try doing more of this strategy
than than this other one so that's what
I'm trying to get that's my five points
on how to get better at doing your own
makeup and again this is not geared at
any one particular area of people but
these are just some things that I found
over my time doing makeup
ever since back in you know seventh
grade or something like that
eighth grade I don't even remember
exactly when but ever since that time
these are the things that have kind of
made a difference for me and I think
these hold true for any person any skin
tone any you know any background whether
you're just starting now or whether
maybe you're in your 50s or 60s and
you're just picking up your first makeup
brush so thank you so much for taking
the time to watch this I hope it was
helpful for you and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
