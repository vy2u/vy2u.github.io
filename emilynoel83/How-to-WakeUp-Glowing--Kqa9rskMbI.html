this video hope you're having a great
day this is just going to be a real
quick tip for you it's sort of an
obvious concept I'm not really coming up
with something super groundbreaking here
but it's something I've been doing for
the past few weeks and I wanted to pass
it on to you because I've enjoyed the
outcome of what i've been doing which is
basically doing a little sunless tanning
on my face before I go to bed and then
you wake up and you've got a little more
radiant skin especially if you do this
for several days straight now i'm using
a tanner that does not have a built-in
bronzer so it looks just like a white
lotion basically it's the tan white
sunless facial tanner comes in this
little container it's a 1.7 ounce
container it comes from Sally's they
have a whole line of tan white stuff
this is the face tanner and anyway it's
not too thick or rich I wouldn't
necessarily feel good about sleeping and
something that was just too too thick
because I have kind of like combination
skin as it is but I put that on before I
go to bed you wake up you wash your face
of course in the morning and things just
seem a little bit a little bit more
radiant this is not going to be a
drastic deep dark tan and you don't
really need to worry about streaking
this reminds me of like the gradual
tanner stuff even though it doesn't
really come right out and say gradual
tanner on it I have not wound up with
any streaks on my face and I have not
been exactly the most careful about how
I put it on I was the first time and
then I realized okay this isn't going to
do anything to major so but if you use
it like I said for a series of days you
are going to see some nice results just
a little more glow to your skin a
slightly deeper color um and that's just
really nice because it's wintertime we
want to keep our skin looking lively and
fresh but we don't want to tan an
unhealthy way if we can help it and at
least I don't and so this is just a good
solution for me um if you do have like
maybe some some skin problems that you
feel like you need to treat with your
particular moisturizer when you go to
bed and you know you this may not be for
you but if you are just kind of using a
general night cream right now and you
would like to try this out I just would
recommend it
what's nice about it is you would wash
your face and then you can start off the
day using your moisturizer that has SPF
in it or your foundation with SPF and
this is kind of you know gone but it's
done its work while you slept and this
does not have SPF in it that's why I
kind of want to make a point to say you
do it overnight and then you can use
your products that have SPF in terms of
exfoliating you should always it before
you start a sunless tanning regimen like
say if you were going to do this for
three to four days a week which is what
i would recommend you know if you could
do it every day of the week that would
be fine and you would really see some
results but three or four days i think
you are going to see it add up
especially if you do consecutive days
but exfoliate before you begin that
process so you're really getting rid of
the dead skin cells and then while
you're using this like i will still use
my face wash cloths with which i think
still have some scrubbing action but
it's not to the extent of where if i
used a face scrub and really scrub my
face it's not quite as intensive and
exfoliation so the idea is that you're
removing those dead skin cells the tan
will last longer and then you don't
necessarily want to scrub scrub scrub
while you're in the midst of a tanning
um what do I want to say tanning process
I guess so anyway guys that's about all
I have to say about it it's just I just
want to give you a heads up I've been
doing this I've been liking it and if
you want a little tip for just gaining a
little radiance in the winter blah kind
of months maybe you should test this out
if you know of another good sunless
facial tanner let me know this is just
one that I've enjoyed because it doesn't
have the built-in bronzer I do like
those but I would be more prone to using
those maybe during the daytime basis I
don't really see a point in putting a
going to bed and needing to be bronzed
as I lay there so um anyway guys thanks
so much for tuning in and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
