hey we just went through the painstaking
process of trying to get a video shot at
night 3 even a little lighting from our
laptop computer in town ears so we're
doing the boyfriend / husband tag for
Tyler it's the husband tag same
questions just he's a husband you should
know I guess homework staff any
questions this is it's gonna be long so
I will have to try to get through this I
guess the way this goes is I will ask
the questions and Tyler will try to
answer them so all right first question
is where did we meet where did we meet
remember the first time I saw you
when was I was in the weight room once
you were lifting with the cheerleaders
and I was just in there working out the
football I think I remember that too and
see the situation was Tyler had moved to
our kind of it wasn't the exact same
high school but when we were together
for football so it was like you know you
knew you always knew who the new kids
were you didn't have to know a big
family so anyway you just kind of knew I
was cheering with one of his sisters and
so it was just kind of like I knew of
Tyler and you know he was like the
tallest God - what was our first date we
went to a movie the saving Silverman I
remember and I believe after that we
went to a nice fancy restaurant with
Randy's oh my god that was nice where
was our first kiss and how was it
was it it was I remember I remember it
was in I was dropping you off
you're dropping me off back home or
Explorer we had been doing this we had
been in a get a basketball tournament or
something he would not when you were
playing
no it wasn't watch my friend who was in
the 3-point shooting competition oh yeah
and then we watched a little bit of the
game okay
and I remember this kiss very well
because I believe I initiated it it was
one of those like we're sitting there
okay goodbye and then all of us that I
just kind of first shot I went for it
Oh people have asked if your Shire Tyler
really once you get to know him he's
just not he's not um I think basically
Tyler kind of bucks the stereotype of
some big guy that's gonna come in and be
all along in your face yeah he's a
little more you know a little more
reserved but anyway I went in for the
kiss
and it was all history from then on you
know that I was the one no I decided to
marry I still have no idea boil it down
to a specific moment fairly early on the
first impression your first impression
of me first impression so I guess we
gotta go to the back to one when I first
saw you we're Bank alive years here keep
in mind we are now 20,000 2099 we are
now 26 years old and we had been dating
since our junior year of high school
like back in the 90s anyway first
impression first impression so since
we're in the waiver and you're quite
strong survive mr. belman physically
strong I am stronger than people think
you're very beautiful Oh beautiful oh
that's sweet when did you meet the
family before every question you asked
yourself if you would get the impression
that Tyler's like not a super talk it's
behind you should have been you should
have met Tyler back in like when I first
met him because there's a period of time
where Tyler was brought out of his shell
and that was the start at that time I
think but yeah he had picked me up for
the sweetheart dance it was the first
dance we went to and that was kind of
when he came in and got me and my sister
was there and I think my mom and dad
were there we have a tradition we did
not discuss no we have like just regular
things that we do but not necessarily
something we would call a tradition like
you know on Friday nights we always got
to eat or something like what was our
first road trip I think it might have
been dialer got me tickets to a
basketball game it was Kentucky versus
Alabama in Tuscaloosa Alabama and the
reason why was because I was a big fan
of their cheerleading squads at both
those schools so I was a real follower
of college cheerleading competitions I
cheered and everything and so it was a
real thrill to get to see a big SEC
basketball game like that it would be
really cool to see a football game too
down there but I was alone who said I
love you first and where were we
I think I did but it was in a card
wasn't the card had like sheep on it or
something because it was I loved and
then it was you like that's what it was
so technically he didn't say I love you
it was I I said I love you she got the
point I think I said I love you too
next one is what do we argue about the
most number 10 we don't get in a lot of
big hmm I feel like I'm answering all
these supposed to be you answer I think
sometimes what what we will tend to
argue about the most probably since I've
been on this this morning show shift
were we kind of like cross paths just
real infrequently during the week like
all Tyler will come home like 6 o'clock
at night and I'm going to bed by 7:00
and so sometimes I think maybe the
things we might bicker about a little
but it doesn't really turn into a big
fight or anything but sometimes just
little miscommunications like something
I forget I would forget to tell you or
scent like I'd be frustrating because
you know and then and then it all comes
back to like dang it why do we have to
be on these different shift yeah it's
it's tough to communicate when you the
majority of the time we're speaking is
when one of the person just woke up or
exactly and it's like oh yeah and it's
hard because it's like you had that hour
to spin and it's like do I want to just
you know chill out and hang out or do I
have to be talking about all like to do
my little pencil to-do list things I
needed to tell Tyler so I mean sometimes
like that can just be frustrating but
there's really nothing we can do about
it so I think we've done pretty good at
just dealing who wears the pants in this
relationship I think that's kind of
isn't that kind of an old-school phrase
like a lark pants manure chance really
like you probably do more pants much
more frequently the night phenomen pants
is just shorts I kind of feel like I
don't know our whole relationship has
really been like a friendship
partnership sort of thing all along and
I just don't know I don't feel like one
person nobody's telling the other one
what to do or nobody is dominant in one
fashion if I'm sitting in front of the
TV what am i watching I manage that's
you saying that so you're answering what
am i watch kind of ABC reality show
based on a bachelor bachelorette dancing
singing oh my gosh you're lucky you
weren't around this morning so someone
from New Jersey some Jersey Shore how
does he look okay he acts like he's got
familiar with Jersey Shore
you he's named like all of them pretty
much but right now kicking into high
gear would be clean we both love Glee
Tyler loves idli like I do and I tell
you I met a lot of I've talked to a lot
of guys we're gonna shift with all guys
and glee is not an unpopular show with
guys I don't think it's a girl thing I
just but I don't you think that people
kind of get a little maybe turned off
just thinking like oh it's a singing
dancing show but it's really funny yes
it is so good what dressing do I get on
my salad I would say light ranch would
be number one
they don't want that regular ranch yeah
New Moon's I just go crazy and vinegar
when we eat out I just let loose and I
just get rid of you what's the one food
I don't like he's probably more than one
whatever light oh yeah oh wow that was
quick and very accurate yes I don't like
I don't like seeing blood run from my
meat I took a bite of it maybe it tastes
just fine but I'm a very visual person
as well so like I don't want to if I see
something that I don't like it's gonna
turn me off for what do you go out to
eat what do I get to drink depends it
would be either diet cola if she's tired
or if it's getting to be at night or if
it's a weekend right you get pretty much
say what size shoe do I wear 9 worried
yeah it fits on if it's a sandal or a
lie
a dressy shoe or a sneaker because I
feel like we always have to try alone
yes and the dressy shoes like an eight
and a half probably is the best measure
that see I'm short I'm 5 feet tall bad
big feet next question and Tyler
interestingly enough for his height he's
6 6 and because somewhat small features
if I was collecting anything what would
it be
goodness I wonder what makeup
well it's me obviously
I mean it's makeup I mean there's no
stairs with me there's make as my final
answer what is my favorite type of
sandwich it's getting revealing everyone
if I go to a random place and chicken
salad is on the menu that's true chicken
salad especially when you put like the
grapes in it
any fruit I like it all doctored up ya
know and just give me chicken and mail
what would I eat every day if I could
I'm not even sure how I'd answer this
chicken strips
the clock is ticking seems even louder
when there's silence nice cream ok
what's my favorite cereal I don't eat a
lot of cereal any more I drink protein
shakes for breakfast I like a lot of
different kinds I mean I like Special K
I was gonna say that looks like the
berries in it maybe yes
the straw is my favorite music but
everything's good yeah yeah everything's
pretty eclectic yeah I mean on my iPod I
have like the top 40 stuff I have
hip-hop I have
