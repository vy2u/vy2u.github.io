makeup tag and I am so pumped to do this
because I definitely part the drugstore
I love my drugstore makeup so much so
thank you to Stefanie and Tracy from
eleventhgorgeous for tagging me to do
this if you haven't seen their videos
like you really should subscribe because
they are so fun to watch it's like
there's this little duo like how fun
would it be to always have somebody you
know to talk to and kind of bounce off
of for your videos so they're so good
together so funny so I hope you'll check
out their channel gotta say this video
has taken so much prep work alike it's
not easy to answer these questions
especially if you love a lot of
different drugstore make yes so there's
a question in this tag about dupes and
because I do have a lot of do pity all
ready like eyeshadow and lipstick and
different products from Mac and whatnot
I decided I would come up with some
brand new never spoken of dupes at least
not from me for this video so these are
things I have not talked about before
and I am super excited about them
actually like some face product dupes I
even have a concealer in here that I was
so excited about so let's just get
started with the first question what is
your favorite drugstore makeup brand and
I've got to start out by saying I feel
like every brand drugstore and high-end
really has its hits and misses I mean I
don't think there's one single brand
that I could talk about and say men
everything's perfect you know because
that just doesn't happen
but for drugstore I think maybe the
strongest brands are the brands that
have those products that are total
must-haves for me first off I'd have to
go with Revlon I feel like they have
awesome foundations and face products
and I think their lip products are just
amazing like I'm a lip product lover and
I feel like they really just you know
totally dominate drugstore lip products
also NYX I think is a great brand and I
think their strength is with the color
variety that they have a great selection
of eyeshadows and then you look at their
eyeliners and it's like tons of colors
too so I feel like they kind of rival
certain high-end brands in the quality
and just the variety that they offer
with colors
and I also do love wet-and-wild because
I feel like I would kind of create like
a most improved category for this brand
because it has changed so much since I
remember trying wet and wild like back
when I was in high school for example
now I feel like they have some of the
best like blushes and eyeshadows and
color cosmetics in the drugstore like I
feel like my makeup collection would not
be the same without some of my wet and
wild eyeshadows in it number two what
are your favorite face cheek and lip
products for face I feel like I just
have a bunch of drugstore foundations
that I really like check out my try
that's not that video for a bunch of
different ones there so I thought it
kind of like wiped that out of this
category and just pick another random
face product that I think is amazing
that I love so much and it's lately been
one that I use everyday it's the Revlon
Photoready bronze shade is called
bronzed and chic it just comes in one
shade but what's special about this is
that it's matte and it is four colors so
I kind of think about it as top and
bottom and if I want just light bronzer
kind of all over my face like I have
today just really light I use the top
two shades and if I want to contour I
use the bottom two and it's just super
easy there are other brands that have
some good matte bronzers but what's
special about this is that you can have
the control to kind of customize it so
this is awesome
total must-haves don't really potay
without using that for a cheek product
I'm going to go with my ELF
studio blushes I feel like these blushes
are top notch for three dollars each I
mean come on
they are so pigmented so richly colored
and a great color variety to that's a
little bit I don't know maybe a little
more modern than what you see a lot in
the drugstore for example they they have
out a great matte bright pink blush pink
passion if you're wondering about that
and this one called blushing Rose is
like an all-time favorite I love just
the richness that this gives your cheeks
and gives you such a natural-looking
gloves tap your brush to these and
you've got enough color for your face so
I'm really really impressed with those
as blush the other part of this question
was lip products and obviously Revlon
I've talked about that a lot whole video
on this subject just Revlon lip products
but
thought I'd give a shout-out to a couple
that I think are especially awesome that
I'm loving right now and one is the
gloss and peach petal this is a really
nice nude gloss and I hadn't tried this
particular Super Lustrous gloss until
recently but this one's really beautiful
if you're trying to take a nude lip and
give it a little more life like a little
more shine this is a new gloss and it is
fairly opaque but it does give the shine
that I think a nude lip kind of needs so
I love the texture of those Super
Lustrous glosses not sticky so
comfortable to wear and then I also love
my lip butters and this time of year I
love combining red velvet which is kind
of a deeper brick red and cherry tart
which is like a brighter red together on
the lips I love these the other day I
took red velvet and went all over
everything except the center of the
lower lip I popped it with the brighter
red and it's super pretty least favorite
product guys say I've run into some bad
products in my time trying makeup but
one that really stands out to me as
pretty ridiculous in concept just the
whole thought behind this is L'Oreal is
the one sweep eyeshadow I have a whole
kind of rant video on this topic but the
thought is is that you take this biggle
sponge tip swipe it across all these
colors and then swipe it onto your eye
and it just it did not work for me if
you made this work Congrats to you I'm
happy for you but this did not do it for
me it did not look blended it did not
look I mean I feel like they're just
trying to oversimplify the whole thought
of putting on eye shadow
I don't mind sponge tips but you know
just give me something where I've got a
couple of them and you don't expect me
to just swipe over them all and then
swipe racing stripes across my eyelid
and think I'm gonna walk out of the
house looking great no way so and
another thing is like if you try to
salvage this and keep using it these are
so skinny that they're really too small
for like a fluffy brush to even sweep
through so I haven't gotten a lot of use
out of this but this hangs around in my
collection for moments like this
it makes me grateful for my other
eyeshadows we'll put it that way before
is what's the best makeup bargain when I
think of this question and I don't
really think like what's the cheapest
thing I have but what is like
the least expensive best quality things
that I've been able to get and I've got
to go with my lovely wet and wild eye
shadows I love these I love these eight
pan pallets I also love the mantle trios
as well I think these are special
because I feel like I use these and I
love the effect that they create on my
eyes but also in the value sense it's
like you're gonna have these for a while
because much like their blushes and
other things it's like it doesn't take a
lot of product to get an effect
you're not like scrubbing down into the
powder to get you know a pigmented
shadow look you just barely touch your
brush to these and you've got what you
need so that means you're gonna have
them for quite a while so I just love
that they came out with the eight pan
pallets my only complaint is I wish
they'd give us some more colors a lot
more so but like I need it but I love
the silent treatment for a great trio I
think that's just beautiful colors
they're for a smoky eye and these for
around five dollars these for around
three dollars and I don't know that you
can beat that for the price balance with
the quality of these I think it's really
good number five what is your favorite
underdog product something you love that
often gets overlooked great question
because I love finding those things like
I I live for finding these diamonds in
the rough like that's part of why I
think I got into this whole youtubing
thing is that I find it exciting to go
to the drug store and find a phenomenal
product that I feel like you know where
did that come from it was so inexpensive
but it works so well so I've got a
couple of those to tell you about today
one is my Revlon precision lash glue I
don't feel like I see a lot of people at
least here on YouTube using this but
this works so well I mean I used the duo
glue for a long time good quality stuff
but just in terms of the application
this is so much easier and fast because
it's got the wand and the glue like it
really keeps you from getting too much
on the lashes therefore it dries faster
it gets tacky faster and then you're
getting it there on your lash line
faster I mean if I'm doing falsies in
the morning before I go to work I need
the process to happen quickly and so
this just helps me with that they stay
on grade I don't have any issues with
them starting to come off with this
other eye product that I feel like is
kind of an
some hero is the maybelline lash
discovery mascara this is pretty much
the only thing I use on my lower lashes
because I feel like if the staying power
is great I don't even use waterproof and
it really lasts there doesn't flake off
doesn't smudge off on the under eye and
I tell you what you gotta trust whatever
you're putting on those lower lashes the
brush is also tiny so it's only gonna
get so much product on those lower
lashes and it's going to really give
them that little boost that depth of
Darkness that you want there but it's
not gonna overlook my upper lashes are
going through all these different
mascaras all the time this is pretty
much always on the lower one question
number six is a drugstore product that
is overpriced across the board I think a
lot of the drugstore makeup has improved
quality wise since you know back when I
was in high school I felt like you know
I was having to try so much harder to
get a makeup look to work or to show up
on my face or this or that and now I
feel like the bar has been raised
and maybe you are going to pay a little
bit more for some of these better
quality products but I think one thing
that really seems too expensive to me at
the drugstore is false eyelashes if
you're gonna get like say one pair and
go into Walmart that maybe between three
and four something dollars and cents and
I feel like it's a little much because
you can get you know big packs of them
like on eBay you can also get some
really good deals on this website um
it's called Lady Moss calm and you can
get like red cherry lashes and different
ones for like just a couple bucks apiece
but from the drugstore I feel like there
are a lot of great deals
I do enjoy getting like multi packs and
stuff like this I think those are a
little bit better but for just an
individual pair of lashes I think it can
be a little price okay the next one is
show your best drugstore dupes and I do
have multiple dupes videos that I hope
you'll check out if this is something
you're really interested in but for this
I tried to look outside of the eye
shadow box so to speak and come up with
some different products like face
products and things that I thought were
great
so one here's the high end first is
benefit erase paste I talked and talked
about how great as salmon-colored
concealer is to new
to realize those really dark under-eye
circles the ones that are ohm almost
like a little blue tone you kind of get
them in here and some people under the
eyes it looks like this you know it's
kind of peachy colored and I really like
this product I like you know bisque from
Bobby Brown I think that's in the right
tone that I'm talking about here and
I've always said it's hard to find
something like that in the drugstore but
just recently I found something really
great that I think totally fits the bill
and it is from pixie so that's available
at Target stores and it's correction
concentrate in brightening peach and let
me tell you this is right on the same
wavelength color wise with the benefit
erased paste it's not quite as creamy
it's not correct quite us like amoliant
as this one is but yet I still feel like
it does the job I don't feel like it's
cakey or anything like that it just
doesn't have quite as much moisture
content and for some that was a
complaint about your a space so you
might even just like this bet so here
are the swatches and this one is erase
paste and this one is the pixie peach
concentrate so as you can see color wise
they are right on the money the only
thing is pixie is not exactly a cheap
brand at Target i this cost like 15
bucks but when you do compare it to the
higher-end options if this is something
you want to try this is a little more
affordable so we're getting there we're
getting there with something that's a
little more low cost that is still that
great quality salmon under eye concealer
another dupe for a really nice coverage
powder foundation type product it is
from Mac and it's called Studio Fix I'm
sure you guys have heard people talking
about this this is just a really nice
textured powder watch your finger in it
and then you kind of rub your fingers
together and it's like it's kind of like
hanging together it almost feels just a
little bit creamy it's hard to call a
powder creamy but you know what I mean
it's not like just flying everywhere
it's not a dusty powder so it's kind of
a unique texture to mimic but I do feel
like there's another similar product
from the drugstore and it is the Milani
multitasker on face powder and this can
be like a powder foundation you can use
it more lightly and maybe just set your
foundation
feel this and then I check kind of the
appearance on my skin compare it to the
Studio Fix it's so similar it's a nice
matte finish powder and this just is
that same way of not getting too flaky
because I do have an eye product to talk
about but it's not an eyeshadow it is an
eyeliner and I've talked a lot about
Malley ever color automatic waterproof
liner this is my favorite thing in the
waterline for staying power I mean I've
done numerous days where I will try one
on one waterline and one on the other
and kind of compare how they held up
this one consistently is one of the
longer wearing ones this is an automatic
liner so just twists up and it's creamy
but it's not as creamy as some and I
think that might contribute to it
staying even better it found something
really close it's not quite as good on
staying power but I must say it's very
close it's also an automatic liner but
it's gonna cost you a lot less and it's
the Maybelline master drama so while
this shade is black it's called onyx
this one is called midnight master for
the black and it is just as intense in
terms of the color it's a little more
creamy and it does last pretty well in
the waterline or anywhere else you want
to I do wish they had more colors though
malee has a bunch bunch bunch of shades
of this which is really nice but this I
wish they had more I think they're maybe
a brown maybe a blue but I hope they
come out with like an expanded bunch of
colors okay last question drugstore
product that isn't worth the hype I've
got to go with those BB creams and I
kind of ranted on these and of whole
video comparing for drugstore BB creams
and I just feel like they haven't gotten
them right I feel like in a lot of cases
it's relabeled products they're taking
something that is you know already been
a tinted moisturizer they call it a BB
cream and they want to you know get
people flocking to it and I did try
several of them they're just really
light coverage moisturizer product do
you feel like they charge a pretty penny
for these in the drugstore I feel like
you know you're paying almost what you
would pay for a foundation if not more
in some cases for a BB cream but I did
get something from Olay and it's called
a CC cream color correction type product
for the CC but it's Olay Total Effects
seven and one and
have been using this is my moisturizer
in some cases using this and some
concealer and I'm good
but what I like about this is that this
does incorporate a lot of added skincare
benefits they're talking about
anti-aging ingredients they're talking
about correcting dark spots and just
evening your skin tone as a whole and a
lot of the BB creams I've tried just the
drugstore ones didn't have all those
claims like they claim to just you know
perfect the look of your skin which they
didn't do but you know it was more like
you know once you've got it on it'll
make your skin look this way but this
excites me more because it's going to
actually apparently have more of an
impact on the health and the texture and
the look of your skin is also I will be
using this consistently and I will let
you know like what changes if any I see
but yeah I just wanted to update you on
that's all for this video guys this was
so fun for me like I said a lot of hard
decisions in this video but if you like
drugstore makeup it is a lot of fun I
would encourage any bloggers out there
even if you don't make videos maybe do a
blog post answering these questions
really get you thinking about what some
of the best products really are and some
of the worst so thanks guys and I will
see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
