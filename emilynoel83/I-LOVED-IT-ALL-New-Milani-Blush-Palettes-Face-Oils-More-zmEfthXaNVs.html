tuning in today
I'm not wearing blush I'm not wearing
lip colors so yes there's some missing
pieces here but we're going to add them
in as we go I'm talking about some new
stuff from Milani and in a very
unexpected turn of events I really
really liked everything I got my eyes
for some reason are starting to water a
bit so I'm really not feeling emotional
in this moment I think it's just all the
light first thing in the morning I saw
that some new things came out actually
the first sign of it I think there was a
picture posted online of an in-store
display now I haven't seen anything in
my stores locally of these particular
new Milani products and I'm not talking
about the eyeshadow palettes I mean I
reviewed those and a whole big cluster
of Milani things not that long ago um so
they're really churning it out but today
we're talking about a couple of blush
palettes we're talking about a couple of
skincare related items and also some lip
products so this isn't the hugest haul
ever but the strange thing about it is
that I truly liked everything I got and
that just doesn't happen that much and
it's not that I'm always like looking
for you know a thing to critique or
feeling any sort of pressure to react a
certain way to different products that I
get but as I've been playing with this
stuff I'm just like yeah I really like
it all but I will give you a little bit
of a preference between these two blush
palettes guys these are so beautiful and
I think this was such a smart idea for
them to create these blush palettes
because I feel like these Rose blushes
are so loved and people really have
enjoyed those large full sizes and here
they've got that same exact shape just
mini and you're getting three different
shades in one and the cost on these is
$13 each and I personally feel that it's
totally worth it so you've got to color
families here one is called floral
fantasy and this one's a bit more I
would say neutral maybe a little more
peachy a bit more earthy and then the
other one is flowers of love that's the
one in this hand and here a color scheme
might be just a little more pink they're
not what I would call like really cool
bubblegum II type Pink's but it's more
pinky rosy in here and a little bit more
peachy Coral
neutral in this one I really do like
them both I think the pigmentation on
these and the textures of them is just
what you know and love from the larger
blushes something important to point out
here is that these two shades in this
palette have just a little bit of a
sheen I might call them just a satin
finish it's not incredibly like shiny on
the cheeks or anything like that but
you'll just notice that they're not a
total matte this one is matte in that
palette and then over here your two real
blush shades are matte and then you got
this thing on the end and for me I mean
this is gonna operate as a highlight on
me for sure and I would think it would
be sort of a highlighter type shade on
most people however my one little
complaint is that I feel like it's not
super pronounced it's very very subtle
like once that's shearing out on the
skin I don't see it quite enough I don't
need the boldest most reflective
highlight on earth let that one shade I
just don't love I do really like the
blush you're getting this soft kind of
medium peachy pink and then a little bit
deeper rosy shade here and those are
great but what I really love is this
palette because I'm getting three shades
that I truly truly like and my first
skepticism going in was is this shade
even gonna show up on my cheeks and
that's what I'm gonna go ahead and show
you in a quick application right now
because yes it does I just dab into it
with any kind of blush brush this one
happens to be Ecotools see this soft
peach it's a subtle blush but I'm
definitely seeing it that is just the
most delicate soft easy blush continuing
on the other she can help it's one of
those that's definitely going to show up
a little better than you expect
I think light to medium skin tones are
maybe the sweet spot for that blood then
we've got this kind of neutral almost
bronze II really dusty rose color and
that's really gorgeous I love those
kinds of tones this time of year in
particular and talk about going with
anything like I'm so thrilled that that
kind of a shade is in here and then
right over here on this end is our
richest color it's like a dirty coral
with a little bit of Sheen and I'm gonna
pick some of that up on my brush and
just kind of apple of the cheek it a
little bit lower on the cheap maybe I
just love it so much please
it's so so perfect so I am feeling very
attached to this trio it's the one
called floral fantasy it's more peachy
it's more choral but particularly with
these two shades there's this little bit
of dusty neutral thrown in there too I
just think is so wearable and fun but if
you do like a bit more of a rosy route
you've got these shades and I will go
ahead why don't I try to toss on this
lightest shade just to show you what I
mean about the intensity level or lack
thereof with this I'm going to just dab
into it see I don't know if you'll
really see it showing up for me with
that shade I feel like maybe I'm picking
up on just the tiniest little bit of
something going on on my skin there but
it's sort of like loading on a little
bit of extra powder on your skin that's
not really having much of an effect
other than just being a little powdery I
know I've mentioned a lot on my channel
that I love a glossy lip finish these
days I really like shine it pulls the
whole look together it lightens up the
face and I noticed that they've got
these lip colors called amore shine now
I think the liquid lipsticks that they
had were amore matte but they're calling
these liquid lip colors but you know
they are shiny so I got two shades one
is a little bit more like a I don't know
berry type pink and one seems to be like
a true pink and this is called
enchanting and I'm just gonna go ahead
and try these on for you and let you
know what I think the applicator is
pointed a little bit like a pointed doe
foot with a bit of a scoop in there but
they're very opaque okay so I get where
they're coming from from calling them
like liquid lip colors it's almost more
full-on color than you might expect from
a lot of glosses
but with this shade called enchanting
okay this is one pass around the lips
like I didn't dip back into my tube for
any extra color I didn't build this up
or anything this is just what I'm
working with and the texture feels so
good not too thick but not thin and
slippery it's got just the right amount
of cling and I feel like they made it
maybe just as thin as possible you know
to really hang on there I found both of
these shades to have decent staying
power simply because of how colorful
they are you know they're not sheer in
the least so you can really sort of tell
that they're hanging on one sort of odd
element to these is like after they
bound the lips for maybe a minute or two
you start to feel just a little bit of
coolness to them I wouldn't even go so
far as to call it a tingle because it's
not doing like what a buxom lip colour
does but it's just I don't know there's
an odd little bit of coolness that comes
over the lips if you've experienced what
I'm talking about maybe you can describe
it more in the comments but I do think
it's a fabulous texture if you like oh
really what you see is what you get full
colored gloss I think these are great
now this is a shade that I think I like
even more this is the one called Idol
speaking of Idol who saw Carrie on there
last night oh it was so fun watching the
contestants choose from her songs
everybody sang a Carrie Underwood hit
and it was so good I was like bawling
during the Mother's Day segment like the
first half of the show was Carrie songs
the second half was because it was
Mother's Day you know picking a song to
dedicate to their moms and the little
packages that ran before their
performances with their moms just made
me want to cry I did cry I think before
so if my eyes look puffy today that's
why but this pink don't you love that
little bit of extra depth like the other
shade was pretty but this is just mmm
love it and that shine is so nice the
staying power like I said it's not gonna
be as bulletproof it's like a matte
liquid lipstick that's really clinging
on there but at the same time it's gonna
look so healthy and rich on the lips and
I just think it's cool how full color
that is I want to get more shades I like
the formula
I like the texture so much it's so not
annoying on the lips I want to try more
there's one more new lip product from
Milani to talk about and it's the
hypnotic lights real quick low did I
give you the cost on those amore shines
these are nine dollars each so kind of
reaching the high end for a single
drugstore lip product but the hypnotic
lights they're gonna charge $11 for
these and I have the shade zero for
luminous light this is really like a
next-level lip topper I have tried a lot
of them there are many beautiful ones
out there but this probably packs the
most punch and I'm just going to show
you in a hand swatch first we've got a
longer kind of flat doe foot applicator
here with this and just look my camera
isn't even sure what to do with itself
once I move my hand to show you the
shine the focus is all thrown off but
it's just crazy this shade is a little
bit pink and a little bit gold but what
you know about lip toppers is being more
of a gel type gloss with maybe a little
bit of shimmer running through it the
shimmer is so concentrated in this it
kind of takes over and the texture on
this is really really unusual like to
touch it you do feel the glitter it's a
very fine glitter going on here with
what seems like a very little binder
thrown in very little liquid put into it
and I'm just gonna take this right here
and dab some like yes on top of my look
that's already super shiny it this stuff
can't help but like fly off your face
that just in terms of the light catching
ability and I kind of love this pinky
tone because it's gonna work in so well
on top of so many pinky lip colors a
really unusual feel it's almost like I
feel a hint of an oil in there with the
product but I have never seen a lip
topper with the sparkle in there being
so darn concentrated but you will get a
gorgeous really reflective effect with
these moreso than probably anything else
I've tried now there I just pressed my
lips together and I instantly like d10
safai things a little bit your most
profound effect with one of these is if
you do have a matte lip look going on
and then the contrast of this sparkle
kind of going on top of the mat that
would be really huge does it smell like
anything oh it smells nice it just kind
of smells like vanilla really what do
the others smell like I can't really
smell anything scent wise off of the
amore shines but you
see what I mean guys I've run into so
much good stuff I mean blush palettes
that are giving us a lot of a formula of
blush that I just really really love I
was so excited to see that all the lip
products I was very impressed with and
then finally I did pick up the face oils
so they each kind of seem to have a
different purpose the Rose one says prep
and brighten and the Camellia Camellia
one says prep and soothe and they're
both really thin oils can you see just
how lightweight that product looks in
there right it doesn't look like a
really thick oil if we use josie maran
argan oil is kind of a benchmark here
for an average oil thickness these are
much lighter than that I would call them
a buildable oil though on the skin
because they don't feel like they're
doing nothing it's not like one of those
skin care products or moisturizers where
you feel like you're just putting it on
putting it on and your skin's just
drinking it up immediately and you're
never getting a hydrated effect I mean
they say use a couple of drops and when
I use a couple of drops I've got plenty
on my skin but you can add more and just
further hydrate really dry areas and
it's been good for me for that and I was
a little hesitant going in because I've
used the volcanic elixir from far Sally
which I suspected I had a breakout on my
skin due to that facial oil so do I
really want to go in using more face
oils but that's since calmed down and
I've used these at the start of the day
I have not used them at night time yet
but just kind of as a prep step and then
you know you go on with some sunscreen
and your foundation and whatever and
they've been really nice they're not too
heavy I really think a lot of skin types
could use this kind of thing because it
is so lightweight but it's still doing
something it's going to do more even in
a light amount I think than a lot of
just lightweight cream moisturizers
might but the biggest difference between
them that I can see is the scent because
the texture seems exactly the same and
maybe with long-term use
you might notice like a different
skincare benefit going on with each but
this is a really authentic definitely
definitely identifiable rose scent on
the rose oil and the Camellia I mean I'm
not really that familiar with what that
scent even is on its own but I smell it
here and I'm like wow that's strong I
feel like I've smelled that scent in
their skincare products may be from
Sunday Riley I think one of the oils I
have from them actually has a lot of
that kind of scent going on in it
honestly when I take a quick whiff of it
I get this herbal tea type vibe and if
you want to investigate these further
look at the full ingredients list you
can go to Milan e's website and do that
but just talking about the descriptions
again the rose is prep and Brighton and
this claims to brighten and balance the
skin custom blended with sunflower
apricot kernel sweet almond crumby I'm
Sinica and rose hip oil to replenish
dehydrated skin and deliver a youthful
glow and both say that this fast
absorbing lightweight formula can be
used on face hair or body and then the
camellia says it's custom blended with
grapeseed camellia sunflower and sweet
almond oils rich and fatty acids and
antioxidants to boost hydration and
protect the skin so to me it seems like
the skin care benefits coming from each
like they're pretty similar in that way
I obviously can't tell you right now
what long-term use from either one of
these is going to do for your skin but
hydration wise I mean I think these are
very approachable oils because they are
so thin and lightweight you're not gonna
feel like overwhelmed with grease on
your skin I guess it's what I'm getting
at and the packaging is beautiful I love
the little frosted glass bottles and
then you have the dropper style
applicator there but the other day I was
wearing one of these and I was out in
the Sun we went to a winery on Mother's
Day it was getting pretty hot outside
and I knew I was wearing a good long
wearing foundation but I definitely had
that underneath and even though I was
sweating a little bit I felt like things
held up pretty well and I wasn't like a
total greaseball and those oils by the
way are $14 each I purchased all of this
stuff from Milani cosmetics calm you may
start seeing it or may have already seen
it in your local drugstores just
depending on how fast they get stuff out
but this was exciting for me I love
seeing those blush palettes really
impressed by the lip products and I like
the facial oils too so what can I say
guys it's one of those rare 100% really
successful hauls so thank you guys for
your time I hope this was informative
and I will see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
