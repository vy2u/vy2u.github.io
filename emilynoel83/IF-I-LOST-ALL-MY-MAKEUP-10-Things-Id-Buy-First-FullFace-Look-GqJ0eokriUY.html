far I'm doing good I've got a great
video idea I'm gonna be bringing it to
you right now this was actually
mentioned in my Q&amp;amp;A video the last one I
did I was like there's a really good
comment here I'm not gonna answer the
question now I'm gonna turn it into its
own video this question was asked on my
YouTube community tab and it had the
most thumbs up on it 255 to be exact and
test sunrise said if something happened
and you had to start your makeup
collection all over from scratch let's
just take a moment of silence for that
situation what would be the first 10
things you would buy and I thought that
was a great question because I think it
shows like you know what are the
priority products if you lost everything
you had you wouldn't necessarily build
that up just real quickly overnight and
you'll notice she didn't really give me
any guidelines as far as price range or
where I had to find the products so I
thought realistically if this situation
happened to me I would probably get a
bunch of stuff right off the bat just
from one place just for ease and
simplicity so I chose Ulta and I thought
I would probably make it as affordable
as possible if I'm gonna like jump in
and buy like 10 things all at once I
would like to make them reasonably
priced and so I only have one like
high-end product in this list also I did
not include sponges brushes or a lash
curler I just decided to make it about
the makeup products and then if we want
to move on to 11 12 and 13 outside of
these 10 products it would be a sponge
eyelash curler and maybe just like an
Ecotools brush set let's say and then
you know time goes on you refine your
collection a little bit you come up with
more specific things but these are
really good basics that I truly love and
I think if I just picked up these 10
things I would be in pretty good shape
even if everything else was gone as you
may have assumed as I sit here with no
makeup on I am gonna take you through
the application of all 10 products cuz I
just thought that would better prove my
point right you know actually putting
them all together for you so the first
thing I would get is maybelline
superstay foundation in the shade for me
natural ivory
and I would get this because I think
it's affordable it's amazing coverage
it's great staying power yes I do like
some different you know lightweight and
natural and different types of
foundations here and there but if I need
one that's going to truly I think make
me look the best this would be it plus
most affordable I use one full pump of
this stuff and I like to patch it around
all over my face to begin and then using
a real techniques sponge which like I
said might be number 11 it can't be
purchased at Ulta I just Pat this all
into the skin
you might recall when I first purchased
this foundation I got a shape that was
quite a bit too dark so this one seems
to be a bit more of a shade match for me
and it does apply fine for me with a
brush as well
second thing on my list is the only
thing that goes sort of outside the
drugstore price range but I think it's
really necessary and if I lost all my
makeup I would probably be like loosing
sleep and really upset and probably
develop some dark circles so we got to
take that into consideration my benefit
boying brightening concealer formerly
erase paste shade number two I have
definitely been dealing with some
circles this week so I think this is
necessary it doesn't take a lot of this
product I mean I just kind of swore my
finger in it and dab it on and I really
just concentrated where the darkness is
there's no real special major trick with
this but I love the texture I like that
it's not drying
but really nicely brightening and then I
would also need just a standard
concealer you know something that I felt
was good coverage something that could
work on the under eye and elsewhere on
the face and for that I would say makeup
revolution conceal and define in c-five
it's a really perfect shade for me to
achieve good coverage so I give it a
little swipe right here on the under eye
area and then I can also tackle like any
redness or you know if there are any
blemishes on the skin this does the job
really well doesn't look too heavy I've
talked about this product quite a bit
before so you probably already know the
details but I find that if I apply like
I did there just a little bit more than
I might use of Tarte shape tape I can
still achieve shape tape like coverage
and with shape tape I just do like maybe
a couple little dots
thing on my list number four is my
Maybelline fit me loose powder in fair
honestly I reach for this more than my
Laura Mercier these days part of what I
love about this is just how brightening
this is there's actually an Instagram
picture that I put up last weekend and
the lighting was just profoundly good so
let's take that into consideration but I
looked so brightened up in this area and
it was beyond just what like a shimmery
highlight was going to do I was just
flat out bright and I credit this I was
wearing this in that picture and if
you've got your Real Techniques sponge
you've got that flat side that can work
really well for baking and this does
make a difference and I don't want to do
ten barely-there products
ten products for like world's most
natural look no I want to show how these
ten products could you know take me to a
fancy event if that was you know what
was going on after the morning where I
woke up and found that all my makeup was
gone so get the whole under eye covered
I also kind of do the chin also liking
to bake up here between the brows as
well it's something about that just
brightens by the time I dust it away it
all looks more flawless with brows I
feel like that's something that's
generally a multi-product Merton
multi-step part of makeup but when I get
to thinking about what product can kind
of handle it all in one it's probably my
makeup revolution brow pomade and medium
brown comes with the little applicator
also 100% like the proper color and what
I like about this is it's easy to
control the pomade is not so so creamy
to the point where your brows feel
really overloaded over gooped but also
there's some hold with this so just
using this one product you feel like
okay that's taking the place of a
separate gel that I would have to put on
so multitasking you know we're trying to
keep this to ten things plus it does
come with the brush that you would need
I dig it another thing I kind of thought
about looking back at my list once I'd
formed this ten I like that among the
things I picked I felt like there was a
lot of variation like if I were you know
in a big hurry I could make a look out
of these things without even using the
foundation
like just using that makeup revolution
concealer mainly I don't have to bake in
order to like the fit me loose powder
you know you can lightly dust that and
get a really nice brightening effect
with it too so yeah there's my brows
guys I'm not gonna do one more thing to
them just use the one product now we're
going to dust away the baked using my
ELF small tapered brush elf brushes
could be another good way to go if you
had to replace a lot of brushes in a
hurry and on a budget I mean they're
fabulous and you guys know if you watch
my videos I reach for this one all the
time I reach for my complexion brush all
the time okay the next thing number six
I went round and round with what to do
about this because I thought I need a
palette that's more than just face or
more than just eye shadow like given the
other things on my list that I
absolutely 100% need it's got to be a
combo palette and this combo palette
while I do really like it it's not maybe
my ideal combo palette I'm not sure that
that exists in the marketplace right now
like my 100% ideal even thinking of in
the palm of your hand which is a great
combination palette not sold at Ulta so
that's another thing that's just not
every single little thing that I would
want so this that I'm gonna be putting
on this list
I still think good quality in here
really like it it's not 100% perfection
for me but it would certainly do in like
a situation where I was facing a beauty
emergency so this is from flower beauty
and it's called the beauty flash full
face palette and what I like about this
is that you get a bronzer you get a
highlighter you get two blushes only
three eyeshadows but it can work and I'm
gonna be reviewing by the way a bunch of
different flower beauty products because
I've gotten so many questions about them
but I really wanted to review their
concealer and it was out of stock the
first go around when I ordered stuff so
I'm waiting on that to come in so I can
play with that first but I really like
the bronzer in this palette so I will
use that just kind of all over the face
you'll notice I didn't really set the
rest of my face with any powder outside
of where I baked and I don't feel like
that's absolutely necessary when you're
using maybelline superstay this bronzer
has a
little bit of shimmer to it it's a nice
like soft easy to blend texture a little
bit just kind of a little low on the
cheek there but nothing like no severe
contour dust a little bit just kind of
on top of the cheeks on top of the nose
like really use it as bronzer it works
so well and another thing I almost
always do with the bronzer is take it
down the neck and blend next we're going
to use a blush and we do have two tones
once more coral one's a little bit more
like dusty pink mauve I think I'll go
for the coral today and this is just a
little Ecotools it's not the full
setting brush
this in concept and just shape and size
reminds me so much of the Charlotte
Tilbury instant look in a palette which
was again a really nice multitasking
concept though it's always really
expensive and it's like they never
really kept it in stock permanently
unless maybe since then they have but I
don't know I want a little pop at the
other blush too because I don't know
when to stop with blush
seriously quality blushes in here like
them and then we have a really soft
highlight in here by soft I mean the
sheen is just like barely there it
almost reminds me a little bit of like a
laura geller french vanilla you know
just a barely there sheen but
brightening
also you know what I forgot an eye
primer on this list and it's too late to
rethink things now so I'm going to take
my makeup revolution concealed and
defined I've done this once before and I
was fine everybody lived I'm gonna go
ahead and use this is the eye primer
sorry about my horrible nails I just
have not had a spare moment to do
anything about them okie dokie so I
think we will all find that even though
I just had these three eyeshadow shades
here we will end up with a satisfying
eye look I'm gonna use this center shade
and just get my crease color going here
with that
as far as this palette goes like it's
this is a lot in one little palette
though like I'm proud of it maybe what
could have maximized the versatility
even more could have been like giving us
one less blush like I could survive on
just the one blush shade and maybe one
more eyeshadow color then I'm gonna do
some highlighting this definitely has
some shimmer and man that could double
as a face highlight can't believe I just
now thought of that
but like if you want more shimmer than
this this eye shadow is pretty shiny
kind of buttery a little golden I'm
doing the easiest like low-maintenance I
ever here by the way taking a little bit
of that and we want to kind of brighten
up this inner part of my eye
and then we have a nice matte brown
which if I was really trying to minimize
this could even have maybe been a brow
color for me because it's not too warm
but as you can see I am just patting
that on the outer half of my lid very
classic standard technique for me but I
just want to show you how these work and
it's only three shades you know we're
not trying to like recreate some kind of
masterpiece here on the ice it's just
like standard everyday eye makeup okay
you can however go in with a little bit
smaller brush on that shake too and make
things a little bit deeper
just putting it on in a slightly more
concentrated way
and for a little lower lashline smudgy
definition I think I'd take that brown
and a little smudge brush and just
smudge away
so that was a lot of items for item
number six a lot of different steps of
makeup that we just accomplished there
and for number seven I know I need a
black liquid liner like just
realistically I need one and it's the
Milani State put matte 17-hour we're in
the matte black shade loving this stuff
so much
I wasn't sure anything was really gonna
replace my Jordana color Envy which is
just kind of hard to come by and I was
just getting annoyed having to get it
from a different place than where I get
most of my other makeup so this Milani
is definitely getting the job done
lasting really well very nice intense
black I really like the thought of if I
had only ten products you know to have
one of them be a liquid liner because
even when your eyeshadow is very low
maintenance not much to it the liquid
liner can just take the look and and
boost it up
has anybody been like trying to guess
products as I've gone along
not gonna lie I feel it out of control
with these wings today they're more
intense than I planned
have I mentioned yet that bubs in Vegas
right now has been for gosh I guess this
is the third day he'll be home like
really late tonight it's for work now
there actually is a legal conference out
there so taking a little bit of this
dark-brown crazy how we had to travel
back to back weeks though one of us and
then the other feel like I've barely
seen the guy with number nine it's
coming down to mascaras now and if I'm
really trying to minimize I would just
want to get one mascara like if there's
only gonna be ten products ba I'm not
gonna give two slots to two different
mascaras okay so I was playing with this
I was thinking the other day like I'm
pretty sure my voluminous last paradise
doesn't tend to flake and smudge on me
on my lower lashline and as I was
testing this kind of retesting it in
that way you know it did wear very well
so I've got lash paradise for both upper
and lower lashes got several mascaras
that I'm really liking right now but
this stuff is just so undeniably good
and I think it's been about a year the
lash paradise has been out and I've been
really loving it so making it for the
long haul guys and I'm just getting a
little bit here on my lower lashes it's
not ideal
obviously like clump crusher the brush
is just smaller for those lower lashes
and just so easy to put on there but I
can make this work the next thing that I
would definitely get because like I said
I'm almost pretending like I'm trying to
put it together a special-occasion faced
with this only ten products not like
world's most natural face and included
in my top ten I would have some false
lashes if I were just going to Ulta I
would get whispies and I would get them
in a little kit that comes with a glue
that way there's multiple steps combined
all in one now I was just looking
through my drawer and I don't have any
whispies on me so we're gonna use these
Koko lashes in risque and just pretend I
do think these are kind of a wispy esque
lush they're a little more dense there's
a bit more volume than there is with the
whispies but I like that they've got
mainly the main part of the length is in
the center
it's been kind of the look I've been
going for a lot lately and that's what
wispies does give you so one thing I am
gonna do just real quick before I pop
those on is grab a little bit more of
this shimmery shade because I feel like
maybe I lost a little intensity I don't
know just in blending so I'm gonna pop
these lashes on and then we'll be back
for the tenth product see what it is
okay guys lashes are on so very happy
with the looks so far but we are down to
lips and only one slot left so it's got
to be a do-it-all type of lip product
and you might think that I'm sacrificing
something by being in that position but
I have a great do-it-all lip product and
it's the new L'Oreal color riche shine
formula these are so good I've got a
full video on them trying them all on
for you letting you know what my
favorites are but there's a reason why I
would pick it for this slot because it's
the application and fullness of color of
a lipstick it's the comfort of a lip
balm and it's the shine of a lip gloss
so bingo I'm set the rosewood shade
would be a definite top pick that's kind
of my your lips but better color that is
currently down in my purse another great
shade that I love is the burnished blush
color this is just a little more pinky I
think it's a great spring color actually
and will bring some life to this look
for sure
do you see what I mean that fullness of
color the shine look at the shining this
is slight basically two passes like if
you go over the same area two times or
just like to go rounds you know around
the lips you build up the color I think
to the perfect place and you get all
that fantastic shine feels so smooth and
wonderful and I think the key is getting
a shade that's not too super dark to
where you're not really scared of that
color drifting and doing something
really scary I mean but what was so
funny before I applied this I was
looking at myself in the viewfinder
thinking I would apply a little more
blush now somehow having that on my lips
it's brought everything to life so that
is my look everyone that's my ten
products that I would buy first if
everything went away and if I had an 11
12 and 13 it would be the wet-and-wild
ultimate brow highlighter to put down in
here which I haven't done because that
wasn't in the ten but I would definitely
be quick to buy that I was really only
thinking about the makeup here with this
video but if we want to throw brushes
and tools into the mix I would need an
eyelash curler I would need one sponge
you know at least so Real Techniques
would be a good one and then if I was
really you know kind of in a rush
trying to be quick about this I would
get a brush kit I would get something
from maybe Ecotools Real Techniques elf
just depending on what was available but
I think all of those brands make great
affordable brush sets oh and another
additional thing that I would be
probably pretty quick to purchase if
this design you know basically became a
top 15 the Mario Badescu like cucumber
spray a setting mist of some sort would
be a really nice like finishing touch
here although I don't feel like my look
appears too heavy it feels really nice
easy and could work for so many
circumstances so thank you guys so much
for your time today thank you so much
test for the amazing question and I will
see you guys in my next video
