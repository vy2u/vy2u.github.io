explain this past weekend I bet my first
ever eye Mets went to New York
Tyler was there too insane amazing
makeup awesomeness like people have told
me what their experiences have been like
there but I mean this was just I
couldn't prepare myself for how cool
that was gonna be so basically if you're
not familiar with eye Mets and my voice
is like lower if normally is I talked a
lot I hugged a lot I mean it was just
really something else
I'm at stands for international makeup
artist tradeshow and this is something
that goes on in various locations they
have one in LA this one was in New York
and basically you can go there and just
be completely encompassed with all
things makeup you can sit in on
different presentations and kind of like
live tutorial type things there's
various stages where stuff like that's
going on all kinds of vendors different
makeup brands have their booths where
you know they may also be doing like a
demonstration you can browse their
products it's known for very very good
discounts on all the different things
and I really didn't spend a whole lot of
time shopping the majority of my time
was spent just you know getting to meet
you guys and I just I I don't even have
words I feel like so many friendships
were made there and I'm gonna do a whole
separate vlog Tyler was there like with
the camera taking pictures with other
people's gamers I mean it was quite an
experience so there will be a whole
other video just on you know what
happened what we did and stuff but I
know I've got a lot of video and a lot
of pictures to look through but what I
could do today I thought was maybe show
the things I did get a chance to buy the
lines were incredible like I mean what
I'm not just talking about lines to buy
a product you were interested in but
lines to just even get a glance at what
was being sold by some of the different
brands that were there
so um I really didn't get much of a
chance to shop until like the tail end
of the day there on Saturday and the
crowds have thinned out a lot so I just
kind of went up and picked up a few
things I was interested in so I'll share
that with you now also I wanted to share
just a few things I got the night before
we went to IMATS I got a few last-minute
things that I needed you know at Target
and then it comes all the things you
don't really need but you find at Target
and what I did find were some of the new
Revlon lip butters the only place I've
seen these new shades everybody's been
talking about has been Target so they
didn't have all of the new shades in
stock I don't think but I did get sorbet
and juicy papaya they both had the new
sticker on them and then I got cotton
candy which didn't have the new sticker
I don't know this is new or not is this
part of the regular line and I just
missed it somewhere along the way but I
didn't have this one so I'll show you
cotton candy I actually have it on under
another lip gloss but it's just like a
really light pink it seems a little bit
has a little more color to it than the
cupcake shade does but really pretty so
I'm glad I found that and then the shade
I was wearing most of the weekend even
if I didn't like start the day with this
color on my lips this was kind of my
touch-up and this is definitely a new
shade and it's called sorbet and it's
just a very very pretty pink very vivid
makes the teeth look very white when you
have it on just a gorgeous color I'll
swatch these in a second but this is
juicy papaya and so here we're talking
that coral shade that everybody wants
there's um juicy papaya there sorbet and
there's cotton candy so really pretty
new lip butter shades I also before I
mattes we were kind of like just looking
around in Times Square on the Friday
night that we got there and I went to a
Duane Reade my first Duane Reade
experience and they had you know more
makeup brands in the average drugstore
and they had a brand called gosh and
I've heard people say great things about
this but I never tried it
this is the light and shine lip glaze
this particular product I mean I've
heard about the brand but not really
this product in particular but I saw
this gorgeous looking lip gloss and I
thought that's a gorgeous shade and then
it has a little mirror on the back of it
so I thought that's really cool I get
home I unwrap it and guess what happens
it lights up okay I don't know if you
guys can see but like yeah there's an
actual light there so when you put it on
your mouth is illuminated you know when
you're in the club or whatever you do
that at night we need in your lip gloss
but Rimmel did something like this in
the past but I didn't even realize it
lit up but I just loved the feature of
the mirror on the gloss itself but I've
got that gloss on today really shiny
really beautiful love it for the I met
stuff that I came up with and I found
you know some different brands this
isn't all like your typical like
high-end brands that you see in Sephora
or your drugstore brands there are a lot
of like makeup artist brands kind of
specialty products as well but some
bigger brands as well I mean steelo is
there I got a couple things from Stila
but I got this model and a bottle makeup
setting spray matte finish so I tried it
today I'm gonna let you know how it goes
but it says makeup setting spray seals
your makeup and lasts as long as you do
no more touch-ups resistant to smudging
tears humidity and water you're ready
you're set now take all the worldly one
of them only setting sprays I've really
messed with a lot has been the Urban
Decay all nighter so this one had some
really steep claims and I think it was
like maybe half price at I met so I got
that I also got some lashes I really
kind of splurged on these lashes they're
very expensive normally and I think I
got them for 20 bucks and I'm like that
seems expensive right for one set of
false lashes but I wanted to see you
know I'm so familiar with the drug store
you know the Ardell the salon perfect I
wanted to see you know if these velour
lashes these are 100% mink and I wanted
to see if these were really that much
better and they had a style that I
thought looked very nice
this case I'm going to keep using
because that's gonna be very nice for
storing lashes in the future but really
thick like the look of a lot of
thickness there at the lash line and
then very feathery toward the ends so
for some special occasion I'm going to
bust those out they say you can get a
lot of uses out of these but I still get
a lot of uses out of the other ones so
I'm really interested to see if these
are you know worth that big of a price
tag and then um I went by the our del
booth and they had just a bunch of
lashes they had a deal by for fur I
don't know if it was for 410 or what
exactly it was but I got some and they
were kind of down to some of the more
like fun stuff like look at these I'm
not sure where I'm gonna wear these but
these have sparkles on them and they're
just called fun literally the name is
fun um so I got that I got these Naomi
style I think I've seen people wearing
these on YouTube from time to time so
just a really thick lash there these are
sparkles they have a little bit of
glitter on them kind of subtle but nice
and then these are just for fun wild
lash beautiful and they have the little
bit of rhinestones there on the outer
corner so I figured why not it was a
really good deal and I you know give me
a chance to try some different styles a
lot of people were telling me how could
the deals worth the steal of booth so I
stopped by there before I left and they
had a bunch of these little like pallets
about this size for around $10 I think
it was I got the positive and pretty
palette it looks like that it's got a
little ribbon on there so this must have
been like a breast cancer awareness
thing but it gives you a little mirror
little instructions and these were just
the colors that appealed to me most
so plum a little bit of pink this is
actually a really pretty kind of
shimmery pink and a couple of blush
shades so I wore those on my eyes today
to try it out so that was just a fun
little find and also for I believe it
was five bucks they had this smudge
crayon set so here it says waterproof
eye primer plus shadow plus liner and so
there's kind of like a this is actually
comes off a little bit darker than it
appears sort of a taupe shade this one
then the black I haven't even used yet
but it looks like kind of a coppery
brown and then like I said the black
shades so they're just little sticks but
I mean there's still a decent amount of
product in there and for five bucks I
thought I'm not gonna pass that up
Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner this is a
brand new thing they said eyeliner
instead of having like the felt tip this
is actually a brush tip and I used it
got a very nice like winged effect and
you can just it's all about the amount
of pressure you want to apply you can
get a very thick line or a very thin
line and a really precise looking wing
and sometimes liners are like you'll use
it and it's it's gonna be either just
one way or the other thicker thin you
know and so if it's a really fine liner
that's great but you might be going over
it a lot for the parts that you want a
little more bold so this one's cool
because I felt like I could get it as
thick as I wanted it in here and then
kind of taper it you know to nothingness
on the wing so that'll be fun to keep on
trying I hope it doesn't dry out too
soon but then again it's a brush not the
felt tip so maybe that'll work better um
I got this thingy here I think I got
this from the RCM a booth and it looks
like a Z palette but it's not really a Z
palette this I tell you what can you see
how that's bending much I just did my Z
palette video so I'm all hopped up on 1g
pop more stuff this has a lot more
flexibility to it z palettes are really
I mean I mentioned there was a little
give to the top of a Z palette but not
this much so I really don't necessarily
feel comfortable travelling with this
but it'll be fine for storing shadows
you know here at home but I wanted to
give that a go God pretty like
houndstooth
pattern there so that's cute oh I met
Eve pearl I know I have a picture it'll
become in the vlog and I watched some of
her demonstrations really intrigued by
her theories with the reverse contouring
and stuff so I got this little palette
this was discounted I don't remember
exactly how much but it's the flawless
face palette I have it in medium it's
cream products and I was really
intrigued that they were cream
products and she mentioned like they're
all the same texture so it's not like
you're using a you know a cream blush
that's totally dewy and then a
foundation that's a totally different
texture so they all work really well so
these are the foundations the salmon
concealers that I really wanted to try
the blush a mattifier and like a shimmer
highlights so I'm wearing all that today
really liked it so far I'm interested to
see what the staying power is though
because I didn't set it a whole lot with
powder oh I'm running out of space on my
memory cards but I got the little
pamphlet and I also got the t-shirt so
yeah I just had a bowl I can't wait to
post my vlog thank you so much for
watching my haul and feel free to post
your IMATS hauls as a video response so
thanks so much guys I'll see you later
