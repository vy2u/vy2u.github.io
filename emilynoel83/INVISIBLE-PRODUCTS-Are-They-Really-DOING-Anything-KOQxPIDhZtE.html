tuning in lately as I've been kind of
doing my makeup testing different
products there have been some products
where I feel like the main question that
I have and that a lot of other people
would probably have before they purchase
them is are they really doing anything
and it's easy to tell when let's say a
matte liquid lipstick is doing something
or when a foundation is doing something
so many products just because they have
color in them are very obvious but these
things I think are either marketed as
invisible or they just you know plain
don't have any color to them and so what
are they doing for your skin are they
doing something for like the texture and
feel and smoothness of your skin are
they adding hydration are they doing
something for pore size are they
impacting the staying power of your
makeup like all these different things
are kind of the questions I have with
the products I'm talking about in this
video and this is not a first
impressions video as I have had many of
these things in my collection for months
I just thought it would be a really good
time to dedicate a video to this stuff
so the first thing is this farce Ollie
Unicorn essence this stuff this is the
stuff that you have probably seen in
Instagram videos you know those fast
paced so I'm going to dab dab dab dab a
few dots of this all over my skin and
blend it in I think for a video like
this the claims are really important so
this is a $54 product for an ounce it
says applied a clean face before
moisturizer maybe use as a primer before
makeup application so what the heck is a
freaking unicorn it says it's an
innovative water-based dual purpose
serum which helps protect the skin from
free radical damage while preparing it
for longer lasting makeup application so
it's got all of these antioxidants from
acai berries goji berries elderberry
blueberry it's got vitamin C in it which
is known to help out with like healthy
even skin tone it is pink and it does
have a scent a pretty strong scent to it
actually it's very sweet I feel like I'm
putting liquid cotton candy all over my
skin I'm going to put a drop here on the
forehead a couple of drops here because
I think didn't they call this unicorn
tears beforehand so it's kind of like Oh
you've got the unicorn tears streaming
down your face I guess is the appeal
right so I'm just going to blend this
all in and what I've noticed about this
product is it is none too moisturizing
it seems to absorb really really quickly
I'm not really feeling any additional
smoothness I picture with a really silky
smooth primer might do for your skin you
know your hands would just like go
across the top of it feels pillowy soft
now I don't have any info for this
product this feels like a very light
moisturizer that is like seeped into my
skin immediately and I feel no real
texture difference with it I've applied
more product than what I just did in the
past and it still seems to just drink it
right up my skin does now some people
say like in the reviews on Sephora
people will say yes this has an impact
on the staying power of my makeup or you
know it makes my stuff on my under eye
area look really good I mean I can't
honestly say that this is doing anything
that I can feel right now for like the
physical texture of my skin ingredients
wise sure it may be packing some great
antioxidants into my skin and maybe
doing a little something from a skincare
perspective in terms of the way it makes
my skin feel and what I can actually see
on my skin or the way it makes my
foundations and other products apply or
wear I honestly don't see any difference
with this product I feel like it's just
pipe pipe pipe people see this pink
serum they think they've got to have it
it has unicorn in the name I use this
stuff pretty consistently for a few
weeks so then you stop using it and you
realize yeah nothing seems different you
know so that's my cue that I would not
repurchase this product so moving on
we're going to talk about a moisturizer
here moisturizers obviously if they're
not tinted they're not having any color
to them but I really want to talk about
the feel of this product this is the
charlotte tilbury magic cream magic
cream in the name you know claiming to
be magical we've got to really talk
about this charlotte tilbury has this
info on the side of the box I've been
mixing my own age defying moisturizer
for years known backstage as Charlotte's
magic cream it's a secret mix of
collagen boosting anti-aging ingredients
hyaluronic acid hydrators and floral
oils that instantly transforms tired
dull skin and my skin is tired as it
is like 5:00 a.m. right now the cream is
white it does have pretty packaging like
it's like storming out there but I can't
see because it's dark right now I'm now
thinking about all those pool floaties I
didn't put away they can be kind of
nervous but I'm going to move on I've
talked about different makeup products
that give Peaks
you know like stiff peaks if you know
what I'm talking about here so this is
kind of a thick moisturizer it
definitely doesn't just like disappear
into nothingness when you start blending
it in on your skin I mean it really
feels deeply deeply hydrating
it has just a light kind of fresh scent
to it but it's nothing really
overpowering I never like to notice a
ton of fragrance in skincare products
put it on areas where I know I feel dry
all the time and I don't feel like any
texture would show through to my makeup
you know it's just a good rich dry skin
moisturizer if you're super duper oily I
don't even know that you would need this
much under your makeup but I'm sure oily
skin people maybe could chime in in the
comments section if they've got
something to offer there but it says
instant turnaround moisturizer and I
mean for my normal skin it's definitely
feeling a little bit on the tacky side
you know not in a really annoying way or
a goopy excess type of way but it just
feels really nicely moisturized and I
have worn this under makeup and I think
it's been a really good sort of prep
step thing that it's lacking for me to
be using it in the morning would be some
sort of SPF does she do something like
this that does include an SPF because I
think that would be really helpful to
not have to layer on yet another step to
my makeup as far as this product goes it
says treat and transform moisturizer I
feel like it is really feeling fantastic
on my skin right now so kind of in this
primer pre makeup prep type idea here I
have a blur stick and I think I talked
about this briefly in another video this
came in a little like sampler set of
milk makeup products this stick is
supposed to really blur the look of your
pores in fact I'm going to pull it up
here on Sephora site it says it's a
colorless oil and silicone free primer
to blur the look of imperfections on all
skin tones says it minimizes the
appearance of pores and fine lines on
every skin tone for an invisible smooth
matte finish so there's what it looks
like you twist it up here it's got this
kind of beige you look to it but it is
definitely colorless going on the skin
and look at my nose before now we're
going to put some of this on like it is
instantly mattifying instantly and now
I'm going to kind of blend that in
because I noticed a little like excess
product happened to come off there I'm
going to do a little on the sides of the
nose is
well because I know this is where I see
pores they really show up for me like on
toward the end of my nose and on the
sides there and the modification that is
happening with this product is certainly
you know kind of blurring at the look of
it as it says with a blur stick now I
want to kind of go over some areas where
I know I have some fine lines here in my
forehead because they referenced that as
well
here as I have used this product I have
not seen it being able to blur the look
of actual lines in the skin like I can
just see them right now every bit as
much as I did before the pores I think
it is making a difference with however I
think your foundation application going
on top of this I think it can really
make a difference because we can do it
over what this just did for my pores
just now but what I've noticed is I put
foundation on top of it it can kind of
like change it or smear they're not
saying this feels goopy or greasy or
anything like that on my face but by the
time you take a brush or a Beauty
Blender all over your skin and you're
trying to blend out foundation I'm
wondering sometimes if I lose the effect
to me the blur stick feels like instant
gratification but I'm not always seeing
like a lasting or profound effect on my
skin afterwards now I want to talk about
these cooling water type sticks but
cooling water is the actual name for the
milk sticks so this is another one of
those things in that little set and it
does feel super cooling on the skin you
can feel like this really thin but
definitely apparent level of hydration
on your skin and I love putting these
kinds of things on on my under eye area
in fact they've almost been replacing
like an eye cream type thing when I
start my makeup because they just do
feel really hydrating and when I say
they I've got two others that I've been
really closely comparing to this one
ever since I did that primer declutter
video so I've got the elf prep and
hydrate bowl and also the hard candy
shear and the coconut water primer stick
I would say for the texture of all of
these just the way they feel the way
they add hydration to the skin there are
two of these things that are really
close the milk and the hard candies they
seem so
in terms of the texture on the skin like
if we did a blind test of this and
somebody was like putting these across
my hand or putting them on each
under-eye area and I didn't know what
was going on there at the time I don't
think I would be able to tell these two
apart like they have the same amount of
moisture that they give back to the skin
and the same amount of cooling effect
that I feel the elf one while it does
look the same I don't feel like this
gives quite as much moisture to the skin
as the other to do and it's not maybe
quite as cooling you guys I have tried
so hard as I have used these to hone in
on what is the difference and I feel
like the milk and the hard candy are
very strong in both of those aspects a
lot of moisture and a lot of cooling and
the elf is still good like if you've got
that I still think you would notice a
certain amount of moisture and cooling
to it it's even more evident with these
two so I think for this video I'm going
to slap on this coconut water primer
stick from hard candy and yes just on
contact so cooling so I like to kind of
run that around my under-eye area and
then I just kind of take my fingers and
dab over it and it feels like such a
nice layer of moisture there and then I
go on and like tweeze my brows and I
kind of let that moisture sink in for a
little bit before I start applying
makeup and already just sitting here
after like 30 seconds I can feel that
it's no longer that slippery moisture
feel some has sunk into the skin but my
under-eye area does not feel dry at all
it feels really really refreshing and
just so nice and so you might be looking
at all the things I've used so far and
be like dang she's using you know the
unicorn stuff and the face cream and
then a blur stick and then a cooling
water stick melt on a daily basis like
I've kind of realized this is not
something that's going to stay in my
daily routine yes I am going to be
putting a moisturizer on I really don't
see the blur stick becoming a daily
ritual for me but so far with what we're
talking about these pre makeup products
this is a really good moisturizer I wish
it had the SPF but I think I will on
days when I'm feeling maybe especially
dry I think I'll reach for this and I do
really like this hard candy coconut
water primer stick as well there's no
reason why you couldn't put that all
over your skin by the way I
get the most impact and like cooling
benefit from it around the eyes it just
feels so good on the eyes now I'm going
to move on with a few more steps in my
makeup and we'll talk about some other
invisible products so I have put on my
foundation and it's the Smashbox Studios
skin shaping foundation the one that has
the foundation stick on one side and
then the little like sculpting stick
like a contour color right I put that in
the hollows of the cheeks around the
forehead I also did some concealer I
used this NARS soft matte complete
concealer also I tried to be really
really careful as I was blending in that
foundation over my nose considered
really buffing in circular motions or
raking across it side to side I really
just tried to work on pressing that
foundation in around the nose and I kind
of do feel like I'm still seeing the
effects of what that blur stick was
doing so I think it's possible for that
to continue doing its job under makeup
you know what I mean you just do have to
be kind of careful
but now the reason why we've turned the
camera back on I wanted to talk about
the translucent powder duo from bare
minerals they have a matte side and a
glow side I've had this for a good long
while like I want to say I got this
maybe around the holidays if not before
here's the matte side and as you can see
the glow side has kind of a swirl of a
Beijing peach tone in there and if you
were to swatch these you know you see
them very lightly on the skin the glowy
side when you touch it you just pick up
more product like it's a little softer
to the touch and the glow is what I
would call very very gentle like I'm
very much barely there glow but it's
super light kind of blended in the glowy
side right there on my skin can you even
tell what's catching the light there
it's super subtle then the matte side
yes I can't argue with the fact that
that's totally matte even though that
looks super white I think it performs
very much as a translucent shade so I'm
going to try to use the matte on a few
areas of my skin today with my ELF
small tapered brush love this brunch any
time you're trying to apply powders and
keep them very targeted you know so I
want to try to use that right here on
the under eye area and as I said before
not my first rodeo with these products
you know I've tried them out quite a bit
not that I'm really needing to be super
mattified here around the nodes but
applying it kind of on the t-zone area
just to sort of set the foundation that
I've got on my undereyes to the touch
they do not feel super techie they feel
rather smooth but honestly as an under
eye setting powder I would say this is
kind of a myth because the thing that I
noticed right away when I put it on was
kind of an instant worth of dryness and
I felt like I just achieved so much
hydration with the cooling water and
then the concealer looked good on top
and this powder too said it just didn't
seem necessary in that area now we're
going to take the glow powder with a
little bit bigger brush as I said this
picks up a lot more like on a brush when
you dab into it you just see a lot more
product going on so I'm going to kind of
just swirl this elsewhere on the skin
kind of on top of my cheeks you seen a
little more glow happening there it's
not too much glow enos but when my
skin's really hitting the light you can
see just a tiny bit of Sheen like I
think that step was actually quite nice
because it was so lightweight the powder
is so so super thin and that glowy side
doesn't look too powdery on my face so
the best way to describe this powder I
would say it's taking away any tacky
texture that your skin might have after
foundation but it's still managing to be
weightless that being said I don't think
the mat looks super great on my skin the
glow looks better but there's a
lower-cost alternative to that and it is
definitely the Milani prep set and glow
kind of a similar thing happening here I
think the Milani gives an even better
look honestly maybe even a hint more
glow than this does but not like you
know shouting from the rooftops
highlight globe but just a hint of
something it takes all this madness that
you get from your foundation and
concealers and whatnot and just gives a
little bit more of that skin like low so
I really do love that in the Milani and
really scrutinizing this product and
using it on and off for months here not
really seeing this as a must-have and in
fact I don't even really like it on my
under eyes a prize that bareMinerals has
released more recently is this invisible
bronze powder bronzer you can see the
bronzer like in a swatch here so it's
definitely not totally invisible it
seems
the way they've created this Ranger
product here these are supposed to kind
of correspond with your skin tones so
fare to light it said ideal for fair to
life skin the medium for medium skin
tones the tan for tan skin tones but I
was kind of worried it might not show up
at all so I went for the tan even though
I would probably be medium and then they
also make a dark too deep as well they
say this luxuriously smooth baked
formula delivers multi-dimensional sheer
buildable color that looks healthy and
natural never orange or overdone ultra
fine reflective pearls create a subtle
glow that mimics the effective skin
after a day in the Sun got my ELF
complexion brush that I really like to
use with bronzers and we're going to
start out just getting this right around
the hairline I can see a subtle glow
with this that tends to be what I notice
I come away from using this product
feeling like it's sort of like any old
bronzer that I used in the past the tone
of it is good when they say never
overdone like yeah I see that kind of
reinforcing that contour like it looks
nice but it does go on the skin kind of
sheer let's put it like where the Sun
might naturally hit and see what kind of
color we actually build up here nothing
major right it's soft its natural I will
say that it's not a scary bronzer if
you're very apprehensive about products
like this I don't think you need to fear
even going with the shade that I did on
my skin you know I can see it but it's
not too much it's not like invisible
though invisible might draw more people
to this product and sound a little more
intriguing but I would say sheer is
probably the best description in
comparison to other bronzers other just
typical bronzers from various brands
have been trying some Becca bronzers
recently in comparison to that this is a
sheer coverage level on the skin and I
think it's cool that they put this out
in a range to cater to different skin
tones but for my own personal needs it's
not knocking my socks off and I would
not repurchase it and back with you
after getting the rest of my face on and
the last product I wanted to focus on
here is the milk makeup blur spray and
this says it's an invisible matte makeup
setting spray provides a soft focus blur
effect directions shake well before use
hold six to eight inches from face and
mist on the skin after makeup at
education so I thought this would be a
fun thing to see like is it actually
doing anything I so feel that way about
different like makeup setting sprays is
it actually making the makeup last
longer does it actually look like
anything on the skin what I've been
doing a lot with my setting sprays is
doing about four myths I kind of focus
one on the top of my face bottom of my
face and then on each side so let's just
do it okay
let the droplets sink in to be honest
with you guys and I have done this so
many times I put this on I've gotten way
up close to my face to try to see if I
notice anything this is I think a truly
matte finish makeup setting spray if you
put a lot of glow on your skin let's say
you wore a buttload of highlight one day
and then you put this on it's not going
to like mattify that but four spritzes
of this and it felt like a decent amount
of product landing down on my skin it's
not going to be one of those sprays like
the Too Faced one or the Mario Badescu
or the hard candy sheer envy primer mist
those with a few myths like the same
amount of product here actually look a
little bit dewy on the skin this lands
on your skin and it does look matte and
it does claim to be an invisible Mac
makeup setting spray provides a soft
focus blur effect I have used this
numerous times over different kinds of
products I've used no blur stick
underneath I've used the blur stick to
me like I said it's it's not doing
anything beyond just being that matte
makeup setting spray the blurring I kind
of question because it's not like this
is liquefied blur stick or something I'm
putting this on makeup and this claims
to be a makeup setting spray so I have
already put foundations and concealers
on my skin that's doing a fair amount of
blurring of skin tones and imperfections
and this and that I'm not really giving
this product the credit also the times
I've worn this
I have not noticed really any
improvement in the staying power of my
makeup and one product there is a
product out there that is a matte
setting spray it's from urban decay and
it's called the slick and that stuff has
a profound effect on staying power like
it I'm not sure what's going on in that
product but it works so well if you are
oily
and you need that Matt setting spray to
really lock in the makeup it does the
job this you know yes I can put it on
it's not adding any additional glow to
my skin it's delivering on the Matt
claims but I wouldn't go so far to say
that it's blurring anything and it's not
really extending the wear of my makeup
so I would say the stuff that I really
liked most from this video would be I
like the magic cream I think this is a
really phenomenal texture for a
moisturizer I wish something would come
out that had some SPF in it but you
could still layer on an additional SPF
and really like hard candies coconut
water primer stick this is very cooling
and I think it's a fantastic dupe for
the milk cooling water stick so
obviously I like this two of their dupes
for one another but why not go with the
lower-cost item and these are many sizes
of sticks by the way those actual sticks
are quite a bit larger I do like the
blur stick this is kind of right in the
middle for me because I think it does do
a good job I think you have to be very
careful with the makeup you put on top
to not undo the effects of the blur
stick except that I am really just not
super sold on would be the unicorn
essence for that price tag I'd like to
see it doing a little bit more for my
skin also the milk makeup spray and I've
tried better setting sprays this
bareMinerals powder duo like I said go
for the Milani if you're looking for
something that's just going to give you
the lightest veil of soft glow on the
skin and the invisible bronze may be
what the doctor ordered for some people
who are looking for a super sheer
bronzer but for me I'm not going to need
that all the time so I really hope this
video was helpful for you my battery
light is flashing so I will talk to you
guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
