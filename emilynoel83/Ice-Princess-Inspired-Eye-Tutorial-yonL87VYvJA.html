tutorial is ice princess yes so we're
going to be using lots of shimmer we're
going to be using shimmer elsewhere in
the face as well which I'll tell you
about towards the end of the video but
it's shimmery it's fun it's sort of a
wearable twist on a look that could go
super dramatic and fun so I've kind of
used some different products some
shimmer some gel liners in here as well
so I hope you enjoy this look and keep
on step one is to lay down a base on
your eye and for that i'm actually using
one of the new shades of gel liner from
Coastal Scents this is wicked and it's
kind of a just straight-up silvery shade
and I kind of forgot I was doing a
tutorial at first and I went ahead and
started putting this on them like oh no
wait you can only do one eye at a time
but basically I'm just taking sort of a
flat brush getting some of that on there
and going all over the lid a little bit
into the crease and right along the
inner corner as well and also underneath
so just kind of surround the eye in that
shade a lot of these new shades are not
your typical liner shades like silver
and pink and stuff like that so um I
consider them to be really good basis
because they have that staying power of
a liner but you can put them all over
your lids so that's what I'm starting
outlet to get that initial kind of
silvery light shimmery tone to the lids
and then the next thing I'm going to do
is go for my palate it's called millas
blues it's one of those celebrity
pallets from l'oreal and this is very
similar also to that smashbox palette i
was talking about that I used on Kaley
on that other video so another drug
store dupe option on that would probably
be this palette there's also Physicians
Formula shimmer strips and smoky blue
eyes is one that I told her to pick up
to kind of duplicate that look as well
so anyway I'm just going to use one of
the sponge tip applicator here because I
want packed on color at this point and
I'm going to go for this lighter shade
of blue right down here it's still sort
of a medium blue though and I'm going to
just pack this on on top of our pretty
silver shade so we're ending up with a
really kind of light shimmery blue all
over
and once I've got that on the lid and
I'm going to take a fluffier brush this
one is from Revlon it's a contour shadow
brush I found it at big lots actually a
while back and get some of that shade on
that brush and just use that to get it
in the crease and actually bring that
shade up just a little bit just like
that okay alrighty next we're going to
go for our darker shade which is of
course that darker blue here in the
palette both shades have shimmer to them
so that helps just kind of keep the
shimmery IC look to this whole on I
tutorial I'm taking my essence of beauty
fine crease brush those are available at
CVS get a little bit of that color on
there and we are going to go the whole
length of our crease with this I'm going
inner corner getting it right there in
the crease and trailing along to our
outer corner we're not doing an outer V
here we're just following our natural
crease so wherever that takes you that's
where you want to put this I'm kind of
looking down into a mirror also to get
that color in my crease I'm looking down
and that way I can see the full effect
of my eyes I look down and do this so
inner corner to outer corner just really
get it in there and kind of blend up
just a bit but you know it doesn't have
to be too overdone with this and write
down there in the inner corner then take
another bear fluffy brush use that to
kind of buff over the edge w get a
really really smooth blend on that the
next thing I want to do is do some real
accents with this look with a couple of
loose shadow shades the first is a
really really I see light blue shade
from everyday minerals called wood
sorrel and I use this back in my fall
everyday minerals tutorial and just get
a little bit of that on a fluffy brush
and just kind of carefully sort of Pat
that along all the way to the brow bone
what's interesting about this is that
you
are going to get a little bit of a
bluish tone to your highlight which is
something I almost never would do but
for this look it's really um that's kind
of the change in this look and making it
look different from other looks is that
you know you're bringing blue into it
all the way up your including color the
whole way through and we're going to
take another loose shade just to accent
some colors up around the brow but also
around the inner corner of the eye and
that is the NYX ultra pearl mania in
Pearl this kind of comes off as a
slightly pinkish shade but um anyway I'm
going to take my little tiny detail
brush from coastal scents and get some
of that just kind of it kind of dips
right down in there pretty easily kind
of tap some off on my hand here and what
we're going to do is just go in and kind
of get that some of that applied right
in here really just getting it right up
under the inner half of the eyebrow and
then we want to do some more of that
right in here on our ultimate inner
corner we're going in and we're going
all the way down and around okay there
we go next thing we want to do is work
on our liner a little bit and I'm going
to use another one of those um pretty
gel liners I love this shade this is so
gorgeous um oops I just open the one I
just use just second some of these are
just the most unique colors I love that
about it this shade is stellar it's a
black with a really like
multi-dimensional sparkle to it like
different colored sparkle it's so pretty
it's like a charcoal gray with shimmer
and then some sparkle as well so perfect
for the look we're going for today so
I'm going to take my Smashbox number 21
brush it's becoming like my favorite
brush for the cream and gel liners and
get some of that shade on there and what
we're going to do is go basically almost
halfway in right here on the top and
kind of halfway in here in terms of the
application and then we're going to take
a q-tip and smudge it further in on the
bottom so basically get that shade laid
down right here on the outer half you
can make it a little thicker if you want
it doesn't have to be perfect because we
are going to go in and do a little
smudging to it make it seem a little
less harsh and intense because this is a
really really soft look so I'm going to
take my q-tip do this you know I
wouldn't hoop said I wouldn't advise you
to go ahead and do all of the liner and
then try to smudge it i would do it one
part of the eye at a time because keep
in mind this isn't a cream shadow this
is a liner and you know when it dries it
won't be nearly as smudge able anymore
so just a reminder there so there we are
just kind of getting a softer softer
twist on that shade right there in the
outer corner and then we're going to
continue that on the lower lash line as
well we're connecting but we're not
really doing a big wing down thing we're
just getting out to the corner in terms
of making a connection there and then
we're running it about halfway under
need a little more here
these brushes like this this is you can
see this is a little more flexible and
so this is going to give you a little
less even though it's a very tiny brush
it's going to give you at times a
slightly less precise exact line just
because it is more flexible than those
really stiff angled brushes that you
might find so again go in with your
q-tip we're going to smudge the outer
part of that and continue to kind of
smudge it in as much as you want next I
want to take my tackle on liner brush
from Coastal Scents again in the sort of
opposite from that other brush a little
more precise and I'm going to go to the
dark blue shade back in my palette and
I'm going to just top off what I've done
liner wise with that so it's going to
give it more of a blue tone but I'm
going to also use that to take things in
a little bit closer on my lower lash
line I know it seems like kind of a lot
of steps for this look but you know if
you don't like doing all these steps you
just do as many steps as you want you do
not have to do exactly what I do okay so
I've got that on into the inside give
yourself a look now and just kind of
make sure that you've got you know you
got highlights where you want them
you've kind of got the lowlights for me
I might on this I go a little bit deeper
in the crease just with a little more
than blue next I'm going to curl my
lashes then I'm going to apply my
L'Oreal telescopic explosion mascara
it's sort of a dupe for that givenchy
mascara that's just a little bitty like
like sphere there at the end and i
usually don't show I mascara application
but I am kind of just trying this out
testing it seeing if I liked it and I
wanted to let you see kind of how the
application would go with this the idea
at least with the way they're kind of
marketing this is as you know you can
get to the lashes from any angle like
you could hold the brush way up like
this
and really kind of get this separation
there it's great I can tell for getting
right here in the corner and I'm getting
some decent length out of this too it
does kind of remind me I mean my my look
that I'm getting off of this is kind of
similar to that of the regular
telescopic it's just a different way of
getting it on it seems like I'm just
getting a little more on there yeah it
is kind of good for getting every last
little lash and also on the bottom what
would happen if I just did that Oh a
little clumpy there on that one part
anyway kind of a cool concept i'm not
sure sometimes mascara is kind of like i
start to like them a little more the
more i use them or as the formulation
gets a little less wet and more creamy
as you kind of as you use mascaras but
this is definitely the easiest way to
get into your inner corner lashes and it
is cool that you can kind of use it from
any direction
everyone I'm back with my finished ice
princess inspired I tutorial it's really
fun and she's just a wearable twist on
something that really could be made a
lot more dramatic force a Halloween or
just any like special event or fun dress
up thing you were doing the one step
that I forgot to include there that I
remembered right before I came back on
as I lined my inner waterline with white
on this so that kind of adds to the sort
of vertical nature of this kind of
building your look by your lashes kind
of coming up like this we're not going
so much out but we're working right
within the I a lot and it's going to
make your the whites of your eyes seem
bigger because they're blending right
and with that white that you've got on
the waterline so I don't know if that
makes sense but yeah this is an easy
look to achieve I kind of took a lot of
steps in terms of getting the shimmer on
there but it's it's really not that
difficult in terms of the face that's
another thing you want to think about
with this um apply whatever you want to
do foundation wise and then I put on a
little bit of bronzer i use my Rimmel
natural bronzer and Sundance because it
has a little bit of shimmer to it so and
I and I kind of wanted to keep with the
shimmer for this look anyway and then I
used my elf all over cover stick in or
not cover stick color stick and lilac
pedal so it's a light light shimmery
creamy shade and I kind of ran that up
on my cheekbones and a little bit kind
of over my eyebrows down my nose a
little bit on my chin and on my sort of
Cupid's bow area of my lips and then to
kind of go over that and set that off I
use my benefit tin bronzer and
highlighter I use the highlighter side
just to kind of play off that shimmer
even more then on my lips I use the
Knicks harmonica lipstick which is a
very very light frosty pink and I went
over that with where is it okay the elf
hyper shine lipgloss in faerie which is
sort of a just a very light pink just as
you would think fairy um kind of just
makes that nice light shimmer to your
lips that would really be pretty with a
lot of other like smokey
looks as well I think so thanks guys for
tuning in for this video I hope you
enjoyed sort of a different twist on an
eyelet for me and I have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
