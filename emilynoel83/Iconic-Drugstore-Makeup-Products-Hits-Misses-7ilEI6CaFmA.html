thrilled to do this video it's been
something that I've kind of been
thinking about for a little while and
just kind of recently put the pieces
together but I have this great makeup
book it's called classic Beauty the
history of makeup and before you like
fall asleep on me this book is so
awesome it's really really cool if
you're just makeup obsessed to look back
at the origins of where everything
started you know why are we doing what
we're doing with a mascara wand or an
eyelash curler and they kind of show you
the introduction of some really iconic
makeup products
I mean iconic in that for decades they
have been sold in the stores and that's
really saying something for makeup
because as we all know you know stuff
gets discontinued and changed all the
time so looking at those old ads and
everything really inspired me to do this
video and talk about some of those
iconic drugstore makeup products that
have been around for so long and that we
still see in the drugstores today those
things that are without a doubt fixtures
of the brands that they belong to so
I've picked out some if you've got more
ideas of iconic drugstore makeup
definitely leave it below in the
comments section maybe we can roll on
with the part 2 of this we go along if I
found some cool old ads and stuff from
this book or elsewhere online I'll
insert those I just think that's so cool
product I want to talk about is Revlon
Colorstay and kind of this whole mind
the whole Colorstay idea I feel like has
been around for so long I think about
seeing that way back when I started
makeup and I know it was around even
before then but in particular I think
one of the real trademark products of
that line is the liquid foundation and
got the combo to oily skin and then the
normal to dry formula and I think that's
kind of unique in the drugstore to see
one line of makeup that really caters to
two separate skin types I know this
foundation to be very very long wearing
feel that way about both versions I've
been a layer in the past and I've used
that combo doily formula and it's really
hardcore tor recently I've gotten into
the normal to dry skin formula my shade
is fresh beige coverage on these liquid
foundations is really good I think over
time I've kind of become a little more
attached to the whipped variety which
came out more recently not really an
icon yet you know it hasn't been around
that long but I love the finish of that
staying power the blend ability I feel
like it almost gives a little more
natural finish on the skin whereas the
regular color stay liquids are very very
matte but I think without a doubt keller
stay is an iconic part of the drugstore
whether drugstore icon I think has got
to be the covergirl clean line
specifically the pressed powder I
remember when I was in like eighth grade
and this was the kind of powder every
girl was carrying around in their makeup
bags and backpacks and it has a scent
that if you've ever smelled that you
know exactly what I'm talking about
it's that strong noxeema sent in this
powder and that is something that really
has not changed the packaging you know
is a little bit different now with the
little puff and I have this here in the
shape medium light and I did wear that
with my look today you know I dust it a
little bit on just strikes me as a real
matte oil control standard pressed
powder I think there are other powders
that I've discovered in more recent
years in the drugstore whether it's
L'Oreal True Match the Revlon nearly
naked I've been liking that Maybelline
wonder powder but just like powders that
have come out with a little bit more of
a rich texture that doesn't look quite
so powdery on the skin we're not the
best description of powder but I just
feel like they're not quite as dry it's
good enough it gets the job done reminds
me of the good old days
not my favorite powder by any means from
the drugstore though ok let's talk about
eye stuff when I was thinking about
eyeshadows from the drugstore one
particular not just line of shadows came
to mind but it just one shade out of the
spectrum and it's the covergirl
shimmering sands trio I think this has
got to be one of the first eyeshadow
palettes of any sort that I ever
her head I don't think it's just me you
know I think across the board so many
people have become attached to this trio
for how basic it is I did buy it more
recently in this newer packaging that
they've come out with because I have
suspected that maybe some things have
changed quality wise with the covergirl
shadows with some of the newer shades
that have come out I've noticed a
difference this way I compared the
swatches and how it goes on my eyes too
one that I've had longer that's one I
feel like it really has kept that same
formula the way I use it you know I take
this kind of pearly shade and put it
around my inner corner take the middle
shade go over the rest of the lid with
that and then blend the darkest color
kind of up into the crease you could
highlight with either of these light or
two shades as well but I just think it's
a very beginner friendly palette also
real hard to blend these shades together
and I think you get a pretty look that's
pretty much universally flattering
definitely a long-standing drugstore
product and I think for good reasons
they don't really have to mention a
couple of iconic drugstore mascaras I've
got two that I've picked out it's kind
of the granddaddy of them all one of
them is the original L'Oreal voluminous
luminous original really has the kind of
brush that I really prefer with a lot of
mascaras I love that it's just
traditional bristles not spaced out too
much I feel like I do get some good
separation and a lot of thickness
I think of voluminous I think of getting
thicker black lashes I don't get a ton
of length with this mascara another
thing that it doesn't do for me is hold
my curl very well a couple of coats I
feel like it does build on itself nicely
but it's still not my favorite drugstore
mascara but you can't deny that this is
one of the most iconic products that
L'Oreal has in its line either iconic
mascara that has just never really
agreed with my lashes is you know what
it is all you got to do is see those two
colors together and you know this is
Maybelline great lash it's been around
for so long I remember my mom having
this tube and even as a child you know
recognizing that this was her mascaras
launched all the way back in 1971 so
think about all the decades the
women have been walking past this
product in their drugstores me whether
you like this mascara or not it's
definitely had longevity in an industry
where I feel like everything is
constantly changing and check out the
brush on this mascara it doesn't it look
teeny tiny compared to all of the
massive brushes that I feel like I've
come out more recently it's got those
classic bristles that are spiraled all
the way around a couple reasons why this
hasn't worked well for me is I feel like
the formula is pretty wet and also the
gaps between the bristles are kind of
wide so those two things paired together
the wet formula and the really gapped
out bristles and makes my lashes kind of
stick together after using this mascara
I tend to look like I've got about four
or five eyelashes like so often this
gets touted as like a makeup artists
favorite or it's mentioned in magazines
as an editor's pick but it really hasn't
worked for me I'm sure it's working for
some people out there but I don't feel
like I have really thick lashes to begin
with so for me it's a definite no-go now
let's talk about some iconic lipsticks
from the drugstore that I absolutely
love love love it's the Revlon Super
Lustrous line there's something about
this packaging guys I think everybody
needs to have at least one of these in
their collection I mean how cool do you
feel when you twist up that gold tube
and apply your lipstick you know it's so
girly it's so classic like Revlon Super
Lustrous lipstick has been around for so
long and in particular I think there are
certain shades that have really gotten
super popular over the years and are
still there today when I'm wearing today
and holding up here as cherries in the
snow you know that is an iconic shade in
make such a beautiful reddish berry type
color and as you see it go on I mean
it's just as full color as any you know
brand new thing that's come out touting
how colorful it is this has been in the
drugstore for ever and I think so many
people maybe overlook it for newer
things but this line of lipstick is
awesome it almost got mentioned in my
form or tag because I do have so many of
them in my collection finally I must
mention the lip smacker
I think lip smackers are a totally icon
make up product specifically I'm going
to point out the dr. pepper flavor how
random really when you start thinking
about it it's a lip balm flavored like a
soft dream when you smell it I don't
know if maybe you're around my age and
like way back in the day you had this
lip smacker it's like you know exactly
what the dr. pepper lip smacker smells
like it doesn't necessarily make me
think of dr. pepper but it's like this
is created some sort of scent memory for
those of us who have used it that's all
its own and I remember reading in
magazines like way way long ago how this
was pointed out as something that would
give your lips just that like light
reddish tint in tinted lip balms have
really exploded on the market in recent
years but this is probably one of the
first things I've ever owned that
technically was attended lip balm it was
like the one lip smacker that you could
put on and really feel like ooh you know
it's not just totally clear so I think
that's really cool in a total drugstore
icon so this video was just a lot of fun
for me thank you for taking time to
watch thank you to my sister Kelly aka
pup for getting me this great book to
begin with and I will talk to you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
