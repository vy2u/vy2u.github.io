another in the palm of your hand
palette vol 2 greatest hits from the
balm which is of course one of my
favorite makeup brands I'm so excited I
called this I knew when they came out
with the volume one which was that I
think it was 2015 holiday season yeah
not this past Christmas but the one
before this one came out and I knew when
they called it vol 1 I totally thought
there should be a volume two and now
it's out and I am so excited to give you
my review about it in this video
now this palette was sent to me by the
Boehm but you guys know I would have
gone out and sought it out myself
even if it hadn't been like I'm so
excited part of my love for this kind of
palette is not just from enjoying this
brand and generally loving what they do
but it's the whole theory behind this
that I wish so many other brands would
get on board with and it is putting
their existing products into a palette
form so you can actually like I don't
know get a sense of what's really
offered from this brand or if you
already love this brand it's kind of
nice to have everything all in one place
limited edition stuff is cool you know
the things that are out for a little
while and they come and go I get it it's
exciting but I even more than that value
when a brand is willing to put their
actual formulas like just as good as the
original products into one big palette
and what you see like hey this is what
we're about this is we can do these are
our best-selling products I love that
this is the original one this is the new
one just physically looking at the outer
packaging they seem to be the same size
however do you guys recall was the
original there was this extra flap here
with two cream products in it one of the
shades from how about them apples
palette and also a bomb girls lipstick
here they sort of spaced the products
out a little bit more and not only did
they do away with the cream products
under the flap but there's nothing else
to really replace those so to speak
either so you're getting two products
less in this palette compared to this
one
but that is reflected in the price and I
think that's kind of what's important I
look back at my old review this one sold
for 39 50 and this one and the newest
one is $32 so at least you
know that if you're getting less product
you're paying less for the pallet
altogether now as far as the original
though if you're really interested in
that that's not being sold on the balmes
website which is where the new one is
that I found it on Amazon it's being
sold through Beauty Bridge on Amazon for
37 55 so it is even marked down a little
bit from that original 3950 price tag so
it's not completely 100% off the market
if you are interested in that original
and I'll go ahead and link below to my
full review on that one or the volume to
the outer packaging they kind of kept a
similar theme to the original because
it's like a collage of the outer
packagings of so many different products
in their line you do have a nice big
mirror on the inside and it's overall
just that like cardboard II packaging
design that the ball usually has with
their pallets what I like about that is
kind of lightweight it's very slim and
there's not a lot of wasted space with a
product like this and then on the inside
what's neat about the product and they
did this with the original - they are
bordered basically with the original
packaging that all of these things came
in so like the eyeshadows you can see
kind of the theme from each palette that
they came from as far as the blushes you
know the the blushes from the balm
really each had their own identity
though the way they were originally
packaged that's kind of what they look
like here sitting in this palette so the
eyeshadows you're getting one is from
the meet matrimony palette mess matte
read it's a really dark matte Brown
you're getting firm from the nude dude
palette kind of a murky shades have a
light brown dusty bronze type color
you're getting Alice copper from the
balm Jovi palette one of my favorite
shapes from that palette this is a rich
burgundy shade that really shows true to
color on the eyes like it looks even
more reddish burgundy rich on the eyes
than you would even expect you know
because you look at it in here and some
shades just get so dark that you can't
really see the color that doesn't simply
look dark on the eyes that really has a
burgundy intensity and then you've got
from the meet Matador palette Matt Russo
completely matte shade here it's going
to be like a light brown dusty rose mix
beautiful crease color and then you've
got the mary lou manizer highlight and
that could definitely fall in with your
use of the
their eyes shadows you can use it as an
eye shadow you can use it as a highlight
and then down here we've got Bahama Mama
bronzer a matte bronzer down boy blush
which is a matte cool pink blush
frat-boy blush which is a matte peachy
pink whoo it's the essence of peachy
pink and then an instinct legend the
color houndstooth we have a nice ma B
plum on the cheeks amazing staying power
with that line of blushes and really
with all of them I have compared these
quality-wise just pigmentation wise with
the original blushes that I have in my
collection it's exactly the same and
that was one of the things I loved about
this palette too was that they weren't
like watering down their products just
to put them in a palette they're really
showing you what they can do and I'm
thinking they're hoping they snag some
more lovers of their brand you know by
putting in top-quality products into a
palette form like this so yeah I think
it's totally for the person who loves
the balm and collects the balm and wants
to just keep up with their new palettes
and it's fun to have all of these things
all in one but I think it's even more
important for the person who's new to
the balm to get a palette like this
because the value is insane take it from
someone who owns these products
individually uses them regularly all the
time they're always in my rotation I've
had them for quite a while and I have
not hit pan yet on any of these so
getting them in a palette albeit mini
sized in here I still don't think you
would run out of these anytime soon
so it's a tremendous value to have them
all in that same like top-quality
formula and then you've got the
eyeshadows up here as well let's talk
overlap for a second this may bother
some people it bothered me a little bit
honestly at the start as I was kind of
comparing and analyzing these two
palettes but you're getting a couple of
things over lapping here with the Bahama
Mama bronzer and the mary-lou manizer is
those two were both part of the original
palette and at first I thought well gosh
you know maybe they should have swapped
those out for something different but I
think what would they have put in here
because Bahama Mama is like the balmes
bronzer that is their one kind of
bronzer contour type powder and if they
just put a random blush in there let's
say in place of that product in the new
palette it would have suffered some
versatility wise for me
because the fact that they're giving you
this distinct highlight shade a choice
of blushes in a bronzer contour color
that makes it very versatile it's doing
a lot for you and if I really want to be
honest with myself like I own all of
these products individually already so I
guess I've already shown that I'm not
really too upset about having multiples
I think what's nice is just having the
different combination of shades overall
in a small palette that you can pick up
and take with you or a very giftable
palette I gifted this original one to
several people around the holidays when
it first came out and everybody loved it
in the original shadow wife they were
getting kind of a grayish color a rose
gold a deep matte burgundy and all of
them and again the mary-lou manizer
shade here I feel like this one is all
about the plumy look because you've got
this
Alice copper shade which I cannot resist
reaching for that color anytime I use
this and it sheers out and creates such
a pretty like I don't know plummy rich
fall/winter depth to the eye I love that
but this matte Brown falls in line with
that too so well and also kind of
inseparable it gives you a really rich
dark look I mean the bones powders are
some of the best quality powders like
the quality of their shadows quality of
the blush is some of the best out there
I really can't think anybody would have
complaints about how well these shadows
apply where blend they're so rich
they're so good now you could do a look
and you could leave out a less copper
entirely and you could get less of a
burgundy vibe with it I mean I could see
mary loumanizer being on your lid Matt
Russo or firm being on your crease and
then maybe a little darkness or a little
liner with this deepest brown but the
way I like to use it in the way I'll
show you in my demo I love this meet
Matador shade in the crease it's that
rosy warmth and then blending some Alice
copper kind of on my lid the outer part
of my lid and up into that shape while
these are shades that are not uncommon
to my collection I really love them they
just love having this grab-and-go
selection of products from the bone and
it's easy it's portable and I do know
that I've got a contour a highlight
three blushes to choose from a shadow
look that I know I'm going to like I
mean I think it's a great value $32 - I
mean the current
Hallet landscape that's a pretty good
buy so I want to walk you through how I
use this for my look today and I've got
my foundation and concealer and a little
bit of powder on at the start and then I
used Bahama Mama as my contour used in
the hollows of the cheeks use it around
the hairline anywhere else you want to
bronze up you know it's a nicely
pigmented fully matte bronzer and then I
use the in sting blush and houndstooth
which is going to be your deepest blush
in this palette and I put that a little
bit lower on my cheek then you know the
full-on apple of the cheek and I just
got that all blended out and I chose to
use frat-boy as this nice pop right on
the apple of the cheek that is such a
solid blush for just about anybody I
love that shade but down boy is gorgeous
- down boy is like that youthful baby's
blush flush so I love them both then I
took my mary-lou manizer highlight with
a small highlighter brush I use that
right on the top of the cheekbones down
to the top of the apple of the cheek
down the nose anywhere else on your face
you want to highlight looks gorgeous I
love that mary loumanizer came out so
far before the real highlighting trend
started yet it can still hang with every
popular highlight that's out there then
for my eyes I prepped my lids with my
Milani eyeshadow primer and I used the
meet Matador color Matt Russo in my
crease and I just buff that out very
easily is such an easy shade to work
with not too light not too dark I use
mary-lou manizer as a highlight on my
brow bone and then I also padded some of
that on about the inner third of my lid
and then my plan was to overlap that a
little bit with Allis copper on the rest
of the lids so I used a flat brush and I
just dabbed that shade all over so
gorgeous wedge it up into the crease
just a little bit after I've done that I
like bringing in again like a sigma e25
type brush blending that shade upward
into the crease it does have some
mobility because it is such a richly
pigmented shape so your patting it on
the lid it can very easily from there
blend up into your crease and it
combines so nicely with Matt roux so
that's a gorgeous duo of shades
side-by-side then I took a little bit
Matt Reed I didn't really need to do
this but I just thought I'd throw some
of that into my outer corner and then on
my lower lash line I smudged some Alice
copper as
as the color called firm kind of this
murky like a dirty bronze color and I
just use that on my lower lash line
finished off my look with some black
liquid liner on my upper lash line and
some red cherry number forty-three false
lashes and my lip color if you're
wondering is a mix of L'Oreal's
mastermind matte lip liners here this is
just a nice neutral colored lip liner
and I mixed in with that especially on
the center of the lip I'm wearing their
matte color riche lipstick in matka room
so that's giving me that little bit of
like pinky I don't know pinky pop but a
very subtle nude pinky pop there on the
lower lip so you guys know this kind of
look as my jam
I love these sorts of colors I think
they really did put in some great shades
in this palette it's the only thing that
would have made me like this more is
probably if they just decided to throw
in like a couple more shadows or still
give you like the amount of products
that were in the original but I can't be
too ticked off about it because the
price is so good you know they went down
from 3950 to $32 so I think they did
reflect the lesser amount of product
with the lower price of this but I'm
going to love reaching for this thing
I'm going to love traveling with this I
mean I think overall the choice of
blushes in this palette I definitely
think I like these three blushes better
than the three that were even in the
other and I love them all but if I had
to like hand pick my favorites I do love
down boy I love frat boy those give you
two distinctly different looks on the
cheeks and then this insane blush and
houndstooth I mean think of all the skin
tones that could effectively wear that
as a blush so guys I hope you enjoyed
this video I hope it gave you a good
solid look at the new in the ball of
your hand volume 2 palette I think it's
a great Buy I think it's going to be a
great gift if you're a lover of the balm
I know this is appealing to you but if
you've never tried anything from the
balm like stop yourself from buying the
individual blushes get them in the
palette can see the quality that I'm
talking about and I know you're going to
fall in love and this is just the best
value to get them in the palette form so
thank you for your time and I will talk
to you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
