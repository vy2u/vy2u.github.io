for this video this is going to be kind
of a review tutorial in one I'm going to
be talking about a new palette that I
believe is a holiday palette it's been
identified as a holiday palette on the
balmes website just haven't gotten any
official like hey here's the big rollout
of the BOMs holiday palette it just
seems to have kind of crept out there I
actually ordered mine off of the Kohl's
website I was just randomly looking at
Kohl's calm because I wanted to see if
my local Kohl's was even carrying the
balm stuff yet because I think right
when the bomb came to cold stores
it wasn't everywhere but I was trying to
get on there and see and you can
actually see like product by product
what's being carried in your local store
and so it's like yeah they do have some
things so I had gotten like the little
the Luminizer sisters trio there I was
able to find that in my store but this I
needed to order online so I got it
online it was just under $40 it's called
in the balm of your hand I'm pretty dang
pumped about this thing what they have
called this is the Greatest Hits Volume
one so as you look at the outside you
can see all of these familiar you know
packaging designs that are on some of
your favorite products from the balm and
you open it up and here's what they've
done they've given you some actual
products that are iconic shades from
their line in blush in eyeshadow in a
cream blush lip cheek thing and a
lipstick here and I absolutely love that
they've done this and I'm seeing hot
mama and the insane blush and Argyle
cabana boy mary-lou manizer and all
these things and I'm like I use these
things over and over again for years you
know you guys have been seeing me use
these different shades and tutorials and
things like that and I just think it's
awesome that they're really capitalizing
on some of the iconic shades in their
line and just lumping it into one super
cool palette I think if you are someone
who has hardly tried anything from the
balm this would be an amazing place to
start because you would get to sample so
much but if you're like me and you
literally already own every
we'll shade in you know its original
palette that it came in or just you know
the singles of the different blushes I'm
still super pumped to have this because
I think it's awesome to have these in
one and I really do like the
configuration of eyeshadows that they
put in here as well and it's just fun to
have this for travel to be able to
bounce around between the different
shade I would say this is about the size
of um like one of the nude tude or nude
dude palettes so it's super super
streamline but they fit a lot in and I
don't think they've made it too skimpy
with the face products to like dip a
brush in there all of the round things
seem very similar to the original size
of like the shadows that would be in the
shady lady palettes so let me just take
you through first off each individual
thing you've got hot mama which is a
blush and a lot of their blushes outside
of the in stain line are marketed as
blushes /i shadows so could totally be
an eyeshadow as well gorgeous sunny
golden peachy type shade you've got an
insane blush and Argyle what's really
special about these blushes their matte
but they've got amazing staying power
they really adhere to the skin Argyle is
probably one of the most universally
wearable shades it's a really classic
pink it also thrown in cabana boy which
is one of their longtime blushes it's a
really pretty plum with kind of a satin
finish there and then you've got a matte
bronzer in Bahama Mama that is a very
dark bronzer so I really think if
somebody gets their hands on this
palette and maybe you're a little bit
deeper skin tone
I still think you'll totally be able to
take advantage of the face colors in
here down here on the eyeshadows you're
getting insane Jayne from Shady Lady Vol
- and that's a very shimmery silvery
taupe from the special edition Shady
Lady they've given you mischievous
Marisa love this shade either of these
first two are great one shadow looks
mischievous Marisa is like a really
gorgeous rose gold they got sexy from
the nude tude palette so that's your
matte really deep plum Led Zepplin from
Baum jofi that's going to be your olive
green with a little bit of shimmer to it
and then of course mary lou manizer is
dead
here and that can be your highlight that
can be an eyeshadow but classic
champagne super glowy so with all of the
products from the balm quality wise I've
always felt like it's a little goes a
long way type brand you do not need to
go scrubbing your brush into the
products to pick up you know a certain
amount of color to make it show up on
your eyes let's say it's just very user
friendly
did I say there's a mirror up here
because I love that then separate flat
for the cream products love that
consideration and they've given you one
of the cheek and lip creams from the how
about them apples palette and that is
the shade called caramel and then also
me amore which is one of their balm
girls lipsticks and that is a classic
cool toned red that's the shade I'm
wearing throughout the video different
formulas here this one almost has a
little bit of like a cream to powder
type feel the how about them apples
blushes it's kind of like if you rub
them between your fingers you can feel
the product just drying a little bit so
it can be great on the cheeks or on the
lips I wore it yesterday as a lip color
and it was just very neutral and easy
and then the red is like you're super
glammed up shade the interesting thing
about just overall sizing here I mean I
know the cheek colors you know have been
downsized some but still there so so
pigmented I don't think anybody's going
to be like running out of those anytime
soon very Luminizer right here has
obviously been downsized but these two
shady lady colors I feel like those are
pretty much exactly what the sizing is
in the regular shady lady palettes and
then on the new tute and the balm Jovi
shades those are actually bigger than
what they were in their original
palettes but you've got so many options
on the cheeks and on the eyes I would
almost classify this whole chunk of
shades as like fun neutrals my favorite
combo has probably been taking these two
together the rose gold and the dark plum
looks really beautiful and don't forget
you know use Bahama Mama in the crease
that's a great matte just standard kind
of crease shade and you could use cabana
boy as a shadow as well hot mama very
eyeshadow friendly shade but something
that I really wanted to address in this
video because I know a lot of people
question when
iconic products from a brand's regular
line are somehow thrown into a pallet
did they change the quality is it
something different so I did swatch
after swatch really comparing every
original product to everything in here
and everything in this palette seemed to
be dead-on with the original products
with one exception
so I mean quality wise the textures the
pigmentation just the overall feel of
the shadows I was like yep that's a
product from the balm as I was watching
one right after the other but the one
thing I would point out is Led Zeppelin
the shade that's coming from the balm
Jovi palette this has a lot more sparkle
to it in that palette and here I mean if
you look really closely you can
definitely see some shimmer and it's got
like that little bit of a metallic edge
to it and this olive green but it
absolutely has less sparkle in this
palette than it did in the other some
people might not be happy that the
original change other people might be
like less sparkly fall out heck yeah but
this is just a killer palette I want to
show you guys how I used it today I
started with my foundation my concealer
and my brows done and a little bit of
powder as well and then I just jumped in
with Bahama Mama I use that with my ELF
complexion brush just stuff that right
there in the cheekbones around the
hairline very lightly very very lightly
with that shade and then I chose to put
on my mary-lou manizer before the blush
I love this effect get a little bit of
the shimmery glowy highlight on the
cheeks and then I took the matte blush
in here which is the insane blush and
Argyle and I went over top of that and I
just think it's a really pretty fresh
effect then I went ahead and did my lip
because I knew it was going to be a
strong lip I wanted to use the red today
so I just did that first and somehow
that kind of helps me set the stage for
the eye looks so then I prime my lids
and I used Bahama Mama in the crease
just to add a little matte neutral depth
in there also use mary-lou manizer under
the brow as my highlight and then I used
insane Jayne from Shady Lady Vol - I put
that all over the lid for that pretty
Tobey grey and I use Led Zeppelin the
olive green just in the outer corner
it kind of merged everything together
somehow from the crease to the lid and I
just thought that was really pretty just
kind of finished the look with some
winged liner very simple curl the lashes
applied mascara and boom all done this
time of year I've got a real weakness
for things that are cute
well-thought-out and great quality and
that's everything this is so this is one
of the best palettes the ball has put
out in I feel like a couple years so I'm
so excited for it so glad I got it again
I got mine at Kohl's you may want to
check either Kohl's website or the balm
comm hope you enjoyed this video and
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
