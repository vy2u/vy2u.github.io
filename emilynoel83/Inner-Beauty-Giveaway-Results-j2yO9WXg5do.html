everyone cupcakes here to help me
announce the contest winner she was just
playing a lot okay we'll let you go
Peppa so I'm calling this my inner
beauty giveaway a couple of videos ago I
went through and showed you what the
prize was going to be and I'll just
review that for you real quick it's a
Mallee set of products and this is
actually a crossbody bag here but I got
this during the Malley event in New York
City and i already had one because i pre
ordered the today's special value that's
going to be shown friday the
twenty-third on QVC so you need to tune
in for that if you don't win this
giveaway it's definitely still available
to you tomorrow get Malley's poreless
face defender okay so this is like the
clear product you can kind of use and
touch up your face give your face a nice
satiny finish you get two brand new face
defender products one is the face
defender highlight so it's again that
really interesting smooth smooth formula
there it's not a cream it's like kind of
like a pressed gel almost but it's not
sticky in any way it's very silky and
then you get a blush this is pink
perfection so all that face defenders
stuff and then you get four more
products so it's seven full-size
products in all it's a volumizing
mascara which I love which I'm wearing
today I'm also wearing the lip gloss
today which is in flirty so that's a
volumizing lip gloss you get the shadow
stick in violet which these are so long
wearing i have what i swatched on my
hand the other day and i really i mean i
had to put some makeup remover to it to
get it off so very long wearing and you
also get an eyeliner in black chairs
o'malley's makeup is about being long
wearing and just some really innovative
stuff so i thought this would be a
really fun kit for someone to try went
through randomly chose a winner out of
the comments the question to you all was
what is inner beauty how do you show it
how do you express it with to the world
and i got just a ton of really
insightful comments more than 6,000 and
so I randomly
chose one and this person I will contact
you through a YouTube private message
and let you know that you've won so you
can get me your contact information but
the winner is mrs. Julie brown so
congratulations Julia you run and others
who I hadn't read her comments since she
had the winning comment and like I said
I didn't judge based on the comment but
turns out she had a really great one and
her comment is inner beauty he's being
the best person you can be being
genuinely sweet kind and caring it makes
others feel that someone really cares
about them and sometimes that can be
exactly what someone needs to hear when
you have inner beauty it makes you more
beautiful than cosmetics ever could so
some really it's really deep comments I
thought in this for this giveaway and I
was just so impressed that everyone took
the time to enter to share something
very heartfelt in the comments section
and I think rating through it I hope
that as you left a comment maybe you
read through some of them and it kind of
got us in this mindset that makeup is
fun and you know makeup it's a way to be
creative it's a way to express yourself
but above all else the most beautiful
thing is being beautiful on the inside
so thanks for participating
congratulations mrs. Julie brown I'll be
in touch with you very soon and again if
you didn't get this if you're not mrs.
Julie brown definitely you can tune in
to QVC and check out qvc.com starting
friday and see what this whole kit is
all about if you want to order it for
yourself and i believe it is right
around sixty dollars little more than
sixty dollars to get this kit of seven
full size products plus a purse so
thanks again for watching everyone have
a great day i'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
