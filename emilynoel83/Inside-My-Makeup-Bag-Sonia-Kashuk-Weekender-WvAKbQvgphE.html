me I hope you had a great Thanksgiving
weekend and if you traveled maybe you
were taking a whole bunch of makeup and
beauty products with you if you're like
me and I was kind of trying out a new
travel makeup bag I was kind of thinking
you know if this bag works out if I
really turn out to like it I definitely
want to share with everyone what I'm
using now because this is my old travel
makeup bag and I have done a video on
this showing you all around the inside
it's got a lot of different little
plastic compartments and a great little
area for brush storage in the back and a
lot of travel bags don't necessarily
cater to makeup brushes so I love that
that was in this bag and this is a Lorie
Grenier bag it came with like a little
mini bag as well and I got him off of
QVC looks fine on the outside the little
inner compartments were definitely
showing some signs of wear and just
looking a little ragged and I've had
this for probably at least four years
now and I don't think they even sell it
anymore so earlier this fall when I was
sent some Sonia Kashuk makeup products
to try this bag was in there with it and
I initially thought well that's kind of
big it's actually not any taller than
this lorry grenier bag but it is a
little bit longer like it's this much
longer than my other bag and I didn't
really have a reason to travel with it
until recently here for Thanksgiving and
it does have a place to put your makeup
brushes inside so that's huge for me it
has a lot of different zip open
compartments on the inside a couple of
little removable makeup bags it was in
some cases the kind of thing that when I
was doing makeup in the car even I could
just open this up in my lap and easily
access all of the products I needed I've
got this plaid style but I think on
targets website there's about half a
dozen other designs so I'll link to this
bag below where you can see all the
different ones and when I show you
inside this is by no means a lesson on
like how to pack a life with your makeup
because I took pretty much everything I
wanted to take and I pretty much only
put my makeup and maybe a couple
skincare items in here I realized after
I packed it that I could have fit my
whole little toiletry bag which is
something I just kind of leave packed if
I'm going to be traveling because it's
that
liquids bag basically that you can take
in your carry-on if you flies so it's
just a small clear bag of little bottles
under three ounces you know your shampoo
conditioner a mini hairspray different
things like that and so I realized I
definitely could have fit that whole bag
in here as well but I just wanted to
walk you through it and show you the way
I chose to pack it for this trip so
here's our lovely bag we've got to zip
around compartments one that opens you
up to this layout and then the other
side you see this this side gives you
the two plastic compartments that do
detach they just have velcro right there
there's also a little open area here
which I didn't end up using you've got a
really big zippered compartment here
this is the brush storage you've got a
zipper that actually goes pretty deep
all the way back behind the brushes I
didn't end up putting anything in this
compartment I definitely could have back
in this big area with where I kind of
chose to go bag within a bag because I
had some smaller things and I just
didn't want them all floating everywhere
but I also put my eyelash curler back
there I put a moisturizer back there
that's my Regenerist day time and a
couple of things that false lashes which
one of them didn't make it back in here
it's probably in my classes case that's
another safe spot for false lashes if
you're traveling put them in your
glasses case when you take them off but
in this little pouch like I said thinks
I just didn't want floating all over the
bag like my tweezers and q-tips I just
got these mini face products that hang
around in pretty much any travel bag I'm
taking don't want to leave home without
the pencil sharpener I've also got my
concealers in here I took an erase paste
also my naked skin and age rewind and
I've got a mini loose powder in there
also and this little pouch is also by
Sonia Kashuk and as you can see it's not
really pushing it to fit it in there and
I could have used any number of tiny
makeup bags that I have this clear
zippered pouch this is where I chose to
put my larger stuff I could definitely
see large bottles going in here if you
wanted to take your full-size hair
products for me this is just what I went
with
I took these ready-to-wear pallets from
Shoei I had just been sent some things
from this brand so I thought I'll take
these and this will kind of be my
homework to test these out while I'm
gone
so you can see there it's kind of like
Morman cool tones for the eye and face
and they work pretty well
they didn't knock my socks off but they
were alright I just threw in a couple of
different foundations on my mac
prolongwear nourishing waterproof and my
Too Faced Born This Way I've got a
L'Oreal True Match pressed powder which
is awesome at all times this laura
geller compact well it can feel kind of
bulky it does have three really key
products in here your bronzer blush and
baked french vanilla highlight so that's
a great little travel product and this
palette I was singing its praises
recently in my holiday palettes video
but in the ball of your hand you've got
lots of blush options there plus some
more eyeshadows and a lip and cheek
product over there so love that and this
is so thin it probably could have slid
right back in that little pocket behind
the brushes and I think this whole bag
could wipe down pretty easily with a
damp cloth when you get it dirty but I
especially love that there's a little
clear window over the brushes because
this is probably the area that's gonna
get the most dirty because you pop a
brush back in and it's had powder or
foundation or something on it it's
really gonna transfer onto there but
I'll be able to wipe that off really
easily I didn't really hold back on the
different brushes I took love my ELF
complexion brush I've got a Sonia Kashuk
like flat buffing brush blush brush I
think I talked about these in a recent
tutorial but I love that for buffing and
concealer not my little highlighter
brush there and then just a bunch of
different eye brushes that I use all the
time and hopping over to this other side
I didn't fill this compartment but you
could definitely stick some things in
there but I love how you've got clear
bags really cool how they don't detach I
can even do it with one hand here I
think
boom hard to keep the glare off of this
but in my eye bag I've got a little
travel primer potion some lash glue
various eyeliners I've got my Maybelline
brow satin in there and also my clump
crusher water resistant and covergirl
super sizer mascara and then for my lip
products I grabbed out several of those
la girl endless lip liners so I'd have a
few different shades to work with I've
got my Charlotte Tilbury lipsticks there
the Bond girl and Glastonbury couple of
melted ones to choose from my pumpkin
spice lip balm because what else would
you use on Thanksgiving weekend and a
really all-purpose shade here is this
L'Oreal glossy balm this shade is called
lovely mocha and this is what I were
most because it's just easy to throw on
it looked good with any outfit any
makeup look that I was wearing doesn't
look weird if it started to fade off but
just a very easy wearable thing so all
in all I think it's a great bag a lot of
versatility with the large compartments
at first I kind of thought oh there's a
lot of wide-open space in this bag but
you know it does give you the
versatility where if you wanted to put
larger bottles of things you know you're
not confined you can put a smaller
makeup bag within this bag or use little
Ziploc bags if you want more confined
space when I latch onto a travel Beauty
bag that I really like I'll use it for
years that was the case with the Lorie
Grenier one I think that's gonna be the
case with this one as well biggest plus
to me would be the fact that if I want
to take a lot of makeup I can take a lot
of makeup in this or if I want to put
lots of different things in here like
maybe my makeup my toiletries tyler's
toiletry products it could all fit if I
needed it to so I just thought I'd get
this out there in case you're gonna be
traveling for Christmas I know I've got
a wedding and Christmas that I'll be
traveling for and this will be my
companion for both of those things thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
