this video I'm so excited about this
look because I had so much fun creating
it and I'm using three really great
shades from glam couture cosmetics yeah
they're just as pretty as they look in
the packaging I'm going to actually sort
of use all three of them in their own
special way one on the lid one sort of
as an outer V shade and then the other
kind of fading up to a pretty warm pink
and I'm also going to do a different
liner technique using my mac fix+
so if you want to see how it all came
together keep on watching alright guys
step one is to apply a primer of your
choice all over your lid I used my ma
it's the bright eyes eye base plus
concealer not totally sure what I think
about that yet but I just went ahead and
used its base today and then I'm gonna
use this shape from glam couture called
Cancun look how pretty that is it is
such a rich color and I'm gonna use Milo
Cornell let me see what exact brush it
is getting a little messy here it's the
3/8 brush the Maxine's not and so I'm
gonna pack on some shadow onto there and
a little goes a really long ways you're
gonna see here so I'm gonna just get
that all over my lid here it's just this
rich rich teal shade and just yeah just
going all over my lid go all the way
right in here to the inner part of the
crease this brush is somewhat flat and
can make it kind of easy to just press
that color on even though it's not a
loose shade it's a very vibrant shade so
you don't want really to get your it's
gonna show if you get this get fallout
from this elsewhere on your face but
these press shadows are really easy to
use so go ahead and do that and then
maybe if you might want to get a little
extra on your brush and sort of start
getting some up into the crease just
slightly here with this teal
this is such a pretty shade
and you can see how it kind of just
diffuses out a little bit and then
before we go much further with other
shades in the crease I want to keep the
inner corner just a little bit lighter
and for that I just grabbed my Milani
single and illusion it's sort of a pinky
gold shade and just pack some of that on
him using my 1/4 brush for this just to
get in this really small space here and
just you know it's not it's good it's
not really going to undo the teal shade
that's not really what we're looking for
anyway we're just wanting to provide a
little bit of light right there in that
corner
okay now when we start thinking about
the crease I'm wanting a little bit
deeper shade than this teal and for that
I'm going to use the glam Couture shade
in mystery another pretty shade and I'm
gonna use my essence of beauty fine
crease brush for this and so I'm just
gonna get a little bit of this lovely
deep blue I wouldn't even call it Navy
because it's it's just got such a vivid
blue quality to it and I'm going to
apply this to the outer half of my
crease sort of creating that outer V a
little bit here
it blends so pretty with this teal it's
just just one kind of step darker and a
little less green in this blue okay so
you kind of got that outer V going these
shades are just effortless to work with
and that's what I love so much about
them and then lastly I'm going to take a
shade called Pallas and I've used this
before in the very same way only with
different colors you know on my lid
increase and it's this gorgeous magenta
I don't know if this it looks more red
in my camera than it does in person but
it's really like a magenta pink with
sparkle in it as well and I'm gonna use
a fluffy brush for this I'm going to use
my Sephora rounded crease brush get a
very small amount on this because this
is where what really instead of
concentrated color we want it really
diffused for this step and we're just
gonna go over the border of um the last
color we used here and we're getting a
pretty you know warmth there with that
pinky shade I just love that I love this
effect of fading out to a pretty warm
pink like this so yeah just go over I'm
pretty much going right over the top of
what I did for the outer V there and as
you can see that you know that dark
shade is still there but where this is
kind of helping us blend it out to
nothingness sort of put that pink hue
and then I'm gonna go back to the Milani
illusion just for a pop of light right
up in here again that's the shade and
I'm just gonna use that same brush and
give it a nice bit of golden a light
pink right up here at the top and there
you go there's the eye shadow and for
our liner I'm gonna be going back to the
Cancun shade that's really pretty tailed
one we used all over our lid and I'm
gonna use some of my mac fix+ I'm
actually just gonna squirt a little bit
of that on my hand here that's the fix+
and basically what I'm going to do is
take my my Coastal Scents tackle on
liner brush the angled one dip it in
that fix+ to get the tip moist and then
put it into the cancun so basically what
we're creating here is a liner and
that's that line that's gonna go right
here under our eyes so we're creating a
teal a pretty concentrated teal liner
here and I'm just taking taking that
brush and just running it right along
just like so and you've got a gorgeous
deep teal there I'd love I mean I will
probably go use this liner technique
with this particular shadow again
because I really like how it turned out
in the corner feel free to kind of sweep
it up just kind of continue it on there
and because we're kind of creating a
little bit of a defined end to our outer
V the line a little bit on our top lash
line too so just remove sin your brush
if you need to to kind of further blend
this out like I said we kind of drug we
we took our liner brush and drug that
lower liner up just a little bit and
kind of use that to just further define
the outer V I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
going to curl my lashes and I'm going to
apply a coat of this all May one coat
nourishing mascara and then I'll join
you for the frame guys here's my
finished look I'm so excited about these
colors I'm using firm glam Couture
cosmetics because they're so vibrant but
I mean I took I felt like I took a
little softer approach than I could have
you could definitely really really pack
these these colors on and make them
super super bold and I mean for me I
just kind of did a somewhat subtle
approach to with some colorful shades
that's generally what I like to do with
some of my more colorful shades you see
how I can make them where
and so I really enjoyed this look I hope
you guys liked it too and also the
mixing medium approach to using liner is
just great and is I'm gonna be doing
that probably a lot more with colorful
shades like these that I don't maybe
have in a liner so anyway hope you guys
like the I look on my lips I used this
shade if it's the NYX or NYX round lip
gloss in soap opera queen so I just
thought a bright kind of fun pink would
sort of set off this look so I hope you
guys enjoyed the look and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
