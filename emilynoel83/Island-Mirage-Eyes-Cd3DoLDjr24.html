one is going to be an eye look I like to
call the island Mirage this is something
very springy it is very light you might
be wondering well what's new with this
number one I am going to be using a new
palette it is the Coastal Scents Mirage
palette mentioned this in a hole not too
long ago and a bunch of people said hey
can you do a look with that and so here
I'm going to be utilizing a lot of these
kind of orange e peachy tones and we're
going to throw in this random gorgeous
pink right there doesn't your eye just
go to that color for me it did so I
really wanted to work that in so that's
gonna be new also new with this look no
real dark crease shade we're utilizing
really only the brights and also with
the liner I'm going to be using a liner
technique kind of inspired by the lovely
album a oh I love her channel I have
watched her videos for a long time she's
watched mine we've been good friends and
so I saw her video about a liner
technique that will really help your
liner last and it also gives a really
neat effect so I worked in sort of a
couple ideas from her in this look liner
wise and if you want to link to her
channel go down below she is gorgeous
she has great ideas and yeah so that's
what this look is all about and if you
want to see how it comes together keep
watching
I'm gonna use a Mallee ever color shadow
stick I love these I love the colors and
I like that the colors are just a little
bit unique and the one I'm using in this
tutorial is bronze check out this color
it's kind of like I mean you can think
bronze but also copper almost like a
metallic peach shade and it's so
gorgeous as you draw it on the lid you
can see it just has a fantastic amount
of shimmer and I'm just going all over
the lid with that I'm dotting it up to
the crease because I don't want the
concentration of color to be as bold
there and then I'm just gonna take a
quick little sweep of this under on my
lower lash line too and I'm gonna circle
the tear duct area as well you want to
make sure that you don't have too much
product on there these shadow sticks are
good about being long wearing completely
on their own but I do like to kind of
dab my finger over it just to make sure
I didn't get too much product on there
because they glide on so easily it's
easy to get quite a bit honest I'm gonna
take my Mirage palette room Coastal
Scents and we're going to be using some
of these fun orange peachy coral shades
and the first one I'm going for is in
this Orange row here down three and you
can see it's got sort of that orange e
bronzy glow so I'm gonna be taking a
flat shadow brush this one's from Sigma
just gonna Pat it in there it's gonna be
easy to pick up a lot of excess products
so make sure you tap it off and then I'm
just going to be patting that all over
that bronze shadow stick we put on and
you can see this color contains quite a
bit more orange so um it's gonna bring
that out in the whole look use a slimmer
pencil brush to take that same shade
under the lower lash line as well we
want this glow to kind of really circle
the up the domed fluffier brush you know
you can take this same shade and lightly
work it up into the crease this look is
all about you know overlapping shades
getting the most out of each color
I want to make my lid pop just a little
more with orange and so to do that I'm
going to be taking one of the matte
shades that's in that orange row and it
happens to be this one right here so
it's you know it may not be entirely
matte but it's definitely less shimmer
than the first shade I put on there
again tapping off and I'm just going to
dot this right there on my lid and
you'll notice even more of a part of the
shades in this palette that my eye was
just drawn to when I first looked at it
is right here this is such a pretty kind
of like violet cranberry almost with
some pink in it just thought it was
gorgeous and I thought it might be fun
to not just do orange but kind of
overlap and work in some Pink's so I'm
still gonna use this fluffy brush when
you really want these seamless blends
working with these blushes and just a
light amount of product on them on the
brush can create a great blend for you
so again this is the Sigma SS 224 I know
the names have changed recently but I'm
gonna pick up a little bit of that on
the tip of the brush and the area I'm
looking to go for is sort of right as
the shadow works its way on to my brow
bone so right about here this visible
area that's going to be seen when my
eyes are open I'm just taking that
pretty pinky color and just overlapping
what's so neat about this color is that
you it can act almost as that Cree shade
you know it might appear that we've done
some sort of outer V but really
effortlessly we've just taken this whole
color and put it right up here as we
work our way onto the brow bone and
we've got a really interesting blend and
then we want to think about our
highlight because there's a couple ways
we're going to use this as well and
you've got a whole range of light shades
that could act as a highlight for you
here the shade I'm using is right here
and this has a little bit of shimmer to
it it's kind of pearly so really pretty
color just kind of a basic and it's in
anyone's collection so you don't have to
have this palette to use this but I'm
going to be going right under the
and of course this is going to just
slightly overlap the pink that we you
really want to have some fun with your
highlight you can take that same shade
with a small detail brush this is the
mini detail brush from Coastal Scents
that I love get asked about it
constantly whenever I pull it out in a
tutorial but there we go just for a
little added brightness right right I've
kind of been experimenting with some
ways that I can get a soft but yet
really defined liner look and one way
you can do that is using you know some
powder shadows to help the liquid liner
look a little more diffused a little
less harsh and so I'm going with a black
shade here that's all the way in the
corner right there and I'm gonna be
using one of my favorite brushes which
is from Sonia Kashuk and this is known
as the smudge brush in her collection
it's a small brush and it can work for
you in a couple different ways which
I'll show you here so I'm gonna get some
black on there and the first thing I'm
going to do is just act like basically
I'm lining my upper lash line with that
so I'm just using it you know
east-to-west just sitting at there
horizontally and running it all along
the lash line with this black shadow now
that I've done that and I want an even
more smudged out look I'm going to turn
this brush and it's the perfect height
to do this instead of going back and
forth like that I'm going to rotate the
brush so it's more of a north-south
direction and then I'm gonna just with
us I just have a little more product on
here same black color and then just
running it egg sort of little back and
forth motions all along the lash line
and you're going to get sort of it this
wider strip of a dark color and what's
so great about this is that when we put
a liner down really close to our lash
line we're gonna have what appears to be
a really natural fade and this brush is
so small that it keeps it controlled I
can still see plenty of the pretty
peachy pink that we worked with here but
now I've got some definition on the lash
line then once you take a little more
black on that brush and we're just going
to get a little of that color on our
natural lash line on the lower lash line
just get it on there however you want it
smudge it you know we're just looking
for a sort of a smudge natural line
right there and we're just getting it
there on the outer part quick before we
get to the liner on the upper lash line
I'm taking my Mally ever color automatic
waterproof liner in onyx and this is
what I'm going to be using on my
waterline today because I think it gives
great intensity and great staying power
so I'm just gonna get that all along the
lash line right to the tear duct
very good then I want to use a liquid
liner that is gonna give me a really
really fine line so I'm using my
Maybelline line stiletto liquid liner
wanted to give this a try I've heard
some good things about it and he just
has you very fine this is like a felt
tip it's not a little brush but it's a
actual sort of tip that it has here to
give me a really fine line so I'm just
going to start here I'm going to stay
super close to the lash line and I'm not
gonna wing it out I'm just gonna bring
it right to the end and then I'm gonna
go continue it in again practically um
you know if you're struggling with
getting close to your lash line think
about almost drawing it right on you
know where your lashes connect to your
skin and that may help you but the
reason why we're doing this again as you
can see that we're getting a little bit
of a fade now from this to the black
shadow trying out a new mascara so I'm
going to curl my lashes and then put on
a couple of coats of the almay get up
and grow mascara
check out the brush the brush was kind
of what attracted me to it in the first
place really volumizing it just gives it
looks a little pinched in you know in
the center but it's a traditional brush
and so I was hoping this will give me
volume and length still not quite sure
what I think about it but I am going to
go ahead and use it on this other set of
lashes
and then I'll join you with the finished
look alrighty here is the finished look
and I threw on actually some half strip
false lashes so that's giving the
effective a little more possibly that
cat eye look without doing any cat eye
liner which can be kind of fun so I used
those lashes let me see
they are the whimsical lashes from
Coastal Scents I'm trying these out they
have a lot of different styles but like
I said these are like the half strip
that give you that sort of fanned out
look right at the edge so for the rest
of my face and I basically went with
some bronze II kind of luminous I went
all over lightly with a bronzer that had
a little bit of shimmer this is golden
tan from covergirl cheekers so did fat
contoured the cheeks a little bit with
my ELF contouring blush and bronzer use
the bronzing side just right in here and
then and I used this new blush from
Malley got the new it was a today's
special value on QVC I'm like love and
malley stuff lately and this is a sort
of a duo blush and it well it's a blush
system so basically what you do is this
is the cream side and normally the cream
is just like a creamy blush but this
happens to be kind of like an
illuminator you put that on first
actually and then you go over it with
this pretty peachy colored blush and you
get the awesome effect of like sort of
dewy luminous makeup without the I mean
the blend is perfect and you don't get
any sort of a greasy kind of look on
your skin or oily so that's an awesome
idea I think you can do with other
products to take it sort of a cream
highlight put that down first then go
over it with a sheer application of
blush and you get sort of you know some
luminosity there without anything
looking too overboard or and on also
wears long or too so on my lips what
I've got going on is one of my favorite
favorite lip liners where is it it's NYX
mahogany this is great because this is
giving you
um sort of a deeper neutral basically so
I went all over with that and then I
took a really pretty gloss from ELF it's
the mineral lip gloss and trend setter
so this is the look with that it's very
neutral very wearable um I don't feel
like it detract from the eyes but kind
of complements the whole look so thank
you so much for watching I hope you
enjoy what I've done with the Mirage
palette for one more look at that again
it is a fun palette to use because you
get a variety of finishes and you're
also getting a pretty wide range of
colors here - thanks again for watching
have an awesome day and I'll see you
