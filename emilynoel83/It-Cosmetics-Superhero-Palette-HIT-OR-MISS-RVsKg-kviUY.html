me today I bring you a video idea that
really jumped the list due to all of the
requests all the questions about this
product and it is the new it cosmetics
superhero eyeshadow palette and I've had
this for a little while now it was set
to me by it cosmetics so I've been
playing with it for a bit and I have
definitely had a chance to use every
single shadow in this palette on my eyes
I have done some comparing to palettes
from other brands and within it
cosmetics own brand and I hope that this
video will just be really informative to
those of you who want to learn more
about this product but this palette is
going to sell for $42 at Ulta stores as
far as the size and shape here's a lorac
Pro palette it has that very same kind
of texture on the outside that I expect
will catch a lot of smudges from product
and overall you know the bulk of the
palette is this size but a little bit
larger with these kind of flared out
tips at the end and then when it opens
up at first I was noticing that it just
kind of wants to shut right back down as
soon as you open it but if you're
sitting this out like on a table or your
countertop you can kind of mess with it
it takes a few times but if you really
bend it back it will stay open for you
but there on the inside you've got a big
mirror there's a little message from
Jamie who is the owner of this brand and
it says you're a real superhero actually
Lori a loves this brand now but she's
reaping some benefits from that I am
sure anyway on the inside taking a look
at the eyeshadows you have three
distinct shades that are labeled eye
foundation it's kind of stamped into the
shadow itself eye foundation so you've
got confidence POW and magical
confidence and POW R to match shades and
then magical is like a shimmery kind of
peachy pearly color down below you've
got three categories superhero nudes
superhero neutrals and superhero liners
all of the liner shades are matte and
all of the rest of the shades have
varying levels of a pearly finish now
limitless and powerful just have a
barely there kind of satin finish but
the rest Ora unstoppable superstar and
fearless all go more towards a metallic
ultra shimmery finish so all in all
we're looking at 12 eyeshadows in this
palette you've got
five that are totally matte that's these
two on the top these three liner shades
on the side and then the rest have at
least a little bit of a shimmery finish
now the first thing I thought when I
opened up this palette is lorac pro one
and if you do look at those two
side-by-side I mean there are so many
similarities a pro one has long been one
of my favorite eyeshadow palettes really
really basic shades going into a few
little interesting pops and there are
sixteen shades in that palette as
opposed to the twelve shades in the it
cosmetics what really made me think
lorac pro one we're like these colors in
here the gold the topi shade that kind
of garnet red those three really make me
think wow that's something I've seen
before in my lorac pro one and to be
honest with you I'm not a huge fan of
this palette after using it now after
using every single shade on my eyes not
just swatching them out I am not really
sold on this I do think it's a good
quality palette I mean it cosmetics I
have believed for the longest time has
made great quality eyeshadow palettes if
you look at their naturally pretty all
matte palettes those are really really
good and I've enjoyed those I've
definitely been on the bandwagon for
those palettes and even before it
cosmetics really got on people's radars
so much they had a palette that looked
like this and it had you know a mix of
matte and shimmer and definitely some
shades in here that I can identify in
their new palette as well I guess the
question is is this palette new and
improved and are they doing something
you know above and beyond their other
eyeshadows in this palette and in a
couple of senses
I do think yes and these two eyeshadows
up top here the shades labeled eye
foundation and confidence and POW these
are matte shades one is a little bit
cooler one has a little bit more of a
buttery almost golden tone in it and
they are so so soft and completely
smooth and about it's full coverage as
I've ever seen a light eyeshadow color
be for example i've swatched confidence
side by side with the matte shade called
sheer joy in the first naturally pretty
palette and to rub over those with my
hand which I would never really expect
these to last but the one from the
superhero palette really does have this
added cling to the skin and it's really
impressive and very rare to see a light
shade kind of hang on there even after I
rub over it and I feel like the same
thing is happening with this shade in
the middle here labeled pal you know
they are rich intense just very dense
peeling eyeshadows if that makes sense I
can tell there's a difference in that
matte texture of those two shades
compared to the matte texture in the
naturally pretty pallet one little
question though that I have about these
eye foundation shades I have a little
guide to the palette here and it takes
you through several looks and in every
look you're advised to dust one of those
eye foundation shades all over your lid
and up to your brow bone as a base shade
and with those colors being so so full
coverage you know when I put them on my
eyes I almost feel like wow that's just
a little bit light you know that first
color is just a hair away from being
totally white it's not that you have to
use them all in the way that they're
advised but for a much deeper skin tone
to put one of those shades all over
their lid and cover the entire space up
to the brow would that even look right
would that look remotely realistic I
almost feel like if they're going to
market those colors in that way maybe
you know instead of making this one
shimmery they should have taken it down
a notch and made it more of like just a
slightly deeper medium shade or
something like that I don't know
something I feel is missing from this
palette in terms of mattes is something
that's more of a mid-tone Matt because
none of these shades over here totally
met at first I thought limitless was
going to be that soft crease color that
I could use and then I thought no it
actually does catch the light it's got
some pearly Sheen to it and it just
doesn't look quite right in my crease
and then I'm kind of reading the
descriptions the shadows and it says
that you can wear the superhero neutrals
alone or as your contour crease color
that's these shades here and you know I
can use super star in my crease I used a
little bit of that up into my crease
today and yeah it can work if you wanted
to do a one shadow look with that it
could work it would look okay but I'm
just a little surprised that there isn't
something lighter than these options
that's also matte that would be just
perfect for the crease they could have
stuck it maybe in this section we're
like I said you got this shade up here
that's kind of per
they give us you know a very basic
mid-tone neutral mat but you know the
pallets been made I don't think
anybody's going to go back change it on
my account but that's just what I saw
that was missing as far as the mats down
here you know these liner shades all of
these shades definitely have an
equivalent in the naturally pretty one
pallet i've swatched each of those
side-by-side with a shade from that
pallet and they seem to feel exactly the
same they have the same intensity the
same look when they swatch and that
doesn't make them bad shades because I
do happen to really like those colors
but if you've already got this pallet
there's three shades that you already I
want to talk briefly about this little
chunk of Shadows right here the ones
labeled neutrals and also this one
called aura I have looked back in my
first it cosmetics eyeshadow palette
that I ever had and this is a nice
palette a really nice formula I'm not
making any gripes really on the formula
but I feel like they took several shades
out of this and kind of stuck them in
this palette as well I'm talking about
aura superstar and fearless there are
three very similar shades to those in
this palette with this kind of bronzy
color this taupe and this sort of
reddish shade here they have a very
similar you know soft creamy texture
which I like but you know those shades
are similar so if you already had this
fella and you already had this palette
you've got a lot of what's happening in
the superhero palette covered with the
exception of I think these new and
improved mats that are up top and I've
said overall the quality of this palette
doesn't disappoint me
but this unstoppable shade this gold
right here I have found this to be a
little bit weak you know when I see gold
I expect gold I like true gold I like
the gold from the lorac Pro palette
because it just shows up very true to
color this is kind of a yellowish shade
and I didn't think it had very good
staying power on my lids even on top of
a primer I did a couple looks with this
and I used it repeatedly because I was
just a little surprised that it's
lighter it's a little more flaky and not
quite as good as some of the other
things
the only other staying power concern
that I have with this are the liner
shades when actually used adds a liner
so if you want to take a powder brush
into that going here or even a dampened
powder brush and then go across like
you're up early
line let's say and use it as a little
powder shadow liner the staying power is
not very good there because I gave it a
close check from you know I applied it
in the morning I checked it at lunchtime
the other day and I was like wow that's
almost totally faded off and I use the
black and I laid it on pretty thick so I
wouldn't necessarily rely on those to
literally be your liners I want to take
you through the look that I've got on my
eyes today and then just wrap up here
and go over some final thoughts on this
palette but the way I did my look today
I what kind of cool toned with
everything and I first applied my Milani
eyeshadow primer as advised I took one
of those eye foundation shades in the
color confidence and I padded that all
over the lid and tried to use it a
little more lightly as I went upward
under the brow area so it would look too
crazy stark up there and then I patted
the superstar shade which is a nice
taupe I padded that all over the lid and
also wedge that up into my crease deepen
things up with the matte black shade
called superhero and again with the
small shadow brush from Sonia Kashuk
kind of patted that on my outer corner
just worked that up into my crease these
shades do blend really easily that's
never been a complaint of mine with it
cosmetic shadows and then I was looking
for something to just kind of transition
out of these dark cool colors so I used
Ora from the nudes section of the
palette and I just lightly dusted that
over the border of my look on the upper
part of the eye then I went across my
upper lash line with my Jordana color
Envy liquid liner in black Envy and on
my lower inner rim I used my L'Oreal
silk kissimmee liner in black and I also
smudged a little bit of that on my
actual lower lash line then I took the
superhero shadow the black matte shadow
again with an angled liner brush that
kind of helped me to perfect that wing
as well and then I smudged under the
rest of the lower lash line with super
star that beautiful taupe color now I
finished off the look by curling my
lashes and applying this superhero
mascara sample and I must say really
impressed with the superhero mascara
absolutely love this stuff
with one coat it builds up thickness and
length so fast like it's really amazing
how quickly it does it and I still love
my covergirl super sizer because that'll
get me there too it'll get me to a
volume eyes
thick and lengthened place but this does
it so quickly I haven't tried it yet on
the lower latches I'm still kind of in
my comfort zone with my clump crusher
water-resistant there because I know
that goes nowhere I will test the
superhero out in that capacity also and
then I applied for some added drama my
salon perfect 615 lat InDesign of this
set and there's the finished look so
truly looking at my finish I I don't
have any complaints about the way this
came together the shadows were really
easy to blend I did use some of one of
those eye foundation shades first on the
look and I do think it kind of helped
everything blend really seamlessly on
top of it now I'm pretty careful when I
dip a brush into these shades I don't
really you know go for broke when I'm
sticking a brush in here I very lightly
tap into my shades and that being said I
didn't see an issue with fall out I'm
truly not finding any like speckles on
top of my cheek from these shades and I
went with you know some of the darkest
shades possible with that blood I think
the overall thought is this this is a
nice quality palette they have done some
things to improve the formula on a
couple of these shades and I already
liked it cosmetic shadow formula but for
me it's more of a question of uniqueness
and I feel safe and saying that this
lorac pro one is probably one of the
most talked about one of the most loved
I shadow palettes in the online beauty
community and probably even outside of
that community because it just is so
beautifully basic it's got all the
colors you need and a few fun little
shades that you didn't even know you
needed I truly feel like this is
everything that this palette has plus a
little extra because it's just you know
a little added shade range here you've
got like this deep plum II shade which I
love that color you do have a couple of
shades in here that are matte medium
shades that are just perfect in the
crease when you don't want to go with
your ultimate darkest colors they're
class I mean you've got just a kick-ass
gold in here you got this garnet shade
pewter is a fabulous taupe so those
kinds of shades you know are kind of
being attempted in this palette the gold
is not quite as good and yes these mats
up here are great I can tell there's
something different about them they have
that really nice cling to the skin but a
lot of the other things in that palette
I can see coming from the naturally
pretty and several shades coming from
like their first big eye palette ever
not trying to trash the product because
I've said again and again I think it's a
good quality product
I just think especially if you're trying
not to overload yourself
with different eyeshadow palettes it's
worth it to you to look to your own
collection and say okay do I already
have that lorac Pro why do I already
have that it cosmetics naturally pretty
palette this may not be an essential
thing to you that superhero mascara
though I think I'm gonna be had the Olfa
pretty soon for the full size of that
that was a really nice mascara and it
held the curl well too that's a big
thing for me but thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you soon in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
