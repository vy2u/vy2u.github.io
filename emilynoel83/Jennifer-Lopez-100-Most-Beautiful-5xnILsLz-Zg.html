new series from the 100 most beautiful
people edition of People magazine I
don't know this came out recently it's
got Christina Applegate there on the
cover and I was looking through it last
night and there are just so many awesome
looks in their makeup looks that really
inspired me and so I thought maybe I'll
just pick some of those and make a
little series out of it for those of you
who really like the celebrity inspired
looks so the one that really stood out
to me at first was this look from
Jennifer Lopez it's just a total glowy
skin of a fairly natural eye but with
some emphasis on the lashes and the
liner there and I just wanted to go
ahead and duplicate that look for you
guys so that is the look that we're
going to be working on today it use this
if you look closely at the picture it
uses kind of a charcoal grey ish Navy
shade on the bottom really really pretty
so I this look turns out to be really
wearable so I hope you guys like it and
I hope you continue to enjoy this series
right guys getting started with the skin
I'm taking a little different approach
with this look because well her skin
looks so flawless in the picture it also
looks somewhat bare it has sort of that
do we look not a really really full
coverage kind of look I realize photos
are retouched and everything so to say
flawless you know may or may not be the
case but it just does give off that sort
of dewy look so I wanted to go with a
tinted moisturizer I'm using the jane
iguazu toggles in medium warm tones and
that has an SPF 30 in it by the way and
I just smooth that all over my face and
it does give a really light amount of
coverage so that was kind of nice and
then I used my Maybelline mineral power
concealer around my nose for any redness
there and I used my Bobbi Brown creamy
concealer kit around my eyes so now that
I'm going to start with the face color
wise I thought I'd walk you through that
first thing I'm going to use is this new
Sonia Kashuk it's a blush bronzer duo
cream blush and bronzer I have the
golden cream bronzer just that and I saw
this do
I thought it was really really pretty
and it may really really lightly use
this kind of pinky coral shade but it
really looks like her cheeks more so
just have a little bit of contour to
them but not a lot of colors so anyway
um starting with that I grabbed my
sponge here starting with the golden
cream shade just gonna get some of that
on my sponge and basically create
cheekbones here you're making that
streak on each side where you want it to
be and then kind of take the bear side
of the sponge and just buff it out don't
be scared to make a streak on your cheek
because you know you can totally blend
it out see we're left with that exact
effect that we want to make it make
sense you just got to figure out okay
here's my cheekbone I'm going kind of
right up under it you make sure you find
that proper spot kind of going like that
and following that line up can help you
and you can also use that cream as a
contour just for an added bronzer effect
elsewhere on the face of course JLo has
a really you know bronzed look so that's
definitely the route we're gonna go she
you know contour around your nose a
little bit to use your sponge and kind
of make that she's got kind of a a very
straight nose there so you can use
contouring to help you out there so
again just go over use that cream to
help deepen up any areas that you want
and then we're gonna go over that with
just some powder bronzer and I'm using
my Milani powder bronzer in light taking
my fluffy puffy brush and this is just
gonna be a light dusting all over my
face here and this is really somewhat in
matte so we're not gonna add a lot of
shimmer or we're really not going to add
a lot of shimmer at all but to maintain
the dewy look we will add a little
but at the end of this little face
segment now that you've gone over your
face with bronzer and you've also done
your bronzing with cream on the cheeks
we're gonna go ahead and further
accentuate certain areas I'm gonna be
using a new blush I got from Maybelline
it's the true match in sweet ginger and
this might look really dark and it is
and it's for the most part pretty matte
appearing but I thought this would make
a great contour color because it is that
dark deep shade and with a light touch I
think this would make a great contour so
I'm just lightly getting it there on my
blush brush and then I'm just gonna
sweep it over that cheek area and I
really didn't end up using I guess any
of the pink cream in that cream duo I
kind of you know looking at her picture
again she really doesn't appear to have
much pink on her cheeks at all it's just
kind of a natural bronzy look you know
so I may take a little bit of this and
just really really lightly hit the tops
of my cheeks with it but past that we're
gonna keep it pretty much as is okay and
then we don't want to forget the
highlighter because she just does have
that nice dewy glow so I'm gonna go
ahead take my Physicians Formula shimmer
strips in Waikiki strip it's the peachy
glow one and just go towards the top of
that palate where the lighter shades are
and hit the tops of the cheeks just kind
of the central part of the face I'm
going down the top of my nose center of
the forehead and chin just kind of
bringing a light to that area
moving on to eyes step one I'm gonna
take my Mac rubenesque Paint Pot which
has a nice peachy golden eagle oh and
I'm going to apply that all over my
eyelid and I'm also gonna work it up all
over you know all the way up to my brow
bone which on my face actually covers
quite a bit of area here but that is the
undertone I want for this entire look so
just kind of a golden eagle oh then the
next step
the the I look is in terms of eyeshadow
is really pretty bare
so I found a palette that I think works
for most of the shades you would need
for this look it's my Revlon Colorstay
12-hour shadow in nude elements and
we're going to go all over our lid with
this shade right here it's sort of like
a very very light taupe with a little
bit of gold shade her lids there's
really not much going on there so I'm
going to use that and I love the kind of
gold and undertone though that that
Paint Pot gives us because I can tell
that that's there in this look I'm just
using my ELF eyeshadow brush just put on
as much as you want I don't think
there's really a thick opaque shimmer to
her look so I'm just kind of keeping it
somewhat sheer and then um in the crease
there's really not a lot happening there
so I'm gonna take this shade right below
it um it's a little bit deeper if you
can see it's maybe it's more like a true
a true taupe very very you know with a
little bit of brown mixed in and I can
see a little bit of contour going all
the way in from the inner part of this
look so I'm going to sort of duplicate
that but again it's barely noticeable so
this is just a great daytime look if you
want to look finished and clean and very
polished but not over-the-top so so the
next thing we're gonna do is not forget
about our highlight I sometimes forget
about that I'm taking the same shade
that we put on our lid and just working
that up here for a highlight you just
blend everything out and then I think
we're ready to move on to our eyeliner
so the liner is she really pulls it off
well because it looks pretty natural but
there is definitely some stuff going on
here so I'm gonna use my mineral wear
eyeliner from Physicians Formula in
the shade is ultra black and I'm gonna
line on the top lash line about halfway
in with this okay so just this glides on
really easily it's not putting any it
doesn't put any stress on your eyelid so
I like that and if it doesn't look
totally clean and just super blended or
blended right into your lash line don't
worry we're going to take the blender
tip at the end of this and use that to
make sure okay so going all the way out
to the outer edge and then we're gonna
go we're gonna go about half way in on
the lower lash line as well so once
again it just glides on and just get it
about halfway there just make sure
you're really smudging it up right into
the lash line then I'm going to recap
that in and use this blending tip and as
I've said before you doing this step
functions to not only smooth out the
liner but it also can remove some excess
product you wonder why you have smudges
under your eyes that may be because you
know one stroke of your liner was just
too heavy and there's a lot of a lot
more product on your eye than you needed
okay so we're just smudging smudging
just like so and then before we put our
liner away one eye on this picture
appears to have the liner in the
waterline and one doesn't look quite so
much I'm just gonna go ahead and do it
it doesn't have you know it's it really
comes down to whatever you want to do
you could totally leave this part out
too but I'm just kind of lightly tugging
downward on my on my lower lid as
lightly as I can do it and going pretty
much all the way in there now what
really drew me to this look was the fact
that on her lower lash line she had a
really kind of like charcoal gray Navy
shade underneath there and I think I
found the perfect shade to match that
and it's in the same palette we've been
using
so far for eyeshadow and it's this
bottom shade here it's kind of like a
dark blue with some charcoal gray just
perfect so I'm using my Coastal Scents
tackle on angled liner brush getting
some of that shade on there and I'm
going to go over basically everything
I'm going to go over our you know the
liner we put on the top with this and I
can tell that you know there is some in
some former fashion the liner in her
look it's going all the way in here but
very lightly she still maintains sort of
a natural look so just gonna kind of get
in as close close to like basically
under like my upper waterline sort of as
I can trying to practically it's
practically like we're trying to hide
that line okay just like so and then the
bottom lash line is where it's most
noticeable so just really pack it on to
the on top of that black that we put on
the outer half and then all the way in
as well if you hear a noise I think
Tyler's making some sort of shake out
there okay there you go there's the
liner now it's time to move on to
mascara and I'm going to curl my lashes
and hold it there for about 15 seconds
next I'm going to apply my lash blast
mascara to the top and bottom lashes it
doesn't look like the bottom lashes are
a huge factor in this look but we do
want them to show up a little bit and if
you wanted to if anything has been added
to her lashes in this picture it appears
it may just be some like small like lash
individual lash bundles maybe to the
outer part and sort of all the way maybe
midway in on her eyes so if your mascara
you know doesn't do it for you then that
would definitely still kind of be in the
realm of this look if you wanted to put
in sand
hey guys sorry this is the finished look
and upon further review I decided I did
need to add a few false individual
lashes to the outside I used these
Andrea perma lash just a few of those I
used three on each side and they are the
Flair and medium black and so that just
kind of gives that effect that she has
here on the corner of her eye
oops holding that flat but just threw
that really kind of swept up and out to
the corner effect so yeah I hope you
guys enjoy this look it's really really
easy and and very appropriate for
daytime or night it just kind of may
open you up to some new techniques
insert in terms of doing the liner and
stuff like that and also just the glowy
complexion on her face for lips it's
clear that she's got kind of a peachy
look going on so I used my Milani
crystal gloss I believe this is called
yeah in tantalizing which is a nice
pretty peach shade but when you put it
on at first it comes off really really
shining and she doesn't really have that
much shine so I just blotted it once
with a tissue and I think I achieved
pretty much the look I was going for
there so thank you guys so much for
watching this installment of my new
series the 100 most beautiful I'll be
doing some more looks from that magazine
that I really like so I keep watching
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
