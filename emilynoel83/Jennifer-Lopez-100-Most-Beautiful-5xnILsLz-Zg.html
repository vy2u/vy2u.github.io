new series from the 100 most beautiful
people edition of People magazine I
don't know this came out recently it's
got Christina Applegate there on the
cover and I was looking through it last
night and there are just so many awesome
looks in their makeup looks that really
inspired me and so I thought maybe I'll
just pick some of those and make a
little series out of it for those of you
who really like the celebrity inspired
looks so the one that really stood out
to me at first was this look from
Jennifer Lopez it's just a total glowy
skin of a fairly natural eye but with
some emphasis on the lashes in the liner
there and I just wanted to go ahead and
duplicate that look for you guys so that
is the look that we're going to be
working on today it uses if you look
closely at the picture it uses kind of a
charcoal grayish Navy shade on the
bottom really really pretty so I this
look turns out to be really wearable so
I hope you guys like it and I hope you
continue to enjoy this series right guys
getting started with the skin I'm taking
a little different approach with this
look because well her skin looks so
flawless in the picture it also looks
somewhat bear it has sort of that do we
look not a really really full-coverage
kind of look I realize photos are
retouched and everything so to say
flawless you know may or may not be the
case but it just does give off that sort
of dewy look so I wanted to go with a
tinted moisturizer i'm using the jane
agua suta goals in medium warm tones and
that has an SPF 30 in it by the way and
I just smooth that all over my face and
it does give a really light amount of
coverage so that was kind of nice and
then I used my maybelline mineral power
concealer around my nose for any redness
there and I used my Bobby Brown creamy
concealer kit around my eyes so now that
i'm going to start with the face color
wise um I thought I'd walk you through
that first thing I'm going to use is
this new Sonia Kashuk it's a blush
bronzer duo cream blush and bronzer I
have the golden cream bronzer just that
and i saw this do on
it was really really pretty and I'm a
really really lightly use this kind of
pinky coral shade but it really looks
like her cheeks more so just have a
little bit of contour to them but not a
lot of colors so anyway um starting with
that grab my sponge here starting with
the golden cream shade just going to get
some of that on my sponge and basically
create cheekbones here you're making
that streak on each side where you want
it to be and then kind of take the bear
side of the sponge and just buff it out
don't be scared to make a streak on your
cheek because you know you can totally
blend it out and see we're left with
that exact effect that we want to make
it make sense you just got to figure out
okay here's my cheekbone I'm going kind
of right up under it you make sure you
find that proper spot kind of going like
that following that line up can help you
you can also use that cream as a contour
just for an added bronzer effect
elsewhere on the face of course JLo has
a really you know bronzed look so that's
definitely the route we're going to go
she you know contour around your nose a
little bit to use your sponge and kind
of make that she's got kind of a a very
straight nose there so you can use
contouring to help you out there so
again just go over use that cream to
help deepen up any areas that you want
and then we're going to go over that
with just some powder bronzer and i'm
using my Milani powder bronzer in light
taking my fluffy brush and this is just
going to be a light dusting all over my
face here and this is really somewhat in
matte so we're not going to add a lot of
shimmer or we're really not going to add
a lot of shimmer and all but to maintain
the dewy look we will add a little
but at the end of this little face
segment now that you've gone over your
face with bronzer and you've also done
your bronzing with cream on the cheeks
we're going to go ahead and further
accentuate certain areas I'm going to be
using a new blush i got from maybelline
it's the true match in sweet ginger and
this might look really dark and it is
and it's for the most part pretty matte
appearing but i thought this would make
a great contour color because it is that
dark deep shade and with a light touch I
think this would make great contours so
I'm just lightly getting it there on my
blush brush and then I'm just going to
sweep it over that cheek area and I
really didn't end up using I guess any
of the pink cream in that cream duo I
kind of you know looking at her picture
again she really doesn't appear to have
much pink on her cheeks at all it's just
kind of a natural bronzy look you know
so I may take a little bit of this and
just really really likely hit the tops
of my cheeks with it but past that we're
going to keep it pretty much as is okay
and then we don't want to forget the
highlighter because she just does have
that nice dewy glow so I'm going to go
ahead take my physicians formula shimmer
strips in Waikiki strip it's the peachy
glow one and just go towards the top of
that palette where the lighter shades
are and hit the tops of the cheeks just
kind of the central part of the face I'm
going down the top of my nose Center the
forehead and chin just kind of bringing
light to that area moving on to eyes
step 1 i'm going to take my mac
rubenesque Paint Pot which has a nice
peachy golden glow and i'm going to
apply that all over my eyelid and i'm
also going to work it up all over you
know all the way up to my brow bone
which on my face actually coverage quite
a bit of area here but that is the
undertone i want for this entire look
so just kind of a golden glow and then
the next step the eye look is in terms
of eye shadow is really pretty bare so i
found a palette that I think works for
most of the shades you would need for
this look it's my revlon colorstay
12-hour shadow in nude elements and
we're going to go all over our lid with
this shade right here it's sort of like
a very very light taupe with a little
bit of gold shade her lids there's
really not much going on there so I'm
going to use that and I love the kind of
gold and undertone though that that
Paint Pot gives us because I can tell
but that's there in this look I'm just
using my ELF I shadow brush just put on
as much as you want i don't think
there's really a thick opaque shimmer to
her look so I'm just kind of keeping it
somewhat sheer and then um in the crease
there's really not a lot happening there
so I'm going to take this shade right
below it um it's a little bit deeper if
you can see it's maybe it's more like a
true a true taupe very very you know a
little bit of brown mixed in and I can
see a little bit of contour going all
the way in from the inner part of this
look so I'm going to sort of duplicate
that but again it's barely noticeable so
this is just a great day time look if
you want to look finished and clean and
very polished but not over-the-top so so
the next thing we're going to do is not
forget about our head high lie sometimes
forget about that I'm taking the same
shade that we put on our lid and just
working that up here for a highlight
just blend everything out and then I
think we're ready to move on to our
eyeliner so the liner is um it she
really pulls it off well because it
looks pretty natural but there is
definitely some stuff going on here so
I'm going to use my um
mineral wear eyeliner from physicians
formula in the shade is ultra black and
I'm going to line on the top lash line
about halfway in with this okay so just
this glides on really easily it's not
putting any doesn't put any stress on
your eyelids so I like that and if it
doesn't look totally clean and just
super blended or blended right into your
lash line don't worry we're going to
take the blender tip at the end of this
and use that to make sure okay so going
all the way out to the outer edge and
then we're going to go we're going to go
about halfway in on the lower lash line
as well so once again it just glides on
and just get it about halfway there just
make sure you're really smudging it up
right into the lash line then I'm going
to recap that in and use this blending
tip and as I've said before you doing
this step functions to not only smooth
out the liner but it also can remove
some excess product you wonder why you
have smudges under your eyes that may be
because you know one stroke of your
liner was just too heavy and there's a
lot of a lot more product on your eye
than you needed okay so we're just
smudging smudging just like so and then
before we put our liner away if one eye
on this picture appears to have the
liner in the water line and one doesn't
look quite so much i'm just going to go
ahead and do it it doesn't have you know
it really comes down to whatever you
want to do you could totally leave this
part out too I'm just kind of lightly
tugging downward on my on my lower lid
as lightly as I can do it and going
pretty much all the way in there now
what really drew me to this look was the
fact that on her lower lash line she had
a really kind of like charcoal gray Navy
shade underneath there and I think I
found
perfect shade to match that and it's in
the same palette we've been using so far
for eyeshadow and it's this bottom shade
here it's kind of like a dark blue with
some charcoal gray just perfect so I'm
using my Coastal Scents tackle on angled
liner brush getting some of that shade
on there and I'm going to go over
basically everything I'm going to go
over our you know the liner we put on
the top with this and I can tell that
you know there's some in some form or
fashion low liner in her look it's going
all the way in here but very lightly she
still maintains sort of a natural look
so just gonna kind of get in as close
close to like basically under like my
upper waterline sort of as I can trying
to practically it's practically like
we're trying to hide that line okay just
like so and then the bottom lash line is
where its most noticeable so just really
pack it on to the on top of that black
that we put on the outer half and then
all the way in as well if you hear a
noise I think Tyler's making some sort
of shake out there okay there you go
there's the liner now it's time to move
on to mascara and I'm going to curl my
lashes and hold it there for about 15
seconds next I'm going to apply my
LashBlast mascara to the top and bottom
lashes it doesn't look like the bottom
lashes are a huge factor in this look
but we do want them to show up a little
bit and if you wanted to if anything has
been added to her lashes in this picture
it appears it may just be some like
small like lash individual lash bundles
maybe to the outer part and sort of all
the way maybe midway in on her eyes so
if your mascara you know doesn't do it
for you then that would definitely still
kind of be in the realm of this look if
you wanted to put in
some individual way hey guys sorry this
is the finished look and upon further
review i decided i did need to add a few
false individual lashes to the outside i
use these andrea / mallesh just a few of
those i used three on each side and they
are the flare and medium black and so
that just kind of gives that effect that
she has here on the corner of her eye
oops not really holding that flat but
just threw that really kind of swept up
and out to the corner effect so yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this look it's
really really easy and and very
appropriate for daytime or night it just
kind of may open you up to some new
techniques insert in terms of doing the
liner and stuff like that and also just
the glowy complexion on her face for
lips it's clear that she's got kind of a
peachy look going on so I used my Milani
crystal glossop Allah this is call ya in
tantalizing which is a nice pretty peach
shade but when you put it on at first it
comes off really really shining and she
doesn't really have that much shine so I
just blotted it once with a tissue and I
think I achieved pretty much the look I
was going for their so thank you guys so
much for watching this installment of my
new series and the 100 most beautiful
I'll be doing some more looks from that
magazine that I really liked so I keep
watching thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
