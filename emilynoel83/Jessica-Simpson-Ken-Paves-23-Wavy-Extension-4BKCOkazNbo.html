me for this video if my hair looks a
little bit longer it's because I have my
Ken pavis and Jessica Simpson hairdo
clip in extension in I'm wearing the 23
inch wavy extension and it was so easy
to put in I wore it for work today
and you can see about where the hair
comes to here on me and I must say that
the overall length is really dependent
on where you clip this on on your head
if you clips down a little lower your
hair would obviously be a little bit
longer or if you go up a little higher
kind of like I did today the top of my
extension is right up here kind of at my
crown it also gives me a little more
body up here on kind of where my roots
would be but it also gives me a little
shorter length but still I find that
it's quite long but it's really fun it
gives you a nice glamorous look and it's
like I said very easy to put in when I
got this I got it for Christmas and it
comes in this nice long box in a hairnet
so you take it out of the hairnet you
definitely want to shake it out and
everything get it kind of looking a
little bit more natural and it also
comes with this guide of exactly how to
put it in your hair you can obviously
style it a number of different ways and
you can get that sort of information in
information on how to clean the
extension and also there's just kind of
a little like I guess quick reference
thing you're not supposed to brush the
wavy synthetic hair they talk about how
there's a there is a water-soluble
hairspray can be used on these for a
light hold and yeah basically what
you've got going on here is the
extension clips on in the kind of the
back of your head around the crown and
the sides with these little
pressure-sensitive Clips so you squeeze
all those on there and I can't feel this
on my head right now so that's really a
really nice aspect of this is that when
you wear it you can't feel it the color
that I have is called dark chocolate and
it blends perfectly with my hair my
natural hair is coming right down over
the top of this and I feel like it
blends really really nicely
so I want to definitely show you how to
put it in and just how easy it is so
keep on guys we are in my bathroom
you're looking at me with my natural
hair right now and the first thing you
want to do before you put your extension
in if you're dealing with the wavy
extension and you don't have short hair
if you have long hair that you know is
going to wind up showing is it kind of
layers over the top it would be a good
idea to make me take a curling iron and
just go all over and give your hair a
little bit of curl is really not going
to make sense if you put stick straight
hair over this wavy extension so just to
make it look natural go ahead and do
that and then you're going to want to
part your hair so you can clip that all
in so I have some bangs obviously right
up here so I would pull those forward
and kind of pull forward like the front
layer of my hair something I said
earlier is really important to think
about here think about how long you want
the extension to come down on on you how
long do you want to hang if you want it
to be as short as it can be you see and
you want to pull up the minimum minimal
amount of hair here that you can so it
goes up higher here on the crown
otherwise you might put it a little bit
more on the back of your head so anyway
I'm going to pull forward definitely my
bangs and also just kind of the front
section of hair here which I've already
done this once and today obviously since
I had it on earlier but we're pulling
that forward and we're going to leave
ourselves with a little area there where
the extension is going to clip right
behind this hair so I'm pulling it all
forward and up and it's going to look a
little funny here but I'm going to twist
this and create kind of like a half up
style here for a moment
twist it and really get it so this is
there's a clear definite part there
between the hair you've pulled up in the
hair that's still hanging down this
product provides you with a couple of
these little clips that will help you
secure your hair on top of your head
while you get it clipped in so just kind
of criss cross those and then really
feel for where that part is between the
hair you've pulled up and what
not pulled up now the hair that you clip
on this is what it looks like this is
the 23 inch wavy as you can see that
curls are not super tight there is one
that is sold but has more of a tighter a
tighter curl to it and this is more just
nice and wavy really really like it it's
not too overly shiny which I think makes
it look even more like natural hair and
what you've got on the inside of this is
these are what these little clips look
like they have little teeth and those
teeth are kind of grabbing into your
hair and helping this stay in there are
three of those across the top and four
across the bottom
they snap like that kind of like
barrettes do and so you're going to just
to kind of hold onto that with both
hands take it around behind your head
and get them clipped in just kind of
think about placing your outer upper
Clips first and I'm just kind of
bringing them around like I said I'm
staying on this this side of that part
that I made making sure to not get up
onto the hair that I've pulled up and
just clip it right in and you just press
down and it's there and then take this
upper one make sure the teeth are kind
of coming back on to your hair clip and
then you'll easily once you use these
for awhile you'll easily be able to
detect where those four in the back are
there's two kind of more up on the side
and two right in the center so you pull
your hair a hair back kind of you know
comb through it get that blended with
the lower layer of your hair then undo
the top layer and what I like to do
since I really have not pulled up a
whole lot of hair I want to make sure
that this covers the line of that
extension right there you can see that
it really does this shape blends very
well with my hair but what I'm going to
do is just tease this upper layer that
I've pulled up a little bit and when it
goes over the extension it's really
going to conceal it very nicely you're
not going to be able to see any sort of
so since my hair is a little more fine I
do want to do that
so I'm taking this little pin just a
typical hair pin that you've seen me
used in videos before by Matt Sally's or
Walmart or wherever and just kind of
basically use that to help comb your
hair right over the extension and it
should be completely concealed when you
do this so let your bangs you know do
whatever you want with your bangs you
know how if you like to wear them more
in a you know kind of out from your face
sort of fashion like that kind of like
up in a way you know you may want to put
those in a roller before you go ahead
and put your extension and it's totally
up to you just kind of make sure
whatever teasing you've done is totally
smooth it out and as much as you can
blend that into the two the extension
you know the better things are going to
be for you so basically this is the look
we've got going on guys it's it's very
easy to do when your hair is done it's
done you know the curl a soft curl and
your own hair put over the top of this
hair really has a nice blend and the
higher up you put it on your head the
less length you're going to have right
down here so I hope you guys like this
video and this to keep in mind this may
not be something for everyone for
everyday you know it's think about
special occasions or just you know do
you want to change from the hair that
you have if you if this was really not
your thing and you're seeing this in
thinking man you know I don't want that
long hair I'm not saying everybody has
to go out and buy this but you may be
interested if you're a person like me
maybe the who has fine hair would just
like to have a little more hair if
possible and this is just a really quick
way to kind of aid in your styling you
put it on and suddenly you feel like wow
I don't really have to do that much to
my hair now I like how it looks with
this so thanks so much for watching I do
have another one of these can pavis
Jessica Simpson extensions that I'll be
telling you about it's me bump up the
volume so look for that video in the
near future thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
