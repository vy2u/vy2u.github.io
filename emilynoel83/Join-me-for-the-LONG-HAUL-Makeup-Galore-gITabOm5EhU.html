is going to be a pretty big hole I've
got a lot of it looking like mainly
drugstore items to tell you about in
this video some things from Ulta Walmart
Walgreens first thing I'll go ahead and
talk about is the foundation I'm wearing
I guess that makes sense right and it's
the Milani conceal and perfect I
actually got this when I got my Milani
brush as I ordered this off their
website because I haven't seen it in any
of my stores and it says two-in-one
Foundation plus concealer I have it in
zero for medium beige it does have a
pump and the first time I use this I
applied it with a brush I think I used
my Sigma f80 flat top brush and I just
felt like it seemed so thick going on it
is like a rich creamy formula in this
foundation but just after applying it it
felt like a lot was sitting there on my
skin you know and then even throughout
the day as I would talk and like move my
face around and like wow I can really
feel the makeup it was kind of strange
so from there on out I have been trying
this out with like a damp Beauty Blender
or today I used my damp Real Techniques
sponge I just really like the flat side
of that sponge and I think it definitely
helped just added like a little extra
moisture to the product maybe or just
you know my skin as I was applying it
and I do think this is a full coverage
foundation it's not maybe as full as
something that's like crazy full
coverage like the Estee Lauder Double
Wear maximum cover let's say I still
need to like conceal my under eye area
it doesn't totally take care of that for
me so in the two-in-one Foundation plus
concealer since I feel like that
sometimes kind of a gimmick you label
brands will occasionally put on their
foundations to make them seem like oh
they're just crazy coverage well let me
it just feels like a really thick
foundation that I still need to use
concealer with staying power for me has
been okay my skin is normal so I'm not
giving it a ton of oil to contend with
but being as thick and matte as it is
I'm wondering if someone had a lot of
dry patches on their skin maybe this
might not be their best friend the kind
of foundation because I can see it
clinging to those areas and can I just
add it's like a blizzard outside my
window right now the sun's just started
to come up so I can see what's actually
happening out there and it does not look
pretty let's continue on with a few
other new Milani things when I made that
order for the brushes and the found
I also got this online it's the prep set
and go transparent face powder to me I
don't really see anything too special or
super different about this it's just one
of those powders that claims to be a
translucent powder but if you apply
enough of it I mean there's a light
swatch that I just did on my finger it
will show up very white so sure it's
going to mattify but I think you will
run the risk of looking a little chalky
the way I plan to use this is just in
very like select areas I've used it a
time or two just to really set the
t-zone or maybe a little bit lightly on
the under eye area that may be the best
way to go with this at least for me
because I don't want to look too white
and ghostly even though I do kind of
feel a little ghostly today maybe it's
just a really dark one that I'm wearing
another new Milani thing I actually ran
into this at Walgreens I don't think
I've mentioned this yet in a video and
it's called length in seconds lash
extension fibers this is kind of crazy
because it feels so light it feels like
nothing is in here but it's not a
traditional cream product it is like
little fluffy white like it's literally
just the fibers would we like to focus
today anytime anytime camera if you've
tried the Too Faced better than false
lashes mascara they give you a regular
mascara and then something similar to
this that's just like the little loose
fibers that you kind of attach on to the
lashes and then finish off with another
coat this basically they're saying you
know use this alongside your mascara
apply a coat of your regular and then
put this on I think they say just the
tips yeah just to the tips of the lashes
finish the look by applying another coat
of mascara to seal it I can't really
argue with the fact that this does
create more length for me the only thing
is that it doesn't always look
consistently natural like you know the
nice swoop of a false lash that looks
nice and even and you know everything
just kind of continuous like that and
maybe my problem is I'm not choosing the
right mascara to layer with it I have
tried several different ones but I will
be able to almost see the little end you
know that this is created like it
doesn't point and continue in a nice
little curved up fashion with the rest
of my lash and it'll be kind of like
pointing out
like the dead giveaway that something's
going on there that's not really natural
and if I'm going to do that I'll just
put on the falsies right so I think I'm
going to try this a little bit more and
continue using it with some different
mascaras I'm wondering if maybe the
things I put on top were a little too
thick also at Walgreens I picked up
another Milani eyeshadow primer I have
my little debacle with this that I
talked about in another haul where I got
it I put it in the cart and I just
forgot to put it on the checkout so it
stayed in the cart for the next person
who had that guard this is just one of
my favorite eyeshadow primers ever I
think it's just as good it's like the
Urban Decay primer potion two faced
shadow insurance whatever you want to
use this is the bomb and it lasts
forever it doesn't look like a massive
tube there but the last time I had this
I used it so consistently and it's like
I could never run out of it staying on
the Milani train I got a couple of these
Moisture lock lip treatments these are
like lip oils okay so they're kind of
set up like a lip gloss and you're gonna
think okay just wear this like a lip
gloss but this is more of a treatment
oriented thing so I got the rosehip oil
infused lip treatment and I got the
coconut oil infused split treatment look
at the size of that dang doe foot
applicator like that's not a doe foot
that's like a buck foot applicator you
know what I'm saying it's huge and I
kind of like it I kind of like putting
this step on the way I've been wearing
it actually is like when I sit down to
do my makeup put my moisturizer on and
I've sort of been replacing a balm
that's when I would normally apply a lip
balm I've been putting these on just to
kind of like sink into the lips and then
by the time I apply a lip product
everything's nice and softened up and
these really do that for me I like it
I've been applying it to like later in
the day just for a little pick-me-up on
the lips my lips have been really dry
lately and I do feel like these are nice
and hydrating they're very shiny I think
you just got to be aware of what these
are going to do and don't set your
expectations too high it's not like
these are going to be like a bunch of
different colors or they're going to
tint your lips in any way these both are
completely colorless on me it's just a
treatment I really like the scent of
both of them of course I love things
that are rose scent
did this kind of scratches my itch for
that and the coconut smells really good
too from a more practical sense like is
each one doing something different or is
one better than the other I don't know
about that the consistency seems exactly
the same on these to me it's just more
about scent and then they've got a bunch
of others in the line as well and one
might be labeled as exhilarating one
might be label is rejuvenating I don't
know that they're really going to be
that different in what they do
but there's a definite scent difference
with these and I like it and I think I'm
going to keep using them let's call
anything else from Milani here I don't
think so that might be it from Milani
I'm going to move on to hard candy and
the lip product that I'm wearing today I
got another one of these velvet mousse
lip colors so the first one I talked
about back in last week's hard candy
video was this cherry blossom one that
was the only shade I had at the time and
they really are like the color of the
outer packaging because cherry blossom
was more of a you know a deep kind of
rosy pink this one is Dalia it's very
dark look at the gorgeous tin I'm really
falling for these tins and I got Sweet
Pea as well and I just think these tins
are really cute they're kind of bulky
they're not like absolutely a necessity
to me but they are really pretty to look
at and honestly it's probably a big
reason why these even caught my eye
because hard candies got a crapload of
things in my Walmart store and these
definitely stood out to me so it caused
me to linger a little bit look at what
they had to offer and you know I bought
the one really like the formula and I've
come back for more basically we're
talking about a liquid lip color it's
not like as liquidy as say one of the
Milani amore matte lip creams more
mousse like as the name implies not
completely transfer resistant but very
long wearing and this is my first time
wearing the Dahlia shape but something I
noticed about cherry blossom and that
made it very unique for me in this world
of liquid lip colors is how evenly it
war throughout the day like it didn't
wear off in a patchy way it wasn't like
slowly peeling off from the inner part
of my lips um that it just kind of
gently lightened up a little bit
throughout the day with this shade it's
a very dark like kind of brownish
brick-red and I feel like just looking a
little bit at the inner part of my lip
here like as it's wearing off it almost
looks like a beautiful unintentional
ombre thing happening there but I think
as it wears more I'm going to see more
red out of the shade but this is what it
looks like you know it's very pigmented
very true to the color you would expect
when you see the product did I say
there's a little mirror in there so
that's kind of handy for touch-ups very
eager see how this one does throughout
the day
I have already worn Sweet Pea and I
gotta say the shape looks pretty but I
wasn't nuts about it it's just a little
too light to look good on my lips in
this very matte format you know what I'm
saying like I can see a lot it reveals a
little too much about the dryness of my
lips also I got another one of these
cheeky tints I tell you when I say I'm
interested in something and I'm probably
gonna buy more nine times out of ten I
go out and I do that as the cheeky tints
sheer blush gel in your adult so the
other one I had was more reddish sheer
kind of a warm red and this is more of a
cool pink you can see it there it's
really like exactly like the color of my
nails and ultimately the shade you're
seeing is my blush today like I used
something else which I'll get to in a
minute it didn't quite satisfy my blush
need today I needed a little more color
and so I used this very lightly I think
it's beautiful you can blend them with
your fingers pretty easily they don't
set too fast you can use a small stipple
brush if you wish hard candy also has
this adorable little glass bottle of
something called illuminate and strobing
mix in drops you need to play around
with this a little bit more because I
haven't used it a whole bunch from the
mix in perspective but even just used
alone I find them to be very very
settled so you got like the little
dropper style here I'll just put a
little bit on my hand
it looks very milky very creamy but
still thin as I blend it out like I
don't know over that size of a surface
like over my entire hand you can kind of
see some glow happening but it's not
quite as pronounced as I was expecting
and I've also kind of just padded it not
today I haven't done this I have kind of
just tapped it on the top of my
cheekbones
that's probably the way I can get the
most impact because you're not spreading
it out over as much skin and you're
really just tapping it over one spot
about the readout of air I wasn't super
wowed by this there's something from elf
called shimmering facial whip it's a
little one dollar product and they do
have a white shade that definitely packs
a little more punch than something like
this does if you are getting it and
really planning to do the whole mixin
thing I think you're going to find it to
be extremely subtle because it's subtle
ads is and if you dilute it even more
into a moisturizer or a foundation and
you know it's going to be a very light
effect at Target I found these ombre
blushes from wet and wild what yeah they
snuck out these blushes and I've just
done like my next video of the ombre
blushes and now here's some from wet and
wild so you can see there they start one
color they kind of fade very gradually
into another shade I have in a purple
haze which is a very different kind of
blush shade for me you know it looks
very purpley there you can see it a
little bit better this is going from
very cool pink to like a lilac shade
I'll swatch each end of it so you can
see very pastel very like you know
Belle's room type lilac in a recent
video I was talking about the NYX
strobing palette and they have like a
really light lilac type shimmer and on
the skin like it doesn't scream lilac
but it has a pretty kind of glow like a
very cool way that it hits the light or
that the light hits it and this I mean
it's kind of like that only more chalky
and less super shimmery and glowy it
doesn't show up a whole lot on my skin
as a blush I'm willing to play with this
some more I've only used it one time so
far the other shades
I love these names props to the
wet-and-wild product naming committee
because one is called might I buy you a
drink this goes from a gold which i
swatched on that finger into a peachy
shade and it's so subtle like this was
the one I was wearing on my skin today
and I was like I can't get enough impact
from it it can look pretty and soft and
glowy but not enough of a blush for me
then same situation with the princess
daiquiris again I love
name but it's more pinky than this other
one and maybe if you had like super
fair-skinned you would be all about
these but for me I just was a little
letdown I wanted more pigment more pop
next up I got this butter bronzer from
Physicians Formula I can even smell this
I haven't even opened it if it's like a
foot away from me I will smell this this
smells like straight-up
tanning salon not that I mind that but
who is it's a very very fragrance
product if you want a bronzer that
smells like a pina colada
I guess this is one you might want to
try you lift up the little guy there and
it's got an actual like sponge with it
instead of a brush which I found
surprising because while this does feel
nice and like buttery and creamy for a
powder it's still very much a powder to
me it doesn't kick up a lot of dust and
fall out but it's still a powder and
this claims to be infused with Muro Muro
butter I'm not familiar with that kind
of butter but I have this in the shade
bronzer and I find it to be very light
as in like barely shows up on my skin
this comes in an even lighter shade as
well it's not completely non-existent on
my skin but it's pretty subtle and if
you're much darker than me I think you
might be a little frustrated by that it
has kind of a satiny finish it's just a
little step away from being totally mad
with the snow that's falling outside my
window right now this is kind of nice to
smell to get a whiff of but beyond that
I don't find it really remarkable I got
another bronzer from Malley and this is
big this is big news to me because I am
a huge fan of her poreless face defender
which is like a clear product kind of a
mattifying pore perfecting touch-up
product is the way i use it anyway just
kind of like dab it on your t-zone it
has no visible look of any makeup
because it's completely clear but it
does what it says it kind of just
perfects the skin and takes away the
look of pores and shine now I see on
ulties website they had this ever color
poreless face defender boost so it's
like a bronzer in face defender format
and one thing when it came look at this
little scratch on the top at first i
rubbed on it thinking it was just I
don't
dust or something that was on there but
it's actually like scratched on the top
so that's not cool you get this big ol
really squishy soft sponge and you get
the extra sponge that is underneath if I
were closing my eyes and you said this
is face defender it doesn't feel exactly
like the other one it's not quite as
slippery it's a little bit more toward
the creamy side but it does definitely
you know have some color to it just
interesting because the regular poreless
face defender is definitely something
you know I would dab on you just dab it
on with a sponge the sponge really makes
sense for that with this it's not like
I'm going to dab this product like as a
touch-up all over my skin you know I'm
saying I'm probably going to use it when
I'm first doing my makeup and it's going
to be more like around the perimeter of
the face maybe or just you know on top
of the cheeks a little bit so I actually
prefer using this with a synthetic brush
I'm almost treating it more like a
classic cream product than some special
poreless face defender product feels
kind of like I'm touching a hardened
putty or something and then it feels
smoother and a little bit more dry
between the fingers goodness gracious I
don't know if this is making any sense
at all it's not tacky it's not dewy
creamy on the skin it really comes off
looking like a matte bronzer when you
apply it you just have to apply it in a
little bit different way because it's
not powder it's not a normal cream
either I need to do more homework with
this one for sure
I got a makeup revolution shimmer brick
it says shimmer brick radiant so I don't
know if this just came in the one shade
I can't remember but it looks really
pretty
it's like a very metallic highlight with
strips of more bronzy tones in there as
well I love my Physicians Formula
shimmer strips this strikes me as
something that's maybe even more like
pigmented or just heavy duty on the
shimmer I'm sorry there's been a lot
happening on this hand today but there's
each of the shades just swatched out
individually you can see how pigmented
they all are like could definitely
double as eyeshadows and then right here
that's all of them mixed together so it
ends up looking like just a soft gold I
think I'm going to like it because I'm
big on the multitasking products I think
what
t'ayn this kind of a tone just swept all
over everything would look really pretty
but also I want to ask you guys are any
of you shimmer brick users like the
Bobby Brown
shimmer bricks do you love those are
there any certain shades that are
must-haves do I need to try those
because I've never used one and I have
used the Physicians Formula this is my
first from makeup revolution so let's
discuss are you leaving but your bulb
you just kissed my dark lips and nothing
transferred off take that for what it's
worth people have a good day be really
careful bubs I'm going to be that
careful because I feel like I'm living
in the moment but we care about the
blizzard out there also um Ulta has
their own kind of generic Beauty Blender
which I do have and I've been trying so
many blendings but just trying to
compare them seeing like what works the
best what doesn't what cleans up better
what feels better but they recently came
out with a smaller version so it's
orange and it says pointed and rounded
tips for blending tight areas so it
comes in a pack of two and then here's
what it looks like after it's been
dampened and I use this on like
concealer and in just a few little areas
today I do really think the size is nice
I cleaned it probably three four times
and it's cleaned up really nicely I've
used it for foundation to I don't feel
like it's too too small for that I
really prefer the evenness that I get
with the Real Techniques blender and
using that flat side with foundation but
this was kind of nice around the eye not
quite as precise as the micro mini
Beauty Blender just because that can go
anywhere and everywhere you know it's
still a little bit on the large side to
get tight places but not quite as large
and in charge as the Real Techniques is
sorry jumping around all over the place
here my eye look for today
another Malley thing it's this nude
attitude I shadow palette thought on the
website was very intrigued because I'm
kind of a collector of the malli
eyeshadow palettes and this one looks
very different like the one she's been
putting out have been a lot like the
naked palettes look you know with the
little kind of vertical strips of shadow
so here we've got
but twelve shades total it's a mix of
matte and shimmer nothing in here is
overly sparkly I really thought this
Tara Rosa shade I actually wanted this
to be like even more metallic than it is
but it's like a soft shimmery rose so on
my eyes today I'm wearing like all of
these darkest shades here and this and I
used a little bit of this but I needed
this quartz shade to really make it pop
so I've got the quartz on the inner
corner I've got the black on the outer
corner some chestnut in the crease which
is a matte brown so you got matte Brown
and matte black in this palette claret
is kind of a satin finish Burgundy I've
got that a little bit in the crease I've
got some russet which is this deep
bronzy shade in the crease as well I
feel like these are pretty similar in
formula to other palettes from Malley
that I've used one thing I really
noticed I enjoyed was that these shades
didn't kick up much fall out at all if
that's a big annoyance to you you might
be interested in this because even you
know high-end drugstore doesn't seem to
really matter there are a lot of pallets
that will do that too yet this quartz
shade is really pretty it's like a satin
finish very light pink itani this shade
right here is really good for blending
you know just kind of buffing the edge
of your look I forgot I did use some of
that kind of in this no-man's land
between the crease and the brow and it
did well there and there's a nice little
brush too you got a small end here very
usable a little bit smaller than the
Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush and then
something that kind of reminds me like
it would function a lot like a sigma e25
really it's not maybe quite as fluffy as
that but could put shadow on the lid and
also blend up into the crease not ready
to review this yet this is my first day
using it I'm one shade I'm very excited
to use because I think it's watch as
well it just looks really interesting is
that slate color kind of bluish grey
couple of other makeup revolution things
sitting over here that I forgot to
mention earlier I got the ultra contour
palette this brand I tell you I keep
running into things on the website that
I want to test out and I think I'm on
the verge of you know doing a review of
the things I already have and it's like
oh wait there's one more palette
the feeling there's always going to be
one more pallet for miss brand and I'm
just going to have to bite the bullet
and do a review on what I have but I
have really liked the the bronzer
palette that's in this format and a
couple of the blush palettes and this is
the contour option so there's really a
lot happening here you've got your three
matte contour shades which I think are
all pretty workable this is the one I
use today and a little bit of this I
think it did well to light matte shades
here one more yellowy one more pinky got
a couple shimmery shades here this one's
a little more like brownish one a little
more pinky but they're very soft like
kind of a soft pearly finish and then
you got this guy up here that's just
all-out like BAM
very opaque white pearly shimmer I used
a little bit of this shade just kind of
brighten up the whole this area of skin
it's really nicely pigmented it kind of
reminds me of the effect I get from
Laura Geller's baked french vanilla so
that was nice and then for this little
added glow on top of the cheeks you know
I was a little scared of his shade you
know just go and fall out with that so I
kind of dipped my brush back and forth
between this one and this one so I sort
of blended the two and got a softer
highlight on top but I'm digging that
palette it's as pigmented as anyone
would need it to be I still really love
my little elf contour palette but I must
say this gives you more options
especially from the glowy standpoint in
just the different highlight shades you
have to work with here it's really nice
when I was in at Walgreens I was
thinking about picking up another
covergirl super sizer mascara I'm not
quite out of the one that I currently am
using but I saw in the Queen collection
they had this called false lash drama
and this looks I mean the brush that
they've got going on here it looks
identical to super sizer so I just
wanted to get this and kind of confirm
for myself that it was the same I'm not
positive but it seems like it's going to
be the same exact thing I would crack it
open for you and examine the brush but I
don't really want to do that just yet
because I'm still not totally done with
my regular super sizer that's it for
right now everyone you wanted a haul you
got yourself a haul I definitely as I
have mentioned throughout I have some
things that I need to work with quite a
bit more before I can give you some
reviews on
then but as with most of my halls you
know we run into some questionable
things here and there but some of the
stuff you know I really love so thank
you for watching and I will see you next
time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
