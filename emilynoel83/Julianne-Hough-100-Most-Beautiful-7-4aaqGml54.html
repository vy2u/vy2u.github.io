Magazine's 100 most beautiful inspired
looks here and this one is going to be a
look inspired by julianne hough she was
featured in the 100 most beautiful issue
just a really small picture and then she
was most recently on the cover of shape
magazine and so I thought I would kind
of use that I could get a really good
look at how her makeup is here and i
thought i would use that to kind of play
off of for this look so it's all about
thick lashes a little different
eyeshadow technique than I've used
before which I think you're going to
enjoy and just a really flawless face so
if you want to see how it all comes
together keep on one right to start out
Julian's look um overall she's got a
really flawless face but the coverage
really doesn't look too heavy and it
sort of has a little bit of a dewy
finish so my sort of formula to achieve
all that is I used my Maybelline let me
grab it out here my mineral power
foundation my shade is medium one and
this really has it's sort of a light
coverage liquid foundation in my opinion
so I thought that would work well for
this look and then I used my Kat Von D
tattoo concealer around my eyes because
I noticed her face obviously it just has
that flawless look to it and that means
under eye circles you can't see him at
all if they're there so I used that and
then I went all over my face with my
Mary Kate loose powder in beige one just
to set that look and now I'm going to
take you through some of the face color
products and she doesn't have really an
overpowering amount of color on her face
that she actually keeps it really
natural in terms of bronzer but I can
kind of tell that sort of around her her
temples and and cheeks and around this
area there's definitely been some
bronzing done there so I'm going to use
my Mac bronzing powder in golden which
is kind of a subtle bronzing shade and
it does have just a little bit of
pearlescent glow to it but it's not
overly just overlay sparkly so I'm just
going to use my big fluffy kabuki brush
and get it in there and I'm gonna go go
over here sort of right along my
hairline
kind of focusing in on my temples so get
right in here and right in there so
we're nicely blended and then I'm just
kind of going around down the side here
as it's making that three motion you
hear people talk about a lot where you
come down you hit right under the
cheekbone and then you come right down
under the jaw so just do that on both
sides now for a little added contouring
I'm going to use my covergirl cheekers
blush and golden pink let's get a little
bit of that on your blush brush and just
focus it in right here give a little
definition to the cheeks um it's in
terms of blush whatever she has on is
really really natural and she has a nice
sort of you know peachy golden eaglets
in so i thought the Rimmel blush in
peach would be ideal here it's one of
the most subtle blushes that I have so
I'm going to just put a little bit of
that on the apples of my cheeks here and
Julian really just has that nice summery
glow I think this look is so appropriate
for the summer time so I want to try to
give off a little bit of that glow she's
really just got this nice glow just the
center of her face is just highlighted
really well I feel like so I'm going to
use my Jane blush sticks and shimmering
peach and this is from their life it's
the Jane like organic makeup line that
they have and I'm just going to dot a
little bit of that along the top of my
cheek here just like so a little bit on
my chin down my nose and just a little
on my forehead and then I'm just going
to go over that with my physicians
formula shimmer strips in waikiki glow
which is a peach bronzer just kind of go
for the these lightest colors here at
the top and dust over that and you'll
really get that kind of a nice summary
glow that she has really Center it on
like the center of the face that's kind
of where you want that light to hit
all right guys it's time to start
working on Julian's I look and for her
eyes working you're gonna notice me
using some different techniques than i
usually use her i appears to be very
flat like in terms of her lower lid and
then her upper lid is really you know
kind of like kind of a deal late on its
back ok flat here and then curve there
there's not a lot of like a cat eye
defect or anything like that it's more
just all kept like right within this
area it really follows the natural shape
of her eyes so I kind of tried to
duplicate that a little bit with this
look so I'm going to start out by I use
some rubenesque Paint Pot all over my
lid just to kind of work as a primer and
really grab the shadow and then I'm
grabbing my maybelline quad in I'm not
seeing what the name of this one is a
chai latte and so go ahead and just get
some neutral colors like this anything
really will work and I'm going to grab
my eyeshadow brush from ELF and I'm
going to use the lightest shade here
that actually is labeled brow bone and
I'm going to apply that pretty much all
over my lid and just to kind of get that
nice nice a light base color to work
with here and this is a pretty sheer
color anyway but it looks pretty on top
of the rubenesque paint pot which is
kind of a peachy gold shade ok so just
get that all over and then like I said
this the following steps are going to be
really easy because we're just following
the natural sort of dome shape of our I
here so I'm going to take this shade
that says outer corner it's a deep matte
brown and get some of that on just a
medium crease brush and basically we're
going to get it in there and we're going
to start the middle and we're just
following the natural shape of the
crease we're not doing an outer V we're
just following that domed
effect of the I not giving really much
more emphasis to one part of it than the
other just following the whole way so
blend that out as you feel you need to
and then we're going to top it off with
this pretty shimmery shade that says
crease it's kind of like a coppery gold
shimmer and I'm just going to kind of go
a little above what i just did and apply
that and it's just going to give us a
little added warmth there so again
you're going to find this that's really
easy and I love I mean I really like her
I look just as much as I like a lot of
people that have more the cat eye defect
but it is a little different technique
than I'm used to so again just using
that to that kind of shimmery shade to
warm things up a little bit and then I'm
going to take my Sephora rounded crease
brush pick up a little bit of that light
shade that we put all over our lid and
just use it as a subtle highlight here
following the shape of our eyebrow okay
then we are going to do our liner and
basically the liner look is pretty
pretty dark all the way across the top
lash line and then just mainly on the
bottom just on the outside so for that
I'm going to grab my physicians formula
mineral wear eyeliner in ultra black and
I like this because it has a little
blending tip we wanted really she has
some really nice thick lashes all the
way across so what we want to do is also
add to that effect by giving a sort of
thick smudged outline along our lashes
to give you even more of the illusion of
thick eyelashes so basically line
however you feel most comfortable but
this does not have to be a perfect line
because we are going to go in and do
some smudging but just keep it don't get
it too thick on the inner part here
try to stay kind of close to the lash
line and then as you go on out just a
nice black line we're not winging it up
we are just staying with our natural
shape of our I here okay just like so
and then I'm going to use my little
smudge tip that's conveniently on the
end here and just use this if you didn't
get end up getting you know as close to
your lash line as you wanted to a smudge
tip is a nice way to kind of really work
that in and then you know you can kind
of blend it up a little bit and wind up
with a little thicker line than what you
started with without using any more
product at all ok just like that and
while we've got this little liner tool
in our hands going to go ahead and take
the bottom part and this is where you
really want to think about if you're
going for the same sort of eye shape
that she has its kind of flat across the
bottom so since my eyes are a little bit
they want to be a little bit rounder and
come up a little bit here I am kind of
bringing this liner down just a bit you
see what I'm doing here I'm kind of
filling in a little space here so my eye
looks a little more flat across the
bottom then as far as the rest of the
way in there's really hardly anything
going on from what I can tell in the
picture I'm just going to take that
pretty shade that with shimmery that
said crease on it in our quad and just
kind of carry that on in it really won't
do anything in terms of really defining
that much but it will just kind of give
it give a little bit of a pretty sparkle
if anybody's looking at you that close
up ok and the next thing I'm going to do
I'm going to curl my lashes I'm going to
apply a coat of this L'Oreal what was
this called extra volume collagen
mascara and
I'm going to put on some of my revlon
the fantasy and length slashes in flirty
and the reason why I chose these is
because they're not really like a whole
lot thicker on the outside on the inside
she has really consistently thick lashes
from inside to out so we kind of want to
keep that same look so that's why I'm
using these this sort of eyelash here
and i also do apply manassas before I do
apply a coat of mascara then after i put
the lashes on sometimes when i come back
and finish the video like they're still
actually drawing so i haven't
necessarily done that every time but but
I do advise you know another coat of
mascara to help blend and anyway I'm
going to go through those steps and then
I'll join you with the finish alright
guys that does it for the julianne hough
inspired makeup look it's all about the
flawless face with that summary glow
using highlighters and some really
subtle blush tones to keep the look
natural but also really flawless in
terms of the eyes it's all about the
thick lashes across the top and really
just following the natural shape of your
eye that's why I think a lot of you are
going to really like this look because
it shows that you don't have to do the
outer V every time to get a pretty I
look on the lips she's got just a really
light sort of subtle pink lip gloss on
so I used this Smashbox shade here which
the sticker is actually gone from it but
you can see it's just like a pretty
medium pink shade with a little bit of
shimmer and that's pretty standard I
think for what she looks like quite
often so here is the picture of Julian I
mean as you can see all about the lashes
really across the top and just that
beautiful flawless face so thank you
guys so much for tuning in for this
tutorial and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
