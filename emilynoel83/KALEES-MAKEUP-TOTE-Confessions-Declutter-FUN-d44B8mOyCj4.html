maybe things that like come up wet and
wild at my wedding while I am NOT a very
sanitary clean individual as a tote easy
goes a long way with Kate Lydia like it
easy this is Avenue since like 2006
story time story time to pull the chair
without the marshmallows this is a great
experience
hi everyone do you know who this is this
is my friend Kaylee Kaylee has done
whether you may recognize her from
several different markets in the United
States Jane Illinois obviously Southern
Illinois Illinois Birmingham Alabama and
Kansas City Missouri that's where she is
right now so she is amazing at what she
does in weather and she always looks
amazing but but I think is really
exciting it's seeing inside people's
makeup bags and Kaylee in one of my
all-time favorite videos on my channel
Kaylee shows what was in her makeup bag
years back I will link to that video
because you want to see that you want to
get the backstory on where this is all
evolving from and a long way it is no
longer a makeup bag it is a makeup tote
dude is that that's heavy
Thanks that's there's a lot in here this
is why I leave it at work how much do I
have on my memory not gonna do it I have
cleared out at least 40 minutes of
memory card space all right I'm gonna
put down the tote and start with this
which you gave me I gave you that so
long yeah this is where your bridal
shower know you came down to Alabama
Tyler you and Tyler did and you we do
they like practice makeup for the
wedding we went shopping and you brought
right this when I came on the way moving
to Alabama and Steve and I anything that
emily has been involved in because as in
the first video when I start something I
stick with it I'm not one to creature of
habit
yes I like a routine I like to have a
structure and there's only a few things
in here that I
straight off the beaten path which is
this item here it was the first
contouring type palette I ever had I
love this it's it's great you know what
because on days that you're off work I
use it for my eyeshadow I use it for
everything yeah got my hope in a
different shades in it you remember I'm
not very good at this hello this is good
you're doing great okay there it is okay
yeah you can talk about this again
yeah well it's a bunch of shapes there's
like one shade with shimmer in it but
the rest are matte it defines your face
okay chisels out your cheekbones and
stuff like that but like you said I
shadow every whatever just general face
powder it's really good next up is this
this was a I went to Ulta
and I needed more bronzer and more blush
and that had it in one and so I thought
that is an easy situation for me to deal
with cosmetics hate cosmetics I don't
know if it's the right shades I don't
know anything that looks really good no
that's a very like universal type
palette and plus it has this third shade
which the third shade it looks like
there's just a little blush fall out
like this henna the blush came over oh
there's gonna be part of me something
together okay so I have my was this
called a Mac and it looks like the names
on the front you oh yes Studio Fix fluid
yes okay so I like this okay I have two
of them okay one for the summer and one
for the winter because I am a completely
different shade in the summer
okay completely different nw20 is one
yeah that's the winter Kayle which I'm
still winter I'm very white right now
okay
but I will be tan soon and this is NW 25
okay um and because I ran out of that
I'm using this now and that is a bad
idea because it's a totally different
shade well but I'm using it and I'm like
waiting for someone to say some thank ya
know if nobody said anything yet if
nobody's gotten on Facebook or Twitter
yet to say anything just you're cool
you're cool so okay and I'm lazy and
stuffing any stories I'm going home from
who needs em you need more foundation
gotcha okay see you got me this yeah
it is the same one that you got me a
long time ago like like years back years
years back that is bad as it's always
love when the top just lives off of it
as opposed to you know actually opening
this is what I'm talking about people a
fully used up what's that man totally
used up at the top I already got one
vodka okay I think this is the one that
I've been using for years and ground
powder brow powder I love that thing and
it's not itty-bitty brushes and tweezers
and stuff yeah
these tweezers by Milani that's a
drugstore item clearly it can survive
Haley's makeup bag for a period of years
so another thing that Emily brought into
my life oh the pixie correction
concentrate on tightening peach I just
actually got a new one so this is not
the one you gave me it's a brand new one
that I bought great product for under
eyes dark circles right here mm-hmm
I put it right there yes yeah love it
highly recommend hey oh this is the Too
Faced shadow insurance the shadow
insurance that Emily also got me hooked
on it's gone though oh it don't get more
okay more but you told me I need to get
something else so I suggested she just
go for the Milani eyeshadow primer which
is you know a Walgreens product it it
works amazingly well I love it yeah I
think I'm gonna have to take a picture
of that so that I can see what I mean by
dirty okay that isn't that dirty palette
okay I rarely use this though but I like
it because I love browns that's real
life in a makeup bag this is what
happens to things that win in a makeup
bag you know yeah it's gonna get dirty
but the stuff you got in there I've
talked about this palette before like a
palette have you noticed how they are
all like this is supposed to be a quad
this is supposed to be a quad and this
is a quad no I didn't know that but so
they like outlined on the back so for
people if you don't know what shadows to
put together this is a great light
beginner palette because you just go for
four and four button wild
this one is good but I don't use it
anymore it's not because I don't like it
it's because I it can go pretty dramatic
that black is pretty dark yes it's
serious and what happens is when you put
it on it falls right here and then you
become like the raccoon of the group
well this
does not use this is a venue since like
2006 but it's still in my okay I'm
thinking I might need it for something I
don't know we really like it I don't
know that it's necessarily been used or
dentist picked up all of the powder fall
out that's true you know because it's
not like breaking apart and if it was
used to be breaking apart do we want to
take the opportunity now to throw this
away yeah okay I'm gonna do the honors
I'm not gonna be the hoarder of the
group okay either okay I always order
this guy is I was a big fan of the
Maybelline concealer cabling it's fit me
well I can see through the container I
know if you could you guys can see that
but that's hollow like there's nothing
there you can throw and I don't know if
sometimes I keep these just in case I
want to buy another one and you know
what color I am that's a good point but
I never actually blown it into the store
so it's oh all right well you're you're
25 media maybe I can try to write this I
loved and well this is this is teal
eyeliner yes okay so it's elf you know
the dollar yeah oh I'm familiar so I got
this for Black Friday a Black Friday
deal 2011 Black Friday deal I don't want
to give it away because I'm just bad
that I didn't use it more
so there's sentimental value because
this is a cool color it is but there's
just not a lot to use it with when you
need a daily television makeup if you're
not gonna reach for it much we can
through to you realistically yeah you
don't think we're it's gonna be making a
comeback okay Luva eyelash adhesive okay
which I can keep I don't put on eye
lashes anyway so for me next time when I
put them on if I'm out I'll use this I
do you mind if I take the opportunity to
just shine it us up with a wig here real
quick should we sing something like
letting my are you go we've been seeing
a lot of that you also gave me this in
the bag
oh that's a really cute nail polish yeah
and I don't paint my nails so it's great
it's just it's yeah well it probably
will still be good there just cleaned up
shiny yeah okay alright this is old and
wait well it's eye shadow oh that's such
a pretty color it's bronze taupe it's
the L'Oreal infallible and actually it's
not a totally loose shadows so that's
why I kind of like it it should be kind
of tamp down like that that's good stuff
okay so this contouring no this is the
same ones that won the fit that was
clear I through yeah cuz I was used that
same showed it's the wrong color yeah
this is what happens when you go to the
store and you don't bring the one that
you save to bring easiest or medium I
medium you come out with a cafe which is
nothing like you and then it sits in
your bag because you're too lazy to
bring it back right yeah well I think
we've all been there yeah yeah that's
not quite in the ballpark do you want to
keep it yeah no this was gonna be a
total makeup purge session good about
its I don't know this is okay that was
it cosmetics they put out it's called
news anchor blue and it's supposed to be
like something you can top off your lip
color with and it makes your teeth look
whiter because of the blue pigment in it
like it's not literally a blue gloss but
they're just it kind of has a little bit
of that shine I'm seeing some separation
there like some buffering like turquoise
this is the brother of the turquoise
okay the black the black again very sad
that this didn't get more loved than it
did yeah that's over now
it's time has come I don't know about
this but it's really too great chocolate
Soleil bronzer I think that you probably
got that with this in like a little
Salem a yeah this is probably good this
is a really nice bronzer you should make
use of this okay so he's still good yeah
I think that's still good have little
individual lash guys okay okay this is a
good story story time story time
alright pull up a chair get off the
marshmallows this alright so some people
can do on some people can't this is I am
in the can't category I end up yelling
that very bad words while I do this
they stick and they end up going like
this way and this but this is the tricky
thing about individual false lashes like
I think we've all been there anybody
who's tried them with practice and time
it can't get Bethel I like okay I
practiced okay
I bet you want to keep them she's stuck
holding on okay so that's what's in the
small bag very good fun look at all you
got rid of so much lighter now yeah and
you've got only things in here that
you're pretty sure are still usable
because I'm like that person who you
know what the almond milks been in there
from maybe seven to ten days but we're
not sure so I'll throw it away and it's
maybe propionic good almond milk maybe
not Coastal Scents 2010 I think you were
in champagne at the time they are not
the same brushes from - that's a
different brush set that I think I
hooked you up yeah there's like a lot
see these might be the originals the
blue ones are sitting on she's got some
a mix of maybe a couple Coastal Scents
in there a couple randoms and a bunch of
the Sigma it's the bunny collection of
synthetic I like Jonathan was up here
earlier he said you don't care for your
brushes they're abuse they're not well
taken care of it all no you don't take
care of them no I don't I just wait
until they're past their prime another
bite new ones
so the washing is I don't know what that
means she likes to get like a towel
uh-huh and she'll just like rub them
into them and that's kind of the way she
just cleans on okay oh God Wow you made
a commitment like in the old video to
wash take care of your I did that
because you're watching I'm back with a
brush that isn't looking still okay but
dirty
it's yeah but it looks way better than
the brush doesn't look like Haggard
I mean you've clearly been keeping it in
its little brush guard I think that's
what's really been a game changer that
one really turned bright yeah I've been
using some serious blush without blush
in the it cosmetic oh I can only do like
up or I'm like this was the same size as
the brush that I loved
no cold brush back to the first video
this one is okay okay the difference
between now and then I don't use the
same brush for everything anymore that
brush will you're not personal yeah with
not only the bronzer and the blush and
whatever else okay but this one is just
the bronzer okay this one is just the
blush this one is just the powder this
one is the contour the darker part of
the contour okay this one is the whiter
part of the contour gotcha not sure
what's the word for when like an animal
dies and it's tastes like like hard hard
that's like a paintbrush when you don't
watch it Kreitman or at all we don't use
them he's teeth he's being he's waiting
for his perfect time
his lolling you will discover a plan
yeah it's um I always do I always
discover a plan this is my um smudge it
out kind of like outer corner York shade
actually that's every shade but
everything that's where I'm what
Jonathan would tell you I scrubbed my
brushes into a towel to like get the
colors off so this guy right here I've
used him okay the day before so but
there's no moisture there's no water
there's no soap nope and now we're clean
and we're ready for the next color the
eye I think what we need to do is just
like wash the brushes the brushes need
to be washed
like pretty frequently just because they
hold a lot of bad stuff they hold a lot
of like bacteria and stuff thick that is
bad for your skin
so like even a some brush cleaning wipes
if we could hook you up with these and
we could maybe do regular check-ins with
you and make sure your brush they're
like he's like an accountability
partners ID on any brush it's flat
because I've used him to the point where
he's no longer with us there is that was
there there wasn't much
there's really nothing here I don't know
how you do it I love that brush I need
to find a replacement before I even
remember what it used to be I don't know
but it's what it is now is this the
upper white part of my iris so I have to
have it you still use this every day
first up yesterday I use that at 2:45 in
the morning when I was getting ready for
work
hi it's my party I'm crap I wasn't even
scheduled so there's my brushes the
inside of my this is a real life these
are these are real real life situations
I like that you're being so open and
honest with the viewers and we are here
to support you
hairspray it's the best sebastio fashion
shaper love this because I like to get
my hair to where it's like I can run my
fingers through it and then I get like a
big-time hairspray
that's like stains like this bag leaves
the tote quite frequently actually
because it is my go to the the studio
bag there is no zipper okay that's
alright but it's it's got stuff that I
may need to touch up throughout the show
gotcha so I've got my powder which is
the studio powder that goes with this
the studio do fix and it in nw20 too no
matter which one I use this is from the
first video but not the thing one okay
okay but I'm still eating it a Revlon
liquid eyeliner
big baby Mac lip gloss I love this stuff
I think it might be clear I start my
eyes across right now this vamp liffe i
anything but you merely like limited
edition collection does not exist
anymore my favorite so can we please
stop doing that because women we like a
lip gloss and we stick with the lip
gloss for life we are lifers Mac has so
many limited-edition collections so
maybe that's where some of these things
came from
well like you know like the special
little displays where they've got a
certain name for it i next time you go
to the mat counter and you want to pick
some things up say I want something
that's not limited okay so I can come
back and get it
okay so then this is a Revlon pencil
this is my under eye okay so I don't put
the liquid on my under eye
I just I wear the liner yeah okay my
curler or good friends covergirl from
Walgreens probably this does bare
minerals marvelous Moxie I like I love a
loss yeah and it makes me feel like I'm
Angelina Jolie sometimes we lie let's
lump shiny yeah you drop something I
think I don't want you I don't yeah the
dot it's power girl tweezers other pink
covergirl tweezers that's kind of neat
yeah this is a new lipstick I bought at
the Ultima Smashbox Smashbox I love it
I like this color if you can't have a
neutral I love our very world audition
gotcha it auditioned for my lips and it
won it and then there's this you you
gave me this all I got to go into that
and I never turned back now I will be a
malli
I do love malli I love all my products
this was probably the worst one I've
ever bought it was really clumpy but see
I'm a loyal I'm a loyal person so I'm
gonna go back for more yeah cuz you've
probably had that for a long long long
long so empty done naked one oh I am
like I am so impressed and rather proud
of how many products use hit pan on here
how many said is this okay that's I just
need to bask in this for a second it
will take a we'll take a brief break
are you back out for this week messages
every single shade but to she's hit pan
on kid out of town like that's amazing
okay all the naked Nick it will make a
negative blue nigga to I like to get to
you completely used up certain shades
I'd love to make it to I think I need to
repurchase this one based off of but
making it is
I love Naked 3 but think about naked 3
is its
it's it's not an every day it's got a
lot of like rosy pinky but I loved the
purples but nonetheless look guys she's
she's completely using up portions of
these palettes I am so impressed well
that's because you taught me well and I
my eyes are different with the Kohl
Center where every day instead of
looking like a same shade take the
opportunity grab something different
this one make it naked smoky
I love naked smoky okay show me no I get
smoky fun recently purchased that last
year so it is not it's only down to
those she's hit pan on to hit pan on to
the light I love I learned that a lot of
it Ike I love them all hey did you know
these little the film that's over the
mirror this is like one of the most
satisfying things ever do you have a
problem if I remove that no please do
like Justin Timberlake needs Mike
singing give a man no mummy and look you
can use this as for like close-up stuff
when you're doing your your eyes that's
fantastic news you can do that with any
of those pallets I noticed it was there
all of them okay a tampon tampon can't
go without it this one you got me yes I
did okay it's a new keep it in the
actual box okay I like it so much
like I loved this and it got so dirty
then I was this so cute I got fur cuz
she lived in Alabama real time and it
just I thought it would be handy for her
because it was so much in one these Fair
minerals shadows are wouldn't you say
they're really nice like up there with
the urban decay is more its quality haha
oh my god this is when I had to go by
the it saying cuz this had everything in
it the set Yeller what it is I think I
have like a bronzer yeah a bronzer
blushes they two runs and two brushes
amazing and I'm amazing I took things
and I still have the film you let me
take it on hey I'm clean I hope everyone
can be blessed with a friendship where
one person doesn't remove the film and
another person who really loves removing
films gets to remove them but this is
okay she's a heck of a list maker
no I wanted to pretend like I was and so
if somebody saw this that worked
think wow she's organized she is a list
in her makeup yeah and then this this is
great but I just don't ever have a
pencil sharpener so he's just waiting to
be sharpened okay what can I sharpen it
for you that would be Jen I was hoping
you're gonna say that but friends and
family this is the tote
Kaylee's makeup tote and we've cleared
some things out yeah I made some
decisions about things we've appreciated
all of it look at that pink what a beaut
we've appreciated all the use that
Kaylee has gotten out of products like
that that's so satisfying to me to see
all that you've used up out of your
naked palettes and not anything like
happy that you're proud of me yeah I am
I know there's things that I can still
work on but I would say the takeaway
from this is nobody fresh some brush
cleaning would be good you know some
level of brush cleaning yeah maybe this
if you give me this right now I can tell
you that 75% sure I will clean the brush
okay I can only say 75% though what if I
do like a little check-in like it text
you every so often I say hey those wipes
did you use how many people at home
would somebody text amendment they lie
but you know I had a great don't judge
me judgment free zone this is a friendly
place just told the truth and nothing
but truth the whole truth the stuff and
that's important and that's rare I think
on the internet yeah so good for Kaylee
um thank you guys so much for watching
here is a lot longer than in the first
video it's soaked and I don't care
whether you like it or not I'm just
going to put it out there it's great
it's fabulous I love it thank you guys
we'll see you later you can cut that
part if you want so what about her
makeup tote what do you know about this
tote have you seen inside this I mean
not many have is it true that there was
a piece of fruit in the - yeah yeah that
legend is true yeah that's not like a
myth or anything it was real I was there
I saw it I kid you not she we made fun
of her and said so and she put it back
in there
like she was cleaning out I promise when
I got like an apple or was it orange is
it orange is it orange
it was an orange was a bad orange it was
on the line of being like I don't know
what this is something may have been
grow I'm assuming this is an orange and
we're like why is this in your bag and I
swear she did not even throw it out she
was laughing she was like I don't know
and just put it up like she needs help
and I just hope that she can get it I
think you're the friend that my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
