continues today with a sunless tanner
that I found at Sephora and I feel like
I'm always on the lookout for a new
miracle sunless tanner products so I
really wanted to try it it's a little
more expensive excuse me then really
most other things that I have tried and
I also like to say first off that not
everyone needs or wants to be tan and I
realized that so I am just I mean if you
really know you're not interested in
this product no need to watch the video
um I'll have more reviews coming up but
I know that a lot of people are
interested in this including myself and
so I thought it was important to share
my experience with this product so
moving right along it is the Kardashian
glamour tan self tanning gel looks like
this comes in a box like this it was on
display at Sephora for 30 to 35 dollars
I think so I saw this I thought hey I'm
gonna give it a try
it says self tanning gel moisturizing
formula protective antioxidants with
vitamin D non streaking non-staining so
there are some definite pluses to this
product and some negatives so I'm going
to tell you all about it first I'm going
to read you the claims on the box here
and unlike most conventional tanning
products Kardashian's self tanning gel
produces a natural sunkissed look by the
way this isn't just a Kim Kardashian
product all three of the Kardashian
girls Kourtney and khloé got in on this
one too easy application with
moisturizing clear gel leaving skin
hydrated natural golden sun kissed hand
within 24 hours includes protective
antioxidants formulated with natural
vitamin D advises you to exfoliate
before using use sparingly around ankles
knees and elbows and hairline washing
hands after application and use two to
three times a week to deepen the tan
results may vary so what you're seeing
on me today I'm not I don't know if I'm
in the truest lighting right now but you
may be seeing some remnants of that I
that on a few days ago and since then
have showered several times so you know
that may be fading just a little bit but
I feel like I can tell you about the
results of this product it says clear
gel that was the most unusual thing
about this you can see yes that is a
clear gel in this tube and I've never
tried a sunless tanner that's a clear
gel I've tried just white lotions that
you know eventually develop into the tan
I've tried but any gel type product I've
tried has been tinted that I think is
one of the drawbacks to this is that
it's not tinted because honestly just to
put it right out there up front I had
some streaks both times I use this I've
gone through the application two
different times sort of the second time
hoping I've learned something and tried
to do a little better job but I still
wound up with streaks and I rarely wind
up with streaks with you know some of
those other products that are tinted and
I feel that that allows you to see where
you're putting the product and then the
tan develops from there with this you
just kind of had to go by feel sort of
try to keep your fingers together if you
apply it and not wind up with any
streaks so however this is a fairly
potent tanner
like after you put that on and you do
give it the 24 hours you are going to
look 10 you're going to notice the tan
probably after a couple of hours but
what's odd about this and I don't think
I've tried anything that says it
continues to deepen over a 24-hour
period that's unique and it truly does
the claims that they make about the tan
and this really will make you tan it
absolutely will it works in terms of
actually giving you that tan but you put
it on and it remains this kind of moist
feeling like your skin does feel
moisturized when you put it on but it's
like I don't think you ever truly
reached that point where it's like okay
it's definitely dry you know what I mean
like if you were going out and like I
would put this on like a couple hours
maybe three hours ahead of time even
after that amount of time
skin still felt some moisture on it and
I couldn't tell ok is this just the nice
moisturizing effects or do I still have
to be super careful about sitting and
getting my leg on something or whatever
I could tell that any streaks that I had
were the result of my like my fingers
raking across my skin and leaving some
kind of streak on my leg they were not
as a result of like my legs sitting on
something or whatever so I take that to
mean that when you put on put this on
even though it feels like your skin is
still moisturized after a few hours even
though you feel that way you're probably
still safe to move around or put clothes
on or whatever um but yeah it's a strong
Tanner I put it on my arms and I didn't
wind up with any streaky areas there but
I think the legs are a little more
difficult to kind of see all the way
around and really be aware of what's
going on there really important point
here with some sunless almost all
sunless Tanner's advise you to exfoliate
before you use it and to use sparingly
around dry areas of your skin that are
traditionally drier than the rest ankles
knees elbows etc it's it's extra
important to do that with this product
because it is a much more potent tanner
you need to make sure you exfoliate
everywhere and really do pay attention
to those areas the knees and the ankles
I got a lot darker around my ankles and
I wanted to so I didn't really heat that
morning of apply spirit layer so
exfoliating is really important what
that does is that sloughing off your
skin scales and skin cells and it's
leaving you a more even canvas to put
that tanner
on so as your skin you know continues to
as the top layer of your skin continues
to basically flake off and redevelop and
this and that it's kind of all on the
same page I don't know if that makes
much sense but that's what you're
supposed to do and I would really advise
you to do that with this product also I
did put this on my face and I felt like
I got a little more tan on my face but
it definitely didn't want
as long as the tan on the rest we did
probably because I'm scrubbing on my
face and tans never last as well on my
face if they do upon the rest of my
bodies so basically in a nutshell this
is a good product this is a really good
tanner but I was not pleased with how
difficult it was to apply and getting a
streak-free tan you need to be really
really careful because this will show up
on your skin after one application
especially after that 24 hours you are
going to have a decent tan they say you
can apply it two to three more times you
would get really dark after three times
a week on this I've only applied it once
a week so I think you're going to like
it if you if you want to try it but just
be really really careful about how you
put it on so thanks so much and
exfoliate thank you again for watching
this video on the Kardashian glamour tan
and stay tuned for more videos to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
