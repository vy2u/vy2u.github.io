tutorials lately has been the centre
parted hair with curls and volume and
how do you get that look so in this
video I'm going to show you step-by-step
how I do it I'm sure there are many
other strategies and if you have some
different tricks that may work for you
or might work better than the way I'm
doing them feel free to comment below
but this is just the way that it's been
working for my hair and just a little
disclaimer I do have pretty layered up
long hair my hair is coming down here
and I have layers that are pretty short
right up in this whole area so you may
have a different turn out or a different
outcome from this look if your hair is
all one length or if you have you know a
different texture here than mine mine is
naturally straight and very fine so I
have to do some different strategies to
sort of boost it up a little bit so
you'll see that in this video and real
quickly some of the products that I'll
be using I have my Hot Tools Helen of
Troy curling iron here it's just sort of
a kind of like a medium sized I think
this might be about a 1 a 1 inch or just
a little bigger so that works well for
me just to get it getting curls that I
mean sometimes when i use a really big
curling iron the curls just don't last
for me so i'm using that i'm using my
gut to be fantastic instant collagen
infusion non aerosol hairspray you'll
want something that can kind of boost up
the volume of your hair that's what i'm
using another kind of hairspray to just
sort of set the look tresemme the trade
to hairspray works great for me there
also want a cone that you can part your
hair with and tease it with and then
either if you don't like using your comb
to sort of calm down the teased areas a
little pin like this you can find that
beauty supply stores or drug stores to
kind of go through and
mint teas back down to a normal level so
yeah those are the products i'm going to
be using in this video i hope you enjoy
it i hope it's fairly easy to follow
this is actually the first hair tutorial
i'm doing here in my new bathroom so i'm
still getting used to lighting i'll try
to make improvements as I as we go along
but hope you get something down this
video and thanks for watching step one
is to obviously do this on dry hair so
make sure your hair is dry when you
begin then I'm going to take a
volumizing product and some of you might
have certain things that you like to use
better than others but lately I'm
actually been using this got to be
fantastic instant collagen infusion non
aerosol hairspray so and this strikes me
as more of a volumizing hairspray than
you know a really solid hold hairspray
so what I'll do once my hair is dry I
just kind of lift up sections of it and
kind of spritz this in right at the
roots and then kind of you know really
get it in there with my heat really just
give your hair a little more body and
stuff so get that in there then next
step is going to be to just part your
hair in the center and this will
basically be the foundation for the look
so on you know I take a comb kind of go
to my nose or you can do this you know
not perfectly in the sand I've got
layers going up you know both sides in
my hair I've got very short layers like
this and then of course down to the very
bottom right down here so I'm going to
basically curl each side and I usually
just will take my hair get it on each
side of my shoulder and then I start
curling in a backward motion from my
face on each side so I'm going to be
using my curling iron here basically
pulling out the top shortest section of
hair and then kind of go like I'm just
going to curl it away from my face so
get it in there hold it for a bit and
then you've got a real springy curl
there and I just kind of once I get it
out of the curling iron I just kind of
tried to direct it back a little bit so
whatever you can do there will help you
out and then you know don't worry about
really getting a brush down at this
point will let those curls
set and not really mess with them while
they're still hot after the curling I so
now I finished curling this whole sign
and before I start messing with this
these curls a whole lot I'm going to
spritz it with an aerosol hairspray
that's kind of going to lock in those
curls a little better i love the
Tresemme a trade to hairspray I just
think it works best for me whether I'm
finishing a style or sometimes like in
this stage of the game where I'm trying
to lock in something I'm done with them
now I'm going to start on this other
side here so that entails basically once
again pulling out the the layer getting
it here in your curling iron and then
curling it back away from your face and
so I'm going to continue to do that all
over and then you know kind of reach
around and make sure all of my back
layers have gotten curled and then we'll
go on with the styling from there all
right guys I have just finished curling
this time of my hair now and I sprayed
it with some hairspray to kind of help
lock in the curl and now at this point
we begin the styling process and I think
this sometimes can be the trickiest part
in getting the look you want with center
parted wavy or curly hair so basically
my hair is down to about here it's kind
of hard for me because this is I'm
actually up on my toes right now to show
you this um but I really want to keep
you know the amount of curl that I've
got in the length of my hair here so one
way to do that is to just kind of run
your fingers through it and instead of
going through it with a brush just kind
of go through it with your fingers this
helps loosen some of the curls from the
curling iron and but it sometimes
brushing can kind of really take away
too much so basically and the length of
your hair just kind of run your fingers
through it then when we're talking about
the top part of our hair here's where we
really got you know some sort of funky
directions going on so I do sometimes go
through the top layer with a comb
combing back like this and this really
kind of starts to get the look I'm after
but we still for me anyway I want more
body past this point if you want it
really loose this can still be a really
pretty good way to go with it but a lot
of the questions I receive our how you
get that look and get the body without
looking like you've got hair you know
out to here so that's we're going to
tack
next so basically what I'm first going
to do you can see my part going all the
way to the back here we're going to kind
of we want to keep pretty much that part
going but right here in the crown we're
going to lift up some hair okay so
basically we're going to lift up an
amount of hair going right here
basically right where my finger is
that's how much hair I'm lifting up I
know it's kind of hard because my hair
is dark this lighting isn't the greatest
and so it's kind of hard to tell exactly
what I'm doing so I'm trying to describe
it as well as I can so we're lifting
that up and then we're going to spray
right behind it just really lightly and
then I'm going to take the comb that I
used to tease my hair with and we're
just going to put the comb in the hair
and pull down just like that a few times
and so that is one way we're going to
build that body with this look is to
getting it up there in the crown okay
that's going to improve in a moment but
we are going to go ahead and finish the
teasing now you see we've got a section
this much on each side and for that I'm
going to tease that not so much on the
back but rather on the side so pull up a
section of that hair about like this
okay and then I'm going to spray the
side that I'm going to tease and then
we're teasing this just like that and
you just pull your comb downward and now
we've got some teas here there give it a
little spritz of hairspray after you've
done it and again on the other side
repeat now you've got a really absurd
looking style I'm going to give it
another spray here I mean that's one
thing that helps my fine hair have
volume is really using some hairspray if
you've got thicker hair you may not need
to use as much but this is what I've you
know through trial in here have learned
with my hair type then I'm going to take
one of these little styling pins or you
could use a comb if you want it to
really go down drastically from this but
one of these pins you know you can find
these at sally beauty supply they're
just great for going through your hair
and not taking out too much of the
teased area so as you can see
I'm kind of directing it in the
direction I want my hair to go so I'm
going over the area I teased in the back
and over this area that I teased in the
sides and the sides can be you know kind
of a real pain at times but since you've
gone over with the curling iron you can
see I'm just kind of gearing it back in
that direction and then so one one thing
you can do with this is obviously like
we were doing comb through it but also
use it to boost the hair back up okay so
that's one thing I'm doing here pulling
it back kind of getting it turning away
from my face and I kind of want to
create just that little bit of gap right
here between my head and the hair right
there just to sort of make my face look
really open and not to cover it up by
the hair not kind of swallowed up by the
hair and so go ahead once you kind of
got in your sides how you want them give
them a spray of hairspray and you know
I've got all the hair kind of turning
gently away and of course a little more
curl towards the bomb count going with
the comb as well sometimes that helps me
with the sides just because they are a
little more difficult and then I'm
getting a little spray in there to
create that little gap for my face and
then spray all over alright guys so
hopefully this gives you some ideas on
how to wear the center parted wavy
hairdo especially if you have layers and
you don't have a lot of body and you're
trying to really create that volume eyes
look while your hair is just parted
right down the middle so hopefully this
gives you some good ideas thank you so
much for joining me and for requesting
this look and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
