out from the Kardashians and it's called
chroma Beauty I have a couple things
from that line that I picked up at Ulta
is this set called shebang quick
transformations the other is this
mascara which I got separately called
stroke of midnight I'd be fun in this
video to just show you how these
products worked and then provide my
little review of it all see the
eyeshadow application of this this kit
also comes with a double-ended sponge
tip applicator which actually isn't bad
but I just opted to use my brushes you
also will see this eyeliner in action
just a basic pencil liner and the eye
lashes as well as as I said this mascara
so here is my tutorial take this sort of
pearly shade right here and a flat
eyeshadow brush going to just sort of
dab that over the inner corner and bam
there's your highlight and then I'm
gonna pull that inward about halfway in
on the eyelid too next I'm going to this
shade on the end it's kind of like a
dusty purpley taupe type color almost
and it doesn't go on quite as dark as it
appears in the palette but I'm going to
just Pat that on the rest of my eye here
so you can see you know it's giving us a
little shimmer but it's just not very
dark I'm going to this darkest shade in
the palette it's a plum and it still has
some ship taking like a really flat kind
of slim eyeshadow brush so I can have a
lot of control here and I'm going to Pat
this on the outer corner I'm creating
kind of an edge with this look by just
getting some shadow on the tip of this
brush and pulling upward like towards
the eyebrow is where it's pointing to
and then just fill in that area here
just wedging the brush into your crease
and you can just continue to pull that
inward a little bit there then I'm using
just a full crease brush to blend that
out a little bit and then I'm taking
this sort of
and berry burgundy shade and I'm gonna
pick some of that up with the same brush
and with that I'm just gonna go up above
this darkest color giving a little bit
of a fade effect I guess and finally I'm
gonna top off the look with that same
light shade and that's gonna go directly
under the eyebrows now for the eyeliner
this is just a standard black eyeliner
pencil here that I'm going to go all
across my upper lash line width and let
me tell you this is not very creamy or
particularly easy to work with dragging
it across you're not getting much color
you're going back over certain areas is
just a pain it's actually a couple of
layers across my upper lash line is just
not very dark you're gonna be doing
false lashes and false lashes come as
part of this kit you really want to lay
down like a liquid liner that says dark
as that lash band otherwise you can tend
to see the end and that's what you're
getting here so I mean I wanted to stick
to what was pretty much in the kit here
but this is not a great base for a false
life is I would almost always take
liquid but this pencil just is not that
dark so I am gonna go under the eye a
little bit with this just on the outer
part here next I'm going to curl my
lashes and then I'm using the chroma
stroke of midnight false lash look extra
volume mascara this was just sold
individually I got it in addition to the
kit and you can see here it's a pretty
large sized rubber brush mascara the
bristles are pretty short not a super
like slick wet formula and it builds up
really quickly on your lashes almost too
quickly and it gets kind of clumpy it
doesn't do a lot of lengthening and so
it doesn't have a lot of separation
either so I'm not a fan of this mascara
see there are some clumps going on here
it's just not a real pretty look I don't
love putting this on my lower lashes but
because it is something I'm sure
you and reviewing for you today I'll put
it on there and you can see it's just
not it's really a pain on the lower
lashes because you want those to look
really just nice and natural so we're
going to do these lashes and I am going
to trim off just a little bit here at
the end because they're just a little
long left to right for my eye so I'm
going to do that I'm going to apply my
Revlon precision lash glue I've just
centered up my fingers on the center of
the lash band and then I'll Center that
up with the middle of my eye here and
then just attach each end like I said
I'd love to be laying this down on top
of some liquid liner but that doesn't
come with this I do like these lashes I
think that's a nice style I think it's
great for like a dramatic kind of night
out and I'm just gonna apply a little
more mascara just to make sure those are
kind of bonded together more step with
the eye shadow I almost forgot to do it
I'm taking this dark shade here with a
pencil brush we're going under the eye
and just kind of going on top of what we
put the liner where we put the liner
there to make it a little more smoking
I'm taking this bronzy shade take that
under the inner part here kind of a
smoky effect there under the eyes so as
I look at the finished look I mean I'm
happy with it I like the way it turned
out but when you think about it in the
context of buying this kit you know is
it worth it I mean I like the eyeshadows
I like the texture I mean here's a look
at some swatches of let's see they're
all super shimmery to the point of being
pretty metallic I like the colors I
don't think they're all that unique and
having tried this now I mean I wouldn't
go back and repurchase this just because
I kind of like the eyeshadows you know
because the sponge tip obviously we can
all come up with those in other places
the liner was a real dud the drugstore
liners like Maybelline master drama that
are retractable that go on they just
glide across your eyelid this was really
old school outdated the eyeliner in my
opinion I did love the lashes and I know
they do sell the lashes individually
really
like the style I love how it was
combined long lashes and also the
shorter one so you get thickness and
Lane I'm not impressed with the mascara
this was supposed to be faux lash look
full body mascara and I really felt like
it didn't separate the lashes near
enough to make them look like false
lashes curious what else is part of this
look I used my Tarte blush in peacefull
so kind of that glowy peach colored
blush and using my NYX lip gloss in
sweetheart was it worth the $10 I paid
for this and about $15 I paid for this I
don't think so considering the only
thing out of this that I would want to
go back and purchase again would be the
false eyelashes thank you so much for
watching I hope the video was
informative for those of you who have
been wondering about this new makeup
line I know for sure it's at Ulta people
have told me they founded it came are
even so thanks again and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
