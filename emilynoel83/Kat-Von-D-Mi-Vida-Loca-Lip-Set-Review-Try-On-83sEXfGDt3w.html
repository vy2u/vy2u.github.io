review with you on the Kat Von D me vida
loca lipstick set it comes with one full
size lipstick and then seven mini
lipsticks that studded kiss lipsticks
and let me just say this I don't feel
like any opportunity to review something
it's like a wasted opportunity even if I
turn out to not like the product so much
I still feel like it's time well spent
because I'm sharing information with you
and hopefully it helps someone but I've
got to say if I took maybe a closer look
at exactly what was included in this set
online or did a little more digging on
what was in here I might have skipped
this one I do find this to be a long
wearing lipstick formula and it's nice
that there's such a variety of shades
and finishes but for me even I feel like
the variety of shades just goes a little
far out of my spectrum just in terms of
what I'm really gonna use I mean I had a
heck of a time trying these on I thought
it was fun to see what a light you know
matte lilac look like on my lips or a
sparkly charcoal gray realistically I'm
probably not gonna wear those shades out
of the house too often but you know it's
all a personal preference thing so some
of you might watch this video and be
like yeah finally you know lipstick set
that really goes out there with its
shades because I've got a couple of
other lip color collections that keep it
very safe I'd say there are two maybe
three shades that I really like in this
collection but even with that being said
I still think if I had the option to
splurge on a lipstick like just a single
lipstick I don't think I would choose
one of the studded kiss lipsticks I
think it would probably go for bite or
maybe if I were going for a matte I
might go Charlotte Tilbury because even
with the shades that I like in this set
I'm not completely obsessed with them
and I'll get into that more shade by
shade packaging wise they're absolutely
adorable and that is probably the thing
that just sucked me into buying this
without even really looking at what
colors I was getting specifically the
seven mini lipsticks look like this
they've got this cute like all over
black studded X
terior I think it's adorable you know
the lipstick is rather small but it's
like they still gave you substantial and
really cute outer packaging this is your
full-size which is white and I think
that's beautiful I'm not particularly a
fan of the color they put in here I
really wish I would have loved this one
because it is full size but not so much
and as far as the layout of shades this
is a limited edition shade this white
one and then the orange and the gunmetal
are labeled as new and all the rest just
have their names they don't say anything
additional so I guess they're already
just regular parts of the study kiss
line let's jump in the first one I'll
talk about is the shade Noble that's the
one I've been wearing throughout the
video um it's a matte nude this is
described as a melody of matte petal
pink nude and I do think it's a pretty
nude I could see me wearing this
actually quite a bit
paired with different liners I'm just
wearing it completely flat on its own
it's not my favorite look but this would
be probably one of my favorites of the
kit I think it has really nice staying
power like even through eating and
drinking I still continue to see this on
my lips I think these Kat Von D mattes
can feel a little dry in application I
don't know I feel like I have to work at
them just a little bit more to get a
nice smooth color it's not that they're
not going on pigmented or opaque but
it's just that the texture of them can
pull a little bit on the lips the next
one is called sex err and this is an
iridescent hot pink shade really really
right like Barbie pink with a sheen the
color just to look at it I think it's
really pretty and I loved how they were
able to pull off the iridescent effect
without actually adding any bits of
sparkle but unless I'm mixing this in
with something that allows it to be just
a little more muted I'm probably not
gonna wear this a whole heck of a lot
maybe in the summer I might have a
little different angle toward this the
next shade is one of my favorites it's
called Bachelorette it's described as
reddish fuchsia and I think that's a
great description just so much red in
this shade with just the splash of pink
and I like the formula because I feel
like it's more of a cream there are
really only two shades in this
collection that I would identify as
cream and I think they
on with the most ease and I think they
feel the best on the lips and it's kind
of sad there's only two like that in
this collection next up we've got wolves
mouth and this is a metallic berry so
they've taken one thing I like which is
berry but one thing I don't really like
in lipstick which is metallic finish and
put them together so I love the tone of
this I really love the color I just
don't like this finish it really
attracts attention to any lines any
dryness crack there is problems you may
have on your lips one way I might
salvage this lipstick is by topping it
with some sort of gloss cuz I really do
like the color I just am NOT a fan of
the finish and wearing it on its own
that way now coven is a matte lavender
you can say I don't have a lipstick like
this in my collection I might have a
liquid lipstick somewhere but not just a
classic matte lavender lipstick and as I
was saying with the matte finishes I do
think they pull a little bit on the lips
they're pigmented it's extremely opaque
I mean this is not sheer a bit and
totally matte as advertised but you just
gotta ask yourself am I gonna wear a
shape like that very often now these
last two are the shades that were
labeled new and one of them is halo this
is one of the two in the whole set that
I was thinking are like a cream formula
this is described as a high-octane
Orange and it goes on really easily has
a nice kind of slip to it across the
lips and I like this shade this would
make my top three probably in this set
because truly in the summer time I
wouldn't mind going there with full-on
orange and it feels nice it's a good
texture so then we've got neon and this
is the gunmetal shimmer roll that
beautiful bean footage here's that stuff
going on it is shimmery very shimmery
with an actual identifiable glittery
sparkle to it not just a sheen not just
a metallic kind of glow after putting
this on I'm not gonna lie I felt like
kind of a badass but I feel very safe
here with you guys and in my makeup room
and out in the open I'm not sure how
much I'd really use this one no I kind
of am sure how much I'd use it I
wouldn't use it very much wait we do
have one more we've got the full-size
and this is
the one that's called gold blooded so
this is a red with gold shimmer in it it
seems to behave like a matte lipstick it
goes on my lips a little bit easier than
some of the other matte finishes but
it's got this golden sparkle happening
and I kind of dig the retro red like
overall color but I just don't like the
sparkle in this I don't know if I showed
but this is the way they come in the box
so I absolutely love the packaging on
these and I think it was fun to get to
experiment with these lipsticks it
really is fun to sit down and try on a
bunch of different shades and I did
discover several that I really liked
Noble the nude shade Bachelorette which
is that really pinkish red and I also
like the orange what was that called
halo I thought that was actually really
pretty and a beautiful texture the
others as I described I either have a
color problem with them or I have a
texture issue and if I would have really
researched this a bit more I might have
skipped it but I am still glad to be
able to sit here show these to you
hopefully this was informative for you
because you could see no I'm not so sure
I want that or that is 100% up my alley
and I'm gonna ask for it for Christmas
so thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
