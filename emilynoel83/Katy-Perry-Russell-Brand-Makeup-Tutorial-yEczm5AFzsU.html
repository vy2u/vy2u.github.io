makeup tutorial but what about her
husband Russell Brad well maybe we could
combine the two you mean a two-in-one to
Tori and I could show everyone how to
get my scruffing my frizzy hair and all
that I could show everyone how to get
the perfect winged outliner and hot pink
lips well I say we do it hey guys thanks
a lot for joining me for this tutorial I
have got to thank my sister Kelly aka
pup who gave me the idea to really do an
out-there
Halloween type tutorial but really just
something to kind of do do something
totally different than what I've seen
here on YouTube and that is basically
showing how to do two looks but not
doing them separately but doing them on
the same face and it's Katy Perry and
her husband Russell Brand and they've
been in the news of course a lot lately
recently got married and all that and I
just thought okay I have dark hair maybe
I can pull this off maybe for the first
time ever I will try to give myself some
whiskers you know and really make myself
look like a man and let's see if it's
even you know if I could even pull it
off and so that's what I've tried to do
this is more for fun than anything I'm
not a professional I'm just having fun
with the products I have on hand here so
I've used some unusual things to get you
know this is eyeliner here it was just
whatever I had that I could use that I
thought could achieve this look I went
ahead and did it so I hope you really
enjoy it once again it's just I mean
it's not really what the concept that
you would go out and wear both looks at
once you of course could or if you
wanted to do the Russell Brand or just
the Katy Perry you would see in one
video how to do them both so that's kind
of the mindset behind this thought it
would be a lot of fun and I did have a
blast putting it together so to see all
the steps keep on watching
so all I've applied right now is a
little bit of moisturizer and primer all
over my face and I've applied foundation
on each side you may notice I'm not sure
if you can tell maybe a little bit this
side of my face is a little bit deeper
and it's a more natural finished
foundation I'll get into that when I get
on to Russell side but for Katie's side
it's lighter and it's more of a maybe
slightly more coverage foundation I use
this from Coastal Scents it's the under
cover high definition foundation in st0
3 she really has that porcelain flawless
look so that's what I'm trying to do
here I'm also gonna be using a fairly
light concealer it's the Kat Von D
tattoo concealer in light and so just to
get a little bit of that you know on
your fingers and really take care of any
dark circles because she really doesn't
have that or I mean it doesn't show but
that's the that's the key I think so
get it around your eye area really just
take care of any discoloration on your
face it has a slight hint of a glow in
the picture I'm looking at so I'm going
to use my Revlon Photoready powder in
light/medium to duplicate the kind of
pinky berry look on Katie's cheeks I'm
gonna be taking my NYC flushable cream
stick and the shade is wild berry so I'm
gonna get a little bit of that on my
fingers and just kind of focus it on the
apples of my cheeks and for staying
power and an added pop I'm gonna take my
Mac blush in dolly mix it has kind of a
little bit of luminosity to it and it
looks very bright in the container but
it comes off somewhat sheer but it'll
give us that pink glow so just top off
your cream blush kind of you I'm going
on the apples of my cheeks and then just
kind of fading whatever's left upward
just a little bit of lips I'm looking at
a picture of Katie where she has super
hot pink lips so I'm going to be using
my revlon colorburst lipstick in fuchsia
and I'm just going to apply it straight
from the tube right here and to brighten
it up even more I'm taking my Mac dare
to wear lip glass and the color is dare
to dare and it's kind of kind of a
limited edition
shade I believe and it has this blueish
undertone it's just really pretty and
it's gonna just make an interesting
little top off here for this bright
shade for Katy Perry's eye makeup I'm
first gonna prime my lid with my Urban
Decay primer potion it's gonna kind of
neutralize the lid and give the shadow
some extra staying power taking this kit
from hourglass cosmetics it's the shade
name is prism and I'm going to be using
this lightest blue shade all over the
lid so just using a flat eyeshadow brush
just Pat that on all over then using a
medium shadow brush there's a darker
shade in here you can see kind of a
sparkly bluish black you get a little
bit of that on your brush and apply just
a little bit of that in your natural
crease area so not gonna really take it
out too far just gonna get it right in
here then take a fluffy brush and just
blend it all out next up we're gonna
take an eye marker you can use any black
black liquid liner you like I'm using
the mark my eyes it's a really jumbo eye
a marker from la girl and this is really
great for getting that cat eyed effect
winged out liner kind of a retro pin-up
girl style look so we're gonna go
starting at the inner corner it may help
you to look down into a mirror and we're
going to make sort of a thick line with
this all the way across our upper lash
line so I sometimes like to go a little
bit above the actual lash line and then
you can kind of go back and fill it in
just like that and it's almost like you
know you outline your picture and then
you color it in so that's sort of the
mentality there it's a little bit easier
and so once you've got your natural lash
line covered there we're gonna think
about winging it out and she's got a
pretty prominent winged out look here so
I'm gonna kind of see where my eye kind
of comes down like that
we're gonna start taking it actually
straight across and winging it up almost
pointing it out towards you know if you
were to connect a line there it would
hit the edge of your
Brown and then connect it up from the
bottom and you've got your wing and then
once again just fill it in and there you
go using a liner brush I'm going to take
some of that same light blue metallic
sort of shade that we applied all over
the lid and I'm going to put some just
under the eye so that's kind of got that
little slight pop of color nothing too
dark we're really putting the focus on
them I'm gonna curl my eyelashes and
apply a couple of coats of my voluminous
carbon black mascara to my upper lash
just applied my mascara and I also threw
on a strip of false eyelashes there just
to add a little more drama to that upper
lash line so this is very heavily
made-up on the upper lash line but
pretty light on the bone final finishing
touch just to keep the eyes really
bright that wide-eyed bright eyed look
that she has that same liner that I used
on my waterline I'm just taking it a
little bit right around the inner tear
duct area just to brighten that up as
well it just really makes the eyes pop
and it'll be a nice contrast from the
other side
now while katie has this you know
flawless kind of you know rosy glow to
the cheeks a very feminine very precise
makeup application obviously to get
Russell's look it's more about the hair
the facial hair and you know just kind
of getting highlighting that bone
structure and adding a little more color
to the skin so we're going to try to do
this now this is gonna be a fun
experiment we'll see how it building I
did actually right at the start I put on
my Mac mineralized skinfinish foundation
and it's in a slightly darker shade this
is this is actually NC 40 so I have NC
40 on this side and like an ivory
colored foundation on the other side
because in the picture I'm referring to
and in several others that I saw he
generally has just a little bit deeper
skin tone than Katy does so also
something that's very important we're
going to be using a bronzer in this next
step and it needs to be matte if we're
talking about men you know there is
really no chance that they're going to
you know go be walking around with
sparkle on their face so matte bronzer
are very important if the chocolate
Soleil bronze are one of my favorites
from Too Faced you can see how dark that
is so deep deep tone bronzer take a
somewhat fluffy brush and right now
we're just going for deepening up the
complexion a little bit and obviously if
you were doing a full face tutorial on
him or a full face look using him you
would put this all over but concentrated
up on the temples where the Sun would
naturally hit also you know top things I
want to exaggerate a little bit more is
more this chiseled cheekbone jawline
area so going back to the bronzer where
as first we just put kind of a wash of
color all over I'm taking a smaller
brush of a blush brush and I'm kind of
seeing right here where this hits on me
and deepening that up alright you may be
wondering what's on my hand here this is
actually a mixture of a dark brown
foundation and and keep in mind I'm
keeping this like a brownish black okay
that's the color of the scruff on his
face so
st 15 is the shade that I've got very
very dark and then I'm using actually
this is a black gel liner this one's
from Jane any kind will do I used a
little spatula kind you can get from
Sally beauty supply kind of scrape some
of that out on my hand applied a pump of
some random moisturizer and then use
kind of a makeup sponge to blend it all
together there on my hand and you may
need to keep reapplying a little
moisturizer to keep this kind of moist
then I'm using a stippling brush see the
look a stippling brush gives you is lots
of little points all in one and this is
going to give us the effect of basically
whisk kind of this five o'clock shadow
or you know however it may be it varies
from time to time that you see him but
we're gonna just stipple that right on
here I'm kind of focusing it basically
you've got your you know your top of
your cheekbone here focusing it down on
the lower part and don't rub back and
forth back and forth it will not give
you the stippled effect this will give
you the exact look of whiskers basically
of scruff stubble whatever you want to
call it a little bit more concentrated
right down here right on the you know
right around that jawline area and you
can take it down a little further even
you know guys gonna get that down in
here is we're gonna get a little bit
deeper interest dot it like that I'm
kind of basically cramming my brush
together he has a definite look of a
mustache as well so same principle
you're gonna pinch your brush together
and go right above the lip and really
just dot that on the big key to the look
now is cleaning it up because obviously
we've kind of gone sort of liberally all
over this area and it's not you know all
completely covered he has little
patterns little places that are bare so
I'm what I'm doing is I'm taking some
eye makeup remover and a q-tip and just
moisten that q-tip and kind of pay
attention to I mean whatever picture
you're referring to it's going to be
slightly different but there's
definitely a gap above
his lip so take the eye makeup remover
use it just kind of like an eraser to
create that gap above the lip we also
want to clear a good gap under the lip
right here next up our eyebrows and this
is going to be difficult because my
eyebrows have a high arch and his are
very straight across and very close to
the eyes so what we're just gonna try to
do here is basically pull mine down a
little bit by really brushing them
downward and then I'm going to take a
dark brownish black pencil and use that
in short strokes to fill in and it will
give the appearance of kind of hair it
just has very very bushy thick brows so
have fun with it fill it in make them
make them big alright guys for the hair
on this you notice my hair was in
rollers here on the Katy Perry side I
really wanted to get her classic you
know kind of wave going on and so to do
that you know just curl your hair with
the curling iron pop them over some
velcro rollers or those plastic rollers
and when you take them out you'll get
lots of volume at the roots and just
this pretty finished wave when you take
them out brush through them they'll all
kind of hang together and then I just
popped a little flower in my hair here
but I just thought it'd really set off
the look for the Russell Brand side I
mean I took a curling iron and I just
kind of loosely ran it through in most
cases not all the way to the ends I
think he's got some natural curl to his
hair so I went up in my layers and I did
that in kind of a messy sloppy way I
kind of just roughed it up a little bit
and I took some of my husband's like
hair gel type product and I just kind of
ran through it here and kind of got this
laying down a little bit got a little
bit of a greasy almost look to it and I
also took I have obviously my hair on
this side is you can't really see up
against this black shirt but my hair on
this side is its original length and
over here it's shorter it's like up to
right about here so to do that I
basically took my hair kind of looped it
up under and just clipped it back in
here back
behind my neck and when you do that I
mean you're totally concealing a lot of
the hair and giving yourself a new light
so this was such an interesting process
to try for the first time ever to
transform myself into a man to develop
the scruff and the you know just the
different look and then have a totally
you know more my style tutorial on this
side so for fans of Katy Perry and
Russell Brand are people who just you
know may not be fans but just wanted to
see this and thought to stop by thank
you so much for taking the time to watch
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
