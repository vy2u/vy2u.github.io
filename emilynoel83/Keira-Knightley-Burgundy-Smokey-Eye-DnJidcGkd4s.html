hey everyone in this video I'm going to
show you how to get a burgundy smokey
eye and when you first think of that you
think oh cool that sounds like it would
be fun but this is kind of a hard look
for me to come up with because you don't
want to look like you're sick or you're
tired and you're when you're working
with Reds around the eye you have to be
very careful so all the more reason for
a tutorial on this sort of look and what
initially inspired me was actually this
shot in all you magazine of keira
knightley and she has this burgundy
smoky eye and they recommended a few
products none of which i happen to have
so I had to kind of improvise with what
I have on hand but i think it's gorgeous
I think that's a wonderful holiday look
but it's just a matter if you know how
do you recreate that so what i did i'm
using the i believe is called the fall
festival palette from Coastal Scents it
happen to have pretty much all the
shades I needed and if you don't have
this palette there are definitely you
know duplicates that you can work with
I'm sure but a red a burgundy and a
brown are key shadow shapes for this the
brown is going to be very key in keeping
this look a little bit neutralized and
not to read read but I hope you enjoyed
this I did have fun putting it together
and I think it would be a wonderful
holiday look for any big events
celebrations whatever it's just a very
special look so I hope you like it as
much as I do and keep on watching first
thing I did I applied a primer all over
my eyelid today I just happened to use
the Too Faced shadow insurance and then
I'm going to grab my fall palette from
Coastal Scents these are all kind of
shimmery shades except for one here
which happens to be the exact match
shade I need for this look so we'll get
to that one in a minute but first I'm
going to be using this red shade right
up here so we're kind of going to be
using just to let you know this shade
that's sort of you know a nice true read
this one that's more of a burgundy with
some purple tones to it and then this
brown right next door is actually going
to help us to tone down the look a
little bit and keep it more um more
wearable I think and a little less like
oh my gosh you know my eyes look red and
sickly so there's a fine line with this
look I'm hopefully going to show you how
to use
so going with that red first the one
right up here get some of that on a flat
eyeshadow brush and just apply that all
over the lid other shades that are
similar to this would be Mac cranberry
and also there's a shade from NYX called
rust that is just a whole lot like it
I'm taking a medium-sized crease brush
this one's my Smashbox number 15 and
just kind of going over that shade I
didn't add any product to the brush but
I'm just kind of using this to buff it
up towards the crease a little bit
there's lots of layering with this look
just because we just have to come up
with just the right shade of red to make
this work so I'm going down to the
corner to this brown that I mentioned
getting a little bit of that on nearly
any brush you want to work with I'm
using something like a medium crease
brush that's small enough for me to
maneuver here and I'm just kind of
basically dusting this over the top of
that red the result is still red but you
can see it's very much toned down except
take a liner brush or I would really
recommend kind of a smudger brush so
something that's just a little bit
thicker that we can use to get not a
very precise line under the eye but just
some shadow down there to create the
smokey effect so I'm going to the
burgundy shade right here kind of has
like I mentioned some purplish tones to
it and that's going to be what we use
under our I I feel like it's less red
than the shade we initially put on our
lid so it's going to really keep us from
looking too tired in the eye area that
kind of thing now we're going to take
that brown one more time and this is
kind of our neutralizing force in this
in this palette and just going to go
over that burgundy here and like I said
it's kind of an interesting thing the
burgundy is still going to shine just
dusting over I'm not being too precise
and I'm not keeping it right among the
lashes I'm letting it come down just a
little bit to the area right under my
eye and you can see with the crease as
well we didn't go out to really set out
to do any sort of certain crease thing
here we just took a brush that was a
little more medium size
you'll remember we were just kind of
pulling the shadows up a little bit and
that's what created that look now she's
got it definitely a matte highlight
going on so I'm going to clean off my
flat brush here and use the one matte
shade in this palette which happens to
be the one I need so this just all kind
of worked out just right it's kind of a
creamy matte white and for it with that
I'm just going up right under the brow
it's not going to see my natural at all
it's actually very much kind of like
your skin tone just really nice and
matte next step the liner with this look
clearly she has a black liner on water
line and it's not just you know dark I
mean it is rich and black so one of the
best ones i have for that it's very
creamy it's not maybe the best long long
lasting but i mean it really gives a
really creamy rich black look and it's
pencil perfect from l'oreal and so just
apply that right here on your waterline
for that glossy black look then there
appears to be a little bit of smudged
outliner kind of just under the eye so
this I'm really trying to keep right
among the lashes not nothing too drastic
here we don't want the appearance of you
know one straight black line but I'm
just bringing that down kind of not
really all the way to the inner corner
but I would say the outer half working
to about the midway point right here
that's kind of where I'm stopping with
that and I like my Maybelline define a
line for this purpose because it's
smudge Bowl but not to smudge able to
where I feel like it's running down on
my face later in the day but it's got
this nice little tip as well it's very
simple to work with just flip it over
and you can smudge out to look that with
the upper lash line i'm using maybelline
define a line as well it's not exactly
clear what she has done there but i mean
just to add some the look of more
thickness with our lashes I'm not
winging it out i'm just doing the outer
portion just going in about
three-quarters of the way so i stopped
right about there and just flip over and
or find another smudger that you like to
use and
that line as well to finish off this
look I'm going to apply two coats of my
L'Oreal voluminous carbon black mascara
to the upper lashes and if you really
wanted to add some more volume you could
take some individual lashes and get her
similar look and kind of glue those on
there as well and then for the lower
lash line maybelline lash discovery
because she clearly has those lashes
highlighted as well I've been asked why
you always use that on the lower lashes
and here's why the brush is absolutely
tiny and it I don't have issues with
this smudging on me at all and you all
know that's very important for what you
put on your lower lashes so that's why I
use this I feel like it doesn't overload
the bottom lashes but it gives some
definition and it lasts all day so I'm
going to go through those steps on
myself and then I'll join you with the
other key products for this look alright
everyone here is my finished look for
the Keira Knightley inspired burgundy
smokey eye this really was a challenging
look to put together just in terms of
using the burgundy shades but not making
them look too severe or you know
something that makes your eyes look like
oh is she sick is she tired you know
what I mean so I tried to keep it really
smoky and just really appropriate for
the season and I think it's just a great
holiday low something I'm definitely
going to use but something I really
really need to stress when I was doing
the eyes until I got the lips on i
thought you know something's just
missing this does not you know this
doesn't really feel like them and i look
i might want to wear but then I got the
lips on there and it just pulled
everything together so i think a deep
lip is very important for this look I
know there are tons of people that just
love the nude lips and I do too i think
it looks great most of the time but for
this there's something about the deep
red lip that makes this look seem so
finished and polished and like okay this
was intentional i meant to do this and
it just looks very pulled together this
way so the products i use were a
lipstick from flirt called elixir and
it's a very deep red and i recommend
kind of blotting your lips after that
because it has sort of a glossy finish
so block that blot it off and then I
kind of defined my lips with this liner
from coastal scents and it is in current
and to swatch that for you it's very
deep but it gives just the perfect
definition for this lip look and then
also the cheeks she obviously has very
beautiful sculpted cheeks but there's a
general color theme I think you want to
stay with for a contour I went with kind
of a warm contour I mean right in here
that I thought really helped my
cheekbones stand out and that is my
covergirl falling apart governor
tweakers blush and golden pink but for
the apples of the cheeks something Rosie
that sort of echoes these these reddish
tones I think elf blush in blushing Rose
this is a studio blush it's got some
glow to it put that on there and I think
it really pulls the whole look together
so thank you so much for tuning in for
this video I hope you enjoyed this kind
of my take on a burgundy smokey eye and
let me know if you try it out have a
great day and I'll see you next time
