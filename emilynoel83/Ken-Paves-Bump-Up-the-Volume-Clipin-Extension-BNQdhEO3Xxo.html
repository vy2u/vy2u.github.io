going to be on this extension from Ken
pavis and Jessica Simpson it's called
bump up the volume hair extension it
comes in a box like this it's all in a
little hair net which is in there but
it's a clip in extension that clips in
in four places three Clips across the
top and one clip in the back which is
right about here under my hair and then
I if I want to boost that up or you know
wear it more natural I have that option
so that's a really neat way to create
volume but you also create a nice length
here as well so it comes in a variety of
colors and I'll have the website
information in the sidebar this one is a
21 inch extension and my color is I
believe dark chocolate so it's a very
very dark brown almost hinging on a
blackish
sort of color and I'm just going to walk
you through step-by-step how to pull
your hair up and clip it in there
another thing I want to make note of
what this extension is it can be curled
or straightened it is synthetic hair but
it can be curled or straight and depend
on how are you depending on how you want
to style it right now I just got kind of
natural sort of kind of turned under
look but if you want to see how to put
it in keep on long I wanted to point out
is how I store the extension when I'm
not using it I just take a hanger and
you could use clothespins or in this
case I'm just using like those hair
clips that you can use to just keep your
hair out of your face but that keeps it
you know really really nice and and you
could put it back in the box if you
wanted to but if you have a little extra
space somewhere in your house to hang
this it I just think it keeps it nice
and keeps it from like rubbing up
against things and keeps the hair in
good condition so before I put it on
guess I'm just going to unclip it and
I'm actually going to use these clips to
section off my hair so the bump up the
volume extension is really going to go
fairly high on your head maybe higher up
than you've put some extensions before
because not only is it a hair extension
that's gonna elongate your hair but it's
gonna affect the style in your crown so
you don't want to you know pull up a
huge section of hair here and then have
the bump in the back you want the bump
to be up top so I'm going to pull up
some hair
not too much but I'm in a kind of
section like that sort of on the top of
my head and just pull some of that hair
up and then I'm going to sort of just
twist it up and out of the way so now
I've gotten that very top layer of hair
out of the way if you can see sort of
where I've sectioned it off is just kind
of a you know a line right up here so if
I was going to pull my hair up kind of
high like on top of my head just that
top section we want to leave some hair
there at the crown area so you've got
that that all sectioned off then you're
going to take your extension which has
four different pressure sensitive Clips
here so you're just going to undo those
there's three across the top that you're
going to have to worry about and then
one at the bottom and the bottom one is
what's going to determine how much of a
bump you have so first off we're just
going to secure it at the top so I just
kind of keep my fingers on the outer
clips and go feel right where that part
is right the Division where I've pulled
up that first part of hair get the clips
in and just snap and then make sure the
middle one is kind of grabbing some hair
there and snap that and so then you've
got got your extension on and you kind
of feel around on the back where that
clip is and this is what you're going to
be able to push up or down if you can
see as I push it up more volume push it
down you have less volume so it's all up
to you you could just wear this normal
and not you know have any boost but if
you want it which is what it's designed
to do just take your hand back there
push the clip up as much as you want for
as much volume as you want
make sure it's grabbing some hair and
then just snap and you can see that I've
now got sort of a boost of volume there
in my crown and then what I'm going to
do with this hair just undo the hair you
pulled up pull it kind of straight up
high and I recommend giving this just a
little tease so when it goes over your
extension
especially if you have fine hair what
goes back over your extension it's going
to be completely undetectable so just
take a comb and maybe a little hairspray
first I'm just going to use my Tresemme
hairspray in the big bottle I'll go
through them so fast
still I'm just going to give it a couple
spritzes from behind and then just give
it a little tease there close to the
roots then flop it right down over that
extension and just kind of comb it down
right on top and you can kind of just
use your fingers to style that if you
want or use what I like to use is just a
little hair pin you can get these at
Sally's or probably Walmart just these
little pins that really make it easy to
style any hair that's been teased so
you're just pulling that down you can
see you've got a nice amount of volume
there in the crown from the extension
and not only is it giving you the the
hair there but you also have added
thickness down at the bottom and what's
really special about this extension is
it is synthetic but it's if the hair is
a certain quality that you can
straighten it or you can curl it up to a
certain amount of degrees so I'll have
that information in the sidebar and and
all the details on that but I have it
right now just kind of natural it's got
a little bit of a like turn under to it
but it's giving my hair a little more
thickness down here at the bottom where
it whereas before with my fine really
naturally straight hair it would have
just been a little more thin
so here's another look at our extension
there you can see you've got that you
know you can look at it 360 degrees and
you see more volume here it can move
around you know you can it's it's secure
in my on my head and again if you are
going through the day and maybe or maybe
you're doing like a nighttime look and
you are this fairly natural during the
day but you want even more of a boost
I tell you all you got to do is just
adjust your back clip there and just
make sure it's holding hair just kind of
it's it's like there are many combs and
you want to make sure that they're
grabbing hair and then you boost it up
and here you can see I've got even more
volume and what's great about this you
could wear the rest of your hair if you
wanted to wear this curly what I would
do is first before you start messing
with the extension curl your own hair
then just with your extension on the
hanger like I had it curl the extension
and then pop it on and you'll have big
voluminous curls as well so that's
really neat really neat quality for this
extension thank you so much for tuning
in for this tutorial and if you have
more questions about these extensions
let me know they're very simple to use
and to care for and I also had another
video on the 23 inch wavy extension so
if you want more information on that
I'll have the link in the sidebar thanks
