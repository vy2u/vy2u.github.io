tell you how to find good beauty
bargains what kind of got me onto this
idea was I think a lot of people look at
my videos in my collection and they
asked anything is like did you get all
that all at once or how did you get so
much stuff or whatever and the answer is
I really I don't get it all at once I
get it over a period of time and it also
is not very expensive stuff it's I
really look for bargains even some of
the high-end items I have I've been able
to get because I got them on sale
somehow and so I just wanted to tell you
I mean some of these things that I'm
going to tell you about our kind of
common sense but others are like oh you
know I never thought of it that way so
first and foremost if you're watching
this in your person who really sticks to
a lot of high-end items you really got
to keep an open mind about some of the
drugstore brands and there are certain
things in the drugstore in the dollar
stores that are really wonderful
products but you've just got to give
them a chance you know you can't write
them off and say oh I'm used to this
other thing so I won't try this because
I've tried enough things to know that
there are some high-end brands that are
beaten out by certain drugstore products
so just keep stay open-minded and don't
be afraid to try new things because
often times you'll wind wind up trying a
brand that maybe you've never even heard
of before but it turns out to be
something you really like so just one
thing I'd like to start everything off
with keep an open mind and as far as
shopping in stores um something to think
about is you may walk in there and think
well I like for example today I walked
into Walgreens and I didn't need a
bronzer or anything I didn't need um I
knew I didn't have to have it but yet
what they had on sale was half off on
the physician's formula bronzers and
those things run around twelve bucks so
to get one for six bucks is a pretty
good deal and so I figured well I'm
gonna run out eventually I love what
I've got and so
you know to get a really good quality
bronzer at a drugstore price for half
the price then normal is something you
want to jump on so even if you see you
know maybe you have a favorite lipstick
and you can tell it's being put on some
kind of clearance sale that's a cue that
it might be getting discontinued and you
might want to go ahead and snatch up
what's left even though you haven't run
out yet so just something to keep in
mind there also watch the ads watch the
store ads check online oftentimes you
can find out when a buy one get one is
coming up but say a CVS or Walgreens or
a store like that and that could be an
amazing deal because you can get another
example here the l'oreal bareMinerals
collection a lot of that stuff runs like
$12 for one mineral thing whether it's
their glow or the blush or the
foundation or whatever but well that's
why one get one free and you're getting
two for the price of one on something
like that and you can really take
advantage of those and you can also you
know don't just get say one item like
that and then the lower priced item is
always going to be the free item so keep
that in mind to get the most fair money
get a couple of higher priced items or
you know a couple of similar priced
items that way you're not just spending
all your money on the higher priced item
but so that's another thing and also
dollar stores dollar stores you can
always like you go to Dollar Tree and I
don't know if you guys everybody has a
Dollar Tree but that's in my area that's
the store where everything in the store
cost a dollar and a lot of times the
makeup they have there isn't just like
generic makeup or anything like that it
is stuff that's gotten discontinued
somehow or has been like specially
packaged and Big Lots Big Lots is a
makeup heaven for me because they won't
so often like these dollar stores will
do will have things that are still items
that are out in the stores right now
let's say certain kind of mascara you
like that is Lori Alex
something and they will have it in like
a specially packaged set like when the
store was doing a promotion and they put
two mascaras in one container and it was
like buy one get one free and they'll
knock the price down even further so you
gotta look out for those deals at Big
Lots Big Lots carries a lot of drugstore
brands and you can also find some
strangely really good deals there if
you're just looking around in their
regular makeup section also this time of
year Big Lots does like drugstore
closeout things where they'll get in a
lot of products from other drugstores
that they may not typically have on-hand
like I found a ton of great NYX stuff
just rummaging around there and it was
all like 20% off and then as the summer
goes on or as the week's go on however
long they have that stuff they keep
knocking off more and more percent off I
remember last year got down to like 80
percent off and I was still finding cool
stuff so just don't rule out those
stores because it's a great chance to
try things you know try out a new a new
color that you're not used to and you
might figure out that you really like it
but if you don't like it you haven't
spent all your money on that okay so
keep that in mind also online shopping
that was something I hadn't gotten into
too much until recently one thing that
I'm not going to necessarily recommend
because I haven't done it before but I
know that the opportunity is out there
on eBay
there are a lot of people that sell
massive quantities of makeup on there
and like unopened stuff like stuff
that's still packaged so you don't have
to worry whether or not you know who
used this lipstick you know that's kind
of weird
and you probably wouldn't want to do
that but um if you're looking for
something you really like and you know
they not everything's like a mask
quantity I know there are some
individual items that you could get
really really cheap on there so think
about that maybe just browse it sometime
just type in makeup and see what you
find another great site for super super
cheap stuff is elf eyes lips face comm
you can check
that and everything on that site is a
dollar except you'll find that their
mineral stuff and their body like
lotions and stuff like that it's a
little more expensive but the vast
majority of their makeup items are only
a dollar and some people talk about
having some issues ordering off their
website as far as the time it takes to
ship or some items are missing or
whatever I just can't I can't say I had
a problem I have had one time when it
didn't ship very quickly but they always
had the stuff that I want and I'm just
really happy to be getting all that for
a dollar so I like like okay you know I
can handle that but that's ultimate
beauty bargain website right there eyes
lips face comm and if also if you want
to look at some things that I prefer off
of that website you can check out my
video where I review a whole bunch of
elf products all in one video also a lot
of people love sephora.com have you ever
tried getting on there and in their
search box just typing on sale it'll pop
up every item on that website that has
been discounted in some way so that's
always neat to check out especially
before you start browsing through maybe
you're looking for a particular item
just check there really quick and see if
maybe something you were going to buy
has been marked down so another good
website is cherry culture calm there are
some pretty cheap brands on there that
are good quality they carry a lot of
different brands that maybe you're not
used to hearing about and then some that
you are like NYX and just different ones
that you can be pretty familiar with and
the other ones it's just fun to try try
a lip gloss I got like a 99-cent lip
plumper I don't remember the brand on
there but it was great probably gonna
review it sometime but so don't be
scared to shop online a little bit and
also my last tip and the reason why I
have a lot of the high-end products I
have is that I asked for makeup for
Christmas and I asked for it for my
birthday I let people know hey I'd love
to get some more Smashbox eyeshadow
so if you want to get me that for my
birthday that'd be great and you know
that's that may be what someone special
in your life you know maybe that's what
they want about the amount they would
want to spend on you and if you if your
passion is makeup then you're gonna
really enjoy that I understand some of
you watching maybe like what you know I
would never do that but I personally
would and I mean that's just what I like
and people know I'm gonna enjoy it
so I let people know if they're asking
what to buy you know direct them to
support dom or one of these other
websites and you have a very Merry
Christmas but that's about all I have to
share and let me know if you have any
questions and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
