this tutorial for People Magazine's 100
most beautiful people and this time the
look is Kim Kardashian she was on that
list in the magazine and I just thought
you know I thought all along that was
one that I would definitely have to do
because it's I mean her traditional look
the look you see her in a lot is very
very easy to understand what she's doing
she's got heavy liner on its kind of
smoked out a little bit a light lip you
know kind of slightly bronzed skin but
it's not overly bronzed some contouring
on the cheeks and we're going to go over
all of that in this video but it's it's
definitely something that I've been
wanting to try for a while I know there
are other ones out there other Kim
Kardashian videos but I hope you liked
this one as part of my people magazine's
100 most beautiful series so if you want
to see the look from start to finish
keep on watching guys I first want to
just explain what I've done already I've
moisturize my skin and then I applied my
Revlon Colorstay foundation in true
beige and I just used a stippling brush
actually brush like this this one's from
coastal scents and just used that to
stipple the foundation on all over my
face and then my face I did you have
used a little bit of like a facial
Tanner here recently so I didn't want to
go adds light on what I used is my
concealer so I went ahead and used my
Bobby Brown foundation stick in natural
just to conceal some areas around my
eyes and then i use my mary kay loose
powder in beige one just all over my
face to get that sort of you know
flawless look yet natural finish um to
start out with and then I wanted to
bring in so I could show you what I do
for the bronzer and Kim has pretty
defined cheekbones I've noticed and part
of that is just for her having good
cheekbones but you can kind of recreate
that look as well so I'm going to take
my Sonia Kashuk cream blush and bronzer
do I'm going to be using the bronzer
here just on any cream bronzer really
will do or like a foundation stick
that's a couple shades darker than your
skin tone could also work here but I'm
just going to take a swipe of that with
my finger kind of suck my cheeks in and
see where that line starts to develop
and just put that right there
okay so kind of right in that area and
then just kind of blend it out you can
use a sponge too for more comfortable
with blending out that can kind of
sometimes with it your finger you can
almost over blend it so once you've got
that blended out go ahead and do the
other side again we're just kind of
accentuating what's already there
alright so after you do that it's kind
of nice to just go ahead and set that
and you know just just to help make sure
that stays for you so I'm going to use
my elf blush and bronzer duo this is
from the studio line I'm going to use
this bronzer here with my blush brush
just kind of go over that and accentuate
the cheekbone area there okay and then
just for an overall kind of bronzy glow
I'm going to use my Mac bronzing powder
and golden and I'm going to grab my
larger powder brush for this this is
what it looks like and this has just a
hint of shimmer to it but not overly
much and just yet grab a powder brush
and just take you know a semi matte
bronzer and get that going all over your
face just to kind of kick up your skin
tone a bit then for blush I'm just going
to go back to my elf studio compact and
use this really pretty peachy slightly
shimmery blush and just kind of apply
that to the apples of my cheeks here
this blush really gives you a nice glow
without appearing to add really a whole
lot of color so I like that all right so
here's what you came here for right Kim
Kardashian smokey eyes so what I'm going
to start out by doing is applying my Mac
rubenesque Paint Pot as my base on my
eyelid here just a thin layer will do
it's going to kind of grab the first
shadow we put on and as opposed to using
you know tones of purely tones of gray
for this I'm going to grab my coastal
scents 88 warm palette I have a video on
that if you'd like to learn more and I'm
going to grab my ELF I shadow brush and
use sort of a golden a golden a peach
shade right
here it matches up great with the
rubenesque Paint Pot we just used and
that's about I guess I should give you
some frame of reference for where that
is on the palate if this is the top
corner it is this one right here ok so
just pack some of that on your brush and
apply that all over your lid you're just
going to get kind of a soft golden e
look here I've seen a surprising amount
of her looks where she does use you know
she's got the sort of heavy liner on but
the lid color and crease colors are more
like golden e shades so that's kind of
interesting then I'm going to go to the
shade right in the yets in the middle of
the bottom this one right here I would
describe it as sort of a brownish taupe
and I'm going to grab my um see it's a
medium crease brush and just apply that
pretty much just wear your natural
creases I'm going to go back to the same
shade we put on the lid lightly dust
that all over up to the brow and then
take any of these like really light
color shades I'm going for the one
that's right on top of it it's just like
a light champagne and go right under the
highest point of the arch with that then
for the last part of the shadow it's
going to be a using the matte black
shade in there I'm going to hold off on
that till I'm till I finished the liner
so for now we will go ahead and move on
to the liner and I'm going to be using a
soft soft black pencil all the way
around here it's from l'oreal and it's
pencil perfect and ebony and this is one
of these softest eyeliners I've used and
the reason why I want to use a soft one
is because I want to smudge it out so it
always helps you know if your eyeliner
is really soft and creamy that you can
smudge it out so but you do have to go
to some extra steps to make sure it
stays and i will describe those coming
up here but anyway i'm going to just
take that and we're going to go i'm
going to zoom out just a little bit so I
make sure I stay in the shot here I'm
going to go from inner to outer corner
and I mean this is pencil liners I think
are what a lot of us started out using
you know before all the creams and maybe
even liquids you know this is kind of
like the first thing you go to and you
start doing eyeliner I think for a lot
of people so hopefully this isn't too
far out of your comfort zone I'm lining
all the way to the outer corner and I'm
not creating a cat eye defect but I am
thickening the liner just slightly as we
get to the corner of the eye and then
I'm going to just connect up with that
meet up with it on the bottom and then
sort of i mean i would not call that cat
i by any means but we're just kind of
concentrating some of that color in the
corner of the eye maybe pulling it out
just slightly then we're going on just
really blending this right in with our
lashes and and keep in mind on all of
this part where you're using the pencil
it does not have to be perfect because
we are going to go in and really kind of
mess with the line a little bit when we
when we smudge so going all the way in
to the absolute inner corner here
alright so once you've gotten that I
think we can put our liner away for good
now oh wait wait i forgot i'm going to
line the waterline with this to this is
the softest boldest black to put right
there in the water line i feel like and
then i'm going to grab just as any
smudge tip you could also use a q-tip
for this if you didn't have a smudger
but go right over everything you've done
there this is going to remove excess
product but it's also going to soften
your lines so just go ahead and go
around and this is going to just really
um exaggerate the smoky effect of this
look so you remember I said we're going
back to the Coastal Scents palette i'm
using the matte black shade in the
palette and a liner brush and angled
liner brush would work really well right
here and so i'm just going to use my
Coastal Scents tackle on liner brush get
some of that on there and like I said
you do have to go to some extra lengths
to make sure this ultra creamy liner
will stay for you throughout the day and
those measures include topping it off
with some powder so just do that just go
over everything real quick this can also
add to that smoky effect there on the
bottom by topping off with powder powder
kind of creates that look a little
better than creams do sometimes we're
going back to that shadow like I said
and get some of that on a fine crease
brush and here we're not going to do a
whole lot with this except i want to
take where the corner of that um of that
liner goes to and just meet that and
sort of blend outward at that point see
what I'm doing there i'm getting a
little bit of like practically an outer
V but I'm not really that's not really
the focus of this look and it's not huge
outer V it's just kind of really
contained you know within within your
own crease area here but I'm just using
a minimal amount of that with a really
light touch not going in too far no more
than half way and just using that to
create that smoky kind of effect that we
see on her so often next thing I'm going
to do is apply a coat of mascara i think
i'm just going to use my Maybelline the
colossal it just seems to blend really
well with false lashes and then for the
false lashes i'm using my salon perfect
number 53 they're not and especially
winged out lashes you know like the
Demi's that have more length right on
the outside these are pretty much even
from inside to outside and so yeah
that's what i'm going to be putting on
here and then i'll join you with the
finished look and the guys here we are
back with the finished kim kardashian
tutorial from the People Magazine's 100
most beautiful people and this was a
really fun one to do and
really again focuses on some contoured
cheeks a really nice smoky eye with some
pretty heavy liner to it and then these
kind of light muted lips and when I put
on there was this NYC lipstick in
chiffon and this is just a really light
light pink it goes on very sheer
actually and just really pearly and then
i used the NARS lip gloss in Turkish
delight which I know is one that she
uses over the top of that to just give a
really like I said kind of muted effect
to the lips but just that slight hint of
pink I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial why I just had a good time
doing it I know there are a lot of other
Kim Kardashian inspired looks out there
but I had a good time you know trying my
hand at it and also with the hair um if
you want her hairdo it's really easy
part your hair down the middle and curl
back like this with your curling iron i
don't know how well you can see but i
just did like some really loose curls
there with that and it was really really
easy to do so thank you guys so much for
