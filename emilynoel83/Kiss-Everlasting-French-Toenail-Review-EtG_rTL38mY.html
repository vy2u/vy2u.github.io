today today I'm talking about the
everlasting French toenail from kiss
I've used these nails these are also the
everlasting regular fingernails from
kiss and I really like these a lot
I've you know worn these I'm coming up
on day probably six on these and day
seven on the toes that I have on and
that's kind of reaching the limit
basically but I've had a couple of nails
pop off on my nails and but they've been
doing good basically what I'm trying to
say is I really like the nails and I've
used them a lot from a lot of different
brands but this is my first time ever
trying the toenails and I don't know why
I haven't tried it before I think I just
thought it was strange or something I
just never I and I didn't think it would
work for some reason I thought oh it's
not going to stay on as well on my toes
as it did on my hands I don't know why I
thought that because it's totally the
opposite I'm on day seven with the toes
and I have had my pinky the pinky nail
pop off one time everything else has
stayed on perfectly and ever since I
reapplied the pinky toe
midway through it's fine too so I love
the look it's a very polished look I
mean it's going to go with every outfit
with this French manicure you can see in
the package they have these application
tabs kind of like right there and what
that allows you to do is you put the
glue on your nail and then you can hold
the tab to put the nail on your natural
nail and not get the glue all over your
fingers which is awesome so that's great
I need the glue that comes with this
kiss stuff is pretty good glue and
basically yeah you're going to clean off
make sure your whole toenail area is
clean remove any polish or polish
residue that might be on there put some
glue on the nail press the nail on hold
it on there and really make sure you're
finding the right fit that is such a big
key for fingers or toes is to make sure
that you've got the right fit on here I
did a video all about you know some tips
for these glue-on nails but what's neat
about these is on the application tab
I don't need to know if you can see with
that one but there's a number and if you
you know assuming your big toes and your
middle toes and your pinky toes are like
kind of the same size foot to foot you
can just use that one on your other as
well and it takes at least a little bit
of the guesswork out of it for me like
it was all the same like if I use just
seven on one foot for that corresponding
nail on the other foot it was the same
so um but really make sure you get the
right fit you get so many different
sizes you get twelve different sizes and
you get 24 total nails so a lot more
than you need for two feet but that's
nice because we all have different sizes
but they've stayed on great I was so
surprised because I have not worn a
normal shoe all week it's been all like
with pretty much sandals and flip-flops
and you know things where my toes are
exposed to the world I walked through
not through the landfill by a story
outside mural I didn't feel and I was
walking a lot there and I was just so
pleased with how well they stayed on I
can't say really anything bad about them
these are inexpensive it's going to cost
less to do this then I guess it probably
is to go have somebody else do it but
these are readily available at the
drugstore I think they're super easy to
put on and I'll show you how they look
on this feels a little strange right now
but these are my toes with the nice
nails again after seven days I feel like
they look as fresh as when I first put
them on no chipping whatsoever and Lord
knows I've probably stubbed my toes at
some point in time this week and you can
see the nice white tips are still all on
there and it's doing thanks a lot
everyone for tuning in for this video if
you have a special
Levent coming up this summer whether
it's a wedding or you know some special
time with your friends and family and
you just want to keep a really polished
look to your toes because we're probably
a lot of us wearing sandals and stuff
like that
check these out from kiss it's the
everlasting French toenail I think
you'll be really impressed with how well
they last and how nice they look so have
a great day more reviews to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
