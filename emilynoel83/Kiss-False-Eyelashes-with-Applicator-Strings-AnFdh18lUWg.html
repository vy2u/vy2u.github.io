about a certain kind of false eyelashes
that claims to make it easier to put
them on so I know that's the problem
lots of people run into you know I'm not
getting a month straight I'm having
problems with the glue blah blah blah
there's so many issues people can have
with false eyelashes so when I was in my
local Walmart and I saw the kits
five times faster and easier premium
eyelashes and you won't see them here
because they are right here on my eyes I
thought is this really possible is this
really gonna be as easy as they say what
you've got here are these eyelashes that
come with little strings that remind me
of almost a a a fine fishing wire almost
you know it's that kind of a sort of
plasticy feel to these strings and the
strings are basically looped around the
outer portions of these lashes so you
can if you want to take slide them right
off before you ever put these on but
they are not like absolutely molded onto
these lashes you know I want to first
just talk about the lashes that you're
given here and the kind that I got is oh
seven here and I actually really like
these eyelashes I think that they if you
want thickness they give you thickness
they give you some length these are
great for lashes for you know that
dramatic night out type look I really
really do like the final look that they
give but what makes these lashes
different is all about the process that
they claim to give you off you've got to
make sure the strings are going in the
proper direction so the lashes Bend the
way you want them to so you have the
right control over it right now I
couldn't put that on there so I've got
to sort of work with it a little bit and
adjust that string so I can best
manipulate these lashes all right I'm
going to try to
going to try to and I got a glance down
in my mirror for a second here line this
up on my lower lash line and then use
these strings to get it where it needs
to be okay it's kind of difficult here
I'm gonna grab my mirror see if I can
get this to go
I really essentially got to get in there
I mean the initial placement with the
strings got on there and it actually did
okay I feel like these strings can be
useful for placement once you kind of
get them wiggled around to where that
you're actually holding it at the proper
angle so that the lash has the right
kind of bend to it we've all seen false
eyelashes and just here's here's another
look at another product that I have here
they have this gentle curve and so what
these strings allow you to do is to
really get that curve going so that when
you go in to place it near your eye it's
curving right along with it so you have
to fiddle around with it for a little
bit to actually get to that point where
as with another pair of lashes or
without these strings I might have just
popped them on say you can you know get
it lined up you've got it in the right
general spot but to only use these
strings to get the corners pressed down
where you need them I mean I don't have
the confidence in this product to say
that I can just get those strings just
so and just kind of tug them in just a
little bit and and just have that little
bit of tension there and then they pop
right on where they should go no I'm
absolutely gonna go in there with my
fingers and make sure that my ends are
there so once you get them on don't I
didn't feel like I could just put them
on leave them and have them placed in
just the right way without going in with
my hands and making sure those ends were
in there correctly my main problem when
I first used these came when you have to
get these strings on first time I used
them I had a real issue with trying to
get that off and it actually pulled the
whole lash strip off so here's my
experience today trying to get them off
next step in my direction says place
finger on corner of lash to secure and
gently pull the string away
and it shows in the little picture it
shows the person has since this is a you
you have two strings on each side
they're pulling just one part of the
string so the whole thing comes undone
so I'm going to place do what they say
kind of make sure that the lashes are on
there and then grab the string Oh God
there we go there's one end that just
came off it had some glue on it so it
kind of tugged for a second let's see if
the inner corner can come off as well
there we go and there's the lashes it
did pull a little bit and it was
slightly painful to get that string off
of there but I was able to get it off
without it pulling the whole strip of
lashes with it because part of the issue
you will have is you put your glue on
and if you want to get your glue for a
really point A to point B on the lashes
you are going to get some on that string
so if you don't maybe take the string
off soon enough or if things start to
kind of solidify there on your lash line
you're gonna really have some troubles
getting the string off of there bottom
line what do I think about this product
love the lashes themselves I this
particular style of lashes I really
enjoy however for me it's going to be
easier for me to take those strings off
and place them on my eye by hand the
regular way than to use these strings I
spent more time fussing with them and it
says five times faster and easier I felt
like it was it not only took me longer
but it was a little more difficult for
me now I'm not I have used false
eyelashes for I don't know quite a few
years now so it's not exactly a new
concept to me so I'm trying to think
also in terms of those who have never
used eyelashes would this be easy for a
person who is very new to wearing false
eyelashes maybe placement wise if you're
really kind of awkward with your fingers
and you're not quite sure how to get
them pressed down there as I was you
know starting out you know this may be
good for placement although keep in mind
you're
gonna have to go in there with your
fingers at some point and get it pressed
down you guaranteed that you would have
good luck reusing the strings that you
that you get on there once you've
already used them once and pull them
through and kind of change their shape a
little bit
I don't recall these being any more
expensive than the other lashes that I
saw there for sale say at Walmart I
think they had some Ardell ones some
Revlon ones and these might have been
the cheaper ones of the whole bunch so
would I repurchase these yes would I use
the strings again no I find it just
easier to use my hands I think it's
interesting that they've tried to come
up with a way to make false eyelashes
easier for people but I for me
personally it didn't make the process
any easier for me because these aren't
very expensive I would say try them out
if you have struggled and felt like I
can't wear false eyelashes because it is
too difficult to get in there and get
them placed and they're just the right
spot then maybe you want to give these a
shot and see how they work for you but
I'm not going to probably be taking any
advantage of this string technology that
I have here any time soon again so
thanks again for watching guys have a
great day and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
