video I'm gonna be talking about two
different eyeliner pins in this video
and I've had kind of a mixed experience
with eyeliner pins in the past there
have been a couple that I've used that I
really have not liked the there was one
from Physicians Formula and also the
covergirl lion exact I think it's called
it's kind of like a short little pin I
really didn't like those too much
because I felt like they didn't last me
nearly as long as they should have like
the liner just ride up way too fast or
either that or it just wasn't
effectively moving through the felt tip
pen type applicator so when I went in
the last one I tried was the Revlon
Colorstay one so when I tried this I was
kind of skeptical I was like should I
even mess with this again but after
using this for quite a while the Revlon
Colorstay liquid eye pen really stayed
working well for me for a very long time
I was very impressed with how long it
continues to work today
it just it's it's got a very nice
applicator just everything about it
works really well it works well even
over shimmery eyeshadows overall you
know it does a pretty good job so I'm
still happy with that but I decided to
test out a couple more because they were
each kind of their own little style here
one is they're both from la girl and one
is called fine line long-lasting fine
tip liquid eyeliner so that looks like
this and this is what the tip looks like
it's like the smallest little tip ever
it's such a fine tip there and I'll talk
more about whether or not I like that in
a second but the other one is Mark my
eyes long-lasting extreme bold eyeliner
and this is more of a marker than a pin
and you'll see why does that not look
like a sharpie marker to you it's just
really a lot there even though it's
tapered to a tip its it's not the super
fine tip like the other one is so okay
let's talk a little bit about these
different ones starting with the fine
line I really like how fine the line
really is it's nice and long
and I didn't have issues with either of
these in terms of smudging just to show
you how how fine the line actually is
just to draw it there I mean it's a very
very nice fine line I think you know you
could even draw it kind of quickly or do
sort of a you know whatever you want to
do with it you can see how it kind of
can vary there but it's overall going to
be a very thin line this tip is a little
bit fragile the one thing I've noticed
that I used it is even if I'm not
applying much pressure you see how I
don't know if you can pick up on this
see how that tip ever-so-slightly
it's now curving off a little bit in one
direction maybe this is just me being
picky but when I draw with it it turns
like that I don't like that I don't see
it lasting very long for that purpose
and I will update you guys on my blog as
to how long these actually kept their
juice in them but that that's one thing
that worries me is that this is almost
too small and too fragile to last very
long although right now when it's new
it's giving me a great line and the line
is very long wearing I haven't had
issues with it like flaking off we're
getting dry and kind of like cracking
off I've heard people complain of that
there's a nice tight fit on the caps so
that's a good sign that the product will
stay moist and not get dried up now the
mark my eyes that's what I have on today
and the line got a little thick here on
this side and it's really not as scary
as it seems because the tip itself is
not that big I mean it's got a
relatively small tip to it but with just
a little bit of pressure I feel like
your that says that as thin a line as
you can get with it
those two are this mark my eyes pen so
as you can see I mean it's just that's
that's the type of line you're gonna get
sometimes you want that sometimes you
don't this is nice but you don't have as
much control as you do with the really
fine line I feel like this is a little
more durable but I also feel like more
often than not I may not want the line
that thick and it did get thicker than I
really wanted it like I just pressed a
little too hard
if I press just a little harder I get an
even thicker line there and it's just a
matter of you know what if your what if
your hands shook a little bit or you
just happen to press a little too hard
that's why this one becomes a little
harder to control at times but still you
get a nice dark line it is not
absolutely like waterproof the stuff
will come off with soap and water but
still it just it does withstand you know
a day of at work or whatever you know
it's not going to rub off I don't think
it also anyway bottom line both of these
are good products if you're looking for
a very fine line this is good if you
like that bold thick line if you like to
wear hoops nice and thick liner this may
be something to test out these are
inexpensive products available at cherry
culture comm however to compare them
back to the color stay which is the best
liquid liner pen I've tried so far this
is kind of middle-of-the-road
this liner is not not as fine as the
other one and not as thick as um as you
can see it see it right there it's kind
of it's not as fine as these and not as
thick as this but this is a very durable
tip that this has another thing that I
like about it is how far that tip
extends from the plastic of the
applicator the the thing that gets to me
kind of about this one
this is the la la girl one right here
that tip doesn't come out very far when
you're getting right in here by your eye
it's kind of hard
this one the Revlon one it's a little
bit easier to get right in there because
the tip is longer so just something I've
noticed you know having used so many of
these different products but yeah I hope
you learned a thing or two about these I
think eyeliner pins can be really a lot
easier for people to try as opposed to
especially if you're just getting in the
liquid liner instead of where it's kind
of like the inkwell style and you pull
it out and you draw it on those are
great Revlon Colorstay has a fantastic
version like that and I really like the
NYC liquid eyeliner too you get a very
intense black color but you may find
those kind of hard to control if you're
just
writing out so that's why these pins are
very user friendly just be aware of
what's out there
what kind of line you're going to get
with each and the amount of control you
you have will vary but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
