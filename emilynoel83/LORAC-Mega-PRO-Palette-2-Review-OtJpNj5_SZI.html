me and thank you to all of you on
snapchat who told me you need to do this
video ASAP
when I started showing this palette this
is the lorac mega pro 2 this is probably
one of the most anticipated palette
launches of the holiday season now this
video is going up on a Saturday on
Sunday this palette officially launches
at Ulta in-store and online at least
that's what my email said how did I get
it early I actually had gotten an email
last weekend saying you're a part of the
Platinum perk program and if you want to
go ahead and order this palette now you
can do it one day only early so I went
ahead and ordered it and I got it like
two days later so once I started
flashing this around on snapchat you
guys are like show us more so in this
video I'll show swatches we'll just talk
overall quality several of you mentioned
possibly giving some comparisons to the
mega Pro one that came out last year at
this time and I'll also give some
comparisons to just the regular lorac
pro one and two palettes now this is the
mega Pro one I do recall this being kind
of a disorganized mess kind of a cluster
to try to get your hands on this palette
last year the launch dates seemed to be
kind of all over the place I remember
thinking I missed out on it and I
emailed lorac and they're like yep you
missed out and then it came back on
Amazon or something and I did end up
getting it I do want to just kind of
point out a few things about this before
jumping into the new if you were to
cover up like this much of this palette
see how incredibly neutral this is you
know it's a lot of light and mid-tone
shades and it's just like all about the
little nuances there's just very subtle
differences between them then you open
it up to this side of the palette and
you start to see more color but any
shade in here that's really bright
enough to show up colorfully on the eyes
is going to be kind of a purple or berry
type shade so definitely talking about
this one here this one potentially these
two right up here any other shade over
here this kind of outside of the typical
neutral family maybe deep teal is so
dark that it doesn't really show up with
a lot of teal color pay
so really what you're looking at here is
kind of a berry palette with a lot of
neutrals you guys know I'm a huge fan of
those kinds of berry shades so I'm not
gonna get this and be like oh man I'm
disappointed at the lack of variety I
really like this palette but I was a
little surprised that with so many
shades in here there really wasn't more
overall variety in the kinds of looks
you would get so now that will hopefully
put into context a little bit more the
mega Pro tube that's come out which I
feel at a glance you can definitely see
it has a broader color variety happening
here you've got extremely warm shades
some very cool shades you know they give
you a little taste of that berry vibe
that they gave you in the other palette
but overall it's really all over the
place I would say there are more
colorful directions that you can go in
with this palette but there's nothing
that I would hesitate to wear you know I
feel like it's all totally wearable I
was playing around with this blue shade
the other day and absolutely loved it
and then you know you can go very warm
kind of sunset vibe with some of the
things happening up here but another
thing to note about the layout lorac
stays very true to their layout don't
they like in the just regular skinny
palette you know you've got the top row
that's all matte bottom roads all
shimmer in these mega Pro palette they
give you two rows of matte and two rows
of shimmer they give the shades normal
names like purple black quality-wise I
have a raved and raved on the lorac pro
eyes shadows over the years they've got
a couple of fantastic palettes with the
lorac pro one I think this is one of the
most basic most like must-have type of
palettes out there because it really
gives you a range of just all your
classic basic shadows you might want
then the lorac pro 2 over the past year
I've really made a point to use this
palette more and have enjoyed it so much
the Navy the plum there's just the
different twists on shades that they put
in this palette I've really enjoyed it
the shadows have a soft kind of buttery
creamy feel to the touch
the mattes are very intense this
shimmers are also very intense as well
something you'll notice when you put a
brush
- these shades is that they can kick up
a little bit of dusty powder eNOS that's
always something I've come to expect
with these kinds of pallets it's
definitely something where you're going
to want to tap into your shadow and then
tap off some of the excess just - I
think build-up shadow more gradually on
the eyes as opposed to overloading
yourself and if you are thinking about
buying this pallet and you just wanted
some reassurance you know is this the
same kind of formula I've come to know
and love from my other lorac Pro palette
it definitely is I wanted to show you
swatches of all the mint shades together
so you can really get a feel for the
range you've got going on here
top row there's you know a lot of
neutral you've got some great just
medium Browns and everyone loves to have
for the crease loving melon tangerine
you've also got a super dark green
called forest here and I almost wish
they would have expanded the green color
selection in this palette a bit more
maybe that's coming in the mega Pro 3
but forest is really beautiful and you
can bring out more of that green color
if you layer it with one of the lighter
more shimmery shades then in the next
row lavender purple
very uncool purpley shades that
particular purple is almost bordering a
little bit on blue and I kind of like
that because so many purples including
so much of what was in the mega Pro 1
was a very like pinkish berry type vibe
so it's really fun to have that nice
classic purple loving goji and sorbet
Cabernet is fabulous ash black great
basics then going down into your
shimmery shades you've got a lot of
light shimmery colors I was a little
surprised that there's really five
shimmery shades in here that are very
light and very close together you've
also got great mid-tone neutrals that
could make a one shadow look if you're
just like I need to use this palette in
a hurry
cinnamon would be great for that
sandstone would be great for that
gunmetal is gorgeous this blue quartz is
a lot of fun I'm thinking that's gonna
be like a lower lash line pop for me on
several occasions penny is one of my
all-stars of the entire palette I think
that's gorgeous just the feel of it the
shine of it is really brilliant
shimmery group you've got some of these
very buttery really shiny metallic
shades and then you've got some that are
like just scaled back a notch you know I
guess I'd call them more of a satin
finish and I'm thinking about chiffon
and soft plum I don't want to say
they're weak but maybe according to the
expectations you may have for your lorac
pro quality shadows those are going to
come off just a little bit softer I'm
not saying they're not pigmented they're
just like a little softer finish little
less Sheen to them just giving you the
heads-up on that and then goldleaf not
quite everything I was hoping for in a
gold in this palette the gold that I
think is absolutely above and beyond is
the one that's in that original just
lorac pro standard one palette not the
mega Pro but the one that's in the black
packaging
that's an amazing gold this gold is more
of a yellowish gold and I didn't love
the way it's watched I thought it was
just a little bit light a little bit
flaky but I did work it into my look
today just to see how it applied over a
primer and it improved quite a bit I
really thought the intensity came out of
it more it hung together a little bit
more you know as I patted it across the
lids in terms of the strongest shades in
this palette absolutely love tangerine
they nailed it on that orange wear it
alongside goji or Cabernet and get that
pretty sunset look speaking of those -
those are another couple of very strong
shades I think those are the other two
shades that I worked into my look today
I've got goji all throughout the crease
and Cabernet in the outer corner and
Penny and Penny I think is just
absolutely brilliant it's not really as
maybe coppery or rose gold E as a
standard penny that you might pull out
of your pocket might be it's just got a
nice kind of old gold quality to it it's
so soft it's so metallic I love that one
now I do think this is different enough
from the mega Pro one for you to not
really see overlap in shades now they
did put black straight-up black in both
of these I don't mind that in fact I
appreciate that but you're not going to
be running into shade after shade where
you're like oh that's exactly like this
other one even shades that appear to be
close and this is one of the things I'm
so impressed by
with this palette even shades that seem
like a really close shave when you
swatch him out they're different how did
they manage to get so many different
shades in this palette and still make it
a palette full of shades that I feel
like are totally wearable shades that I
am completely comfortable wearing on my
eyes how did they do that did so many
comparisons side by sides with the
shades in here
I also compared side by side to the
lorac pro one and two palettes and they
really have given you differences in
here in some cases their major
differences with shades like tangerine
and forest and goldleaf and purple in
other cases maybe some shapes like tawny
or sorbet or peony dark Sienna you might
think those are kind of close to other
shades that I have and they may be close
but they are not exactly the same and
tell any makeup lover that a shade is
close but not exactly the same and
they're like okay okay I guess I need it
I guess my bottom line on this you guys
know I'm critical of palettes that are
really hyped up I really like to give
them a good hard look and thank you know
is this worth someone's hard earned
money and I really feel that this one is
if you know you enjoy the quality of
lorac Pro eyes shadows you're gonna
enjoy this you're gonna appreciate I
think the fact that they put in so many
different kinds of shades in here the
variety of looks you can come up with is
really just as broad as your imagination
because you can go you know pairing all
sorts of different shades together and
it really just promotes makeup playtime
you know you open up a palette like this
with all these colors and it's like okay
where do I begin this is gonna be fun
also continue to be very excited about
that palette from the balm the Greatest
Hits palette that I reviewed earlier
this week that's more of a combo palette
you know it's got some shadows but it's
got some of their blushes and other face
products in there as well so really
coming out of the gate I feel like this
year holiday palette wise talking about
a couple of the palettes that I am
extremely impressed by so I hope this
video was useful to you if you would
like to see some tutorials with this
palette please let me know and I will
talk to you again later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
