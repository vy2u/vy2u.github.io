well I just woke up this morning and
thought I want to do a matte eyeshadow
tutorial I don't know where that came
from but it was so I don't know if I it
was dreaming about it or what was going
on but I just really felt like I wanted
to do this and I started to think and
I'm like I don't know if I've done an
entirely matte eyeshadow tutorial II
think I use a lot of shimmer and I
thought let's do something all matte
because I've been experimenting a little
bit and really enjoying the looks I've
been getting from the lorac Pro palette
I had to do it I had to get this because
it is really kind of like a here's what
the palette looks like first off got a
big mirror there but I mean it's like
half and half matte and shimmer I know
lorac has great quality eyeshadows I've
gotten different kits from them from in
the past and I've liked them a lot and
so I thought I'm gonna do a look just
using these matte colors just to show
what a flawless look matte eyeshadows
can give one thing about these shadows
just texture wise I feel like they there
is a lot of fallout so get in the habit
of dipping it in and tapping it off the
old dip and tap you know what I'm saying
on the other hand they're very pigmented
and very blendable and if you do tap
them off I don't seem to have any issues
with fallout like under the eye area I
thought you know a nice deep dark eye
look for fall or I mean this could even
translate to Halloween if you've got you
know some kind of look where you need
that nice dramatic eye and you've got
some basic shades kind of like these
even if you don't have this palette you
can see kind of how I used him so I hope
you like the look I'm gonna start by
taking the primer that comes with this
kit it's a small size of the behind the
scenes eye primer from lorac and I'm
just gonna take a little bit of that and
just put that all over my entire eye
area from lid all the way up to the brow
bone next I'm gonna take my palette and
take a flat eyeshadow brush to the light
pink shade there like to kind of tap my
brush directly over the shade I just
used so the fallout goes kind of back
into the color and then I'm just gonna
blot that light pink right around the
tear duct and take it in just a little
bit then I'm going to the shade called
mauve
same brush I'm just gonna Pat that on
the rest of my lid then take like a
blending brush and just blend some of
that mop up through the crease area I
feel like with Matt shadows while these
are pretty easy to blend anyway just in
general like layering the shadows really
helps you kind of get a good blend so
we'll be going over that a little bit
but it gives us kind of a nice space
next I'm using my performance collection
shader brush you can use whatever kind
of brush you want really but I just like
a smaller size for this step I'm going
to the black the matte black color here
I'm just going to begin blotting that
right here on the outer corner this look
is kind of all about the outer corner
really and then I'm pulling it up to the
crease just a little now you got that
nice and deep right there in the outer
corner I'm taking a liner brush an
angled liner brush to that black shade
once again this right here on the lower
lash line and take it about 3/4 of the
way in then I'm going to kind of
basically make a line going upward from
the lower lash line like that and that
is going to shape the rest of the shadow
that we do here I just kind of start
with my angled liner brush because
that's going to give me the most precise
application I kind of start blotting and
filling in that V with the black shade
and that's gonna give you the blackest
most precise you know application then
we're gonna go in and blend mix I'm
taking this shader crease brush from the
performance collection any smaller
crease brush will do and then we're
really just going off the end of that
liner and starting to bring the black in
just a little bit see how nice and deep
and dark we're getting it right at the
corner anytime you put your brush first
on your eye the first place your brush
hits is where the most product goes we
want the most product getting on the
outermost part and then anything as it
blends in word about halfway is just
going to be you know extra now I'm going
to work with a couple of lighter shades
that are going to totally complete the
look first
a smudger brush and this shade called
sable which is not the darkest Brown but
kind of a medium brown cut a little bit
of the sable and just blend that under
the inner part here if your eye just a
little less intense than the black but
it's still gonna be even it's still an
intense eye look who am I trying to get
then I'm taking a sable again this time
with a fluffier crease brush and we're
gonna use this to go kind of the inner
part of our crease here and just up
above the black so see how this is
giving us kind of a flawless looking
sort of blend here shades layer very
nicely for being matte colors you would
think okay what can you do but you can
really layer them and blend with them
and create you know some looks that you
wouldn't expect the clean off the brush
a little bit and then we're gonna go to
Mothe again we use mob a little bit to
start now we're going back to it this
makes the matte selection in this
palette in my opinion I mean it's just
you need to have that warmish kind of
pinky color here and I'm gonna go yet
again up above that Brown and it's just
a beautiful layered type of effect here
finally I'm using so many brushes here
and you just really use what you have I
mean you don't have to have this
specialized selection although it does
help me to kind of work in some very
small detailed ways I'm gonna go to a
light shade in here called cream right
here and this is the performance
collection blending brush so just it's
just like a mini sized blender and for
that taking that lightest shade so we
can have a nice still sort of a
highlight under the brow where things
are getting kind of close there so
there's just gonna be a little bit of
light now it takes some even pop it on
the inner corner if you feel like things
are getting a little deep and dark and
another trick to kind of finish our edge
here you can take that blender with the
cream and just it's practically like
that little area now it's getting
outlined it's getting framed from here
from here
and now from here it's not going to be
really identifiable but I think that
that kind of helps bring a finished look
to that area and I'm just gonna use a
black liner on my waterline I'm using my
malli ever color automatic liner and
onyx take that all the way into your
innermost corner then I'm going to take
a liquid liner on the upper lash line
keeping it a really thin line yeah you
can't even hardly tell like okay where's
that liner going it's just really going
right in with that black next I'm gonna
curl my lashes apply some mascara to the
upper and lower lashes and I'll join you
with the finished look well that wraps
it up guys no shimmers in this look just
the matte from the lorac Pro palette I
can do a review on this if you want but
in a nutshell for now I really like the
palette and I think there are some
gorgeous shimmery colors here probably
know I would like that coppery color
there the deep plum stuff like that but
the matte is actually more fun than you
would think so I enjoyed this loss for
the rest of my face use this blush from
NYX and pinch I feel like I use this a
lot in tutorials but kind of a golden
peach there I did kind of a neutral lip
it's not erase your lips nude because I
don't think that that's always the most
flattering way to go but I used my
Milani
lipstick in nude creams you can see it's
neutral without being like I said light
lightening then I took it up a notch
with some NYX gloss in beige pearl and
this is a very shiny shimmery gloss and
then I went to this shade in the palette
called nude it's ultra shimmery and I
just dip my finger in it right onto the
center your lower lip and then Mama and
it just kind of blends it in and kind of
turns it into gloss that way and I just
love the pop of shine that that gives so
that's how I got the look I hope you
guys liked it definitely something
different from me considering I haven't
done a lot if any matte tutorials so
have a great day and I will see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
