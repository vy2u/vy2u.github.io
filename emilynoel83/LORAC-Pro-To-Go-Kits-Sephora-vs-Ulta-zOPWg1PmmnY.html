on two brand new products Sephora and
Ulta each have their own exclusive
versions of the lorac Pro to go palettes
and I just lost a brush out one oh those
are basically each kind of a variation
on the lorac Pro palette which I think
this was a smart thing for lorac to do
because this palette I know has been
super popular I've talked about it a lot
you've got a bunch of matte shades a
bunch of shimmery shades really soft
textures very easy to work with and
blend and so I wouldn't exactly call
these to go versions like downsized
because they're just different they've
got some different things than just eye
shadows in there so in this video I'm
gonna explain the differences between
the one that's offered at Ulta and the
one that's offered at Sephora know your
requests on which one of these you'd
like to see a tutorial video on but I
will have some swatches in this video so
you can get a really good look at what
these products are all of them first off
let's talk about this one from Sephora
it's got that same texture that's on the
outside of the original one so it can
kind of get dirty easily what's really
neat about this see how small it folds
up well it actually folds out and this
is the size of the real palette but it's
just gonna fold back like that for you
and under one side you're going to have
your mirror and your eye shadows so here
we have six different shadows they are
pearl chai and mink
those are your shimmery shades and then
you get three matte neutral shades this
one is Shell cafe and blend with the
exception of black these are all
different shades than what you're
getting in the lorac Pro palette I
actually don't mind that they've doubled
up on the one black shade because I
think black is an extremely handy shadow
to have because it can double as a liner
and just be really useful for you in
getting a variety of look the other side
of this palette you have three face
products which is exciting you have a
matte bronzer a matte pink blush and a
shimmery coral blush but you also get
with this two mini sized brushes one
an angled brush and the other is just
like a small eyeshadow brush and I used
both of these in the look you're seeing
on me today
really thought this was a palette where
you could go to town with a smoky eye
but I decided to keep it a little bit
lighter
I used pearl and I also used this ivory
shade kind of in my highlight and inner
corner I used a little bit of chai on my
outer part of my lid and then in my
crease I used this shade called cafe I
think this is just a phenomenal shade so
glad they gave you this matte Brown in
here kind of a lighter brown and it's
something that can give you the natural
crease that you see I have here or if
you're using one of these darker shades
like mink or Blanc in your crease it can
buff it out a little bit and give it
just a softened edge for the face
products I use the bronzer I first put
on this pink blush and then I layered on
top of it a little bit of the coral and
that's what's giving me a little bit of
sheen on top of my cheeks I practically
use that one as a highlight so here's
what it looks like all stretched out at
the bottom here it says the makeup I use
to keep my celebrity clients looking
glamorous on the go Carol Shaw fun fact
lorac is Carol spelled backwards so
that's how she came up with that name I
guess but there's how it folds down now
this one from Ulta is very different
instead of just being a flat palette it
actually is a little pouch here turn it
right-side up and here's what it looks
like on the inside you have spaces for
three brushes which they supply in here
a mascara and a little eyeshadow quad
the mascara is full-size it is the lorac
pro mascara in blood has kind of a cone
shaped brush it's very volumizing kind
of lengthening as well this is your
little baby lorac Pro palette so you can
see the size comparison to the original
this has four shadows here again they
are different shadows from what you're
gonna find in the original lorac Pro
palette you have ivory you have rose or
Rose a you have a shade called spice and
a shade called aubergine the shades seem
to have a little bit of Sheen to it
for example this shade here ivory is
kind of a satin finish
rose' definitely had some shimmer to it
as well kind of a sheer pink spice
obviously has a lot of sparkle and
aubergine this deep plum has it as well
you do have a little mirror that comes
with this it's small but it is used so
and then you get three basically
full-size brushes I mean they're a
little shorter than my Sigma brushes but
as far as the brush size themselves they
are all full size I was wearing this
palette by the way in my last video my
July best in beauty and I only use these
brushes with that look so it definitely
is possible for these brushes to create
a look without bringing anything else in
you have a flat shadow brush and it
actually comes to a bit of a subtle like
point not a real distinct point that's
great for patting your shadow on you can
also pull it up into the crease Rea
crease brush I love the size of this
this is not an oversized crease brush
but it's not too small either so perfect
for either applying a little bit of
shadow to your crease or just buffing it
out very very soft as well on both of
these is your angled brush and I don't
feel like this has near the softness
that the other two have and I could
really feel it when I was using it the
other day on my lower lash line it's
extremely stiff and you know how soft
the shadows are all the lorac shadows
have a lot of softness to them so you
have to be very careful when you dip
this into a shadow because it
practically cuts down into that soft
shadow and it can do the job but it's
just not my favorite liner brush and my
personal preference on these if I were
to just pick one I would go with the one
from Sephora simply because I feel like
it has more in it just makeup one I
really like the fact that you're getting
six eyeshadows here three of them are
matte three of them are shimmer very
basic type shadows that would be great
to have if you were on the go traveling
and I really think you could get a
variety of looks from something fairly
soft like I did today to something very
deep and smoky I really like the face
products here I love this matte bronzer
it seems like a lot of times when
bronzers are thrown in to kids it's like
they can't get them right
this is matte and I think did a really
nice job for contouring I
like the blushes as well I think they're
soft and pigmented nothing else that I
notice is size-wise you look at the size
of these shadows in comparison to the
size of the shadows and lorac Pro
they're quite a bit bigger as well I
just love the construction of it I feel
like there is no wasted space in this
palette I think they made it just as
small as they could and gave you still a
generous amount of these face products
and a generous amount of eyeshadows as
well yet it folds down and you've got a
great sized mirror to use as far as this
one goes I mean I love this little quad
I think this is really nice but there is
much more Sparkle and shimmer with this
little grouping here mascara wise these
cone-shaped wands have never been a real
favorite of mine I feel like you have to
use it like in the same manner on each
side and I'm not always a wrist flipper
sometimes I will but I kind of like to
just go in that way as well and I felt
like even though I think this tube does
a really good job of cleaning a lot of
the product off of this brush I still
felt like my lashes we're getting a
little overloaded and kind of sticking
together Anila wise I like something
that's a little bit drier than you enjoy
the fact that they included three
brushes that can give you the total look
if that's what you want to wear the
brushes I think are fantastic the crease
brush and the flat brush the angled
liner brush is a little bit just hard
and not nearly as soft as the other two
this ultra version bottom line is just
gonna give you an eye look this one is
gonna give you and I look matte or
shimmer plus you're gonna get some face
products as well so this one's my
favorite but think about your own
preferences your own needs and if you
even think you need any more i shadow
kits or palettes I again think that the
lorac Pro is just a wonderful wonderful
palette if you haven't tried it already
I think it has fantastic quality lots of
variety you don't already have it an eye
shadow is your primary focus I would go
for this above all else but I mean if I
shadow and the face products or
something you'd be interested in - this
is great that's my review on the new to
go palettes thank you guys so much for
taking time to watch
and I hope you have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
