about in this video I am talking about
the whole l'oreal infallible paints line
and you know what's funny about this
when this came out the first thing that
my mind went to was back when l'oreal
released that hip line high-intensity
pigments anybody remember that from like
the 90s i don't know early 2000s and it
was all about like bolder colors they
had those great like eyeshadow duos they
actually had an amazing mascara that i
loved in that line and those little like
jelly pot lip balm so many cool things
and i was kind of sad to see that range
leave L'Oreal's line but i feel like
with the infallible paints it's almost
like they're bringing back that bolder
makeup concept but just with a little
bit different selection of products so i
would scent this whole like spread from
l'oreal PR and i got it i think it was
more toward the start of this year when
things were really going crazy you know
new baby and all that stuff not that I
don't still have a new baby on my hand
but I just really hadn't had the time to
play with all this stuff till now so I
wanted to give you a full review on the
double-ended eye colors there's also a
bunch of lip colors and eyeliner pins
and then I also have a blush palette too
so there's tons to talk about I'm going
to be whipping through some shades
pretty quickly in this video I will
definitely be taking the time to explain
what I think about these formulas and
the way they wear I've really been
experimenting and actually having a ton
of fun with the things from this line
and I am wearing these products on my
eyes cheeks and lips so there will be a
demo for this eye look I'll show you
know the blush application that I'm
wearing today and a full Tryon of all
these lip colors even this you know teal
shade here why not so I want to talk
about these cream eyeshadows first there
are twelve different shades and they're
really cool some of them it's like kind
of a complementary saying on each end
you know the shades coordinating look
nice together but they're not
necessarily in the same color family
like this one and then there are others
where it's maybe a light shade and then
a little bit deeper take on that same
color well I might throw around the word
like liquid eye shadow for these they're
not a true likes in liquid they're more
of a cream and they really do set to a
long way
finish on the skin and I have worn these
like all day long and I can truly say
they do not move they do not change it's
a fine line with products like this I
feel like certain things that I try that
are in this format certain ones don't
set on you and they get really really
Creasy these absolutely do but they give
you enough time to work with them and
kind of blend them out on the eyes like
well I know they eventually set to this
budget free state I don't feel like I
have to hurry as I'm doing my eye look
with these but my favorite way to use
these paints is either as a pop on the
lid like I'll do powder shadow to maybe
get a little light crease color going
and then I'll do this as a full-on like
pop shade on the lid or I really like it
as eyeliner either across the upper lash
line or as you know a lower liner type
pop as well some of the bright colors
look really beautiful in that way and
because they do last so long I'm not
scared to put one you know full-on on
the lower lash line as far as a primer
goes with these it does not matter like
I don't need to put a primer on with
these products when we're talking about
powder eyeshadows I think primer really
helps I think primer can sometimes help
some cream shadows that don't totally
set up because these are so full color
on their own and they do completely get
to this budge free place
I don't even find a primer to be
necessary with these and bottom line
they're just fun like I don't know if
it's just the different consistency or
the shade range maybe it's a combination
of both but I have had so much fun
playing with these on the eyes coming up
with different looks using them has that
pop on the lid blending one shade into
the next you do really feel kind of like
you're painting with these I've been
using my Real Techniques brushes a lot I
think any synthetic brush
you know paired with these kinds of
creams works well for blending and these
clean off really really easily
I got this brush that's the shading
brush and it's just really nice for
colors on the lid and if I want to buff
anything out a little bit more this base
shadow brush is nice and you'll see in
my demo I also used a little like elf
smudger brush that worked well but I do
want to take you through some quick
swatches of all of these shades there
are certain colors that I might refer to
as matte and if you look up at them
like SuperDuper closely maybe you see
like the tedious bit of a potential
satin finish on those but still I do
feel kind of safe and calling some of
these shades matte and then some are
definitely like a shimmery or metallic
finish
so the lightest duo is called cool ivory
I love this one you've got a really
light pearl color and then a little bit
more of a champagne shade and both of
those have a lot of shimmer then with
nude fishnet we have like this matte
beige color and alongside that is a
deeper beige with shimmer some really
fun pops with Jet Set blonde here you've
got a light like white Frost and then
this matte yellow and the matte yellow
really does show up with a lot of
intensity and for my warm color lovers
sunset fire here you've got this peachy
shimmer and then a little bit deeper
richer peach with still a little bit of
a sheen to it but not quite as much as
the lighter color has there's a nice
matte neutral duo with brown sugar here
you've got a light matte Brown and then
a deeper just richer chocolatey Brown
aqua aura gives you kind of a soft peach
but there's not too much orange in this
peach and it's more toward the matte
side and also this matte teal this is a
really interesting duo I enjoyed working
this into one of my looks I did earlier
in the week and then Navy Yard is kind
of like the deeper take on that duo the
lighter end of this one is a little more
pinky and it does have shimmer and then
there's just gorgeous navy blue that has
a beautiful sheen to it as well if
you're a big blue fan
BRB blue has two tones of light blue one
is this really soft periwinkle with
shimmer and the other is this more pure
sky blue shade I think that one's really
pretty
then shady violet has two creamy purple
shades and neither of them seem super
frosty to me one just a really light
lilac one is a bit closer to a true
purple but it still adds a little bit of
softness to it I am so excited to play
with the shade mint detox here we've got
a really pretty jade green color and
then the darker end has some shimmer and
this makes me think of a pre emerald
green army camo we're talking a nice
creamy murky kind of olive green and
then the deeper shade is a little bit
more of a true greenish olive shade and
does have shimmer and then the last one
is mistress Noir both shades are very
dark but the lighter of the two it seems
like a deep charcoal with just a hint of
green and a little bit of shimmer and
then a pure black now for today's look I
worked in two of these I use Navy Yard
and I use BRB blue and I just want to
walk you through how I did this first
and one way that I do like to use these
if I plan to have a pop on the lid I
like to use kind of a matte shadow to
work into my crease so I use this quad
from Physicians Formula called quartz
quartet and I use that kind of deep
dusty rose shade and then I use the
beige for a bit of a highlight up under
the brow and then from the navy yard duo
I use some of that rosy shade kind of
like a rosy peach and I just dabbed it
on the lid and then I used my brush to
blend it out sometimes I just like to
dab my brush directly on the applicator
or you know you can dead the applicator
on your eye and blend from there you can
use your fingers with these too but I do
think the brushes give me a little extra
control and then from the VRB blue duo I
use the deeper the two blues just on the
outer part of my lid I just thought it
might be fun to do a little side-by-side
there with those two and then to make
everything look just a little more
finished I use the deeper shade from
that quartz quartet just with a small
crease brush on the outer corner I
thought that helped complete the upper
part of the eye a little bit more I use
the black liner which I'll talk more
about the liners in a second but I went
all the way across my upper lash line
with that used a blue pencil liner from
makeup forever in my lower inner rim and
then I went to this gorgeous rich
shimmery navy from the Navy Yard duo and
I used that under the wing and just
pretty much smudged all across the lower
lash line and I thought it might be fun
to take the lightest and sorry switching
back and forth so much but the livest
end of the BRV blue I use that to
overlap the innermost part of my lower
lash line and just kind of encircle the
tear duct area and then I used black
mascara top and bottom some Ardell
whispies on my upper lashes and the
finished look I think it's just a lot of
fun it kind of makes me think of that
Unicorn vibe you know on the upper part
of the eye with that pinky peach and the
Blues side-by-side but then I loved the
intensity of the deeper blue on the
lower lash line and then earlier in the
week I did a really bright look I worked
in like three of these I did some of the
yellow from the Jet Set blonde on my eye
and then I worked in the blue from the
aqua aura duo and the purples for the
lower lash line I ended up with kind of
an unintentional Mardi Gras type look
but those shades were so well liked you
know that look at the end of the day
look the same as it did right at the
start so I was so proud of how well
these lasted the other look that I did
that I really liked I just did some
matte neutral shadow in the crease and I
popped cool ivory on my lids I think it
was mostly this champagne shade and then
I used a little bit of the lightest one
more toward the inner corner and that
was a really pretty look as well because
this pops so much really more than most
like powdery shadows in the same tone my
and I just thought that was gorgeous and
it wore really well for me too
so I loved to see so much consistency in
this line with the way that they wear
the colors are really fun even if you're
more into the neutrals I think there's
something in this line for you as well I
just wanted to mention of the ones that
I've used so far I really really liked
cool ivory because I think these are
just great shapes to have in this format
these light shimmery tones they're fun
to pop on the lid I decided to play with
that yellow some more throughout the
summer it's just a fun color that I
don't work with as much and I think it's
hard to find really strong yellow powder
shadows but in this cream it's really
good and then Navy Yard this beautiful
shimmery Navy is so gorgeous and some
navies get too close to black and they
don't even show up as Navy but this one
really had some pretty blue in there and
then I like the peachy pink on this
other end but a couple of shades that I
haven't use yet that I suspect I'm going
to love would be the sunset fire duo if
for a nice orange you look and then mint
detox I think those greens are top-notch
but I do love shady violet too I forgot
about that one this one was so pretty to
work with on my lower lash line the
other day
now these liners the infallible paints
liners here we have six shades you've
got a black you got a white and then
everything else is more of like a
greenish blue there's this forest green
there are a couple of blue shades that
are you know really intense blue these
are felt-tip liners
I do really like the way it's a pretty
long felt-tip so if you're one like me
who kind of likes to lay these on their
side to go across your lash line you can
definitely take advantage of that and
there's not that steep jump off well I
like the tips of these they're not maybe
quite as juicy as I would like them to
be because I do think it's a little bit
harder going across a cream shadow
that's set than it is to go across a
powder shadow like there's just a little
more texture that these have to go
across so if you are thinking of pairing
these with these creams you might notice
that a little bit of difficulty it's
like a little bit of a tug across the
lash line also a small complaint on the
white when I did a really colorful look
and I went all across my lash line with
this it definitely picked up some of
that color and instead of looking like a
stark white it picked up like some of
the blueish green color that I had used
on my eye that day so that was a little
bit disappointing I think if you're
going to use a white liquid liner you
might look for one that's more like
going out of an inkwell type design you
know what I mean that way there's just a
little more juicy liquid to go across it
and I think the felt tip kind of it
creates a little more friction across
the eyelid and can pull some color up
but one of these shades you know might
be exactly what you're looking for they
are some kind of unique and different
colors I'm excited to use this wild
green it's like a really nice forest
green something else that I did notice
just in the swatch is on my hand if you
just get a little bit of liquid in touch
with these they can break down kind of
easily so they don't feel like a full-on
waterproof liquid liner to me so keep
that in mind if that's your expectation
this blush palette absolutely love this
blush palette and I had walked past this
in the store and I think I've seen it
online and just for whatever reason
assumed it was a cream blush palette I
think they made these shades so like
intense and so mad it's like you glanced
at them and you don't even see like that
powder stamping you know like the little
texture that the top of the powder has
if you look really close at it you can
see the little lines but at a glance it
just seems like solid creams but these
are really nicely pigmented matte
blushes and too
day with my look I chose to use some of
this peach color thought it gave a nice
fresh pop to the cheeks I've used that
multiple times and really enjoyed it and
then I worked in a little bit of this
rosy shade down here at the other end
and I used that a bit lower on the
cheeks and just kind of blended the two
together in between those two those
you'll see in my swatches you've got a
really bold coral and then more of a
bright pink and these shapes they don't
apply like exactly as intense as they
look in the palette and for me you know
that's good for blush I don't want to
have like a bat tone of pinking on my
cheeks but that color is pink sheared
out can look so fresh and beautiful they
give you a teeny tiny brush here that's
of course one of those blunt cut way too
small to do anything tight brushes so
I'm not really sure why they bothered
with that but in terms of the quality of
these blushes this was really nice to
see now if you strictly like to use
peachy tones and you don't think you get
use out of the Pink's here or vice versa
this may not be for you you may be
better off just grabbing one individual
blush out there but if you really tend
to enjoy bouncing back and forth between
all of these tones I think you might
like this palette because the
pigmentation is really strong but yet
it's not overpowering not difficult to
work with on the cheeks so I loved that
it was very impressed another thing that
I was so happy with from this line is
the formula in these infallible paints
lip colors the best way I can describe
these would be if you took a lipstick
like a solid cream lipstick and like
melted it down in the microwave I feel
like that's what you would have here
because these are a shiny like lip
lacquer type of feel but they're not
sticky at all for the fullness of color
that all of these have I'm really
surprised that they're not more thick
and sticky and uncomfortable because
they're so opaque you'll see that in the
Trion they're just really true to the
outer color that you see here on the
plastic they're definitely far from
being one of those liquid lipsticks that
sets dry and matte I mean there's no dry
down with these they're just like a
creamy more toward a gloss but a very
like I said full color opaque type
blonde I was imagining that these would
be that format where you take the cap
off and because this you know looks and
feels like a squeezy tube it might
squeeze up through a little dough
foot type thing but you actually have a
wand and doe foot applicator here and
the way the applicator is it's almost
like a little scoop and more often than
not with these I feel like I can apply
it and not have to go back for more
product because that scoop actually
holds a decent amount so with pretty
much one swipe I get full color from a
glassy type texture all over my lips and
I don't have to go back for more that's
kind of a big deal and the comfort on my
lips you know they're just thick enough
to hang in there but not so thick that
they feel uncomfortable and when I look
up close at my lips like this shade the
spicy blush and this was the first one I
was really drawn to there isn't really
one that I think so many like any person
could really wear and I look up close at
my lips and they just look perfect it's
like that perfect not too shiny but not
matte and dry either it's just like the
best balance
so yeah the formula on these is just
delightful it's just a matter of which
shades do you like but I'm going to go
through and try all these on for you I'm
going to be pretty quick with my
descriptions and then I'll go back and
tell you about some other favorites that
I have but that spicy blush pretty
unbeatable if you're a new lip fan it's
nude with a hint of pink kind of a dusty
pink though definitely not like a bright
cupcake type pink what is a cupcake type
pink though I don't even know what I
mean by that nude star is going to be
that spice type color you know a little
bit deeper but still very neutral then
we've got topless and this is your
grayish neutral shade not sure how
comfortable I am with that color
personally but it's definitely one of
those trendy shades that a lot of people
are into right now now getting more into
the pink family we've got Wild Rose this
one strikes me as like Barbie pink it's
true pink by the way no shimmer in any
of these shaven fearless fuchsia
I love how intensely bright this is I
think with a super simple eye this would
be such a pretty shade and then for a
richer berry shade we've got sultry
sangria I think this is stunning as well
this is a type of shade I'm typically
drawn to like in fall and winter several
orangie red shades in this range we've
got cool quarrel that strikes me is just
a straight up orange sometimes I think
of
corrals is having a little more pink
involved but this is just very orangie
but then orange gets even more saturated
with the orange envy shade you know just
a deeper take on that same kind of tone
but both are very pretty very on point
for this time of year and then DIY red
is going to be a warm red definitely one
of my favorites out of this whole
collection I think it just totally pops
on the face and I would give this one a
little bit of a blot some of the fullest
color ones here I feel more comfortable
blotting them off so I don't have as
much shine or as much risk of them
wearing outside the lip now we got some
purples lilac lust just an absolute pure
true lilac shade I actually kind of like
that one I might actually consider
blending it in with this next one violet
twist totally love this shade it's like
a purpley with a little bit of a very
involved there so I think that makes it
a little more wearable in my eyes
bewitching Bordeaux like we're talking a
dark kind of vampy purpley shade this
one might have been the only case where
I thought the application was a little
bit on the streaky side so I had to be a
bit more careful with the way I built
this up because you don't want too much
product on because then it can actually
look even more streaky but you just want
a nice evenness of color so for the fact
that this one is so dark it was a bit
harder to achieve so then we've got a
couple blues here we've got domineering
teal it's just heel it's so odd to try
to describe these because they really
are what you see is what you get there's
not a lot of further description needed
this is teal for your lips and then Navy
spy beautiful Navy lip color I like this
so much more than I expected I would and
oddly enough I didn't feel like this was
a streaky as the bewitching Bordeaux
shade so I'm not sure what's happening
formula wise there they feel the same
but this one just applied more evenly so
while there are some fun shades in here
that are really fun to play with and
just like see how they look on your face
my three favorites just for wearability
things that I realistically think I'm
going to get good use out of and I just
love these colors they would be the
spicy blush fearless fuchsia that's the
brightest pink in this collection and I
see that just being awesome with a
simple eye like we're just talking a
winged liner and maybe some lashes
than that on the lips and that's
gorgeous and I also love violet twists
and that my friends is all from this
l'oreal paints line again some really
impressive things happening I absolutely
love what's going on with those cream
shadow duo's and how you have the time
to have some blend ability with them but
yet they set and they wear so well
throughout the day they're so true to
the color you expect that you're going
to get with them and same deal with the
lip colors here too I mean was it not a
total what you see is what you get with
these different colors so I love the
formula I think it looks really nice and
juicy on the lips if you do opt for one
of the more bold or deep shades I think
you may want to blot it off just a
little bit just so you don't risk you
know that color transferring off because
obviously it is a glossy finished
product blush palette is money I love
this I think it's just beautiful I like
this bright shade range but I like that
they're still easy to put on and they
actually are something that I could see
myself wearing on a daily basis the
eyeliners like I said you might try them
out if you're looking for one of those
really specific colors that felt-tip
particularly on top of some of these
creme shadows after they set that felt
it doesn't glide quite as nicely along
the upper lash line as I would like so
thank you guys so much for your time
today I hope this video was useful if
you hadn't yet really investigated the
infallible paints line I definitely
think there are some cool things to look
into here so thanks for watching I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
