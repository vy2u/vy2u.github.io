those of you who last week said you were
sick just like me are starting to feel
better now this video is so much fun I'm
so excited about this um lip gloss lip
gloss is making a complete comeback in
my life I don't know if I'm gonna call
this video like lip gloss Renaissance
lip gloss takeover
lip glosses rediscovered I don't know
cuz what happened I got some new lip
glosses sent to me as part of a PR
package just trying on tons of them was
like uncovering one shade after the next
where I'm like oh my gosh this makes my
lips look amazing I love this I
love this shade and I was realizing I've
been in a matte place for far too long
with lip colors and I'm just ready to
embrace that shine again you know that
shine that kind of gives some fullness
to the lips gives some life to the face
I'm like yes if you can find a
comfortable formula that you can really
get on board with a lip gloss is amazing
and I'm not saying I'll never wear a
matte lipstick again or a liquid
lipstick or whatever but lip glosses
have been ignored for far too long in my
collection for a big period of time here
and so they're coming back so anyway
after I tried those new ones that were
in the PR package one thing led to
another and I was digging through my
drawers and it was just a total like
moment of makeup excitement you know
where you're just in it you're not
thinking about anything else you're just
playing you're trying stuff on you're
having fun it's what makeup is supposed
to be I was having one of those moments
so I was going through my drawers and
kind of reevaluating all my other lip
glosses too and I'm like I don't really
like that so much ooh this is really
great and I feel like what I'm coming to
in this video is like a mini Emily
Awards like super specific focusing on
all sorts of little subcategories of lip
glosses because I am geeking out on lip
glosses people and they are back and
they are back in my life and yeah a lip
gloss is not gonna last as long as a
liquid lipstick that being said I don't
mind reapplying these like I really
don't mind it that much since when did
reapplication have to be like such a
frowned upon thing I guess since when do
we need a certain product to last us 12
hours throughout a day without being
touched I feel like I'm on a soapbox
like shouting to the masses I've been
watching the crown you know I feel like
I'm like on a balcony speaking to the
people you know I am all
for even if you're out somewhere without
a beautiful mirror reapply your lip
gloss who the heck cares get that fresh
application on your lips I mean most of
these even will last me a good chunk of
a morning you know but you don't have
that look where with the liquid lipstick
maybe you're just settling with it by
the end of the day you're like yeah it
is like 75% worn off of my lower lip
right now but you know it's still
partway there so I'm just gonna be okay
with it with lip glosses it's like no be
fully satisfied get that completely new
and wonderful application all over again
when you reapply I am so fired up about
this guy's and I want to know in the
comments section what's your favorite
lip gloss what do I need to look into if
you've watched the whole video through
and you realize I've missed something
like there's there's something else out
there that needs to be uncovered by me
let me know about that what are your
favorite shades have you also been
ignoring lip glosses are you ready to
get back on the train with me because I
am I'm all for it and no I don't have
any like weird motivation with this I'm
not in cahoots with it he's like look
look like I'm just excited about lip
gloss again now the brand that sent me
the big PR package which I had
snapchatted about and not in an
informational way at all it was just
purely cuteness like Yves was helping me
take him out of the box and she's all
about putting things in bags taking them
out of bags and so the unboxing thing is
just really her best life right now so
we were looking at these new Lancome
glosses and these are fantastic and I've
been playing with them there's such a
big range and they've got like different
finishes within the range but what I've
kind of settled on is that I really am
in love with the ones that have this
little bit of shimmer in there and I
wouldn't call them a metallic gloss but
they're a glossy finish with like micro
fine shimmer embedded in them not any
kind of like chunkiness that you'll ever
feel on your lips you would never know
it's there only by looking really up
close you'll know it's there but it
gives the shine on your lips like this
extra dimension it's like this gloss
gets an unfair advantage because not
only is it shiny but it's got that
little bit of shimmer in it and it's
beautiful and so they've got a lot of
great glosses in this line again they've
even got some that are like I think they
call them Velvets and they don't even
have that much shine but they're really
beautiful on the lips too and some are
just creamy with absolutely no shimmer
but the ones that I found myself just
like having that huge AHA like oh my
gosh I love lip gloss again moments with
are the ones with the bit of shimmer so
like the one that you'll see me in
throughout the video is this number 351
and I'll look up I'm sure there's a name
associated with these but the number on
the bottom all they're giving me here is
the 351 and so this I see is my your
lips but better wear it absolutely any
time kind of gloss and you have to get
up really close to yourself looking in
the mirror to see that hint of sparkle
that's in this that little bit of
shimmer it does not come off metallic at
all but it's giving the shine like
something extra and it makes my lips
look so full so healthy and this is just
the kind of shade where it's giving me
that feeling like where have you been
glosses this is what needs to be on my
lips this is what truly makes my lips
look the best regardless of trends
regardless of whatever like this is my
best look moving on another great shade
and this would be the category I said I
was gonna do this kind of like Emily
awards style I should back it up a
little bit I'm calling this category I
guess best glosses with a little shimmer
so three dimension here from this line
272 is another awesome shade I love the
richness of this shade it's warm it's
kind of rosy the shimmers didn't have
kind of a golden tone so it's really
really pretty it's another nice everyday
shade and then I was so surprised at my
love for this number 383 which looks
like a hot pink it looks like has this
really cool tone sparkle I can't tell if
it's maybe a little turning toward blue
or if it's just a cool pinky sparkle in
this but your lips don't come out
looking exactly like this hot pink but
it's like this veil of pink this veil of
life and shine and beautifulness when
you come away from that gloss so I am
just nuts about these these are the ones
out of a whole big lineup of literally
dozens of new Lancome glosses that I
tried on I'm loving these that have that
little bit of shimmer and it's taking me
back also years back in my channel I'm
gonna say like maybe four years ago
or something like that there was a
Lancome gloss that had shimmer and shine
to it shimmer and shine sorry Belle
really likes that cartoon but it had
like a lot of dimension to it and I love
that gloss I remember loving that you're
gonna see a couple other at Lancome
glosses turn up in my little lineup of
favorites here my next category is like
actual moisturizing glosses if you're
thinking about getting on board with
these moisturizing glosses you've kind
of got to be okay with a little bit of
thickness because there's a level of
thickness in both of these that I think
gives you the hydration it's a fine line
right you might be thinking doesn't any
gloss feel moisturizing just because
it's kind of you know it has a slippery
nature to it but no I truly think there
are some glosses that are offering
something back to your lips like even
after they've worn off you can tell that
they've treated your lips in some way
and by the way I should have mentioned
more the texture on these Lancome
glosses is fantastic it's like it's not
too thick not too thin it feels really
pleasant it hangs in there on the lips
even more colorful shades that I've worn
that are outside of the realm of what
I've just mentioned here are really nice
like you can wear them with confidence
they're not slippery at all but back to
my moisturizing ones one of them that I
love is this Neutrogena hydro boost
hydrating lip shine I'm gonna be
mentioning some specific shades that I
love you know throughout the rest of
this video but I'm sure there are others
in the line that you might like as well
but this shade is berry Brown and it's a
really soft kind of nude color but it
says hydrating lip shine lips look and
feel hydrated for 24 hours I don't know
about 24 hours that's a huge claim for a
gloss like I definitely need a
reapplication in there for it to be that
way for 24 hours but it has hyaluronic
acid in it the applicator is like really
wide but it carries a lot of product on
it which I like and to me the shade is
just a really nice creamy nude
definitely some thickness to it but
you're getting something back from that
you know it's hydrating and then I love
this one from julep this is the ultra
hydrating lip gloss in the shade work
and this is a pretty kind of Mavi berry
color the applicator here it's kind of
that hourglass shape where the tip is
really carrying a lot of product and you
can actually have a lot of precision
with this it maybe feel slightly less
thick than the Neutrogena but still a
lot of moisture a lot of comfort with
these glosses and the thickness is
almost like a protective barrier on your
next category that I want to discuss is
nude lip gloss I think we need a
category devoted to the best nude gloss
because so many times you will select
the nude gloss it will be too sheer and
you'll feel like well I just ended up
with sheer kind of colourless lip gloss
right so when you want the nude and you
really want it to show up as a nude
color on your lips like one and done
which is pretty much what all of these
glosses are to me are a one and done
step I don't feel the need to pair them
with a certain lip liner or put them
over a certain lipstick like it's a one
step thing so the best nude gloss from
the drugstore is the L'Oreal infallible
paints in the shade spicy blush my
goodness is this a beautiful shade it's
not gonna be that you race your lips
sort of concealer nude it's got a little
rosiness to it but I think it's that
sort of new found nude for a lot of
people you know that instead of just
making your lips look blank they just
look natural it's a nice formula too and
as you wear this particular formula some
of the shine is gonna sort of died down
and you're still gonna be left with a
lot of color now got a couple tones of
nude from a high-end brand this is again
from the Lancome formula I uncovered
both a traditional nude and then more of
a pinky that I love so so much again the
formula here is great it's really
comfortable it's got just enough
thickness just just enough cling to the
lips you're not gonna be wearing this
gloss and like really thinking about it
all day you know it's gonna have that
smoothness that glosses have but it's
not at all annoying and I love this 202
shade because this is traditional nude
done so so right I feel like it's maybe
a little lighter and a little less pinky
than the infallible paint spicy blush
but it's just a great like straight-up
standard nude you're looking for a nude
gloss you get a nude gloss like that's
what that is
and then this other shade this pinky
color is 213 and I just oh this is
taking me back to the days when I was
trying to have that Kim Kardashian
Turkish Delight from NARS
you know lip color what I love about
both of these light shades that I'm
showing you is that they're not streaky
they're capable of being light being
opaque being just beautiful and soft and
I just think that's the perfect soft
pink kind of nude pink
shade my next category here is for a
fully 100% opaque gloss okay so you want
the glossy finish on your lips but you
want absolutely 100%
what-you-see-is-what-you-get color like
you want that color in the tube that's
exactly what you're going to get on your
lips so these are brands you know I'm
gonna give you a couple examples here
but I think these are brands that you
can look to and I've tried enough to
where I can say with confidence
I think whatever shade you pick you're
gonna get the color you want you're
gonna get that exact shade that you
think you should be getting judging by
the look of the tube so first off
Anastacio this has been an Emily award
winner this past year at a shade I've
got here is vintage this is a very like
workable I think best-selling shade from
their line just that dusty rose color
that about any person can get away with
wearing but it's exactly the color you
expect to get it's sort of thin but yet
it does have some cling to your lips and
even when you do again lose some shine
from this shade I think you'll find a
lot of color still hanging around to
compare it to the Lancome formula I feel
like it's a little bit less thick but
they're pretty close so I kind of see
why I like them both so much but with
the Anastacio I just feel like shade
after shade that I've tried they're just
SuperDuper full color so if you want the
color and you also want the shine one
step you want to look to the Anastasi of
glosses or a great drugstore alternative
here then nyx intense butter glosses
again a full kind of glosses where I
feel like you could pick for any one of
them and they're going to give you a
really consistent result here and being
what you see is what you get colors so
the shade I'll be showing you on my lips
is spice cake this happens to be a
really intense color a nice beautiful
berry and it's going to show up non
streaky exactly that color all over your
lips it's not a real thick gloss in fact
I would say this formula is pretty close
to the anastacio honestly want to give a
little shout out to something with an
awesome applicator because as we know
with lip glosses the applicator is
really important an amazing applicator
can just make the experience make the
whole process that much better and the
makeup forever artist plexiglas --is
this is another great formula that I
would I would put in that last category
for being something that's very full
color very what you see is what you get
there really it
the fullness maximum color there's no
real Sheerness here unless you select
certain shades in their line that are
just kind of more transparent but this
number 204 is another one of those
classic like you know I'd hand it to my
mom I'd say here mom very safe very like
workplace friendly but the special thing
about this is the applicator it's almost
like a little spatula like a little
paddle here and there's definitely an
ability to turn that and get like a line
on the outside of your lips like you can
really take it right out to the edge
with such confidence that you're not
gonna go outside that line you know and
the way it gently curves inward
it also hugs your lips at the same time
it's a really well thought out
nicely done applicator if you're just
looking to experience something a little
bit different that would be a great one
to try final category we're gonna chat a
little bit about lip plumpers because I
think lip plumpers are a real thing I'm
not into painful lip plumpers but I
don't mind some minty tingle and that's
what both of these are offering me from
the drugstore the new Milani keep it
full line is really really nice they
smell like mint chocolate kind of like
around Christmas time I had some of
those mint M&amp;amp;Ms and it's such a strange
sensation because as you bring this
toward your mouth and you're kind of
getting to the scent of that formula
it's like the same vibe I was giving
what I was putting those mint M&amp;amp;Ms
shovelin those into my mouth but this
shade that I have here you saw it in a
recent video if you watched my Milani
one but it's soft rose and surprisingly
opaque with this color and it's giving
me a really nice nude look the tingle
here with this is very soft it's like
entry-level Lipton hope you know it's
like a little bit of minty coolness I
don't know that it's physically like
taking my lips and making them fuller
but the texture of the gloss is
definitely I think cancelling out lines
in the lips and making it look really
smooth and full and then if you want to
kind of graduate from that level of
plumping check out the buxom line this
is a mini by the way of this shade
called cherry flick which i think is
outstanding beautiful color I also love
white Russian I'm really partial to
their line of lip creams you're really
feeling that tingle a little bit more
not at all painful but it's a minty
tingle it's very refreshing and I do
think the texture of the gloss is such
much alike the Milani
just smooths over the lips and you might
say well a lot of glosses do that but I
do think there's kind of something
special happening here I feel like that
tingle is actually like the lips are
plumping someone so everyone that's what
I've got I have been digging through lip
glosses in my collection these are what
have emerged as new favorites and
rediscovered favorites they here like I
hadn't used NYX butter gloss intense for
god knows how long and now I'm kind of
realizing how great those were the
Lancome stuff that has come out recently
they've got some fabulous stuff in that
line just so many good things and the
fun thing about lip gloss is it's kind
of a one and done thing when you find a
really good lip gloss sure you can
create whatever cocktail of products you
want with liners and lipsticks and
layering but one thing that I really
love about everything I've talked about
here is that I consider it great with no
strings attached
no added products you can just put it on
enjoy it no it's not gonna wear like a
liquid lipstick and I think that can be
a good thing in a lot of respects so
