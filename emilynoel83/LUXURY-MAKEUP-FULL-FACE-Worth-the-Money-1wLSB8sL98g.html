been getting more requests than ever
lately to feature more luxury brand
makeup on my channel I'm talking brands
that are maybe not so much smashbox on
to face but maybe some giorgio armani
YSL Tom Ford and that's exactly what I'm
bringing you in this video I do
understand the desire to know whether or
not products like this are really that
much better than the products you buy at
the drugstore
I am extremely familiar with what's
happening in the drugstore and really a
lot of other brands too but then this
upper echelon you know price range of
makeup is just something I have not
dabbled in quite enough and I do think
there's value in that because you
understand like how things compare how
similar or how different different price
ranges can be and I will definitely tell
you honestly if I think they're good or
if I think we're just paying for a name
here or some really fancy packaging
because there is some fabulous packaging
happening in front of you right now but
yeah I just thought I'd do a full face
with all this stuff this is not my first
time using these products I have been
experimenting with them on and off for
about the past week and a half two weeks
and by all means if there are things
that you would like me to use beyond
what you see me using in this video if
you want to make some requests or
recommendations to me in the comments
section I am all ears I would be happy
to do this kind of video again or just
sprinkle in more luxury product reviews
on my channel and I am by no means
abandoning the drugstore like that is my
home I just really do want to be
offering you guys more information and
just maybe be able to draw some better
comparisons on my channel so let's jump
in first thing that I've got here is the
Giorgio Armani power fabric foundation
I've heard some great things about this
in terms of coverage and staying power I
have it in the shade 5 and it says
broad-spectrum SPF 25 flames on this
just kind of looking back at what I had
read originally on sephora's website
full coverage liquid foundation that
perfects with a velvet matte lightweight
second skin finish and it says through
Armani beauty's own micro fill
technology powerful ultra fine pigments
are shaped to provide the highest
coverage foundation with the thinnest
and lightest texture and it claims 16
hour wear I don't think I've experienced
mind-blowing staying power with the
foundation I mean it's been present on
my skin I think but I feel like a very
minor amount of oil like that I will
have sometimes around my nose broke it
down fairly easily then again I didn't
set it super heavily any time that I've
used it but they don't claim that you
need to anyways so we've got the pump
here beautiful looking foundation just
to look at it in the bottle I'm gonna do
about a pump and a half of this again
I'm in shade 5 and I'm just going to
start by dabbing this around my skin how
I normally do I will say like I like
this foundation better than the luminous
silk that was one that like looked
pretty on the skin but I just I don't
know I couldn't constitute the price tag
being so high but with this the coverage
really is there I mean you can see that
just really doing good things for any
little spots even around circles
it blends out super easily it does not
feel sticky on the skin although there
is I don't know a real feeling of
moisture there it doesn't feel dry at
all my nose area is kind of dry earlier
but it doesn't look to be clinging too
much maybe a little bit around the
outsides of the nose I would say the
coverage is really quite beautiful I'm
thinking to drugstore brands that could
achieve this coverage like the L'Oreal
that really total cover infallible
version of L'Oreal foundation that one
most definitely can achieve the full
coverage place but I feel like you have
to be a lot more careful with the
application it's not just this silky
smooth super easy kind of foolproof
application for concealer I got this YSL
all ours concealer and I have it in the
shade 2 ivory this could not look more
like just a really standard
run-of-the-mill concealer here with the
very classic doe foot applicator you
know just a twist off cap nothing
insanely fancy happening here it's a
very thin concealer we're talking
thinner than a tart shape tape I like
using this shade really kind of down the
center of the face you know on any areas
that I want to kind of pull out and
brighten I'm using my pro mini flawless
airbrush here and I just kind of like
the way this spreads it across the skin
but this for being as thin as it is I
think it has really impressive coverage
my one gripe with this concealer is that
I find it to be kind of drying I don't
set it like overly much with anything I
feel like I look at that area later in
the day and the concealer yes it's
totally still there it's perfectly in
place but it looks kind of dry but it
doesn't set too quick it's not like hard
for me to blend out at all I'm not
struggling whatsoever and look at the
coverage that had without really using
any sort of peachy tone corrector you
know granted I did have some good
coverage delivered by the foundation so
it's not really a coverage complaint
here it's not a texture complaint like
right at the onset it seems so
lightweight but I think there is just
some dry
down with this concealer quite a bit of
it and you're gonna notice if you have
like any little fine lines or any kind
of crepey areas there like I I have
definitely noticed every time I've worn
this and I've worn it probably five
times so far every time I've I've had
that look at myself a little bit later
in the day thinking hmm examples of
concealers that don't give me that look
would be like the benefit erase paste or
the Anastacio concealer you know a
creamy concealer that offers a little
moisture back to the skin as well as
coverage I think that's a really good
thing to be able to lay your hands on
now something I forgot in this haul I
forgot to get like a powder just a
standard powder and I could definitely
do this look without adding any powder
really like I've got this overall matte
look but I am gonna add a little powder
from a very high-end brand that I
already had and it's the by Terry
hyaluronic hydra powder gonna revisit
this thing again this is one of the
ultimate like finest powders in my
collection by far one of the fights that
I've ever used it really goes airborne
like I don't know if you can see that
that's just like just a super fine
powder and I find I really have to make
a point of getting it on the brush and
then really pressing it onto the skin as
opposed to really dusting back and forth
or else I do feel like I lose some of
the powder to the air it's crazy but
this really does blur a lot in terms of
pores just imperfection on the under eye
area but even wearing this on top of
that YSL concealer it is generally
speaking is not a drying looking powder
like it's whole basis is to kind of
rehydrate the skin through the powder
but even when I just put a light amount
on top of that concealer like I said
late in the day afternoon hours I'm
still seeing that concealer quite a bit
the next thing I got here is the girl on
terracotta Sun trio palette in natural I
have tried a bronzer from this line
before it was a very like oranjee
bronzer on me but I saw this and I
thought this might be really workable
see how it's got just this lighter kind
of I think you might call it a highlight
shade but it is matte and then these
other two matte colors here as well so
I'm gonna apply a little bit of just
this main shade that's happening here on
the bottom and just get that going here
on my skin it's a pretty bronzer I mean
I've used this I'm now dabbing into just
a little bit of the deep shade - I've
been wearing this a little bit and I
don't really have any complaints about
it honestly it's just a pretty bronzer
this is the kind of product where if I
did you know one of those half high-end
half drugstore face videos I think I
could totally duplicate what this is
doing on my skin with a lower cost
bronzer
it's pretty and it's pigmented and it's
smooth and it's matte
you know it's really got a lot of
qualities that I like but there are some
really low-cost browsers that can
achieve it too for example I would say
I'm no happier with my finished look
that I'm getting from this than I am
with my lorac contouring palette Plus
that has more shades and the lighter
shades have more like I don't know they
pick up more color this light shade here
it's kind of hard to I don't know I'm
just dabbing a little bit on here just
to show like it doesn't really do a
whole lot I think to me it seems almost
like more of a mix or shade like if you
want to lighten up any part of this
bronzer you can just kind of swirl your
brush in it okay now what I got as a
blush or what I intended to be a blush
came from this Burberry beauty box so it
had something in here and it's called
dark earthy blush well getting it home I
think this might be a fine contour shade
but this is just not blush on me at all
so I'm just gonna go to an expensive
blush that I already have this is from
Marc Jacobs and it's the one called
night fever and hot stuff and this blush
I do think is gorgeous I love this combo
of shades it's looking like kind of a
burgundy kind of brick-red
paired with a really hot pink and you
can use varying amounts of either side
depending on if you go more toward this
end or this end so I'm going to just
sort of tap my brush right here in the
middle tap off the excess and swirl this
a bit here on the outer part of the
apple of my cheek
it's a really pretty blush with kind of
a satin finish on the skin
I feel like I've been using a lot of
more neutral blushes lately so it's kind
of fun to have that pop right now I'm
liking that really gorgeous shade love
that and then something I will be using
from that little Burberry set is this
fresh glow luminous fluid base I don't
know if they mean by that this could be
like a primer but as I was watching this
out on my hand I thought it was gorgeous
and I thought it might make a really
pretty just highlight on top of this
look so this is a mini size and I'm just
gonna sort of sheer it out a bit on my
hand here so we're dealing with a very
very soft pearl effect this is not gonna
be anything drastic highlighter wise and
then I'm just gonna use this high
cheekbone highlighter from Sigma and dab
this a little bit right in this zone
it's just adding the lightest bit of
luminosity there nothing nothing too
heavy and like I said this may not even
be the intended function of the product
but it certainly does help all this
madness that we've got going on on the
skin right now it kind of I don't know
it gives a little more life to the face
so I just snuck in a little elf brow
pencil there I totally bypassed brows
when I was doing my little whole from
Sephora on all this stuff just didn't
even think about brows so yeah sorry
about that you guys are thinking yeah
there had to be some elf on your face
today okay eyes I got a Tom Ford quad
this is in Coco Mirage and I will say it
looked a bit more compelling to me on
the website than it does in person I'm
not saying this is not a pretty palette
in person please ignore my chip nail I
haven't had the chance to deal with it
yet you know I've gotten that neutrals
here matte cream this brown that seems
to be maybe mixed with a hint of
Burgundy and a little bit of shimmer
there as well it's a pretty palette like
just it's got a magnetic closure on it
it's got a great big mirror the size of
these shadows I think is generous now I
don't know when I was shopping for this
I mean these are a pretty penny and I
was thinking like I want to get one
it has shades that I will likely wear
quite a bit so I didn't want to go too
out there and not that many of the
options were even out there at all but I
just wanted to use something I thought
would give me my best shot of doing a
full eye look something I'd like
something I get use out of and then I
got this and I thought oh man it's ultra
ultra tame that's okay we're gonna go
ahead and use it I'm gonna use this
shade first in my crease and I have some
Milani eyeshadow primer on already and
these shadows like I said been playing
with them a little bit and they're nice
you know they work fine they blend
nicely I mean I've got to get past the
fact that these colors are so so common
in my collection I glanced at this and I
instantly think of that Maybelline quad
called
designer chocolates I think it was I
don't know if they even make that one
still but that was exactly this color
scheme to a tee like I think about my
new Too Faced palette that has like you
know these colors and then a bunch more
just having trouble seeing the total
worth in this I'm sorry but I'm gonna
blend over this shade a little bit and
these do go on very easily they're nice
textures to work with they don't seem to
generate a lot of fallout as I tap in
but they are plenty pigmented enough I
think I'll do a little bit of that cream
shade as well just right here on the
inner part of the lid
and then I want to take a little bit of
this shade right down here this kind of
burgundy ish Brown and Pat that on my
lid as well
thank goodness for this color in this
palette because it does it's kind of do
some interesting things I like seeing it
lighten up over that lighter shade
actually starts to look a little bit
like borderline ma wysz kind of pretty
this shade generates a little more
fallout than the others though and this
is the non matte and then I'm just using
my bear brush to blend over this a bit I
think I'll add a little bit of this
darkest Brown just right here in the
outer corner
say this look is classic textbook me as
far as the pattern of eyeshadow
application there but I just want to
show you you know how they go on there's
there's no problem with them they're not
bad I just I don't really know that this
particular quad of shades that I got
feels worth the price tag to me and I'm
going into this color right here and I'm
just getting a little bit of that down
on the lower lash line and then I've got
one of these Marc Jacobs highlighters in
rokoko here and it's kind of like a
taupe shimmer and I'm gonna give myself
a little bit of that like kind of a
bronzey shimmer I'm gonna do some of
this on my lower lash line and also I'm
going to get some of this in the lower
inner rim I really like these highliners
from Marc Jacobs I mean I think they are
so incredibly creamy the shade called
blacker is awesome and I think I'm going
to use that on the upper lash line
dabbing this down here on the lower
lashline and then we're going to smudge
it out with my smudge brush
look at in this nice smokiness going
there on the lower lashline I'm liking
that I mean I think you could find
similar liners that would do that but
that's a pretty look and then I'm gonna
go ahead and use blacker which is just
the straight-up black shade across my
upper lash line I remember first trying
this in a set of minis a couple holiday
seasons ago absolutely fell in love just
a really nice soft creamy gel eye pencil
next I think just to kind of soften up a
little bit I'm going into that Matt
Brown with an angled brush I'm just
gonna go over my upper liner a little
bit the thing about using pencil is like
I never like to really make it look like
I obviously just drew pencil on you know
sometimes it just no matter what it
looks like pencil but when you kind of
top it off with some shadow it just has
that little bit of softness next up I'm
gonna curl my lashes this is my
tweezerman eyelash curler by the way
this is the one I've been using for
months now and I think it is absolutely
worth I don't know 20 25 bucks for it
so good I've never found a lash curler
that fits my eye shapes so well I think
it claims to fit round eyes a little bit
better but it just really gets in touch
with the entire lash line so nicely and
then I have a lash primer I could not
resist this this is by Givenchy and it
is the base mascara perfecto
look at its a pink lash primer the
packaging could not be more gorgeous
there and yeah the product itself is
actually pink I mean the brush looks
absolutely choked with product there if
it's looking like there's a lot on there
there definitely is and what I have
found as I've put it on it does look
kind of chunky it's like just a glance
at what you've put on your lashes you
feel like oh that looks kind of clumpy
looks like a bit much but whatever
mascara I've put on top of it seems to
kind of like smooth it out I don't know
what's happening there because I
definitely do wait until this has gotten
dry because I don't want you know this
light shade to tint my mascara or
lighten up my black mascara is that
there's that all right there on the
upper lashes I really only care about
having this on my upper lashes right now
I have just gotten so congested here the
last couple days and it's not coming on
me like a like a cold does you know with
the sore throat all that stuff I just I
feel like it's maybe an allergy type
deal so can you tell but that's light
pink I think it's so funny so I'm gonna
make sure that gets a chance to dry and
I'm gonna do my lower lashes with
something I can count on today I'm using
my covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant
sorry need to do something I can trust
down here I just really like the way
this mascara you know defines the lower
lashes it lengthens them out darkens
them but it never gets too thick on
there the brush is easy to control now
the mascara that I'm gonna use is this
Burberry cat lashes jet-black this was
from that little set that I was
describing here so it came with that
glowy stuff the mascara the dark earthy
blush that I did not end up using in
this video and then there's a lipstick
in the shade
which is probably pretty similar to the
lipstick that I bought individually that
I'm going to be using in this video but
we'll get to that in a second for now
the cat lashes it's like an hourglass
shaped brush with rubber bristles I've
only used this one on top of this
particular primer so sadly I cannot tell
you how this works on its own but on top
of the primer do you see what I mean
like the primer seem chunkier and then I
put this mascara on and it kind of
smoothes it out hourglass shaped brushes
like I can deal with it with you know
Too Faced and the the L'Oreal voluminous
lashes pyridine zero like hourglass
there so you still feel like you're
really reaching all your lashes with the
entire brush this one dips in in the
center just a little too deep you know
and I don't feel like I'm making good
use of the center of the brush like I
feel like there are only two spots where
the brush is hitting my eye and it's
where it's more you know bulbous it is
nice and black but I'm getting a ton of
length I feel like out of that primer
and I'm just gonna need to work with
that primer some more try it with some
different mascaras and see exactly you
know how worthwhile it is my favorite
lash primer by the way has always been
the Estee Lauder little black primer
because I just I love first off that
it's so dang black and you don't have to
be as careful with like making sure you
top off each and every little spot it's
very easy to reach all your lashes with
the tiny brush that it has but also it
holds the curl so well and this one you
know I'm already seeing some sinkage
here and I
not quite sure right now if that's the
fault of the primer or the mascara I
feel like it's maybe the mascara the
formula seems just a little heavy
I can honestly tell you guys I am NOT as
impressed with the combination of these
two products as I am with just one coat
of l'oreal hash paradise it's the truth
I do want to pop a lash on with this
look I'm gonna be using my Koko lashes
in the style called Misha they're really
just fluttery and full as you can see so
I'm going to pop those on and I'll join
you for the lip okay I got some lashes
on there I just I don't know this look
is very classic there's nothing wrong
with it like would this not be a nice
like special occasion super formal
wedding look or something I'm just kind
of reinforcing some of this bright shade
there this light shade light beige right
here there are some decent applicators
in this little palette by the way and
then I'll just dust a little bit more of
this lightest shade I just want to see a
little bit more of that kind of on the
edge up here pretty colors very workable
I just feel like I can find them and
honestly find comparable quality in
about three dozen other places in my
collection now the lipstick that I have
first off I'll show you this Burberry
one this one is in the shade russet just
in case you were curious about what
comes in that set it's a creamy formula
lipstick looks like that's like kind of
a I don't know red with a little rust in
it now the lipstick that I got
specifically to use with this look after
looking at the whole selection of the
Tom Ford lipsticks I got one of these I
think the packaging is phenomenal it
looks great in this room this dark and
gold it's so lovely I chose the shade
called Casablanca this is not one of the
mattes it's just the straight-up
cream formula I believe and I was
expecting it to be just a little bit
darker and more reddish it's this shade
right here kind of just this rosy sort
of I don't know very all-purpose like
works for anything type color so I am
kind of pleased with that but I was just
expecting a little bit more red in this
color just from what I saw online
put this on my lips are so dry right now
but this heals I gotta say this feeling
on my lips this is what I would expect a
really expensive lipstick to feel like
like it is just so-so Burrage it's not
too thick as I wear this throughout the
day like it it has a nice cling to my
lips
I mean it's absolutely luxurious feeling
it's not far from feeling like a bite
amuse-bouche lipstick but this is truly
like the ultimate in creaminess I got a
saying I'm very picky about formulas on
lip products I don't want it sticky I
want it to be full color it's absolutely
like full color with one swipe no doubt
about it
smells amazing smells kind of vanilla
ish the one disappointment here why is
this not a magnetic closure I mean it is
a satisfying snap but why not the
magnetic closure there that would have
liked totally 100% made this product for
me but the color see what I mean it's
just kind of a rich rosy shade it's not
super reddish I think it could work on
darn near anybody for about any reason
like everyday wear totally works I'm
really glad I ended up with a shade like
that honestly my hair is still like kind
of drying from my shower last night but
finished look how do we feel about this
guys I mean I am not unhappy at all with
the way my skin looks right now I think
the coverage level is good the eye look
is fine it's just a matter of knowing
how many other things I have that could
executed that very same look what do we
think is really worth it I mean this
power fabric foundation I see the hype
behind this I see why this is a really
popular item I mean it totally did the
job on my skin and I do really like that
and I'll continue using that the all
hours concealer like I said impressive
to have that amount of coverage in that
fit of a formula but tart shaped tape
looks fresher on my skin like as I go
throughout the day and it still got
great coverage too not really sold on
the bronzer I just have a lot of other
things that could do what that does not
saying it wasn't nice but you know it's
not that unusual nothing in this
Burberry kit is realy shouting from the
rooftops like this is an awesome product
I mean I'm not saying that's not a
pretty lipstick or that glow thing
wasn't kind of cool but nothing was
really knocking my socks off I am a fan
of the Marc Jacobs eyeliners these
highliners and their are matte liners as
well you know these go on like a dream
that being said there are probably some
other things that I could dig up in my
collection that have a very smooth
application and great staying power how
these do last really nicely on me in my
lower inner rim and that is kind of a
special thing there so I do really enjoy
those I also really like this Marc
Jacobs blush I think that's a stunning
shade again I can pull off this kind of
cheek look though throughout my
collection with a lot of other things I
do quite enjoy this lipstick Horomia
though it is every bit as luxurious as I
hoped it would be I'm not sure how many
more of these I would repurchase I think
if you want something similar to this I
would look to bytes line but I do really
like the shade I'm just I'm happy with
the product I am so thank you guys so
much for taking time to watch and I hope
this was helpful for you I hope it just
gave you a little different perspective
from the girl who's always talking about
drugstore stuff a lot of times let me
know if you have any requests for other
products you'd like to see featured in a
video like this and I will see you very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
