reviewing a mascara from Lancome called
Hypnose mascara here and it's a new one
that I've been trying out now for
several weeks and I've also been using
the seals booster XL which is a product
you can use as a primer for the lashes
to kind of lengthen them more boost them
up and nourish them as well so I'm going
to be talking kind of about both of
these products I'm going to show you
some pictures of weather that will kind
of prove to you whether or not this
really makes a difference and I will
also take you through some application
tips showing you exactly and may have
one of the best methods to apply Lancome
Hypnose is or how it worked best for me
so just to start off this is a
traditional brush mascara I know we've
seen a lot of rubber brush mascaras
coming out recently but as you can see
this is what the brush looks like it's
got a lot of bristles and they're not
extremely long bristles so the brush is
a little bit bent I'm bent and probably
isn't really the right word but it comes
in just a little bit towards the middle
and it's a little more full on either
side I really like the way it then the
formula is very black so you put it on
and you don't get that sort of you know
like okay it looks black while it's kind
of wet but then it dries on your lashes
and it just looks kind of chalky or
lighter than it appeared this is truly a
black black mascara and the color I have
it in and it's actually called deep
black so you're really going to get that
rich dark look on your lashes I also
like the fact that it really separates
it gives you the look of a lot of volume
meaning a lot of lashes show up not just
you know each lash looks thicker or each
lash looks longer but you actually
appear to have a lot of eyelashes
because it manages to highlight them all
a lot of that comes from the application
which I'll get to more in a minute here
but um I was that was really what caused
me to pursue this mascara as an option
because I was reading the makeup by
Mario blog and I noticed that in a lot
of his get
look articles which he is a makeup
artist for Kim Kardashian in a lot of
situations and other celebrities as well
but he uses this mascara a lot so I was
excited to sort of see for myself if I
got the effect that I thought he was
getting when he used it on some of his
celebrity clients so I really like how
once again it thickens it lengthens it
volumizes
and it also really lasts all throughout
the day without flaking off on me I mean
I've worn this throughout newscast
throughout just random days and you know
it does not come off even if I put it on
the lower lashes like I have on there
today again I feel like I got a lot of
length a lot of volume with this mascara
so really really happy with that now
when we bring in the primer I'm going to
show you some pictures here one eye has
the primer on it and the hypnose and one
eye just has Lancome Hypnose on it these
were taken a couple days ago today all I
have on is Hypnose but you'll be able to
see a little bit what the difference is
with the seals booster on the one eye I
may have noticed a little more length
but I also didn't feel like I got quite
the separation that I get just with
Lancome alone
now it's not a really huge difference
and I think I really just like it better
with the Hypnose I wouldn't necessarily
say you have to run out and get this
although this is known to have some
nourishing qualities some people I was
reading on another sort of product
explanation of this that some people
like to wear this at night just as sort
of a lash fortifying treatment type
thing so you know if you feel like it's
getting your lashes in better condition
or keeping them nice and soft I guess
that's one thing but still even just
with Hypnose on there I mean I don't
have the feeling of hard rigid lashes
that are just gonna snap off or
something like that is that still
remains a very soft kind of flexible
feel to the lashes so you don't
necessarily need that to have the feel
that your life is are in good conditions
so that's one thing to keep in mind once
again I would really recommend this for
the fact that it's very rich in black it
gives you the look of a lot of lashes
but it also comes down to the
application and if this is a new product
for you and there's still a lot of
formula in the in the tube here and a
lot is coming off on the brush I do have
some application to with the application
and one thing you're going to want to do
first off is make sure that any excess
is off the tip of the brush something
you pretty much have to do with any
mascara you pull out just so that little
area when you get in with your inner
lashes it doesn't get clumpy then I'm
going to sort of look down into my
mirror and since this is sort of a fresh
new mascara instead of really wiggling
it and going quickly you know
wiggling it between my lashes I'm
actually going to go very slowly sort of
pressing the brush onto the lashes and
getting the most definition I can get
the most volume making more lashes stand
out when you go slower you really get
that you're probably seeing them show up
there on camera a little bit a slow
mascara application can really help and
if you feel like you are getting clumps
you know take a bear one of those bear
mascara brushes that you can get like
you know in little packages from Sally's
and stuff and kind of comb through again
but as you can see I've gone really
slowly through my lashes and I feel like
I'm getting the look of more lashes when
I do it like that if you want to go back
for another coat do it again but you
know go about it in the very same way
kind of just press the wand onto your
lashes going nice and slow really
helping to define each one potentially
there's a lot of formula that can get on
this brush and the more you get on there
sometimes the lashes kind of team-up
section off and go their own way so you
want the look of lots of lush lashes so
that's my tip for doing it and then for
the lower lashes I'm not big into like
hugely spotlighted lower lashes but so
you could get that look if you wanted to
but for me I'm just very lightly going
over that in much the same manner
because I really don't want a thick or
clumpy look on the lower lash you know I
am hugely impressed with this mascara
not only with how it looks and how it
gives you the look of a whole lot of
eyelashes but I also love that it wears
on and on throughout the day and you
continue to have that nice rich black
look to your lashes and you don't even
on your lower lash line I don't deal
with any sort of flaking off or smudging
if I were to give you a drugstore
alternative to this the closest thing I
would say I have used is the L'Oreal
voluminous mascara this is a really good
mascara d and honestly it gives a very
similar look to Hypnose hypnose gives a
little more length and it also I think
holds up a little better throughout the
day I will occasionally have a little
bit of flaking with the voluminous and
just it seems to maybe just not wear
quite as well maybe some of the little
microfibers that are in it don't
necessarily hang on or aren't sealed in
there quite as well once you put the
mascara honestly you get a little more
flaking with the voluminous not bad I
mean it's trust me if you really don't
want to spend what it takes to buy
Hypnose then go to your drugstore and
then buy this and you will come close
but once again this
really adds the length and it also has
the the fantastic staying power
throughout the day so that is my take on
hypnosis and the seals booster and sort
of an alternative the next best thing if
you want to pick it up from the
drugstore so thank you so much for
tuning in for this video and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
