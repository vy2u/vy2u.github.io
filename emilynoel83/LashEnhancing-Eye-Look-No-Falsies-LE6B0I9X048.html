tutorial is something that's it's kind
of hard to put into words to be honest
it's something that I came up with over
the past few days and I was realizing
hey I can get a really good effect with
my lashes if I just tweak a few of the
techniques that I do with my eyeshadow
and my eyeliner and I'm someone who
really likes to use false lashes
I love primarily the lifts that they
give the eye just this nice like kind of
upturned wide-awake and look but for me
to have kind of an alternate look that I
can go with that still makes me feel
really content very pleased with the way
my lashes look and just the whole effect
of the overall eye if I can be happy
with that especially with my less than
amazing natural lashes and I think we're
onto something here we've got a good
thing going I will be using my in the
balm of your hand palette for this look
but this is something where you could
plug in absolutely any shadows you have
so you'll want like a light kind of
shimmery shade or metallic color and
then a deeper matte shade and then also
some things that can really spotlight
your look it could even be a face
highlighter we're essentially using
shadow to create the lift that lashes
can give us when someone might see you
from a distance and that you know you've
got those false lashes on and you've got
this beautiful almost like cat eyed
effect out here we're going to use
shadow to do that and we're going to use
lighter shadows to create an absolute
like backdrop for the inner most lashes
and really help them stand out so here
is how I did it I've already applied a
little bit of eye primer on my lids
through the crease and up to the brow
and then shadow wise I do just want to
put a little wash of color in my crease
just so my crease is kind of accounted
for all the way from left to right we
will be focusing a much darker shade
really in the outer part of the crease
but I want everything to look nice and
seamless so I'm going to take Bahama
Mama here which is actually a bronzer
shade but it works perfectly as just
that classic neutral crease color and
I'm just going to work that into my
crease with my Sigma e25 brush I'm going
to go all the way to the inner corner
and just get a little depth going on
there and of course same thing over here
on the other side
so step two I went a little bit lighter
shade on the lid and I'm going to use
this pretty kind of like rose gold color
called mischievious Marisa and I'm just
going to pick that up with my son you
cash it in medium shadow brush and just
Pat that right here on the lid this
shade has such a pretty like golden
Sheen I just love it now the next thing
we want to do is bring in more darkness
and kind of create the illusion that
we've got a lash that is coming up like
this lifting our eye you know that
effect that you get when you've got a
great set of falsies on and you can
really recreate that just with the shape
of your eye shadows I'm going to use a
matte shadow I think that really works
best since we've got shimmer on the lid
this will create the best contrast so
any deep matte shade you like in this
palette it's this deep plum called sexy
so I'm going to pick that up with a
small crease brush this is from mua
makeup academy professional and it's a
315 I got it from CVS and I'm just going
to work this into the outer most part of
the crease I like using a small brush
here because I feel like I have tons of
control um the shadow is going to go
exactly where I place it and then I'm
going to kind of start working the
shadow almost in a bit of a point up
toward the tip of my eyebrow
now I'm also just using this little
brush you could pull in a flat brush too
but I find this fresh does a good job it
just looks really pretty when you
overlap a little bit of that kind of
peachy rose gold just on the outer part
of the lid kind of just helps the blend
of the whole look and I'm just gonna
take a bear brush and do just a little
bit of blending on the top part of where
I've applied this shadow but it really
doesn't require much I think it went on
pretty easily and then I'll just repeat
that same step over here
next up I'm choosing not to line my
upper lash line in the traditional sense
of like just going straight across the
lid because I do feel like that takes
away from the look of length with your
lashes but I am going to use my Milani
supreme Kohl Kajal eyeliner and actually
do like a little bit of tight lining
here and just take it kind of on the
upper inner rim and I kind of think of
this as just filling the gaps you know
if your lashes are maybe a little sparse
in some areas just applying the liner
right in this very you know fine and
kind of under the radar place does make
a little bit of a difference and I'm
also applying this pencil on my lower
inner rim and this is not necessarily
like a must-do step for this tutorial to
line your lower inner rim like this but
I think you know if I'm wanting just a
little more dramatic look or trying to
make it look a little more special and
different all - go ahead and do this
step and then on the actual skin your of
your lower lash line I like to apply a
little bit of liner there as well
because it just makes it look a bit less
stark and when we go over this with a
smudge brush and blend it it just looks
really soft and smoky so two of my
favorite lower lash line brushes first
off the Sigma e 21 smudge brush with
nothing on it I'm just kind of going
over where that creamy liner is
and then I'm going to use this pencil
brush which just has a bit more fullness
to it and I'll go into my dark like
burgundy plum and I'll just apply that
here mainly on the outer part of the
lower lash line
kind of connecting it up to what's
happening in our outer corner there on
the top
and finally as far as the shadow goes
I'm going to do a little bit of
strategic spot lighting with this look
and it's great to have mary lou manizer
in the palette this is a great
highlighter all over the face I do have
it kind of right in here on the top of
my cheek so we're going to put this
under the brow using my ELF this is the
blending brush I love this little brush
and I'm just gonna take that right up
here give us a little spot why then I've
got this little Sigma inner corner brush
any small detailed brush that you have
and enjoy it will do for this step gonna
again pick up a little mary lou manizer
and i'm going to brighten the inner
corner and i'm going to pull it up ever
so slightly right in this little zone
here
and this will fall into our strategy of
having a little lower lash shimmery
backdrop I'm going to take a little bit
of the mischievous Marisa a little bit
of the mary lou manizer and i'm just
going to dab those shades right here so
kind of right under the center of the
eye I'm not looking to make it like
crazy light and frosty down there but I
just want a little brightness it'll make
a difference once you see the mascara on
next up for me this is a very important
step and it's to curl my lashes
and then I think you want to use the
mascara that you know works best for
your lashes here for me it's covergirl
super sizer because it holds my curl the
best it just makes my lashes look big
and the efforts we went to to put
lightness right here around the inner
corner you can see as I get the mascara
on there it gives those lashes a nice
light backdrop and we didn't apply liner
that can potentially take away from the
full look of the length of your lashes
so we're set up here to have a pretty
nice spotlighted effect on the lashes
themselves it's almost like if someone
were to see you up close the effect they
get is like oh the lashes are standing
out nicely they're in contrast with the
lid but if someone saw you from far away
your eye would look more dramatic due to
what's happening out here in the outer
corner does that make sense these are
just the topics that I mull over in my
head while I'm like taking a shower and
stuff
another thing I really try to make a
point to do is catch all those little
bitty innermost lashes too because those
are going to be coming up right in front
of our nice light shimmery eyeshadows so
take advantage of whatever you're
working with there and get mascara
element
then on the lower lashline depending on
what you enjoy you might use your same
mascara you used on the upper lashes for
me I love my covergirl clump crusher
water assistant just cuz I know it won't
budge all day and I do feel like having
that little lightened up burst of shadow
there on the lower lash line can help
your lower lashes stand out quite a bit
another thing I decided to do here on
the lips kind of once seeing how the
aisle panned out I wanted my lips to
look a little less red I already had on
this Estee Lauder pure color Envy
sculpting lipstick in red ego with a
little bit of the LA girl endless lip
liner in wine I just almost wanted to
neutralize the color even more so I took
this NYX kind of brownish lip pencil in
the shade urban cafe and I really
applied that just all around the outside
and then as I was kind of blending it in
the inner part I just used my finger to
almost rub away a little bit of any
product that's on there and that helps
you get sort of that ombre a little bit
faded look another little trick here
that I love to do especially it works
well with this mascara and several
others that I have in my collection but
after it's pretty much all the way dry
like if you can touch your lashes and
not see any product coming off on your
hands just gently blink down onto your
finger like I gotta just put my fingers
up there and let the look down and let
the lashes rest there for a second and
this kind of reinforces the curl
now that mascara is on there and it
really gets your lashes fully drying in
a nice upturned way it's really helpful
for those of us like me if you got
straight lashes just reinforcing that
curl it helps a lot alright guys so your
finished look I really feel like for my
lashes to be looking this good without
any falsies on you know I credit the
mascara that I use really a whole lot
for that but also like I said when you
pull back from a distance the whole
shape of the shadow just gives the eye
the lift that many of us enjoy from a
set of false lashes I mentioned what was
on my lips and I'll just tell you real
quickly and that other face products
that used came from this palette I used
the Bahama Mama bronzer for just a
little light contour and then my blush
is a mix of the hot mama and the insane
blush so I just got a little soft glow
there and then I put the mary-lou
manizer as my highlight just on top of
the cheekbones so this is a super handy
palette if you guys haven't checked it
out I really really love that so thank
you good for your time if you try this
look post a picture on Instagram
Grahame snapchat me I would love to see
it and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
