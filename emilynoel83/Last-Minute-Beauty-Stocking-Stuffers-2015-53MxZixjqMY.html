time I love thinking about these little
last-minute gift ideas which last minute
sometimes it annoys me a little bit when
people say last minute like two weeks
out from Christmas because I'm like no I
got a lot more time left and I've got a
lot more to do and I'm not ashamed to
say that I have shopped before on
Christmas Eve so I do know the true
meaning of last-minute shopping but I
just wanted to throw out a few little
ideas for you hey you were just looking
for those little extras to tack on to
someone's gift or throw in a stocking
but well they're nothing major there are
things that you can kind of group
together yourself and kind of make a DIY
project out of it and for the person
you're giving it to I think it shows
that you've put a little thought into it
but before we get into the super
thoughtful stuff I did show a little
like $4 and 88 set thing that I did find
at Walmart recently I just wanted to
mention this because I think this is a
super good deal from wet and wild this
has six of the wet and wild color icon
singles which I love
they've got Brule in here Neddy kitten
lagoon glam rock and this green which i
think is called envy but I can't see the
little label on that plus there's a set
of false eyelashes which I have not
tried I cannot vouch for how good the
quality is on those but for the six
singles I think that's a great little
deal now to the things that you might
put together yourself and this is
probably the smallest quickest easiest
thing you can do face masks if you look
at the end of the aisle in Walmart or
just whatever drug discount store you're
in I feel like each one has their own
little selection of individual face
masks but just put a couple together
with a little bow and toss them in a
stocking toss them on top of another
gift you're giving because these can be
really nice and some of them the ones
that are creamy on the inside not the
sheet masks can have multiple uses so
one of the ones I love so much and I've
actually only been able to find it in
this little packet size it's the Fremen
diamond mineral rinse mask I love that
it feels so good I also have a little
Freeman Rose sheet mask on there as well
but that's just an easy inexpensive
thing you can add on to a gift another
idea I love is doing a little beauty
on-the-go bag first
once bag by the way isn't that gorgeous
I got this off of hautelook and the
brand is called trina i believe and i
got it off of HauteLook quite a while
back but I know trina is a brand that
makes just a lot of different makeup
bags grab one of these little bags and
just fill it with things that you find
to be great on-the-go essentials I love
my mini Tresemme hairspray I think this
is so handy and that's my favorite kind
of hairspray so I put in one of those I
put in a little elf makeup mist and set
because I think even on the go like not
always right after your makeup
application but as the day goes on it
can be a refreshing little thing also
from ELF I love these little blotting
sheets I think I talked about these in
like new elf products worth trying this
is a great little set because the
blotting sheets actually have a mirror
and then there's this little puff with
adhesive on the back that automatically
will pick up the sheet and then you can
boom boom boom blood all over your face
everybody can use more like ponytail
holders these are actually something I
hadn't heard of before they came in my
Walmart beauty box they're the goody
slide proof and they've got all these
like little bitty
Nubby's on the elastics can you see
those look at that isn't that funny and
then just a little tinted lip balm I
threw in this Nivea kiss of flavor it's
the cherry tinted lip care so this
actually does have a little bit of color
on your lips the next little DIY makeup
bag that I've come up with
I'm calling the sample satchel I know
I'm not the only one who hoards the
little samples that might come with a
Sephora order or an Ulta order maybe
just a little mini gift with purchase
things that you've got over the year
kind of compile those together and put
them in a little makeup bag for someone
this might be for the friend who is just
getting started with makeup or kind of
wants to branch out and try some new
things and if you're really thinking you
could customize this even to their skin
type so if I'm thinking about giving to
a friend who's got maybe combo to oily
skin I'm gonna throw in like the little
benefit Porefessional I've got this
sample of the benefit hello flawless
powder anybody could use these little
packets of the Tarte Guard SPF 30
sunscreen and there's a Neutrogena
Healthy Skin boosters face wash I
remember getting this bare minerals
mineral veil free with some bare
minerals purge
that I had a little primetime eye primer
I've got benefit high beam highlight and
Bennett in it which is really pretty on
cheeks and lips and then a little malli
volumizing mascara so it could be a bag
that's completely comprised of products
you know and love or just things that
you think they might like to try but
when you're giving those many things
it's like you can feel a little bit more
adventurous because then they're not
stuck with like a whole jug of something
if it didn't work out another idea that
I have and I am about 99% sure I've
included this in a past stocking
stuffers video but I really love this
idea I'm calling it my little black lash
bag inside I'm putting three things my
go-to mascara or maybe you have a
different go to mascara that you'd like
to recommend to a friend but I love the
covergirl super sizer and putting in a
Revlon precision lash glue because that
in my opinion is the best Holy Grail
lash glue out there and then a pair of
false lashes I have my red cherry number
43 s here another I think really
universally loved lash style would be
the salon perfect or ardell demi
whispies but pick whatever you want put
it in a little bundle you can even just
put these three together and put a bow
on it and boom you've given somebody
maybe their first false lash starter kit
or if you know they already love false
lashes they can always use more glue
mascara and pairs of lashes the last
little thing I'm calling this the cup of
comb this is the thing you want to give
to somebody who needs a little extra
pampering I just stuck this little
Christmas decoration in the top of it
like you wouldn't even need to do that
but I don't know it makes it look even
more festive and then because I don't
know when to quit I put a candy cane in
there randomly but the key things here
first off a cute mug I found this mug at
Walgreens I put in a little face mask
this happens to be the banana oat
instant smoothing mask from Freeman also
in the bath and body sections of a lot
of drug and discount stores you'll find
these eye masks you can chill them in
your refrigerator for a while and they
feel so good but you can put them on if
you get those awful headaches that feel
like they're happening like right behind
the eyes this feels really good I also
threw a really great lip balm in here
this is the Smiths rosebud salve in the
tube and then maybe they've got a Keurig
maybe they don't you could do little
packets of hot chocolate in here or I
put in just a couple of like a green tea
and a coffee and again maybe these are
add-on gifts to a larger thing maybe
they are literally something you're
planning to stuff in a stocking or maybe
you're just getting a bunch of these
like small gifts to coworkers something
about putting them together yourself I
think makes it a little more thoughtful
and a little more special so hopefully
these ideas get you started if you've
still got a few things left to do for
Christmastime so thank you for watching
and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
