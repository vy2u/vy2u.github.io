of one of the other cards I mentioned in
my like Christmas gift haul video it's
the laura geller baked basics i don't
know if you know a lot about the laura
geller brand of makeup but she is also
she's available on no you're not gonna
get her but you'll get her makeup on
sephora.com or she's on QVC sometimes
and therefore also qvc.com but I got
this chaos of Sephora or it was gotten
for me by Kyla and basically just to
describe what these are it says starting
out of swirls of liquid color corrective
pigments they are then poured into
terracotta pans and bake for 24 hours so
if you if you hear the word baked and
you're like what does that mean which I
was a little bit like unsure about it I
think Physicians Formula that brand had
some things that are called baked so um
anyway I was really intrigued by this I
heard some other people on YouTube
talking about how great the Laura Geller
makeup was and it was very similar to
the mac mineralize skinfinish products
so i thought well this is probably gonna
be pretty good quality so i'm gonna go
ahead and review those things for you
first I'll just tell you what came with
it you got three different baked powders
the first one is the balanced and
brighten and so this is it looks like
this by the way the packaging is really
cute although I must say these are a
little bit I get the feeling they're
gonna last me a long time from what I
can tell so far but they are a little
smaller than I thought they would be but
what is this one's the balanced and
brighten so I don't know if you can see
clearly there but it is like a swirl of
different beiges and yellow colors and
some tan shades in there too I think
this is like the medium kit for this so
that's the medium shade I think you can
also get like but here's what
says about the balance in brightness is
my color corrected powder foundation is
a blendable swirl of warm neutral tans
and creams which provide buildable
coverage giving us the sheer smooth and
delicate to use apply with kabuki brush
over your primer so that is leaping out
balance and brighten so you could use
that like just a powder foundation
the other one is bronze and brighten and
so this one's kind of interesting this
that's the more tan shade some pink
shades some cream tones to it you always
got to hold it just right so the color
the lighting doesn't wash me I got white
like pointing right at me but that's
that's really pretty I think it's really
I really like that particular product in
the set but she calls it her desert
island product totally versatile adapt
to whatever you ask it to do can serve
as an eyeliner or eyebrow color or eye
shadow which I believe that I've used
that actually as a contour of my eye and
that's a really good idea so that's the
product and then the third one probably
the prettiest in the packaging is the
blush and brighten in berry and this
color is so pretty
unfortunately I think it's getting
completely washed out but there you can
kind of see it's like got some kind of
plumbing colors and pinks and golds and
it just looks gorgeous there in the
packaging and that you just want to say
sheer enough so with natural colorful
enough to dazzle so that this is a
really fun group of things because it
also comes with this cute little thing
it says war Geller on it and you open it
up and you get a mini kabuki brush so
this is really I can't say I'm a huge
fan of this brush because I mean while
it is very dense and soft it's kind of
like it's like cut real blunt right
across the top I would appreciate it to
be a little more tapered like I have a
little one out to compare it I have a
little one from Smashbox
that
this one you know the laura geller one
more straight across and this one things
here to blend with the smashbox one
because it's more tapered like that but
either way I tend to like to use bigger
brushes anyway for like a bronzer or
something like that so I would probably
only use that little one if I use it at
all I would use it for maybe the blush
or maybe around my eyes with the
foundation but either way it's cute you
cannot debate that that's very cute
anyway just as far as my opinions on
stuff now I've told you what all it is
the with the balance and brightness
thing you can use as a powder foundation
really like this it it works
surprisingly well as far as evening at
my skin tone when I used it I just put
on my moisturizer and my Smashbox photo
finish primer and then I put this on on
top of it and I just you know I wasn't
even too careful about it you know I
just put it everywhere and give me a
nice amount of coverage too so I was
really impressed with the balance and
great and I think it's a good concept
she's got going of using you know
several different shades in there to
kind of accommodate everyone skin tone
and there's a nice amount of yellow
shade in this and that actually works
from well for a lot of people it
complements a lot of people's skin tone
to add a little yellow in there so
Belsen bright and gets high marks for me
I really really like that and it looks
like it's in it like I said even though
that's a small amount in there that's
gonna last me a while but again I think
it's just small because it's part of
this special deal this set and I can't
quite remember how much it cost I think
it was somewhere I don't even know I'll
look it up or something at all tell you
if I can find it but I'm sure you could
get this in a full size if you liked it
well enough there but the bronze in
Brighton is really cool because it's not
super shimmery it's got some shimmer in
it but it's not overboard and it's just
so many bronzers you get and they're
just so dark in the container and you're
thinking okay I'm gonna have to be so
careful when I apply this the fun thing
about these powders is you don't
to be very careful about it you know you
can just put it on you're not gonna
really screw up with this and look like
a crazy freak with super super bronzed
skin it's gonna give you a nice amount
of glow if you have that medium skin
tone kind of like mine medium to light I
think this would be fine for you so that
is the grunts and brighten and that that
is a really good product there now the
blush this I would say it looks prettier
in the package than it does on your face
so I mean you can see it's got gorgeous
tones in there and it's not but it
doesn't look bad on your face but what
I'm trying to get at here is that um you
put it on and it's got a little it's got
a lot of shimmer to it but not a ton of
color um what just to show you here like
I'll put a little bit on it's like I'm
seeing a glow but I'm not seeing a ton
of color I'm seeing a little color but
not a lot so you know what I mean you
look at this you think wow that's gonna
look crazy but it really doesn't show up
a whole lot it just gives you a little
more shimmer it's more shimmery than the
bronzer let's put it that way
and so anyway overall I give this little
set some really high marks
I like the Laura Geller makeup I think
it's great quality I was so impressed
with how the powder foundation covered
even around my eyes I mean it was great
so if you are curious like I was and I
didn't have any other laura geller
products except like a free sample of
the spackle primer which it's very good
really like my little free sample of the
spackle but if you're curious about it
want to try out a few things I would
encourage you to check out this set if
this set does not remain available for
much longer than you know check out one
of the individual products I really like
the bronzer and the balance and brighten
a lot so anyway thanks a lot for
watching this video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and learned a few things
about this and if you have any opinions
on the laura geller stuff or any other
laura geller products you think I should
try out let me know because I think it's
a really great brand so have a great day
