today I wanted to tell you about a
little makeup kit that I thought was
just too good to pass up it actually
includes a few products that I'm pretty
familiar with from Laura Geller's lines
is the Portofino getaway set and I got
mine from Ulta it's thirty nine dollars
and as you can see it has a very summery
vibe to it and I feel like the look that
I put together I really kind of kept it
minimal with the color products that I
added and I kept it to this kit pretty
much like for my eyes and for my cheeks
I did add a blush but the overall color
products are coming from this kit and I
feel like it gives a really like simple
easy
glowy everyday look for any time of year
really but ultimately these little
pieces could be useful aspects to your
makeup routine just peaced in with
whatever you're already using getting
the baked body frosting that's the
all-over body glow and Tahitian glow so
you can use it face or body
the baked french vanilla highlights the
color drench lip gloss in the shade
called ginger the style lash lengthening
mascara and then also an applicator a
double-ended applicator which I know is
usually sold like on QVC alongside the
French vanilla highlight I love that
everything in here is full-sized one of
the things that really perked my ears up
was the baked french vanilla highlight
this is a highlight that I can safely
say is good for anyone those of you who
have mature skin those of you who are
dealing with pores and acne and a lot of
uneven texture and you feel like anytime
you put a shimmery highlight on it just
makes all of those things look like
they're being spotlighted this highlight
is amazing and I already have one so
this is gonna be the one I'll be
touching and putting my finger in but
this is just the perfect satiny finish
highlight see how it's just like kind of
barely catching the light this is the
best way to show you what the finish is
because when I just hold this up here it
looks kind of flat and matte but it does
have just the tiniest bit of sheen to it
and one of my first ever beauty
broadcast Express reviews that I did was
on this product so I'll link to that
because I'm sure I got very detailed in
that video I've been using this one very
consistently for a couple years now you
can see I well I do have a pretty good
dent in it I have not yet hit pay
and this is the way it goes with laura
geller products they're kind of domed up
they're baked products and it takes a
while to use them up sometimes I will
use baked french vanilla alone and I
love to use it up here in this zone
because it's so so like just brightening
as far as your whole overall skin to
some highlights they just add the
shimmer this really seems to take a
whole chunk of your skin and really lift
it up sometimes on its own it can be a
little hard to come by I know QVC sells
it for I think just under $30 and I
don't always find it at Ulta then I'm
not sure if you guys know my history and
experience with the Tahitian glow but
this is kind of like a glowy bronzer
type product and I actually have this
from back when it was sold or maybe
they're still selling it as the baked
body frosting same exact product on the
inside this is huge and look I actually
hit pan on this this is a massive amount
of product and it originally came with
this little puff and you can just like
practically paint it on your body and
it's the most beautiful like glowy
bronze not orange in the least I would
put this all over you know like even
after sunless tanning and it would give
a really nice glow to the skin so I'm
thrilled actually to have a smaller size
of this that's a little more portable I
can just pick up this product on a
makeup brush and you just put it there
on the shoulder and it's just instant
pretty glow love that I would say this
is a glowy product without being all-out
metallic the best way to describe is
probably like highlight and bronze
rolled into one and with these baked
products you're always gonna see like a
little sector of the palette that's a
little deeper than the rest you don't
like this parts a little lighter this
parts deeper and so you can kind of
target your brush a little bit if you
want to to hone in on the deeper shade
but that's entirely up to you and if it
bothers you that not every one of these
is going to come out with the same
identical look or that the whole palette
isn't completely uniform if that bothers
you this may not be the product for you
you're getting a style lash intense
lengthening mascara I was really really
impressed with this actually and this is
the first laura geller mascara I've ever
liked I feel like so many of them have
been a
really wet formula too goopy too thick
too heavy for my lashes and with this
first off the brush is reminding me so
much of lights camera lashes you know
with the shorter kind of spiky bristles
a little bit tapered toward the tip and
then in application I would say it's a
little less thickening than lights
camera lashes but more lengthening for
me so I really like the way you know two
coats of this I'd say is my ideal I
really like the way that extended my
lashes out it feels kind of light on the
lashes like I said not too thickening
it's not super heavy and that's why I
think I'm seeing the curl lasting pretty
well with this I have not yet
experimented with this on my lower
lashes you know that's kind of a danger
zone for me I like to use my covergirl
clump crusher water resistant down there
but on the upper lashes I mean this is
fabulous I really really like just this
natural kind of length and outlook that
I've got and then the gloss is actually
a shade that I had tried before it came
in a holiday kit I think two years back
but it's the shade ginger from the color
drenched lipgloss line they smell kind
of like frosting I guess like
buttercream cake frosting maybe a doe
foot applicator but it kind of bends
backward really gets nicely out to the
edge with the product and this shade I
would describe as quarrel with a little
bit of a golden sheen in it it's not
sticky I know I've recommended her
glosses when they've been sold in little
sets I wanted to show you a quick little
demo with these products I already had
foundation on my skin and powder my
brows were done and what else I did a
little bit of contour and then I just
used the Tahitian glow I went around the
forehead I feel like I can use this and
not be too careful with it you know I'm
not too concerned about getting overly
glowy with this because like I said it's
not a metallic glow it's kind of a soft
glow with bronze mixed in then I used my
baked french vanilla and I just went on
top of the cheeks use this wherever you
want to highlight you can go down the
nose with it it's so multi-purpose I
feel like I can get pretty close to the
eye area with this and not accentuate
the look of fine lines or wrinkles in
that area so that's great then I use
those products on the eyes as well I
applied a primer and then I use the
baked french vanilla just patted it all
over the lids it's really brightening I
also used it right under the
and then you guessed it I just used the
Tahitian glow went into a little bit of
the deeper part of this compact and just
use that in the crease easiest look ever
and then you can also use that little
pencil brush smudge it down on the lower
lash line if you want your eyes to look
extra awake and bright and use a light
pencil in the lower inner rim then I
curled my lashes I applied two coats of
the style lash mascara you can see my
lashes you know not the greatest lashes
on earth but this definitely boosted him
up gave him a lift gave them some added
length and then my last step for the
look was just to apply the lip gloss the
color drench lip gloss in ginger so this
is the overall finished look very
focused on these particular products but
again they're all little individual
pieces on their own so you can use one
not the other just integrate them into
whatever your signature look might be
but I really like this kit and I just
thought $39 was a great deal for all you
get so wanted to share thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you soon
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
