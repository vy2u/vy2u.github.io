video continuing our series on
foundation application and um I kind of
wanted I had some requests on different
kinds of mineral makeup I'm going to go
ahead and get my things out of the way
here I had some requests on different
kinds of mineral application techniques
and I like the warrior they're natural
minerals and things like that and just
different different formulations and
stuff and I will get to that I just kind
of wanted to go ahead and do get the
liquid explanations out of the way so
today I wanted to do it
applying it with your fingertips which
seems pretty self-explanatory but I have
had some some kind of specific questions
about it and so I thought for me I feel
like when you apply makeup with your
fingertips I think you can achieve a
really full coverage look as opposed to
sometimes what you get with a brush like
for example with the stippling approach
we talked about that is kind of was
where you can get a really sheer
coverage but I feel like when it's going
from the container to your fingers and
right on your face you can really you
have a lot of control with your
fingertips and in that sense you can get
a quite a bit of coverage as well so I'm
going to use a foundation called
it's from Alma it's the line smoothing
makeup it's supposed to be kind of
hydrating it says hydrates all day SPF
15 my color is warm to 80 and this was
something that I used like I used more
during the winter months last year it
was heavily recommended to me by someone
on makeup TOCOM and they just really
sang the praises of this foundation so I
wanted to just kind of go back to that
and show you how you can get a pretty
quite a bit of coverage with with your
foundation so to start with go ahead and
just you know you want to get some on
your
anger tips like so and I go ahead and
dot it on the places where I know I want
more coverage to start with so I've
around my nose and also around my eye
area I'm just going to start there for
now and I'm going to blend outward from
from basically the center of my face
okay so I'm ending kind down to my
blending down to my chin running right
around my eye and and you see it's it's
the whole concept of like when you put
eyeshadow on the first place that your
brush touches is generally that's the
spot where the most product gets and
then you blend outward and so here
that's sort of the concept the first
place that my foundation touched right
around my eye area that was a place I
knew where I wanted more coverage I want
a more product to be and so then I'm
just blending it outward okay it's it's
it's really simple um you know it's I
just kind of wanted to show people this
because like if you don't have a sponge
or you don't have a brush handy you can
still get a good look you know
foundation wide just with your
fingertips so we started out we blended
around our nose and we kind of got that
down to our chin blended around our eyes
and out this way but we still do want
that touch of coverage elsewhere so I'm
just going to kind of dot it on my
forehead and also a little bit on my jaw
you can see I'm not putting much I think
the camera and the lights are kind of
washing me out and really badly right
now but hopefully you can just see this
is not a tough process what you do want
to make sure of though is when you're
blending you I mean this can be is one
of those things that can be easier to do
with a brush is when you're getting down
here around your jaw line really make
sure you're blending that right up to
your ear your jaw and right up to your
to your hairline area and then so you
kind of want to give your face another
look and one reason why it's kind of it
can be nice to do your go ahead and do
your foundation before concealer is
because sometimes you'll find out oh
well the foundation covered whatever the
flaw was and I don't need to go over
that again with my concealer so I just
keep that in mind with the order of your
products any mineral makeup is kind of a
different ballgame but when you're
talking liquids sometimes the liquid
foundation can take care of things like
that you may use concealer for later for
example I have like a blemish or two
right over here but the foundation
seemed to cover them well enough that I
don't need to go over them again with
concealer so then once you've pretty
much gotten over your whole face um I'm
going to switch my light down here a
little bit see if that okay I don't know
it's still kind of washing up but just
give another look to your entire face
see whatever areas you might want to put
a little more for me it's going to be
the corner of my eye so I'm just you
know been dipping my finger back in here
and Eddie as you can see you've got tons
of control when you use your finger
and it's just really easy I think to get
a full coverage look this way can you
get full coverage when you use a typical
foundation brush or a stippling brush
yeah I think so um it's just the fact
that this method um it's going directly
to your face I guess this is the whole
thing and you're not having that
middleman there and um this can be one
of the easier ways I think to apply
foundation and still get up really good
full coverage look just pay close
attention to around your eyebrows around
your hairline and your jawline because
you really want that to look seamless
you know I mean so um anyway I feel like
I should have more to say about this but
it's really just as simple as that
um just as far as different types of
liquid foundation and the ease that you
will have and applying with your fingers
it really doesn't matter um more liquidy
or more creamy this is the one that I'm
using is a more creamy formulation and
um it's just basically your choice but I
hope this was helpful I know it's kind
of like one of those things maybe some
of you are watching me like uh how you
apply it with your fingers but um I mean
there just are some things to keep in
mind with it like you know carefully
blending and um you know just make sure
it really is blended in you don't want
to see a streak of a finger or anything
like that and a lot of that comes down
to how closely does it really match your
natural skin tone which will I mean that
you're getting yourself a real leg up if
your foundation truly does match well
you will struggle if you're trying you
know you got your fingers on there and
you're trying to blend a darker shade
onto much lighter skin that's going to
be a problem so just keep that in mind
and just keep watching for more
techniques on foundation thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
