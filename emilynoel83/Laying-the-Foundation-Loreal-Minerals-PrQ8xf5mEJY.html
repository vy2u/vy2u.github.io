foundation video I'm glad you've really
been enjoying these by the way I'm in my
bathroom over here but I've gotten a lot
of good feedback on these videos because
I think it's just something everybody
can look at and maybe even though you
have an idea of a certain method how to
do it sometimes just seeing somebody do
it can like open your eyes to one little
thing that you didn't think of before so
I'm glad you're enjoying them and I'm
not even sure what number I'm on with
this series yet but I want to do one on
minerals I'll probably do several
because there are several different
methods of mineral makeup and the one
I'm going to do today is on the Loreal
bear natural foundation I first of all
it had specific questions about how to
do that and I've also just wanted to
show it because I think it's a little
bit different than your typical mineral
application and by the way I know if you
look back in my videos I did do a
mineral foundation application video and
I believe it was using the bare minerals
line so if you're curious about that
that was a little while back but you
could check that out as well so I'm
going to I'm gonna start off by doing
and oh another thing um I find that
unlike with just a liquid foundation
where you just got the liquid and you
put it on mineral makeup is kind of like
a lot of brands have created a line of
mineral makeup and they have milk
they've got the fishing powders and the
concealers and all this other stuff so
for the brands that I have those items I
will go ahead and do all those steps in
this video
and but what I start out with usually
even when I do
mineral makeup I want to use a concealer
usually around my eyes just a separate
one just to be safe because I worry
about I just think getting getting
smoothness and redness and circles away
from your eyes is just a big factor in
making your makeup work so I'm using the
in
age rewind concealer from Maybelline and
medium and I just kind of put it on my
fingers and this is just you know we're
trying to keep it quick here you know
you could use a brush but this is very
easy to maneuver with your fingers and
you just want to make sure you work it
all the way up to right up to your lower
lash line and this is specifically an
under-eye concealer so I won't go ahead
and use this anywhere else on my face
although I'm sure I could um I'm just I
don't really have a need to right now so
all right so we just gotten some
concealer going on their back and now
we're going to move on to actually
L'Oreal makes a little concealer too
which I'm not really wild about just the
coverage on its own but it's just you
just unscrew that and it's got the
little sister and so I just kind of dip
it in what is sifted through and then
this is a great way though to set
whatever you know you've done around
your eyes nose mouth whatever so
basically you're just using this like a
concealer brush and
and it's just it does work really well
around the eye area although I wish it
did have a little bit longer like handle
on that good what can you do alright so
we've gone over the under eye and this
is a little wider by the way the shade
I'm using is light and so this will be a
little wider than the foundation I put
on this is nice for around like any
broken capillaries you have around your
nose just getting rid of some redness
you know like I have a little redness
around my nose will just take care of
that right away and so the concealing
step is done and it's really cute to see
how little that is pretty small huh and
then I'm going to move on to the
foundation now this is an SPF 19
foundation and my color is nude beige
460 so what I would usually do for this
is just give it it in case you're
totally unfamiliar with this I'm going
to just go through it basically and and
then maybe you'll see it in the store
and realize how it's supposed to be
applied and you'll understand it a
little better but what I would do is
just give it a little shake you've got
this top that comes off and then you
unscrew your brush okay now you've got
this sifter here and after you've shaken
it some of the product is probably come
up through and then I just swirl the
brush in and you can tap it give it a
little tap if you feel like you've
gotten too much on there and then you
just want to work in circular motions
all over your face so I just usually
start on one side this is so easy I it
really doesn't get much easier than this
is large applying I think mineral
foundation is just a great great
innovation for people who are just
getting started with makeup because you
and if I'm going back for more I usually
will just stick this down in
the opening and shake it then you get
some and just keep going back for more
but it is just so easy for a beginner to
pick this up not have to worry too
terribly much about blending and things
you know it's just a matter of okay
let's pick the right shade and then just
put it on and so basically I've gone
back for more I did this side of my face
and I went back for more to do this side
now I'm gone back for a little more to
go over my forehead and as you could I
mean the coverage you are getting
coverage with this it just you know if
you are a person who has used liquid
foundation for a long time you're going
to feel like okay how do I know this is
really doing anything that was the way I
felt when I first used marrows like how
can I tell but it really you really are
getting some some good coverage with
this and so you go over your face and
then look at it stop and actually look
at yourself before you go back for more
foundation and see okay do I truly need
more and I would say yeah I want more
around my eyes so I'm just going to
shake it up get a little more on there
and go over the eye area and definitely
blend down around the jawline and into
the hairline I know I always say this in
every video and around the eyebrows and
there's your foundation so the
foundation step is done there and then
you may go ahead and do a bronzer at
this point um I'm just going to grab a
bronzer that I have because I don't
think they have a specific bronzer I'm
not positive with L'Oreal so I'm going
to just grab my wet and wild bonds or
bronzer in Tahitian tan and just run it
all over my face real quick just so I
can move on with the other steps of this
thing because they're like two other
steps or the L'Oreal stuff there's a
quick swipe of that and then I'm going
to do some blush a flush that I love I
don't I also don't have the L'Oreal
blush I'm sorry
but this blush is from Milani minerals
and it's in my tie and it's a gorgeous
like deep peachy color I'm just going to
go ahead and put that on gosh it gives
us so much color I love it I think this
is just one of those universally
flattering shades too so it works really
well okay so we got the blush on now
we'll get back to the L'Oreal stuff they
have something called an all-over
mineral glow and I have it in nude glow
and it's kind of golden and you got this
different kind of brush here not like
your normal kabuki so I'm going to shake
it and swirl it and then I'm going to go
over like the tops of my cheeks right
down my nose and on my forehead you
don't want to go overboard because there
is some shimmer in this and I mean I
never like to be like overly crazy
shimmery so that step was super nice and
fast
and then you've got finishing powder and
this is just in finish 4:01 it's that
soft focus mineral finish give it a
little shake twist it off this is closer
to your foundation brush that comes on
the foundation just a little softer
maybe I always like to go around do a
circle around my eyes with that and then
just go over the entire face and there
you go there is a mineral foundation
application mainly using the bear on the
bear natural products from L'Oreal and I
hope you guys enjoyed this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
