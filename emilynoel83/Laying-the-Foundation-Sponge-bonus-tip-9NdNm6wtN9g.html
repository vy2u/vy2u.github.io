I wanted to continue my foundation
tutorial series with how to apply liquid
foundation with a sponge because that's
often times when you're using a little
sponge like this you can get kind of a
more sheer look so if you're looking
I'll tell you just right off if you like
not so much full coverage with your
foundation but something more sheer this
will be a tutorial you're especially
interested in and I'm but to add to this
I'm also going to show you how to deepen
the color of your foundation if you want
a more blonds look or maybe you've got a
foundation that just your skin's gotten
darker and as the summer has gone on and
on and you want something to give you
that extra glow so I'm just going to
show you how to do that right now so
I've already put on my moisturizer and
I've also put on a foundation primer and
the foundation I'm going to use is my
mineral power liquid foundation in
medium one from Maybelline and I'm
basically just going to use my hand it's
kind of a little palette to mix on and
I'm going to put just a decent size a
dot a dollop of that on my hand
oops my cap here just a second okay so
now that I've put my foundation on my
hand I'm going to take my Bonnie bail
gel bronze and golden tan and this is
just a great tool to use it's like a
sheer transparent like stain almost
except it does wash off I have another
one actually that you can use for this
too it's also from Maybelline mineral
power and it you will have to go wash
your hands after you use this because it
truly it this is a true stain so it's
really it's transfer proof you can use
it all over your body I mixed it with
body lotion before and it works really
well but just for the purpose of me not
getting up and washing my hands and then
this I'm going to use this stuff which
will it gives the same coloring overall
and so I'm going to get I'm going to do
a couple I would say I'm using about
half as much of the gel bronze as the
foundation but you can change your ratio
depending on how dark or light you want
it and I'm just going to blend the two
with my finger here and you're going to
see the color is quite a bit deeper than
it started and I'm just from here that
little sponge these makeup sponges are
available everywhere pretty much mine
came from okay mine are from essence of
beauty from CVS and I really like these
because the sponge is is very um like it
doesn't have huge gaping holes in this
sponge it's like a very soft sponge and
the reason why you're going to get more
sheer coverage with a sponge is because
it's obviously this is something that's
absorbent and so you think about it not
all of the product you're putting on
something is necessarily going onto your
face some of it is absorbing into the
sponge so just keep that in mind and I'm
just going to start over areas where I
want more coverage because I've darkened
this up somewhat I'm not going to
concentrate a whole lot around my eye
area I'll probably use concealer for
that just so I don't overly darken it
and create more work for myself right
now but um if you were just using plain
foundation and not mixing in a bronzer
by all means go ahead and get under your
eye area that would be a main area I
would focus on but basically to apply
you know you just kind of want to do
sort of a stamping on motion and then
blend especially around that jaw line
around your mouth just think of any uh
any open area or any border to your face
that really needs to be
blended I mean that's probably the theme
that has just gone on throughout every
tutorial I've done is um you know really
blend no matter what method you're doing
blend around that jawline and so as you
can see I mean I can you may not really
actually be able to see this too much
but I can tell looking in my makeup
mirror that this has deepened up my skin
tone somewhat and it's also going on as
I expected very sheer um those more full
coverage methods that I've talked about
before like using your finger I mean
that using your fingers would be a more
full coverage using a stippling brush is
one of those where it can really go
either way you know you can make it more
full coverage or less or less coverage
just depending on how much foundation
you want to pack on the brush so anyway
I'm just uh since there's not much left
on the sponge now is the time that I'm
choosing to go around my eye area
because like I said I don't want to
darken it up too much because I know
um I know my concealing will want to
lighten that area so I don't want to
fight against what I'm doing right now
but just and I've now I've worked off
everything off of my hand it's all gone
it's either in the sponge or on my face
and anyway that's just a quick and easy
way that you can apply your foundation
with or without a bronzer but if you
want to add bronzer you can make any
foundation a little bit deeper and keep
in mind when you're also adding this to
something in that respect you're making
it more sheer because you're taking a
you know a what is sort of like a
translucent gel and adding it to this so
you need to keep in mind that as you do
that you're lessening the coverage there
somewhat so if you do want full coverage
and I would say a sponge may waste some
of your product if you just want to use
your foundation and apply it on there I
mean a sponge can work well but I think
you're going to find yourself using
more of the product than you thought you
were going to simply because it does
absorb into this so it's just kind of a
common-sense thing just something to
keep in mind but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and we will continue with
more foundation application tips to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
