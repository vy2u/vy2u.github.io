excuse me continue my foundation series
today sorry my voice is a little course
it's been Homecoming weekend that I went
to the football game yesterday so but
anyway I wanted to show you today how to
apply a stick foundation because I've
had a few questions and it was actually
something that when i started using it i
was a little confused as to exactly how
you know how do you go about using a
stick foundation so i wanted to show you
that and so I'm first going to just get
my hair out of the way and I went ahead
and put on my moisturizer and I did a
little concealer around my under eye
area that's something you could we don't
really do before or after the stick
foundation I know usually with liquid
foundation I go ahead and apply that all
first and then a concealer but I don't
know something about this just simply
for the fact that this stick doesn't
have to be applied all over your face I
guess I just kind of kind of just go
ahead and put it on also just to show
you a couple of stick foundations that I
have used the Max Factor pan stick is a
good one it's very very creamy and and
these are just so convenient because I
mean they're basically like a jumbo lip
balm or something there that size and
they can easily travel with you in your
purse and they can kind of double as a
concealer if you wanted the Max Factor
pan stick i happen to know my colorism
medium beige it has a little bit of a
scent to it it's different it's a really
different scent unlike anything I've
really smell going to make up before
it's kind of um I don't know a little
bit Lowry I would say a little perfume
heeya it's a stronger scent than most
foundations that I don't mind it but
and this is a really really creamy
formula I mean it's it's just very
creamy right on your hand I do happen to
know that Max Factor pan stick has some
mineral oil in it so be aware that this
is not a totally oil free product if you
are girl who struggles with products
that are coiled free and then the other
one the one that i've been using most
recently is my bobby brown foundation
stick which i talked about in one of my
videos but i hadn't really reviewed it
yet because i hadn't used it very much
my color is natural and this is
something that I actually had seen on
seen a demonstration on on QVC and Bobbi
Brown was there and she was applying
this on someone and she used a flat
foundation brush just this type of brush
this one I picked up from sally beauty
supply she had a different one of his li
but this is the sort of foundation brush
you want to use it's much easier to come
by then say the stippling brush that I
used in one of the videos so that's good
and basically you know you twist up the
stick this is not maybe white as select
I guess as you as you touch it it's got
a little bit more maybe maybe even a
thicker consistency but it doesn't just
glide right off its its have I guess you
might say a less oily feel although this
doesn't really feel oily to me but what
I'm trying to say is it's not quite as
slick when you touch it but anyway um
when I first got a foundation stick you
know I wondered you just like draw all
over your face and then blend it in I'm
sure that's an option but what I find
that works well just blending wise is
too and this was what I had seen Bobby
Brown do with their own product so I
figure this is the did what how the
product is designed to be used just take
your foundation brush and just kind of
swipe it a few times on top and you see
you get some of the product there on the
bra
and then it's really just up to you i
mean you could go all over your face
with this you're going to get pretty
good coverage because when you think
about it what you're using is a cream as
opposed to a straight-up liquid so it's
not going to really dilute and go all
over your face at once it's going to go
where you put it and if you want that
coverage all over your face I mean you
can definitely get it so I'm going to go
back around my eye area and you could
really could use this I mean I just put
a little concealer under my eye just
kind of as a comfort thing I like to
just know that it's there but I mean
this really could do you're concealing
if you were in a rush you know and
you'll see I'm right now I'm focusing in
on the places where I need the most
coverage I'm kind of going just around
the mouth and nose and the the eye area
take it down here kind of get on top of
the cheeks even wear those circles and
shadows can still kind of form and it's
really easy I'm just it's super easy to
blend out and i know i'm using a pretty
high quality product here but still i
mean the principle remains the same
whatever a stick foundation you're using
and just for the purpose of this
demonstration although i may not go all
over my face with this i'm just going to
go ahead and put just a sheer
application of this on my forehead and
you may say well what makes it sheer
what you're doing well i'm not going
back to the stick over and over i get
about three or four swipes on there and
then you just kind of keep blending from
what you've put on your forehead okay
you blend it out as basically as far as
you can take it and because you know
some products still remains on the brush
but if you I hope you understand what i
mean by that i'm going back to here and
then I'm just going to blend it out as
much as I can
and the more you're going over it with
your brush the more sheer your coverage
is going to be and this just I mean I'm
fortunate enough to have ordered this
without being in a store and I found
vehicle the exact match like this could
not match my skin any better and that's
a really big key to making your
foundation work for you so with this
it's a lil it's slightly more difficult
to blend down to your jawline than say a
liquid is just because or if you're
using one of those big stippling brush
is just because they're so big and they
can kind of blend down there easier this
is a slightly smaller brush but still
you want to make sure that you're all
blended there and then um like I said
for full coverage if I'm looking at this
and I'm thinking okay I still want more
around my eye area just get more on your
brush and I mean you could also go in
and if you really wanted to use this as
your concealer and really Zone in on
your eye area you could take just a
concealer brush which is smaller and tap
on this and you know get what you needed
there if it helps you fit in around your
eye area more so basically there you go
i mean this is this is good coverage if
i had to rank it somewhere in terms of
coverage for different foundations i
would say i would say you can achieve
more coverage than a liquid with a stick
simply because this is creamy okay when
you touch that that is thicker on your
finger than if you dip your finger in
some liquid foundation but at the same
time this is very easy to just dot
around a few places and use more like a
spot concealer so in that in that
respect you can get lighter coverage
it's however you want to use it and so
that's what's really nice it's very
they're so portable small you don't have
to worry about something a cat coming
off in this spilling all over I mean
this is just I really like the Bobby
Brown
foundation stick and oh one other thing
I wanted to tell you is if you do say
use this as more concealing tool maybe
you don't put it all over your face or
even if you do a light application of
some mineral powder over the top can
giving I found a really flawless look
you know if you just does some of your
favorite mineral foundation that is
lighter coverage I know if you're in
everyday minerals use your user you may
not take your intensive and then put it
over the top of this but bare minerals
or you know brain like that you know
just swipe it swipe it over and you can
get a really nice finish with that just
dusting it over the top of this
considering you may not apply this all
over your face so and also I have had
some requests for mineral foundation
tutorials and yeah I will do them with
some of the different brands because I
know there's so many different formats
of that these days i will show you what
i know about that so thank you very much
for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
