video this is actually a very exciting
time right now this is the start of a
series called laying the foundation and
the reason why I decided to do this was
I've been asked numerous times about all
different kinds of foundation how do you
apply it can you do a tutorial on
applying mineral foundation or liquid
foundation and I thought well let's just
do a series let's lay it all out there
and I'm going to show how I apply
different kinds of foundation with
different brushes and methods and things
like that and this will probably go on
all throughout the coming month
interspersed with other kinds of videos
so the first brush and I'm gonna do a
liquid foundation today and this is
actually the look the kind of foundation
that I use for work when I go to anchor
I use this Rimmel lasting finish
foundation in two hundred soft beige and
I used my Coastal Scents duo fiber
stippling brush and so as you can see
it's a little it's been used quite
frequently and you may recall when I did
my review for the Coastal Scents brushes
this was in there and I said well it
gets very sheer coverage it was like I
used it one time and I found the
coverage to be very sheer but as I've
gone on and kept practicing with it I
really like the coverage you can build
it up a little bit and I think that's
what you'll be able to see in this video
but yet you also can you you can do the
extremes you know you can build up your
foundation coverage but you can also
keep it a little more minimal and it
actually does stay longer that way with
a little more sheer finish so start off
with I gotta get my hair just took a
shower so I gotta get my hair up out of
my face for this and I have also already
applied my moisturizer and my Rimmel fix
and perfect primer so my face is nice
and smooth and so I'm just gonna take my
foundation
and actually just use my hand as my
palette and squirt it out just a little
bit just a little little dollop is on
there and I probably won't even use all
of that that's I'm kind of trying to
show the shooter approach to it and now
he's going to take my brush and just tap
the light-colored tip in there okay so
you got it on there and then I usually
just kind of do one side of my face at a
time and what I'm doing this is kind of
a stippling aspect of it I'm just
dotting it all over the side of my face
and I can see the product but as I keep
dotting anybody who is in art knows what
stippling is anybody who did a lot of
pen and ink but you're stippling and you
can you start off still being able to
see the product but as I keep doing this
that you can just see the foundation
disappearing into my skin and then so
usually that's kind of the first step to
applying is just dotting it on and then
the next step just to make sure it's
fully blended I just kind of work over
it in circular motions I go all the way
down to the jaw line up in and around my
eye circular motions all over there and
then you just repeat this like I usually
go to my chin next and around my mouth
and you just dot till it disappears and
then blend circular motions
okay so super easy as you can see just
repeating I'm dotting it all over I'm
dotting it on my skin until it
disappears and then I'm working it in
with circular motions now this this
brush does tend to share just a little
bit so you have to watch out for that if
you have purchased this or planning to
just be aware but it was not that
expensive I think around like seven
bucks or so but you can watch my Coastal
Scents brush review video for more on it
going over the nose right now and then
lastly it's just the forehead so I'm
just dotting all over and keep in mind
you know there may be some places where
you don't need to some parts of your
face where you don't necessarily feel
like you want all that much coverage
then don't go you know do more of a
blending outward from where you put it
on rather than apply it and fresh you
know foundation to it you know I mean
like instead of going back to your hand
and putting it on go ahead and just like
start in one spot and blend outward that
one spot if you wanted to do it that way
would probably be your nose or the
center of your face and then you would
blend outward but if you want more you
know that coverage all over I mean this
is just the way I do it before work when
I really do need to have good coverage
for my foundation and you can see what
I'm doing here I'm blending it up right
up to my hairline it's not getting in my
hair or coloring my hair at all I mean
I've got dark hair so it would show if
it was but you just really want to make
sure you blended it all in and then once
you've gone all over your face around
your eyes and everything else I just
continue to buff a little more just make
sure you
you do not want any lines around the
ears of jaw and hairline and also around
your eyebrows I usually just go over
that as well if you think you're getting
some product on your eyebrows and a
lessening the color of your eyebrows
usually a clear gel at the end when you
set your eyebrows and that kind of thing
that will sort of bring the brows back
to life a little bit well anyway it's
pretty much just that easy I go onto my
neck a little bit and that is that
foundation application that is how you
apply a liquid foundation with a
stippling brush so I hope you guys found
this a little bit educational and gave
you some ideas maybe if you've seen this
brush around and you're thinking how do
I use that
well this hat this brush does have other
purposes some people use it just adds a
brush for powder spray all over face
powder or a bronzer or shimmer powder
you know if you use it with powders you
will get a very light application and
use it for foundations it's just very
interesting their brush like this can be
used for a liquid but lots of people
it's becoming more popular I think
you'll probably see more people on
YouTube doing this and anyway look for
more of these videos to come on how to
apply foundation thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
