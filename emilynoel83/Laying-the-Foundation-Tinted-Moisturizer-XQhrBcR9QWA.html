foundation tutorial this time I'm kind
of combining two things in one it's a
tutorial on doing tinted moisturizer but
at the same time I want to gear this as
something toward those who have said hey
I live in a really dry climate and I
know the weather is starting to cool
down and the air is drier and you want
something that's going to hold some
moisture in your skin but also give you
some coverage and some color as well so
I'm going to show you how to do that
today hopefully some of you who
requested this quite a while ago I'm
finally getting to it so thank you for
patiently waiting so now that I
stylishly clip my hair back I'm going to
start out actually for the very first
step here because even though I'm going
to incorporate a tinted moisturizer I
want to start out with regular
moisturizer because we're talking I mean
if this is if you are truly in dry
weather you do need something a little
extra so I'm just using my mary kay
timewise moisturizer
I like their skin care well I think it
keeps your skin just really smooth and
soft
and I mean this is always a step that I
do before any of my foundation tutorials
but I just wanted to get the point
across that even though I'm doing tinted
moisturizer today I still moisture eyes
before hand all right so we've got that
part so next you have an option at this
point you want to give that a little bit
chance to absorb into your skin and the
next thing you could do if you want more
coverage you could take a liquid
foundation and you could blend that in
with some more of this moisturizer and
you might get a more full coverage look
out of it while also getting more
moisture or you can just take something
that claims to be a tinted moisturizer
and use that so I'm going to use my um
mary kay tinted moisturizer they make
these long tubes here and - beige one
and it's ten moisturizer with SPF 20 as
well so that's nice and so this would be
for like a lighter coverage look and
another part of the reason why I guess
with this particular product that I
would do um some moisturizer first is
because I don't feel like this is
extremely moisturizing I feel like it
actually gives sort of good coverage but
it just doesn't have a lot of moisture
in it just use that is at least for my
skin so anyway I'm going to go around
and kind of apply this like I would
apply a foundation with my fingers and
I'm gonna kind of try to work from the
inside there the inner part of my face
out and be surprised at how some tinted
moisturizers really do provide some
coverage and this one is one of those so
I get it right up under my eye and
notice some differences there and
and again if you if you have oily skin
then the two steps of moisturizer might
be too much for you and you may want to
just stick with your tinted moisturizer
but you just kind of have to gauge your
you know your own skin because and and
like with mine for example it tends to
be more oily in the summer and more dry
in the winter and that's just and that's
just something I've kind of gotten used
to so really just keep a close track of
how your skin changes with the seasons
and then you'll know what your needs are
and just pay attention to formulations
if it feels like it's not giving you
enough moisture then you need to maybe
add in something else so basically I've
just applied that moisturizer all over
and I've gotten a little extra coverage
out of that since I think this you know
borders on slightly slightly less
moisturizing slightly more coverage but
it's a good one so I mean I could
recommend this to anybody who's looking
for a good team moisturizer but at this
point I would go ahead and do some
concealer on top of what I've just done
because I mean you may have gotten some
coverage out of that tinted moisturizer
on there so I'm going to use my
Maybelline mineral power concealer over
just to those areas non under eye areas
right now so anywhere that I just want a
little bit of coverage and I know if I
put this over any blemishes it's not
gonna irritate it further and then for
under-eye one of my favorite concealers
right now is my Bobbi Brown so I'm gonna
use there's a corrector which is like
kind of a salmony color and that I
usually use that before on-air stuff but
for everyday I think the creamy
concealer kit is is fine
so grab my brush and this is just you
know
nice creamy pigmented concealer and I'm
just going to work this around the inner
corners of my eye and also come down
under and go right up to your lower lash
line with that and this has such good
coverage I love this concealer I use
this so much and the eyes is I mean
pricier but this is a very important
place on your face I mean especially if
you're doing more than noon you don't
want to look tired okay and another cool
aspect of this concealer is on the
bottom part it has a little it's called
the pale yellow loose setting powder so
you can like really lock in your
concealer Bobby Brown really is a
proponent of using a decent amount of
loose powder to set your liquid products
that you put on your face so it really
does help the staying power of your
concealer
over your other concealer you've done
two and then I would encourage you after
you have done remember we did the whole
tinted moisturizer thing to go ahead and
use some loose powder to set everything
so you can use I mean just about any
loose powder will do a really affordable
one that works well especially kind of
balance out the moisture in your skin
and you know walking that line between
having moisturized skin and having oily
skin because you don't want that
appearance the NYC smooth skin loose
face powder is really affordable I think
and it's just you get a ton of product
and it just does a good job of keeping
your skin still matte even though you
you know still have some moisture on it
so I'm just gonna go ahead and go over
the entire face with that yeah and you
know this really just helps you have
that balance not getting dry but also
you know and this this does kind of up
your coverage it kind of clings you know
a little bit and there you go guys
that's basically the whole process I
would go through to when I'm applying
tinted moisturizer again what I did and
this is a recommendation for those of
you who really do notice a change in
your skin when the weather starts to
change and the era is much more dry
there's much less humidity in the air
use a moisturizer any moisturizer and
then let that kind of thing in and then
go ahead and use a tinted moisturizer if
your tinted moisturizer is not extremely
high on the moisture side I mean we all
know if you've experienced if you've
used several different kinds of tinted
moisturizers they're not all really
moisture you know there's not a lot of
moisture in all of them some of them are
more towards the coverage side of things
to just be aware of that
you know you're gonna have to kind of
use your own opinion on your products
but once you do that some concealer some
setting powder and you'll be good to go
