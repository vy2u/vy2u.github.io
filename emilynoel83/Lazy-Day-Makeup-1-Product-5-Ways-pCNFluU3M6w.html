the bat my outfit right now is pajamas
my hair just taken out of a bun just
kind of comb through it with my fingers
and my makeup is so simple that I used
one product to go in five different
directions this is real life this is
sometimes the situation we're in where
you just want a quick go-to makeup look
this particular one is very summery I
was thinking of referring to this
actually the first word that came to
mind is a slacker makeup tutorial or a
lazy day makeup tutorial because I feel
like it's the results you want from
makeup but very little work both
physically or mentally involved here
because you just kind of grab the
product and go so the real workhorse of
this look this product I've been talking
about is my Too Faced beach bunny and
this is going to be our bronzer contour
blush highlight and eyeshadow today but
I will be taking you through the looks
start to finish so here we go so I'm
just gonna start off by blending a very
low-maintenance based products all over
my skin something that I see is kind of
a multitasker because at least this time
of year it can be my moisturizer and my
foundation in one so it's the cosmetics
CC plus this is the regular version SPF
50 and I chose the regular version for
this video not the illumination because
I really want to spotlight a different
product where glow is concerned and I
want you to see you know exactly where
that's coming from and not wondering oh
was that the CC cream or where'd that
come from so that is one full pump all
over just kind of blend it out first and
you could continue on and just do this
with your fingers very easily I just
really like buffing it in with a brush
and this is that double ended it
cosmetics brush that I've enjoyed on
it's kind of nice because it's your
foundation brush and your concealer
brush all-in-one next taking a little
Mac Pro Longwear concealer this is
the shade NC 25 I've got probably more
than I need here on my finger but I'm
gonna get a little bit of this on the
under eye area just kind of smooth it
out
and then just dab that in with the same
brush I know I talked about this quite a
bit in my makeup for beginners video but
dabbing concealer is going to maintain
so much more coverage compared to like
really sweeping back and forth
and then kind of a rediscovered product
here for setting powder this Revlon
nearly naked powder in light it's a
really like incredibly smooth textured
powder
so I'm going to pick some of that up
with my ELF complexion brush I do love
the finish of this powder on the skin
you know I think it's very natural it's
kind of a semi matte type look going to
very quickly fill in my brows this is my
ELF brow lift pencil and this is in the
shade taupe actually I like using this
for just a very very quick fill-in
because the color is soft and cool and
I've got a lot of brow already so it
this just kind of evens out those few
little parts of the brow where you know
I think I need a little even out
now I think this is kind of where the
fun begins because we're going to really
be going all over in different ways with
this beach bunny bronzer from Too Faced
this is one of two-faced bronzers that
up until recently I hadn't been very
familiar with I'd actually been using
Sun bunny a lot recently which I love I
think as a face product that's really
nice there's two tones in it but this
actually having the four shades I do
think makes a difference so if you're
looking for one product to just do a lot
of multitasking not have to really think
about what you're picking up and you
know really putting too much thought
into the technique that's what we're
gonna be talking about right now so the
first function that I want this powder
to have is kind of an all-over bronzer
type look so I'm taking my ELF
complexion brush I'm just dabbing all
over the product kind of focusing a
little bit more down on that and then
I'm gonna just start by taking this
right up next to my hairline and this
does have a little luminosity to it it's
not incredibly metallic and shimmery and
that's kind of a fine line I was walking
as I was looking at other comparable
products either they were too faint
one thing I looked at from NYC was
similar but just not pigmented enough or
I've looked at my shimmer strips from
Physicians Formula and they're a little
too shimmery to do all this stuff on
just a little too metallic so giving
myself that DEP on forehead also really
focusing it in around the temples then
light bronzer just all over thinking
about where the Sun would naturally hit
and I'm just dabbing kind of centrally
in this palette just really warming up
the skintone take it down the neck as
well this looks pretty all across the
decollete
yeah then I'm gonna do a little bit of a
cheek contour and I'm really gonna focus
my brush right there at that end I'm
gonna sort of squeeze my brush a bit
it's already a little bit flat but we're
gonna have like flatten it even more
just take this right here in the hollow
of the cheek it's not gonna be a super
intense like a really defined contour
but it really is gonna give us a little
definition there okay so bronzer and
contour are done and then for blush
we're gonna focus right here in the
center of the palate so those center two
strips ones kind of golden ones kind of
peachy I'm going to take my up and up
blush brush and I can easily you know
confine the brush to those two shades
and then I'm just gonna sweep this and
you can see that peach really coming
through sweep this on the outer part of
the apple of the cheek and it's amazing
how we're achieving you know these
different color tones with this very you
know simple looking compact and I'm
liking how its glowy you know but it's
not too glowy
these don't come off like a metallic
polarized eyeshadow you know but I think
that step with the glow that it has it
kind of helps me achieve blush and
highlight in one and then I'm going to
make it I shadow as well so first I'm
just gonna prime the lids as I would
with any product if this is the NYX
perfect I'm using this medium sweeper
brush from Sigma and I'm gonna go right
here into this goal and I'm just dabbing
it onto the lid and this is of course
just one suggested way to use this you
know as your eyeshadow because there are
other ways you could go as well
then I'm going to this brown that's
gonna be our crease shade I'm using my
e25 for that nothing complicated just
gonna stick it right there in the crease
I mean I'm not really shaping it in any
particular way I don't know about you
guys I just really get a kick out of a
product when I feel like it can really
almost be worth more than the cost you
know for all the different things it can
do and not only that but on the days
when you're really rushing around and
you want to get a look done without
having to dig through everything you own
you know this is where it's at I'm just
gonna take a little bit of that peach
now just lightly with an e 40 brush and
just very lightly blend it over the edge
of the look very simple very quick I'm
pretty pleased with the look as is but
I'm just gonna add a little something to
the lower lash line I'm gonna go over
here to this bronzy color on the side
with the pencil brush and this is just a
matter of smudging that shade right
under the eye gives you a little soft
definition but it's kind of in one of
those undetectable ways people wouldn't
come up to you and be like Oh a nice
lower liner like people are doing that
all the time other people only on
YouTube probably the one quick way I
might also perp this up is just to put a
nude liner in my lower inner rim just
because I know I'm tired right now and I
know that's probably a little reddish I
use the Jordana continuous almond just
now same basic thing as the Milani
almond cream so whichever last but not
least just given the lashes a quick curl
gonna be using my covergirl super sizer
mascara which I love which I'm probably
going to need to repurchase soon when I
am trying to be quick with a look
skipping eyeliner benefits me in the
sense that I feel like my eyelashes
stand out more when I've posted like
instant oh did I just I just let you
blink too hard got mascara down there
don't worry we're okay
this is real life people don't go too
fast with it as I was saying I actually
feel like my lashes stand out a lot more
if I eliminate the liner assuming I'm
not wearing false lashes now in an
effort to really make this product go as
far as possible I even when I was
testing out this look I put like
Vaseline on my lips and I mixed this
product and like dad did over the lips
and it seemed like a little extra work
compared to just a random with product
you might grab so I'm not gonna do that
today but you could do that if you
really wanted to keep it very like this
product being the root of the entire
look but I think what this look lips are
really where you can have fun you know
you don't have to keep it neutral with
just as much effort you know you can do
something brighter and really kind of
just change the overall vibe of this
look for me today I'm gonna use
something that's kind of like a neutral
rosy
type shade it's the Fergie velvet matte
lip color and this shade is called
fashion darling and they're interesting
because they don't go on like has crazy
full color as maybe some other pencil
lip products you might know but they
feel so like soapy as they go on and
they're kind of just buildable where the
intensity is concerned
and here's just how simple we're keeping
this I'm still in my pajama top ear I'm
just gonna take my hair out of this bun
hope that it has you know some decent
wave to it and volume just kind of style
it a bit with my fingers here again it's
the finished look this is one product
five ways makes for a very easy makeup
look and you don't want to take the time
to make a lot of decisions and I really
like the finished look you know it's not
fussy at all it's just very simple I
hope this was helpful to you guys thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
