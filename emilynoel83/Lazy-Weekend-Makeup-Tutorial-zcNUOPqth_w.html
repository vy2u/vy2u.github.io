where you wake up you got a lot to do
and you just don't want to take all that
much time with your makeup well I have
coined this look the lazy weekend makeup
look and I'm going to take you
step-by-step through what I did on my
face eyes and lips and it really doesn't
take much time at all of it might look
like you've put a little more work into
yourself then you actually have but it
is so quick and easy and there's just a
few tricks in there to sort of give
yourself that polished appearance
without taking all the extra time so if
you want to see how I did it keep on
watching guys first step I'm going to
grab my Kat Von D tattoo concealer from
Sephora and just my shade is light and
just dab a little bit kind of you know
corners of your eyes we've all got a
little bit of that discoloration you
know right around our eye area and just
kind of blend that in and you'll see
that start to melt away a little bit
here just going around my eye and the
outer corners especially you know can
kind of show some tiredness and whatnot
so we can just eliminate that real quick
by using being concealer that is more of
a one-step process rather than e a
two-step or anything like that now after
you've put concealer around your eyes or
anywhere else on your face you feel like
you need it I'm going to grab something
that I think i can use really really
quickly to get foundation coverage and
it's the Milani minerals compact makeup
and my shade is true beige and it comes
with a little puff like thing but you
could definitely use a brush which is
what I'm going to do here so I'm just
going to grab I can find it yeah just a
kabuki brush and just kind of use it on
right on top of the powder there and
just blend that all over this does
eliminate when your minerals are already
pressed like this this eliminates the
whole you know tapping it in and and
swirling and all that business so here
we're just able to really quickly get to
get the product from the makeup to our
face
alright next step is bronzer and
oftentimes you see me using multiple
bronzers to achieve you know the
highlighting and the contoured effect
but if we're just kind of trying to be
lazy with this look I'm going to use my
Milani sunset duo's bronzer and blush
and this is in sunset breeze so I'm
going to use that blush shade there too
so it's 2 &amp;amp; 1 you don't have to mess
with opening up to different products
I'm gonna get some on a excuse me a
fluffier kabuki brush and just apply
that you know you can you can still kind
of contour with this because it's matt
and it's not gonna you know interfere
too much with what's going on with your
skin type you know you do a lot of
people don't like to add too much
shimmer if that blemishes or something
like that so got to worry about that
with this matte powder so just get that
all over your face a lighter dusting on
top of your cheeks down your nose okay
and bronzer step is done and then I'm
going to go into the blush here this
plum shade I'm going to use my angled
blush brush from coastal scents and just
apply that right there to your cheeks
the I look here is really really easy
i'm going to use a black kind of jumbo
pencil this one's from wet and wild and
it is called graphite so i'm going to
basically just draw this lightly all
over my lid and you might be thinking
you know i was expecting something you
know maybe not involving like black sand
and smokey tones but you know what when
we want to be lazy but we also want to
look good so we want to have it both
ways so i'm going to show you a way that
you can really do that with this look so
you see i'm patting over and I'm kind of
picking up any excess moisture there on
my finger then I'm going to go to my
physicians formula palette and this is
baked smokes okay I'm going to go to
that middle shade right here it's
actually not in the middle of the
palette but it's the middle tone it's
kind of a medium gray color and i'm
going to pick that up on my ELF
eyeshadow brush and I'm going to just
put that on
over the lid it'll stick really nicely
to the black pencil we just put on there
okay so once you've got that all over
the majority of the lid just flip your
brush over this is just a really quick
way to you know not have to clean it off
in between and I'm picking up the light
shimmery shade there and I'm going to
put that on the inner half of the lid
yes like that okay third shade is the so
we've done let's see we've done this
shade on most of the lid this shade on
the inner half and then we're going to
use that deepest charcoal gray using my
essence of beauty crease brush and we're
just going to work at these these are so
easy to blend just moving it right here
into the crease not really worrying
about a defined outer V or anything like
that i'm just getting the color in there
and I just find that you know this is a
wearable look for daytime but yet it
looks like you've done a little
something but these colors are so you
know just using the colors you have
within one pallet can speed up your
application a lot okay so now that
you've got that if you want to mess with
a highlight i would suggest just going
to your back to your bronzer getting a
fluffy brush and just this will just
lightly lightly warm up this area for
you and then if you wanted to go back to
the lightest shimmery shade put a little
right under the highest part of your
arch there you go shadow is done so then
for liner i'm going to use my all may
black eyeliner pencil and i'm just going
to go on the outer half here of the top
lid
it's kind of slightly thickening your
line as you go outward all right just
like so and then we're going to go
underneath as well and just leave it
right to your close to your inner corner
sorry hardest part for me is just
staying in the shot when I do this okay
after that you want to set that and it
takes no time at all I would really
recommend not skipping this step go to
the darkest shade take your angled liner
brush and just go right over the top
what this is doing that that creamy
liner has Cares hoops drop my brush that
creamy liner has oils in it that you
don't want to transfer on to other parts
of your face so primarily the cheek area
right below so I'm just going right over
that we're not being all that careful
but it's kind of a smudged out smoky
look anyway so that's fine then we're
going to curl our eyelashes grab my
covergirl volume exact mascara I think
it gives you a lot of bang for your buck
here because it defines your lashes so
well makes you look like you have more
like there's more there than maybe there
actually is lengthens them out
beautifully so just apply a couple of
coats of that and maybe one coat to the
bottom and your eyes will be set for the
day
just like now for our lips again it's
sort of that we're trying to kind of
deceive people with this makeup look
make it look like maybe we did a little
more to ourselves and we actually did
and a great way to do that guys is a red
lipstick so I'm going to be using my NYX
round lipstick in he be it's a chibi II
or he bore I don't know I don't even
know but I'm going to just go ahead and
put that on it's a it's a pretty red
shade that's a little bit shimmery to
skipping these loss and the liner and
everything not only does it make your
teeth seem wider it just makes your
whole look look a little bit more like I
don't know finished and refined so
anyway guys that is the whole look here
I hope you enjoyed kind of learning a
few strategies to just speed up your
makeup look and still make it look good
and polish for the day and hope you guys
have a great weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
