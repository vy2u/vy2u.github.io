in for this Lea Michele red carpet look
this is inspired by her look at the 2010
Emmys and I've done some research I've
been looking around online and finding
some interviews with her makeup artist
and she basically revealed what products
were used it was a lot of NARS products
on the eyes and lips and cheeks and so I
sort of looked around in my own
collection to see what products might
become less expensive dupes for those
things so you will see how I use those
in this video but this is a really nice
look it's a very fresh look on the face
but the eyes are definitely more
dramatic than their use then you're used
to seeing Lea have as Rachel Berry on
the show for example this is a little
more glamorous a little more fun so I
hope you enjoyed this look and keep on
one I'm going to apply some of my
Palladio herbal eyeshadow primer all
over my lid so just get a little bit on
there and we want to kind of spread that
upwards you can see how my nail polish
completely popped off one of my nails
there sorry about that I just spread
that all the way from lid up to using my
covergirl eye brightening eyeshadow this
is the set for brown eyes and I'm just
using this light shade right here and
just kind of dust that all over the lid
and take it all the way up to the brow
as well so this is gonna be kind of like
our base shade here the shadow with this
whole space here under the brow we want
to warm that up and make it just a
little bit more golden so I'm going to
take some of this gold shade just to get
a really light amount on your brush and
kind of start dusting that over the top
until you get the desired level of
golden glow up there we just want it to
be a you know a little more gold a
little less just white so we're gonna go
in with some liner I'm going to use my
L'Oreal extra intense liquid pencil
liner the I want to use a creamy pencil
liner because that's what was used on
Lea Michele but I also want something
that I know is going to really last
where I where I put it so I know that
this is going to become very smudge
proof
after a little while so kind of start in
don't go all the way in because we're
gonna do is you can see something a
little bit colorful right there on the
inner corner so just kind of start I
don't know about three quarters of the
way in and it doesn't have to be perfect
because this is going to be smudged but
just do your best to get very close to
your lash line and go all the way to the
end of your off to get to the end we're
going to create a fairly pronounced wing
here so I'm just going to angle it up
right here at the outer part of my eye
and you know it comes off definitely a
little bit thicker than if I was doing
this just with a liquid liner you know I
mean it's it's a pencil so it's gonna be
a thicker line and that's the nature of
her I've got that line there I'm just
kind of going over it with a q-tip and
just smudging out what I can
the makeup artist took like a sort of
bright blue eye shadow and smudged it
over that black liner my dupe for the
NARS shade she used would be this blue
ice shade from Milani so I'm just gonna
get a little bit on sort of a pencil
type brush smudge brush and I'm gonna
just take that right over the top of my
liner there and you can see it's going
to take your liner and give it more of a
navy blue appearance than black also
kind of brushing some of that bright
blue in sort of a sheer way all over the
lid then we're going to go to the darker
shade in this palette which is sort of a
dark grey charcoal kind of color and I'm
gonna just slightly get that up into the
crease and sort of blend it on top of
everything we've done there on the lid
is creating a real outer V here just
kind of keep it in your natural lash
line keeping with this kind of arch
there and if you need to bring in a
fluffier brush to help blend that out go
in a liner brush with that same dark
shade I'm just kind of patting over that
wing just I don't want it I want it to
still remain pretty dark and not get too
blue I want to keep it in sort of that
Navy range there
and then there's not a lot of lower
liner going on but there is just a
little definition there I feel so I'm
just taking that darkest shade in the
covergirl palette and just bringing that
smudging that basically right in with my
lower lashes I don't want it to be very
identifiable at all that there's liner
there but I just do want a little more
definition and don't worry about making
any big connection with the up next
there's kind of an interesting twist on
this look there's sort of a turquoise
pencil jumbo cream pencil used right in
the inner corner and I found a Coastal
Scents
double ended pencil that has it's got
kind of a periwinkle blue and then a
really nice turquoise on this end and so
what I'm going to do this is just used
as kind of like a highlight in the inner
corner of the eye and these pencils are
super easy to use so I'm just taking
that in going to the point where I left
off there with the liner and just bring
that up a little bit so you've got that
little pop of color in the inner so I'm
going to curl my eyelashes I'm applying
a coat of the voluminous carbon black
mascara to my upper lash line lower
lashes I'm using some Maybelline lash
discovery we want to build up some
thickness here so just kind of wiggle it
right next to sort of where your lashes
hook in there right at the added
thickness I'm applying some false
eyelashes i'm using the intensifying
false lashes from revlon and i'm also
using the revlon precision lash adhesive
i still really like this glue and i use
it every time i use false eyelashes so
i'll put those on and then i'll tell you
about the rest of guys here's my
finished look for my Lea Michele
red-carpet makeup this look was really
actually very easy to do and it just
basically involved a really pronounced
cat eye effect and just a few different
things with the shadow but I just
thought she had a really interesting
look there she has really thick lashes
so I think false eyelashes are kind of a
must for this look on the lips I found
pretty much a shade I thought was
perfect but she has a little bit of what
I think it might be a
Matt finish there so this happened to
have a little shimmer in it but it's the
Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick in a rose
do it gives you kind of that pinky a
little bit Coralie maybe look but to
kind of tone down the shimmer
I took a ball that I knew was not super
shiny and I dabbed that over the top I
used the lush lip balm and honey trap
just a very you know regular old lip
balm it really has no frills to it no
shimmer Oh shine and I just dab that
over the top and it actually gave a
really nice and matte effect to the
lipstick so that was interesting and
Leah Michelle has a really identifiable
pronounced bone structure she's got you
know almost sort of a squarish face with
a really pronounced jawline here more so
than I do but to sort of recreate that
look basically all over my face did my
foundation and then I use this Rimmel
natural bronzer in Sundance this is a
light bronzer with a little bit of
shimmer and it just kind of gives the
face an all-over glow then I did to kind
of give my cheekbones a little more
definition I used one of my favorite
contours the covergirl blush and golden
pink and I ran that kind of right in
here and then for blush I used Pinchot
pink for a Maybelline which is a nice
pink blush like this just to give the
cheeks a little bit of a pink glow and
then the key to this is too when you
highlight I use my benefit highlighter
in ten I use this light kind of fun sort
of pinky champagne highlight the key to
the highlight for her is to not just
highlight up here but I also took the
highlight down here and it gives the
effect that the cheeks cheekbone is
coming in and then the jaw is kind of
coming back out just a little bit at the
bottom so I don't know just a little
trick to try to recreate her look but
this is more of an inspired look just
trying to use to get the similar effect
on the eyes that she had on her red
carpet appearance so thank you so much
for watching guys I hope you enjoy Glee
as much as I do and I think Lea Michele
is just awesome so thanks a lot for
tuning in and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
