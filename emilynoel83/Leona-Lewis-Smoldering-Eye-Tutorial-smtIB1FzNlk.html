this video this is a celebrity inspired
look and my subject or the celebrity
it's inspired by is Leona Lewis and I
found this picture of her in my
sophisticates hair style guide I'm not
exactly sure what it's from she has some
sort of like a net over her face but if
you look at her eye makeup it's just
really sultry and smoky and just the
epitome of sort of the smokey eye but
kind of an undone look as well her
entire skin is good you know her whole
face is glowing and so in this tutorial
I'll take you step by step on the eyes
I'm going to be using a sigma palette
which offers a lot of that dewy shimmer
we're looking for and then I'll talk at
the end about some of the face products
I used to get this look to and its
really the look that I always feel like
when I see her in magazines or or on TV
I feel like she has that look of like
she just got out of a sauna or something
everything is just glowing it's a really
pretty look and I hope you'll stick
around us sing a bit on this I i put on
my Too Faced shadow insurance I primer
and then i went ahead and kind of forgot
who's doing a tutorial and i went and
started doing things on both eyes but
fortunately i caught myself soon enough
I used the elf duo shadow cream in
butter pecan and I used this sort of
golden a brown shade and I just patted
that all over my lid and really kind of
patted it again once i put it on there
just to really share it out and make
sure there wasn't a ton of product on
there for creasing and then I took the
peachy shade and I went all the way up
here to my brow and this just kind of
gives us kind of a dewy base to begin
with for this look I'm going to be using
as a shadow I'm using my Sigma palette
and these are the neutral shades that
come in the little to go palette thing
and these are very very shimmery and
could potentially have a lot of fallout
so that's why it's nice to have that
extra sort of sticky a base down there
for them to really cling to so the first
thing we're going to do shadow wise is
really get a deep shade all over our lid
and sort of around our eyes so we're
going to use the shadow and brown eyed
girl that's this one right here
see it's very deep shimmery it's kind of
like a dark dark topi gray shade so
that's going to be perfect for this look
I'm going to take my elf I shadow brush
any flat brush that you like will do and
just kind of load that up and go all
over your lid with that shade and just
kind of Pat it on because like I said
this is a very that there's there's a
lot of color to these shadows and a lot
of shimmer and we've already got a lot
of shimmer kind of on our face with this
look so we don't necessarily want to add
a lot more so just kind of go all over
and now we're going to start to be a
little less precise with this I'm going
to put some on my brush and kind of flip
it over and just kind of get the crease
and and sort of work it out like kind of
drawing on a little bit of an outer V
here because the shadow does in the
picture really come out from her I so we
want to definitely duplicate that so go
around and then this is a purpose I
don't know if I've ever really used this
brush for because I tend to be a lot
more precise with the shadow under my
eye but this is a little more you know
that messy sultry look so kind of dip
your brush downward into your shadow
like that get a little bit on there and
then just use a slightly bigger brush
like this not not a precise liner brush
start taking that shade right under your
eye and take it under you know pretty
much all the way in just like so sorry
and kind of lighten it up as you get to
the inner part but we just really want
to have that dark shade not in a fine
line but just kind of all the way around
next take any fluffier brush I'm going
to use my Sephora rounded crease brush
and just go over the border of that
shade it'll it'll buff out for you
really nicely but just soften that up a
little bit and let's look it's been a
little different because we are
kind of starting with the darker shades
and then moving in with our lighter
shades I'm going to take a shade that's
not in that palette because I want
something just basically black i'm using
this makeup forever diamond shadow it's
sparkly black shade the shade wore off
the pallet there so I'm not sure what it
is but i'm using my smash mobs number 33
brush it's a smudge brush so a little
smaller a lot smaller than the elf brush
we were just using and i want to take
that black shadow and just kind of run
it under because it's even deeper on the
bottom with the black so get some on a
smallish brush like this that's still
once again not a precise liner brush and
just kind of take that all the way under
then we also want to work that same
shade into the crease i'm using my
essence of beauty fine crease brush and
just going into like the outer corner
area and working that in so we've really
just got this this dark dark area right
in them in the outer outer edge of this
look now we're going to start playing
with some of the lighter shades in this
look and I think what makes this
different is the fact that there is a
lot going on in terms of like intense
shimmer and like shimmery taupe right on
the inner part but an area that I really
don't touch that much with my eye makeup
but it's like right in here if you look
at the picture you can pull it up for
you you can see that there's definitely
some shimmer pulling all the way in to
this not quite in Turk or part right
here so I'm going to take a flat brush
I'm using my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow
brush and we're going to be going
between two different shades to get that
perfect kind of really shimmery taupe
and I'm going to be using this one right
here which is indian girl and this one
above is brown sugar so kind of mixing
the two what one is a little more on the
silvery side and one is a little more
Brown I think we'll have the perfect
shade here so first if that silvery
shave that one is indian girl get some
of that on a flat brush like this and
just kind of Pat that in right in this
general
area right here it's really going to add
some sparkle I'm kind of overlapping
with some of the brown to get this
really ultra shimmery look there and
then if you want there's a very light
shade called Angie and it's sort of a
light kind of pearl light pink and you
can take any kind of fluffy or a brush
with that to use the Sephora rounded
crease brush get a little bit on there
and kind of take that right up here
under the brown and there's a couple of
finishing touches here as well a couple
of other places if you look at the
difference now between this I and this I
you can see a little more light that
we've placed on the lid because we want
that look of like you know it's just the
lid is just glowing right here in the
center area so i'm taking angie that
lightest shade in the sigma palette and
I'm just kind of dotting it on with this
tiny brush from that I have from Coastal
Scents I'm just dotting that shade on
and i also want to dot a little bit
right in here and that's really gonna I
think set off this look a little bit
more and one more thing before we finish
with the liner this look while it is
definitely not your typical shadow look
I mean it's it's it's not precise or
anything like that but we do want to
kind of create a border from our skin to
our shadow she definitely you know there
is an end to this kind of smoky look so
take any powder i'm using my maybelline
dream matte powder and just a concealer
brush that I use for dry product and
just take that powder around the outside
here don't go on top of your shadow but
just go right under it and that's going
to kind of create a definite border to
an end to all the shimmer in the eye
area like that and Leona has her water
line lined and what appears to be black
so just go ahead and do that I'm use
my almay a pencil liner in black it's
pretty creamy it definitely gives you
the black appearance there on your on
your waterline kind of take it in just a
little bit then we're going to curl our
lashes I'm going to use my Rimmel the
max volume flash mascara and the awesome
pink tube on my upper and lower lashes
and then I'll join you with the finished
look
all right guys here is the finished look
as you can see it's a lot different from
a lot of the looks I've done because not
only are the eyes very shimmery and
undefined the whole face makeup has an
element of shimmer to it it's kind of
like just that really hot sexy kind of
fun just it's kind of a summary look is
what it feels like to me but I think
it's fun to do these kind of looks in
the winter as well because you know it's
just not that nice outside and you can
just kind of bring that that feeling
back to your skin and so yeah I just put
the mascara on the upper and lower
lashes because she clearly has some I
mean maybe even more thickness on the
lower lashes than the upper eyelashes
but what really makes this whole look
come together is a lot of shimmer with
the face so I just wanted to go over
briefly what I did do with my face
makeup I first went all over my skin
with this bronze booster this is
something i reviewed wasn't really nuts
about but it does provide if you are
going for this ultra shimmery look it
provides a lot of shimmer and there is
like some self tanner in it it's the
self tanning bronzing veil by physicians
formula so I put that all over my skin
and then I touched up sort of areas
around my eyes nose chin with the Revlon
Photoready makeup in natural beige and
this is not your typical like it
completely matte foundation there is a
little bit of like a I don't want to say
shimmer but it's not just an entirely
matte foundation there's just a little
bit of glow to it that it gives you so
went all over with that and then I kept
going with the cream products because
cream products are what's really going
to give you the best shimmer here so i
use the elf all over cover all over
color stick and toasted you can see
that's kind of a golden a tone there and
i went kind of on my cheeks with that
and just all over any areas that i
wanted that extra glow and if i wanted
to really light in certain areas and
highlight them like my chin bridge my
nose and right here this area you can
see in the picture those were the areas
where she's really light i used the wet
and wild mega glow in Sunkist which is
even
you can see how reflective that is it's
even lighter than the toasted so put
that all over and then I kind of topped
off several areas with my mac MSF in
soft in soft and gentle it's hard trying
to remember like the whole sequence
because this really was a lot of
products on my face but I use that here
here you can kind of see the areas and
right like on the Cupid's bow area so
really kind of solidified those less
places that were just creamy I kind of
wanted have the powder on top for
staying power purposes so I used that
then what I used on my lips is the bonny
Bell lip lights and spun sugar and that
kind of dabbed it off because it really
really was light but I do think it this
sort of mimics the shade she has which
is a very super super light shimmery
pink and other than that guys that's
pretty much the way I achieved this look
definitely a little undone a little
Messier but I like it a lot and I hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial as well
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
