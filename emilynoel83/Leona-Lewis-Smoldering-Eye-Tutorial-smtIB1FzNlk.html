this video this is a celebrity inspired
look and my subject or the celebrity
it's inspired by is Leona Lewis and I
found this picture of her in my
sophisticates hair style guide I'm not
exactly sure what it's from she has some
sort of like net
over her face but if you look at her eye
makeup it's just really sultry and smoky
and just the epitome of sort of the
smoky eye but kind of an undone look as
well her entire skin is you know her
whole face is glowing and so in this
tutorial I'll take you step by step on
the eyes I'm gonna be using a sigma
palette which offers a lot of that dewy
shimmer we're looking for and then I'll
talk at the end about some of the face
products I used to get this look - and
its really the look that I always feel
like when I see her in magazines or or
on TV I feel like she has that look of
like she just got out of a sauna or
something everything is just glowing
it's a really pretty look and I hope
you'll stick around this thing I did on
this eye I put on my Too Faced shadow
insurance eye primer and then I went
ahead and kind of forgot if it's doing a
tutorial and I went and started doing
things on both eyes but fortunately I
caught myself soon enough I used the elf
duo shadow cream in butter pecan and I
used this sort of golden e brown shade
and I just patted that all over my lid
and really kind of patted it again once
I put it on there just to really sheer
it out and make sure there wasn't a ton
of product on there for creasing and
then I took the peachy shade and I went
all the way up here to my brow and this
just kind of gives us kind of a dewy
base to begin with for this look and I'm
going to be using as a shadow I mean
using my Sigma palette and these are the
neutral shades that come in the little
to go palette thing and these are very
very shimmery and could potentially have
a lot of Fallout so that's why it's nice
to have that extra sort of sticky base
down there for them to really cling to
so the first thing we're going to do
shadow wise is really get a deep shade
all over our lid and sort of around our
eyes so we're going to use the shadow
and brown-eyed girl
that's this one right here you can see
it's very deep shimmery it's kind of
like a dark dark topi gray shades so
that's gonna be perfect for this look
I'm gonna take my ELF eyeshadow brush
and a flat brush that you like will do
and just kind of load that up and go all
over your lid with that shade and just
kind of Pat it on because like I said
this is a very that there's there's a
lot of color to these shadows and a lot
of shimmer and we've already got a lot
of shimmer kind of on our face with this
look so we don't necessarily want to add
a lot more so just kind of go all over
and now we're gonna start to be a little
less precise with this I'm gonna put
some on my brush and kind of flip it
over and just kind of get the crease and
and sort of work it out like kind of
drawing on a little bit of an outer V
here because the shadow does in the
picture really come out from her eye so
we want to definitely duplicate that so
go around and then this is a purpose I
don't know if I've ever really used this
brush for because I tend to be a lot
more precise with the shadow under my
eye but this is a little more you know
that messy sultry look so kind of dip
your brush downward into your shadow
like that get a little bit on there and
then just use a slightly bigger brush
like this not not a precise liner brush
start taking that shade right under your
eye and take it under you know pretty
much all the way in just like so sorry
you can kind of lighten it up as you get
to the inner part but we just really
want to have that dark shade not in a
fine line but just kind of all the way
around
next take any fluffier brush I'm going
to use my Sephora rounded crease brush
and just go over at the border of that
shade it'll it'll buff out for you
really nicely but just soften that up a
little bit and
look has been a little different because
we are kind of starting with the darker
shades and then moving in with our
lighter shades I'm gonna take a shade
that's not in that palette because I
want something just basically black I'm
using this makeup forever diamond shadow
it's the sparkly black shade the shade
wore off the palette there so I'm not
sure what it is but I'm using my
Smashbox number 33 brush it's a smudge
brush so a little smaller a lot smaller
than the elf brush we were just using
and I want to take that black shadow and
just kind of run it under because it's
even deeper on the bottom with the black
so get some on a smallish brush like
this that's still once again not a
precise liner brush and just kind of
take that all the way under then we also
want to work that same shade into the
crease I'm using my essence of beauty
fine crease brush and just going into
like the outer corner area and working
that in so we've really just got this
this dark dark area right in them in the
outer edge of this look now we're going
to start playing with some of the
lighter shades in this look and I think
what makes this different is the fact
that there is a lot going on in terms of
like intense shimmer and like shimmery
taupe right on the inner part light an
area that I really don't touch that much
with my eye makeup but it's like right
in here if you look at the picture you
can pull it up for you you can see that
there's definitely some shimmer pulling
all the way in to this not quite in Terk
or nerd on here but inner part right
here so I'm going to take a flat brush
I'm using my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow
brush and we're gonna be going between
two different shades to get that perfect
kind of really shimmery taupe and I'm
going to be using this one right here
which is Indian girl and this one above
is brown sugar so kind of mixing the two
with what one is a little more on the
silvery side and one is a little more
Brown I think will have the perfect
shade here so first get that silver a
 shave that one is Indian girl get
some of that on a flat brush like this
and just kind of Pat that in
right in this general area right here
it's really gonna add some sparkle I'm
kind of overlapping with some of the
brown to get this really ultra shimmery
look there and then if you want there's
a very light shade called Angie and it's
sort of a light kind of pearl light pink
and you can take any kind of fluffy or a
brush with that you can use the Sephora
rounded crease brush get a little bit on
there and kind of take that right up
here under the brow and there's a couple
of finishing touches here as well a
couple of other places if you look at
the difference now between this eye and
this eye you can see a little more light
that we've placed on the lid because we
want that look of like you know it's
just the lid is just glowing right here
in the center area so I'm taking Angie
that lightest shade in the Sigma palette
and I'm just kind of dotting it on with
this tiny brush from that I have from
Coastal Scents
I'm just dotting that shade on and I
also want to dot a little bit right in
here and that's really gonna I think set
off this look a little bit more and one
more thing before we finish with the
liner this look while it is definitely
not your typical shadow look I mean it's
it's it's not precise or anything like
that but we do want to kind of create a
border from our skin to our shadow she
definitely you know there is an end to
this kind of smokey look so take any
powder I'm using my Maybelline Dream
matte powder and just a concealer brush
that I use for dry product and just take
that powder around the outside here
don't go on top of your shadow but just
go right under it and that's gonna kind
of create a definite border to an end to
all the shimmer in the eye area like
that and Leona has her waterline lined
and what appears to be black so just go
ahead
do that I'm using my almay pencil liner
in black it's pretty creamy it
definitely gives you the the black
appearance there on your on your
waterline kind of take it in just a
little bit then we're going to curl our
lashes I'm going to use my Rimmel the
max volume flash mascara and the awesome
pink tube on my upper and lower lashes
and then I'll join you with the finished
look
alright guys here is the finished look
as you can see it's a lot different from
a lot of the looks I've done because not
only are the eyes very shimmery and
undefined the whole face makeup it has
an element of shimmer to it it's kind of
like just that really hot sexy kind of
fun just it's kind of a summery look is
what it feels like to me but I think
it's fun to do these kind of looks in
the winter as well because you know it's
just not that nice outside and you can
just kind of bring that that feeling
back to your skin and so yeah I just put
the mascara on the upper and lower
lashes because she clearly has some
maybe even more thickness on the lower
lashes than the upper eyelashes but what
really makes this whole look come
together is a lot of shimmer with the
face so I just wanted to go over briefly
what I did do with my face makeup I
first went all over my skin with this
bronze booster this is something I
reviewed wasn't really nuts about but it
does provide if you are going for this
ultra shimmery look it provides a lot of
shimmer and there is like some self
tanner in it it's the self tanning
bronzing veiled by Physicians Formula so
I put that all over my skin and then I
touched up sort of areas around my eyes
nose chin with the Revlon Photoready
makeup in natural beige and this is not
your typical like it completely matte
foundation there is a little bit of like
a I don't want to say shimmer but it's
not just an entirely matte foundation
there's just a little bit of glow to it
but it gives you so went all over with
that and then I kept going with the
cream products because cream products
are what's really going to give you the
best shimmer here so I use the elf
all-over cover all over color stick and
toasted and you can see that's kind of a
golden aid tone there and I went kind of
on my cheeks with that and just all over
any areas that I wanted that extra glow
and if I wanted to really light in
certain areas and high
then like my chin bridging my nose and
right here this area you can see in the
picture those were the areas where she's
really light I used the Wet n Wild mega
glow in Sunkist which is even you can
see how reflective that is it's even
lighter than the toasted so put that all
over and then I kind of topped off
several areas with my Mac MSF in soft in
soft and gentle it's hard trying to
remember like the whole sequence cuz
this really was a lot of products on my
face but I use that here here you can
kind of see the areas and right like on
the Cupid's bow area so really kind of
solidified those less places that were
just creamy I kind of wanted have the
powder on top for staying power purposes
so I used that then what I used on my
lips is the Bonnie Bell lip lights and
spun sugar and that kind of dabbed it
off because it really really was light
but I do think it this sort of mimics
the shade she has which is a very super
super light shimmery pink and other than
that guys that's pretty much the way I
achieved this look definitely a little
undone a little Messier but I like it a
lot and I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial as well and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
