joining me for this video I feel like
it's been a long time since my last
video but I don't know it probably
hasn't been like that long but a lot has
happened in between then and now I had
to travel a little ways I've just been
on the road a lot it seems like but I
had to travel for an event for the
Illinois broadcasters association it's
known as the Silverdome awards and I
didn't think I was gonna really come
home with anything but I did win for
best anchor so that was really really
exciting it's for the state of Illinois
outside Chicago so that was really fun
and then I went back home for a wedding
for a couple of my friends so that was
great i did the bride's makeup so yeah
lots to talk about where that's
concerned but i do want to do a tutorial
for you on the sephora color easter
palette which was oops something fell
out in there it's that little pic that
helps you pop them out but that's the
one downside that kind of floats around
in here i found the more I've had this
but I reviewed this recently so check
out my review for all the ins and outs
of that palette but this tutorial is
going to be focused on the look I'm
wearing today which is really some
shades of lilac paired with navy
typically I might use black it's like my
contrast color to deepen things up but
I'm loving the look of Navy with lilac
shades so this is a look at my little
palette that I made for myself for this
tutorial so I shadows here and here this
is a lip gloss and then I have a couple
of blush shades so I'm going to show you
how i use all of this in this tutorial
so keep on watching
alright step 1 i'm going to take my NYX
HD high definition shadow base which I
really like I love that you can put it
on and it only takes a small amount and
you can see it kind of neutralized all
that discoloration on my eyelid and it
kind of gives it one solid color without
being real thick so it's like I think
it's actually a better version of
Smashbox photo finish lid primer so this
is a really good value so anyway put
that all over my lid and then I have
made my little Sephora color easter
palette as I showed you here just with
all the different colors I want to use
and I'm going to start with this pretty
kind of lilac shade here and I'm going
to load that up on a flat brush minus
from sigma and I'm just going to Pat
that all over the lid and this I find
that these shades are pretty buildable
so just kind of keep going back and
layering it on as much as you want as
bold as you want the color to be and
you'll find I'm concentrating it on the
inner part and then you know the outer
part we're going to be putting a darker
shade so don't worry about that as much
then with a little bit larger brush this
is my SS 222 and just kind of a crease
brush here I'm taking that same color
and just really lightly getting it on
the inner part of my crease here and
then I've taken a shade that has a
little less purple in it and a little
more of a bluish kind of a periwinkle
lavender and I'm going to take a little
bit of that on that same brush and just
use that to slightly deepen the crease
on the inner part here and back to my
flat brush I'm going to use a gorgeous
bluish Navy shade this has some shimmer
to it it's really really pretty and I'm
just going to be patting that on the
outer half of my lid here so it's going
to be nicely deep end up I love using
Navy as an alternative with you know
purples instead of black say and as your
dark
I think Navy really complements the look
very well and after you've patted it on
there I kind of like to flip the brush
around and I find it just gives you a
really nice angle just to get that blue
on the outside as well and using my 224
from Sigma just kind of buffing out the
edge of that and then you'll notice here
it's almost like the color just
gradually extends up and so I'm going to
go back to the shade we put on our lid
because it's got just enough warmth to
it just enough pink in that shade to
actually make a really pretty um sort of
on top of the brow bone color here right
there really pretty this kind of reminds
me of like a violet or almost floral
inspired look with some of these pretty
colors we're using here so I'm just
using I'm put doing really really light
applications but you'll notice me going
back to build up to it so you don't want
to just slap a whole bunch of color on
there all at once but continue building
going back and get it as strong as you
want like I said what I like about a lot
of the colors in this palette is that I
find they are pretty buildable i'm using
a small brush this is my mini contour
brush from Coastal Scents I love it but
a q-tip can do the same job as well and
I just took out a really frosty silvery
shade out of that palette so I get a
little bit on there and what we're going
to do is kind of like a c-shape as a
half circle a right around the tear duct
and this is just going to serve to
really brighten this area and kind of
just draw you in to everything that's
going on around it it almost gives it a
little bit of a glossy appearance a
little bit dewy look on the eyes so
really high shimmer things can do that
and see how I'm actually taking it in
look at how the shimmer goes up in here
so I'm taking it up just whatever is
left on the brush and going up and
around and just under the brow we're
going to do a little bit more there see
how now that that's got a really nice
highlight
under the brow area and then just maybe
a little bit more under the arch and
kind of flick that downward to continue
to emphasize the Blues in this look I'm
going to be using a Navy liner this is
from the elf studio collection the shade
is called midnight it really comes off
like a bluish black so I'm just using a
small pointed brush for a mac with this
really any pointed brush with your cream
liners I find gives a really nice
detailed affect your line does not get
too thick on you so just go I'm going to
be going all across the upper lash line
I sometimes like to start in the middle
now cream liners do come in the color
easter palette there just wasn't a navy
um so just so you know that's why I
wasn't using the ones from the palette
right now you can see I'm thickening the
line a little bit toward the outside
giving myself almost a little bit of a
wing but the wing is not going to turn
out to be super important since we're
going to put on some false lashes that
will mimic that look we could do no
liner and and have a winged look because
of these lashes we're going to be
putting on so anyway I'm just kind of
going around here and I'm going to be
taking it about halfway in also going to
be lining the waterline there's this
gorgeous shade called purple blaze from
NYX and it's the slide on liner I think
these are great for the waterline I'm
liking them more and more the more I use
them but yeah just kind of gently
exposed the water line so you can get
that on there and it's not going to be
really dark but it's just going to be
kind of something different it's not
going to give you quite the wide-eyed
look that a white liner on your
waterline will give you but it helps to
go with this sort of sweeping motion
we've got here with the outer corner
once we have those lashes on then we're
going to take a not so precise smaller
brush but it's a pencil brush it's a 219
and this is going to be nice for
layering over our lower liner to give it
a little more of this smokey look so
I've put in an even deeper Navy shades
so this is what wasn't on the
our corner this is going to be like our
liner topper here so just get a little
bit on your brush and I'm just going
over the top of what I did on my lower
lash line also smudge that over the
upper lash line as well soften that up a
bit also going to take the little bit
periwinkle shade that shade right there
and just apply that a little bit right
under the inner part being careful to
leave our little highlight going on
there but this just kind of brings out
more of the color we have we have in
this look next up I'm going to apply
some false eyelashes these are the
whimsical lashes from Coastal Scents but
it's the type that I said was very
comparable to the Sonia Kashuk ones that
I featured these in my favorite false
eyelashes video but they're a half strip
longer on the outside so take those take
whatever lash glue you like to use I
really swear by the revlon precision
lash glue songkhla going to apply these
to the outer half of my upper lid and
then join you with blush and lips is
going to actually do just a little bit
of contouring with some bronzer since
there's not a real deep contour shade in
the color easter palette so this is my
too faced chocolate soleil bronzer it's
a matte bronzer and I'm just going to
apply this right here just kind of you
can see we're sort of the indentation is
there under the cheekbone and kind of
take it down under the jaw line as well
then I've taken a light pink blush
that's in the color easter palette so
i'm going to pick up some of that and
apply that right here to the apples of
my cheeks and up it's really pretty
shade i think it's going to look good on
a lot of skin tones actually and then I
took this light shade it's kind of like
a super light shimmery blush almost like
a highlight so it kind of reminds me of
the spotlight powder from lorac so the
perfectly lit powder that's kind of like
a highlight without being too shimmery
so I'm just going to apply that a little
bit all over and finally I'm applying
that pretty pink shimmery gloss from the
color east of hell
all over my lips so thanks a lot for
watching this video I hope you enjoyed
the way it all came together again those
lashes that kind of flare out at the
ends can give you the look of winged
liner without really doing any fancy
work with your eyeline again for
watching I hope you have a great day and
I'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
