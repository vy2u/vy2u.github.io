joining me for this video man the work
week is almost over and I'm so ready I
mean I am really really tired I went and
actually did a story this morning for
our newscast I was out doing a live
report with some roller derby girls
there's like a big event coming up this
weekend and that's where like I mean
they it's it's a full-contact sport I
mean it is very physical and they
actually put the pads on me and have me
doing stuff I like sweat off all my
makeup and my hair's like I don't know
kind of a problem right now my eye
makeup is probably somewhere down in
here but it was so worth it and so fun
if you follow me on Twitter or Facebook
you've probably seen some pictures I've
posted and there's like a little link to
a video clip so you can check that out
if you get a chance but meanwhile I
wanted to go ahead and give you some
dupes basically drugstore lipsticks and
lip glosses that are basically the exact
same thing as some products that cost a
whole lot more so I think this is really
gonna save you some money
I have been like slaving poring over my
stash for quite some time now trying to
figure out you know what things are
close enough I tested them all it's not
all just based on the shade but also the
texture the thickness you know how
opaque is it is there sparkle in it is
there not I mean just I went through a
number of factors and I want to say
thank you to those who joined me on my
24/7 beauty broadcast chat room
yesterday I actually got this idea from
someone kind of asking you know give us
a video on dupes this one's just on
lipstick i'll probably do face and eye
products at some point as well but that
little chat i think i'm just gonna kind
of let you know on twitter and facebook
like when i'm in that chat room and you
can come ask me questions otherwise it
is open 24/7 for you to just you know
pop in and see if anybody's there
talking and get to know one another and
stuff like that so anyway now that I got
that business out of the way I'm going
to go through these dupes these dupes
include
brands like Mac Clinique Lancome and nah
right let's get started first one that
I'm going to talk about is this MAC
lipstick this is Viva Glam 5 okay super
popular lipstick you can see is just
kind of a neutral shade it's got a
little bit of a golden undertone and I'm
gonna swatch that here so you can see it
there is Viva Glam 5 and the dupe for
that in my opinion is the Rimmel
moisture renew lipstick in Sunset okay
I'm going to swatch that side-by-side
these are both a lot a lot alike and
they also look super similar in the
tubes as well so yeah Viva Glam 5 is one
of those MAC lipsticks that you hear
about a lot so if you're looking for a
good neutral color the moisture renew
lipstick from Rimmel in Sunset is a good
one
next is the one I'm wearing now I'm
actually wearing the less expensive dupe
but a recent MAC lipstick that I got
that I love so much is the amplified
it's that kind of you know you can get
like for example Viva Glam five is a
luster this is an amplified lipstick and
the shade is called craving and it's
this gorgeous intense kind of berry
color and I had told people about it and
I think some people were kind of
wondering well what's the what's the
alternative to that you can see it
there's so much color intensity to that
shade and I think I've found the shade
that is the dupe and I believe it's the
Maybelline lipstick and it is the it's a
certain line it's the moisture extreme
lipstick sorry and the shade is rose
berry and when I swatch it right beside
it you're gonna be able to see just how
similar those two shades are it's pretty
amazing they're both really pigmented
berry colors and yeah this is the
Maybelline and this is the Mac
next one is max lipstick and angel
another popular pink shade here this is
a frost and I'm gonna make a swatch of
this for you there is angel just a very
very light pink another really popular
color I know it have been noted quite a
bit that Kim Kardashian that's a
favorite shade of hers but my dupe for
that is Maybelline this is the color
sensational lipstick in born with it
it's a pretty close dupe this isn't
maybe one of my closest ones but those
two are really pretty similar you can
see there that born with it maybe it's
just a slight bit warmer but really they
are super similar lipsticks and just for
a light creamy pink I think that's a
pretty good option
all the rest I have I guess now are lip
glosses first one is the mac lipglass
and nymphet and this one I think is
gonna kind of shock you because this is
a really complex shade like you look at
it and it's like okay I see gold in
there I see pink I see hints of maybe
even a lavender undertone to it and to
swatch that one for you it comes off
actually very gold in my swatch here
there's that swatch right there very
gold almost nude and you just don't
really know what to expect by looking at
it in the tube but look at this dupe
that I have for it it's the Milani in
summer baby it's the Crystal gloss and
it has that same kind of like pinkish
tone but a lot of gold and the undertone
so as i swatched that it looks even more
alike in the swatch than in the
packaging but look at those two together
they both have that same kind of you
know like in certain lights they might
look more pink but overall they look
very golden it's just so interesting
that these shades they both have their
own kind of look in the package but
really when you put them on it's like
wow those are actually the same color I
went through a lot of trial and error
before I figured that one hell
next one and a high-end product is the
Clinique long last gloss we're in fire
berry really like this shade this is
interesting because it's a berry shade
but it has a gold undertone to it again
so that kind of I think the gold in
these kind of warms the colors up that's
why you're seeing a lot of that but it
can be hard to find a good match for
that that doesn't have like silver
Sparkle or you know some other kind of
shimmer to it so make a swatch of that
here and this has a little bit of it's
it's somewhat of a sheer gloss even
though it is deeper than some others so
that's the Clinique and then I believe
the dupe for this is the elf moisture
care lip color in Ruby slipper so you
see the those two together
you can see that rivey slipper is also
kind of a berry shade but it does have
especially if you look really close at
it has teeny teeny golden tone shimmers
there so to do a swatch of that beside
it and it's one of those click up one so
it's coming out the top and there is the
swatch of those two very similar and
when you get up really close you can
tell that they both have that and cold
shade underneath
next one I'm going to talk about is
lipgloss from Lancome that I loved I got
this in a set around Christmas time and
I went ahead and I bought the full-size
this happens to be the small size but it
is the color fever lip gloss in heat
stroke and I just really fell in love
with this shade I think it's very
interesting very unique it has kind of a
metallic quality to it neutral but a
little deeper than you know a typical
nude and you can just kind of see it
catch the light and it's very
multi-dimensional it has sort of some
silvery tone sparkle to it now the dupe
for that is one of my all-time favorite
lip glosses that I think is universally
flattering on everyone and it is from
Jordana it's the pretty shine lip gloss
in lovely so you're looking at that here
and when you see the swatch you're gonna
be pretty impressed it's this one is
just a little warmer
so here gosh I've got a look at it again
to tell the difference okay lovely is on
the end and heat stroke is right beside
it you can see when they catch the light
all those metallic qualities really come
out they both have Sparkle
they're both also in texture very very
similar I mean they both are really rich
nice lip glosses
next one I'm going to talk about is from
NARS it is the lip gloss in Greek
holiday on all the NART the NARS
packaging kind of doesn't let you see
super clearly what that shade on the
inside looks like so you really do have
to swatch it and so I've got a swatch of
that here you're looking at a very pale
gold got basically it's got some gold
shimmer it's got some shimmers that are
just so fine I mean you notice that in a
lot of the high-end products it's not
chunky glitter but the one I'm going to
compare that to is from L'Oreal it's the
color juice in caramel cream so will
swatch some of that side-by-side and
there they are there's Greek holiday
there's caramel cream they both are kind
of just this golden a nude shear type
lip color so don't you don't have to
spend the full price to get that look
you can get it elsewhere
next one is the NARS lip gloss in orgasm
this one looks very pink right here in
the packaging but really when I take it
out and do a swatch of it you're gonna
notice a lot of gold in that it's right
here so you've got pink and then it
catches the light and instantly it looks
really gold the shade that I'm going to
say is the dupe for that is the elf
plumping lip glaze in Oasis and there
you can see the pink look but I'm gonna
swatch it this by the way has two ends
so one end is kind of like your plumper
and then the other end is your color but
just the colored side is what I'm
talking about here we're going to put
that on beside it and the two are a lot
alike when they catch the light they
both have this golden e pink look that
is really unique and so I was surprised
that I found something that I thought
was a dupe for that I've been really
picky about these and really you know
kind of putting them side by side over
and over again
my last one is something that I
identified as a dupe awhile ago I think
in a blog and now one of these products
is discontinued I was running into this
problem so much like I would
double-check the shade online and then
it would be like I couldn't find the
shade for sale anymore and so I don't
want to go recommending a bunch of stuff
that's discontinued but I just this was
such a solid dupe that I had to tell you
and if you can come up with this shade
that's great or you can share your you
know your favorite dupes down below for
everything that'd be awesome
NARS Turkish Delight is the shade and
the dupe is Neutrogena lip gloss
Moisture shine lip gloss in groove you
these are so close and there's Turkish
Delight right there very light very pale
pink it's creamy it's got no sparkle and
neither does groove put that beside it
the two shades are one the same they are
so similar and so thank you guys a lot
for sitting through this video with me I
took a lot of checking and rechecking to
kind of see what products really matched
up but there are some options out there
if you don't want to pay the full price
so what would be really helpful I think
to everyone who views this videos if
down below if you've noticed some
high-end and low-end low-end
alternatives to a high-end product put
them down below and we can all share
each other's comments so thanks a lot
for watching guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
