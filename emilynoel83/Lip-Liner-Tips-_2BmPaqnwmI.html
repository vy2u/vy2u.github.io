this video this is gonna be all about
lip liner I was actually just browsing
my Beauty broadcast facebook page which
is a really really cool way for you to
get tips from me and other viewers it's
really kind of like a family on there so
if you joy if you get on there and you
start asking questions it seems like at
least like one or two people will
probably have an answer for you and I
will too and it's just really fun to
kind of share ideas and get other
suggestions on products and stuff like
that so it's really cool but anyway
somebody was bringing up lip liner on
there and they were saying that you know
do you necessarily have to have a lip
liner for every lip look that you do or
do you need to have different lip liners
to suit like every color family that you
would wear on your lips and my answer to
that is no I don't always wear lip liner
especially if it's a light or neutral
look I don't always wear it however for
the news I often do wear it because I
feel like it gives me a much more
defined line around my lips and not
really that it's just a line around your
lips because I always fill in and I just
feel like it kind of just keeps you from
having that sort of muddied look between
your lip and the skin around it it looks
very clean and polished and that's kind
of the look that I go for when I do the
news everyday and speaking of clean and
polished don't look too closely at this
hi I was out it was really cold today I
was doing a story it was outside
freezing cold kind of windy and very
bright and sunny so I was like I don't
know why I just started watering over
here but anyway on my lips are pretty
much bare actually it's sort of like
this is the worn off lipstick from the
day I kind of liked this look actually
but I was gonna go ahead and just show
you a quick application of what I would
do if I was doing my lips kind of a full
you know lip tutorial here I guess
before I apply lip liner you always want
to put on some kind of balm
really anything will do just something
that's gonna kind of moisturize your
lips and allow it to glide on really
smooth you'll get a nice even
application
and if you like to fill in your lips
like I do with your liner and it's gonna
definitely help the purpose behind
filling them in for me is really just so
it all wears as one you know you could
line your lips just the outside put your
lipstick on and you know maybe it may
look fine at your first look at it but
as the day wears on you know they aren't
necessarily going to wear off at exactly
the same pace and you're very likely
going to be left with a line around your
lips so anyway I used my silk B lip balm
the Elan vital formula which is very
very moisturizing and I'm wearing red
today so I chose to do a red lip I'm
using my Rimmel exaggerate lip liner
it's my favorite red lip liner and
basically I'm just going to trace around
my lips here I'm just gonna I always
tend to start right around the Cupid's
bow area and just kind of define that
about like that just kind of like I do a
little V there and then I just kind of
come down from that and do sort of short
strokes just like so I'm not a fan of
lining outside my lip line I just go
with what I've what God has given me I
guess there are ways you can make your
lips look plumper and I think I've
addressed that in past videos but
basically now that I've got my line then
it's just a matter of filling in this
pencil is really creamy and I just kind
of fill in the line and it's to the
point where you know if you didn't want
a super shiny look or something you
could just go with the liner alone and
then on the bottom same sort of story
there I just kind of work in short
strokes work kind of from both sides and
then connect it at the bottom and then
just fill in and I really like using lip
liner when I'm you doing reds or plums
because I feel like the shade is darker
and it's more obvious if you've kind of
had a little mishap with your
application so a nice clean line really
helps and
then another tip for if you're doing a
lip like this is kind of red I'm gonna
use my mary kay lipstick and amber suede
it's not like really a true true bright
red it's actually a little bit deeper
I'm using a lip brush and just kind of
brushing it right off the product here
and then applying that to my lips right
over the liner and this gives it a
little bit of a creamy shine it also
deepens the color just a hair so you're
just getting you know a little bit more
Sheen with it just like that and so you
could go ahead and go over that with
some gloss if you want for me today I
mean I felt like the color was bold
enough that I really didn't even want to
go with a lot of high shine but you
could definitely you know put a lip
gloss over your look but that's how I
use lip liner I'm sure there are other
ways that people like to do it maybe you
like to put your lipstick on first and
then kind of you know outline them but
and sometimes I'll do that with a gloss
you know like I put on a gloss they'll
be like and I just want a little more
definition and then I'll just go over it
but that's just a basic way that I will
apply the product and I also wanted to
go over with you just some lip liners
that I really like
other than Rimmel exaggerate which I
just use that's my favorite red um
another great great brand of lip liners
if you haven't tried them out guys these
are so affordable and I think they work
really well
it's the Jordana easy liners and these
are available at my Walgreens and
they're usually like a 2 for $3 kind of
deal too or maybe even less than that
but the shades I like in that are plush
plum so if I'm doing sort of a plummy
lip look this is going to really provide
some nice definition I'm kind of doing a
few strokes here so you can see sort of
what shade that is this is really deep
but it just is so creamy it goes on just
wonderfully well and I don't get that
sort of feathering you know outside the
lip line either if I'm doing a pink lip
I really like the shade in baby berry
so that looks like this now I'll do a
little swatch here for you and kind of
show you how easy it goes on you know
it's just super creamy here so you can
see there's baby berry just a lighter
pink works great to kind of put that on
and then put your really light shimmery
pink gloss it has a very pretty look
that way and then for neutrals neutrals
who are kind of getting into where I
don't necessarily always wear a lip
liner I think throwing on a gloss is
fine you know you don't have to always
have the high-maintenance lip but a
really affordable option here from
Jordana again is a shade called tawny
and this is just a classic neutral shade
to see that alongside the other ones
here it's got a little bit of pink in it
but overall it's kind of like a light
brownish pink there if you see it below
the other two so another affordable
option there another one that I like if
you're into sort of the deeper neutrals
maybe you like to get into the brownish
Reds a great great liner is the wet and
wild lip liner number six six six I
believe it is in brick yeah in
Brandywine and this one has it seems
like a little bit of shimmer or sheen to
it just a hair more and it's a classic
pencil not one of those retractable ones
like I just showed and it's a slight bit
drier than the Jordana ones as I kind of
draw it on my hand there but it's a
really pretty shade it looks nice with
Reds right there it looks nice with
Browns any kind of deeper neutral shade
it looks really pretty it really
complements the look just to wear it
alone and put a clear gloss over it I've
done that many times and it looks very
nice so in giving you all in telling you
about all these liners I'm not saying go
get all of them but if you are trying to
minimize your collection a little bit
going with something like this is very
versatile and would work with almost any
color so keep that in mind also a total
you know no-brainer lip liner is the
Revlon Colorstay in clear I think I
reviewed this way
Oh Quinn and basically it looks like
this it looks white but it's gonna draw
on completely clear you're not gonna see
it at all and it still has the texture
you know of its other Revlon liners and
stuff but basically the idea here is
you're gonna put that on your lips and
it's gonna grab your lip color a little
bit better and it's gonna have the same
effect that a lot of these lip liners
have and that it keeps it from
feathering outside your lips someone
asked me I can't remember where they
asked it with ask what's feathering and
I think I consider that to be when the
lip color starts to go up in little
lines that you may have kind of around
little little little fine lines that you
may not even know you have until you
know you wear the wrong lipstick and
then you're like that's it's really
fading up there but this will kind of
help keep the whole look in place so if
you've never tried liner and you maybe
jump around between a lot of lipstick
colors this might be a good one to try
you could definitely you know use that
with any color and one lip liner that I
just recently bought I talked about in
my haul video but it's Mac world and
this would be a little bit lighter a
little more nude alternative maybe to
tawny let me do that right beside tawny
it's got a little less pink in it put it
that way but it's very very close that's
world and that's tawny so whirl has a
little more of maybe a yellowish an
undertone this has more of a pink tone
to it but I haven't used this a whole
lot but I had no issues with it kind of
going outside my lip line or anything
like that but it is a little more
expensive so if you are you know a
die-hard Mac fan you buy mostly Mac
products that might be a lip liner to
try for a Mac if you haven't had it yet
but all these other ones really good
options you know if any of those just
kind of if you wear a lot of pink and
you think you know baby berries for you
that would be great but keep in mind
some of those options I gave would work
for any lip color at all so I hope this
was somewhat educational for you on lip
liners again you can wear lip liners
alone you can top them with lipstick you
can top them with a gloss is a great way
to wear them because a lot of time
when you use a lip liner it doesn't feel
like quite as much as sitting on your
lips as say a thick creamy lipstick so
if you're kind of trying to minimize you
know what's going on on your lips you
can get kind of a matte look with a lip
liner top it with the gloss and you're
good to go so thanks again so much for
tuning in guys I really appreciate all
of the kind and supportive comments that
you give I mean it really really makes
my day
also I almost forgot I wanted to tell
you that on my blog there is a link if
you scroll down a little bit and look
over on the right-hand side there is a
link called video library I mentioned
this before but I just updated it
yesterday I spent a lot of time getting
it all up to date with my videos it's
all my videos that I've ever done and
this is number 360 I think this one so
that's kind of cool but anyway it's
every video I've done and it's all
categorized so like dramatic eye
tutorials natural eye tutorials reviews
on lips reviews on eyes face whatever
any series I've done those are in their
videos with Tyler vlogs shopping list
ideas it is all completely categorized
so I really really encourage you to look
there if you're wondering if you want to
ask a question or if you're wondering
has Emily done a video on this or that
check their first because chances are in
you know 360 videos yes something like
that has been done so thanks again so
much for tuning in and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
