me today I'm doing the lip product
addict tag and I think it's very
appropriate because I tend to feel like
out of all the different kinds of makeup
out there lip products are some of the
things that I'm really really attracted
to lip products and palates yeah I kind
of have a thing for palates as well but
many of you asked me to do this video I
also was tagged here in there
Marnie miss gold girl and Kristen gay so
thanks guys for tagging me and if you're
interested in doing this yourself and
you're a video maker or a blogger I say
go for it this was a lot of fun to look
through my stuff and kind of pick out
some top things for these different
categories so the first question is
favorite boom slash treatment and this
is a toughie because specifically I feel
I am a lip balm addict and one of the
things most recently that I've really
really been enjoying is the soft lips
cube this is a new thing I mentioned
this in my favorites video recently I've
got it in the French vanilla scent and
it does totally look like an EOS lip
balm but it's just in this cube and if
you like the texture of soft lips which
tends to be like really really smoothing
kind of cooling feeling on the lips as
well but also that light vanilla scent
so I really like it it's also got SPF 15
and it feels really good going on your
lips super smooth not a greasy feeling
lip balm it can make a nice primer for
lip products and I just feel like that
cooling sensation is so refreshing
especially this time of year so I've
totally been loving that and one other
thing that I'd like to also throw into
this category it's not necessarily like
a treatment or just a balm but it's
probably the colored lip product that I
have that I think does the most for my
lips in terms of hydration and keeping
them from getting really dry and check
it I've mentioned it a lot but
Neutrogena moisture smooth color sticks
are awesome that I'm holding up here is
called fresh papaya and I think that is
great
summertime shade but I would love to see
them branch out and come out with like
tons of shades of these because I just
think they're a wonderful texture so
hydrating and just the best jumbo lip
pencil out there the next question is
best eye catching red so I dug through
and I think I pulled out the one that I
enjoy the most when I really want pull
out red and it's the Milani color
statement lipstick in red label it's so
pretty it's such a great cream formula
so with this you're getting like a
little hint of shine but it's not like a
super greasy gonna slide outside your
lip line type of feel which is really
dangerous when it comes to red lipsticks
so I'm very comfortable ultra rich full
color may even want to like take a
little lip brush and use that to apply
it for some more precision but I think
it's just a classic classic red you know
not too much on the orangie side or on
the blue tone side either I think it's
pretty neutral so I like that long long
what she says best luxury and best
drugstore and I wasn't sure if this was
referencing just like the best line
overall or specifics from each of those
I think for best luxury or just high-end
lipstick I've got to go with bite I mean
they have totally won me over in about
the past year I have so enjoyed the
textures of their lipsticks the full
color that they have how comfortable and
good they feel on your lips even with
really prolonged when I am wearing a
couple of bite lipsticks today actually
I got these double ended once and I just
love them this was such a great kit to
get around I think it was around the
holidays that I got it
and I am wearing Rose which is a nice
classic pink but then I combined that
with red Cena which is kind of a like
softer pinky nude type color so the
combination of these two gives me a
little more muted pink since I got this
like blue stuff going on in my eyes
today but just so many great colors that
I've fallen in love with from this line
from the bright pinks deep berries news
got some awesome products even more
things that have come out recently that
I want to try I want to get some of
their glosses I think they've got like a
BB for lips or something sounds so
amazing if I'm gonna make a lip product
splurge that's the kind of thing I want
to get and then best drugstore I really
think the Milani color statement
lipsticks and there are a couple of
reasons why I feel that way first off
they don't just put out a line of
lipsticks and they've all got some like
cookie cutter finish to them you've got
some mattes
some creams some shimmers furthermore an
amazing color selection just so much I
mean it in reds alone there's like four
or five different options you could
choose from a lot of great nudes pinks
berries orange I just don't feel like
any part of the color spectrum was
ignored when that line was created I do
have blog posts with like every single
Milani color statement lipstick on my
lips that I'll link to if you want to
learn more but the cream formula is
probably my favorite for finish and feel
but um some of the shimmers might feel a
little more drying I love to prep my
lips with a lip balm under these but one
that I just thought I'd give a shout-out
to as i mentioning it is the shade
called pretty natural this was one of
the newer releases and i think it's just
a perfect pink for any occasion any
person not too light not too dark just a
really really pretty color best MAC
lipstick this was kind of tricky for me
because I know I've mentioned over time
like different ones here and there that
I've liked but I don't know that I've
ever really named a you know a soul
favorite matte lipstick but I did kind
of narrow it down to something that I
thought was the most versatile and can
give you I think a nice little spectrum
of look it's especially a really great
fall in winter shade have you guessed
what one it is I'm talking about yet I'm
talking about rebel and this shade looks
so dark in the two can look very dark on
your lips but you can also wear it you
know a little more sheer you could apply
this over a balm with a lip brush and
get like a totally
kind of medium very tight look so I
really like the versatility of it and it
kind of surprised me that it wasn't
until like this past fall that I
actually picked this one up and I know
it's got a cult following but I'm really
glad I finally gave it and got it too
for the most dissapointing I was just
gonna name something I recently tried
and didn't like but no most disappoint
probably means like the worst lipstick
you've ever used or lip product and it's
got to be that awful too or Tanna one
that I mentioned in probably the last
fails video that I did is so dry but so
sticky I'm gonna hold it at a distance
because I don't want to catch a whiff of
that anymore and since we're moving
portions of my makeup I've been packing
up here in there so I don't even have
that here right now to show it to you
personally I can only hope that maybe
since I've tried that one some things
have changed with the line or maybe
there are some improvements that it's
not quite as bad as it was then because
that just it's one of those unbelievable
like how do they put this on the shelves
type of item the next question is liner
yes or no um overall I guess I would say
yes although I don't wear it like every
single day but I do think it can be like
exactly what the doctor ordered for
certain lip colors particularly when I'm
doing a bright lip or a really nude lip
like I love to have a nice crisp line
when I'm wearing a red or really deep
berry or maybe a very hot pink shade
also when I'm wearing nude lipsticks I
think it's good to have a good nude lip
liner that can kind of give you a really
finished border without looking like way
darker than your lip color you're
putting on and so a great one for that
is the NYX retractable lip liner in nude
I love this this is so great
what was the gloss that I've been
pairing this with the NYX butter gloss
and creme brulee is gorgeous over the
top of this a lot of these retractable
lip liners from NYX and they are really
long wearing so if you put them on
definitely fill in your whole lips with
them and it'll give you like that extra
layer of staying power under any gloss
or any lipstick you put on top number
seven is best gloss I've got a lot of
glosses that I like one that I've been
trying to get back into using more it's
like I ever didn't like it or stopped
liking it but I just feel like I've been
reaching for them a little bit more
lately are my buxom lip glosses and
they're kind of like lip plumpers and
losses in one they've got really nice
staying power I've got a ton of these
shorter sizes because I always try to
find those kits when they're available
and one specific formula of these I
think is great are the creams berry
blast is so pretty
creams are a more opaque look on your
lips not saying the other ones can't be
colorful some of them are but these just
give that shine but also like a more
densely colored formula so I really
really like these they do give your lips
you know that little bit of a tingle
kind of a minty type of feel but I like
that and then the last part says
something extra I guess something else
that I would recommend the thing that I
want to mention is a total combination
of lipstick and lip gloss like the
finish on your lips has color intensity
that makes me think lipstick but
beautiful shine and it's the Sonia
Kashuk shine luxe sheers I so so love
these products I own most of them I'll
link to the blog where I tried them all
on a really really great kind of peachy
nude is the one in sheer pink lust this
is probably my most used one it's like
when I'm wanting that nude color with a
little shine this just instantly pops
into my head I'm always reaching for it
but they just feel so like luxurious on
your lips but if you haven't checked out
these products and you're kind of
wanting to try something different you
know from the average lipstick you might
like these so that concludes the lip
addict tag I had fun with this and I
hope you did too
thank you so much for taking time to
watch my videos I really really
appreciate it and I'll talk to you guys
next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
