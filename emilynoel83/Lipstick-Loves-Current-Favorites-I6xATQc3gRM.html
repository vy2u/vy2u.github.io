realizing the other day how many
lipsticks I've been using lately and
really really getting attached to and
loving the different shades but what
ultimately made me want to do a video on
it is that the colors are so varied
normally I feel like I'll kind of get
into a rhythm with using like maybe
light Pink's or berry colors or you know
just kind of latching on to one type of
shade but I was realizing the other day
just how diverse some of these colors
are and I thought it might be fun to
share just some of the things I'm really
liking lately not only do I like these
colors but I really like the formulas as
well the first one this one I've had for
maybe two and a half weeks now and I've
been absolutely loving it and it's one
of the new Estee Lauder pure color Envy
I think these are called sculpting
lipsticks the packaging is just fabulous
and it's got that kind of magnetic snap
there but the shade I got was impulsive
and when I was looking at the shade
range they had a lot of pretty shades at
the counter but this one seems like the
kind of shade I would wear a lot and
since it's a little pricier of a
lipstick I wanted to make sure it was
one of those kinds of shades it's so
creamy and rich on the look you like the
moisture on my lips can hang around for
a good long while like an entire morning
up until I eat lunch I feel like wow you
know my lips feel really good and the
color hangs around a really long time
too which I always feel like with the
lighter shades they fade off a little
faster you know they're just not maybe
as a parent on the lips as a deeper
color I've been involved in a big event
or a party or something like I normally
go for something a little bit darker or
brighter because I feel like those are
the ones that hang around longer now I
feel like I have a really good option
for staying power for something that's
lighter as well and I think it's working
great with the smoky eye I just love
something from Milani that's kind of
close to that but a little bit of a
deeper pink and this is one of the newer
shades that was released from the color
statement line and the shade is pretty
natural I love this very classic pink
color I think I put on Instagram I think
this is in every woman's pink fair skin
or deeper skin I mean I just feel like
this is such a universal pinky color
that looks very youthful it just looks
really pretty I think for springtime you
know if you're trying to get out of the
deeper shades and get something a little
lighter this is a great one and I really
like the cream formulas especially of
these Milani color statement lipsticks
really nice nude that I've had in my
collection for a while but I've more
recently kind of rediscovered it is from
the Revlon Super Lustrous line and the
shade is just enough buff love this kind
of peachy nude color I will wear this
alone but I also think it looks really
pretty with a gloss thrown on top of the
cream formula no shimmer nothing I've
talked about so far has had any shimmer
in any that's my thing with all these
lipsticks I guess just one of them that
I'm talking about today might have a
little shimmer but they're all really
nice and creamy but I just just love
that and over any of the ones I've
just mentioned a nice little gloss
option that looks really nice on all of
them is the NYX butter gloss in creme
brulee this also is just great on top of
Nyx's retractable lip liner in nude love
love love that combo but any of these
you know whether it's a little pinky or
more nude I think this works really
nicely as sort of a glossy top coat if
that's the kind of finish you like a
great pink I love rediscovering stuff in
my collection that's kind of been there
for a while but I haven't been reaching
for as much until recently this is the
matte cream machine lipstick and hot
gossip
I love the cream machine formula it's
really a great great formula for
lipstick they feel very comfortable
going on the shades there's just so many
shades in that particular division of
matte lipstick that I really like to
speed dial is another one it's a little
bit lighter pink than this I think of
this is like a slightly deeper cool pink
but super wearable a little less neutral
then say the Milani shade and pretty
natural you know it's close but I feel
like this one that I'm talking about for
Mac is just like a little more pinky
pink speaking of pinky pink
what a great description my bite
lipstick at first I was just completely
smitten by this end of it in Palomino I
mean I love that shade I think it's
awesome but slowly I've been drifting
over to the other end and this is a
shade called Rose so fresh I mean these
bite lipsticks require nothing else the
colors are so pure and so bright and
bold it's like don't mess with them
don't put anything on top of them
because it's they just look so nice as
if this Rose shade just gets me it's a
really really fresh color that's just
the first word that comes to mind when I
think of it now as I said there's quite
a bit of variety going on with these
things that I've been loving lately and
I'm having abandoned my plums and one
that I have been going for is this NYC
I've been kind of infatuated with NYC
lately a line I think I've had kind of
bad opinions about for a while but I'm
sort of diving in and retrying some
stuff but this is the a policies' lip
balm and apple plump eyes this is not a
super hydrating lipstick this is not the
longest wearing but it is really pretty
on the lips so that's why I'm giving it
a shoutout
I've enjoyed this for kind of like a
quick application of something deeper
you know a lot of deep lipsticks are
kind of high maintenance you know
they're really full color really dark
and this one I think something about the
ball mesh texture of it makes it a
little bit easier for just that quick
application but if you want something
that's a little bit on the plumy side
it's really nice it smells great to
Mel's to be kind of like a fruit roll-up
or some kind of candy oh my gosh I hope
you guys can find this read I really do
this is from Revlon the Super Lustrous
line but they released some of those
vintage lipsticks again you may have
seen the display in Ulta that's where I
found these is like a little special
display end of the aisle and they had a
small selection maybe five different
re-release lipsticks that were created
by Revlon back in the day and now they
brought them back and this is Fifth
Avenue red and I think this is a really
great red but it's unique because the
first thing I think of when I look at it
is that's not a super bright red you
know that
really really wearable almost like deep
rosy red not a bright cherry red but
it's just so wearable and I love the
creamy texture the cream formula of the
Super Lustrous lipsticks is just the
bomb so I love that and then something
that's just been floating around in my
purse non-stop and if I'm wearing any of
these early and they wear off like I
grabbed this thing real quick and this
is my Maybelline Baby Lips it's the
cherry me shade I've been using that a
lot this is a pretty kind of like
reddish pink is how this comes off on my
lips just like what the NYC thing it's
kind of like a brighter color but a
low-maintenance way to apply it a more
sheer look to a red on your lips so this
is definitely something I steer people
toward when they're like you know I want
to try something a little brighter but I
don't want to commit to a really
full-bodied lipstick this is a nice one
I hope you guys found that interesting
just some of the lip products I've been
reaching for a lot lately and just a
real varied shade range so I thought it
might be fun to share so thank you for
watching guys I'll talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
