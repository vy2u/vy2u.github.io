review on some liquid eyeliners I know
it's something that a lot of people
eventually decide you know you may start
out using a pencil liner and then you're
like well I want to try using a liquid
you know I want to do something that is
gonna give my eyes a really strong bold
look and I've tried quite a few of them
I want what you know what I think is
worth buying and what maybe not so much
so the first two are more of a pen type
like a felt tip pen sort of version one
is from Physicians Formula and the other
is from covergirl so starting with the
Physicians Formula I really like this a
lot when I bought it this is the what
you're gonna get as far as the tip it's
like a felt tip marker sort of very very
easy to use and the color is very very
black what you get there however after
not very long it really the tip part
gets dry you can you can like see that
when you use the marker side like the
end it puts out color but the tip
probably puts out anything so that's a
problem when these these tips of these
felt tip things dry out so it's gonna be
good and you're gonna love it for like
oh you know a couple of weeks and then
it's gonna go dry on you and it's gonna
be really disappointing because you
never see that coming so that's my one
complaint with this and it's a pretty
big complaint so I won't be buying that
one again that's Physicians Formula I
define our felt tip I marker
the other one is covergirl line exact
and it's kind of this cute little short
squatty tube and it's got a tip that's
almost identical to the Physicians
Formula one and once again after about
three weeks of using it the tip got dry
the side would put out color like the
sides of the marker but not the tip and
I mean you can't just go triangle line
in eyes and be really precise with it
when you have to you know flatten it out
like blot it on your eyelid it just does
not work for me so once again very easy
to use products right off the bat but I
I just don't know what the deal is but
they dry up I don't know if it's because
if you put it over I shadow and it picks
up some of that and the shadow the
powders and shadow dry it up but
whatever the case may be I mean I'm not
gonna stop using eye shadow just to use
one of these pins so you know it may be
a matter of you could shake it still you
know barely comes out so I'm just really
not that impressed with that kind yeah
Reles you at first you start loving it
and then it doesn't work alright next
variety is the kind that comes in like a
little thing like this where it's like
got a little oil well you see what it
looks like there little ink well and
then the little tip which is just a it's
not a brush tip but it is a what do I
want to say it's almost like a felt tip
but it's just not the the product isn't
coming out through it it's dipping into
it
first one is Mary Kay liquid eyeliner
and this is actually really really good
it is very black it stays put the entire
day it does not flake off or lose
intensity throughout the day I've had no
problems with this it's lasted me a long
time you don't have that issue with a
tip drying out because the product can't
get through it because gotten all dry or
something so that's it's pretty good I
mean I like it quite a bit but as for
that's a very similar product that just
goes one step further is Revlon
Colorstay this is my favorite eyeliner
for liquid because look at this it's got
the same sort of applicators what I just
showed you but the color is so black
like it is you know the blackest black
eyeliner and I love color state products
you've probably heard me talk about
different ones
I really like this is no exception it
stays put wonderfully well the only
thing that you know maybe takes it above
the Marion came one is that it is just
so rich in color there is no
transparency to it whatsoever and I
really like that
okay moving on to another category I
will say this is the liquid eyeliner
with the little brush tip and this I got
from Sally Beauty Supply it's like their
mini you know I have a Sally girl
products and they're like miniature and
this is a actually a brush at the end of
that and two reasons why I despise this
if I really don't have sensitive eyes at
all and when I put this on one eye like
I instantly felt like I almost burned
like right near my lashline I was like
okay that's not good and second of all
it's like if any of you ever painted
with watercolor Pink's you know what
that's like like it's like the color
just appears watered down that's great
for painting but for this it's like you
don't want your black eyeliner you get
black liquid liner for a reason okay you
get it because you want to be a nice you
know defined black line and here it just
seems watered-down number one and number
two it's it irritated my eyes so I can't
deal with that and so anyways I'll stop
ranting about that the last thing I
wanted to tell you about was a couple of
cool colored liquid liners that I have
just recently picked up they're from wet
and wild and their mega liners and one
is sort of a turquoise shade and the
other is purple and the turquoise shade
is really really pretty metallic and I
haven't tried the purple one yet I've
just kind of like brushed it off on my
hand and these are probably right around
$2 and they're really fun and they
really really do stay put
they're not there h2o proof liners I
haven't tried those yet I've heard good
things about them I just haven't tried
them yet but these are really really
good I love the color they put out it's
metallic it stands out like I said I've
used this teal turquoise one
go and I don't know how will you be
they'll see I've been drawing all over
my hand with the other ones but it's a
really pretty bold color and it looks so
pretty you know I've seen a tutorial
someone did using this color and I just
loved it so I picked it up and tried it
and it's great so if you want to
experiment a little bit and get away
from the basic black try one of those
wet and wild ones because you're not
gonna spend a ton of money to do it like
I said they have got blue and gray and
like bronze different colors like that
so so those are good like those love
Revlon Colorstay that's my pick overall
the Mary Kay liquid also is pretty darn
good then we start going downhill the
sallygirl is definite no oh it might not
it ate your eyes yeah but it irritated
mine and I might aren't even very
sensitive plus it's just watery it's
just watered down that's all I can say
these pins gosh I love these pins I
really like how they apply at first I
hate how they dry out though and you
don't have any warning like I said it's
not like you can see that you're running
out of the product and I have a feeling
I wasn't right it wasn't because I was
running out that they weren't coming out
right I think it was just that it was
getting dried up at the tip tip was
getting dry because like I said the
product was coming out of the side just
not the tip so be aware of those if
there's any good ones out there like
this
let me know if you know about them but
hopefully this gives you a little better
idea if you're going out to buy you know
liquid liner and don't spend too much
money maybe there's a few there that
might interest you and hope everybody
enjoyed this and all see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
