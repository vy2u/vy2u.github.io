me I want to let you know right off the
bat a little reminder I do have a
meet-up happening tomorrow Tuesday the
21st at an Ulta in Chicago it's the one
at the Shops at Roosevelt Collection I
will have all the specifics below in the
info box but I really hope you can make
it if you're in the area I would love
love love to meet you
and I want to tell you a little bit
about what's been happening for me this
past week I have been judging the Miss
Illinois and Miss Ellen Oy Outstanding
Teen Scholarship pageants and it has
just been a whirlwind week I mean you
don't just show up on the night of
finals and start judging these girls
like it is a week-long process you are
in interviews with these girls you are
you know watching them in preliminary
rounds and it is just such an inspiring
really week this is a Scholarship
Pageant and you've got girls who so many
who are the total package you know
they're coming in they're able to carry
off a 10-minute interview about current
events they've got an interesting
backstory interesting experiences tons
of time spent doing community service
projects and then they come out looking
like a million bucks in their outfits
and their talent and all the different
things that they can do and I've never
actually competed in a pageant myself
but I've always kind of thought you know
there's got to be more than meets the
eye happening here and it is just a
really intense week I'm really pleased
with the way everything panned out now
that I can really say much specific
feedback about individuals but not to
brag on my state but Illinois has some
strong strong girls anyway my role is a
judge with this pageant did involve some
very long days we would usually start
off with some sort of a morning meeting
or you know one day there were just
interview straight through the day but
things would start early I would be
doing my makeup around 6 7 a.m. and then
even if there might be a little midday
gap where I could come home and just
hang out every night there was some form
of competition whether it be the teens
the Miss contestants prelims and then
the finals so those would go on pretty
late and then often we would have a
meeting that followed and I would be
getting home or
around midnight let's say on average so
staying power of makeup was everything
and I was really paying attention to it
so closely so I could kind of report
back to you guys about how this went now
it's not like I was putting this stuff
through the most ruling like temperature
conditions you know often times I was in
an air-conditioned space but I was in
and out of hot cars a lot and I do have
a tendency of sweating very quickly and
I've got kind of a combo skin type this
time of year more oily in the t-zone a
little bit normal everywhere else but
bottom line I was not spending time
touching up and that's a long day that's
a long day for makeup to look fresh from
6:00 or 7:00 a.m. to midnight and I
wasn't using the exact same products
every single day of the week I was kind
of trying some things out testing
certain products against one another but
I've definitely just had a great
refresher on the products that really
can wear well throughout a long day it's
a big mix of high end and drugstore I'm
going to take you through all the
products like to go through a full face
in this video and I will be cutting to
some demos and just explaining the
reasons why yeah after this full week of
interviews I'm like tell me the why tell
me the reasons give me concrete examples
so I will be talking about all that but
I must say I have never received so many
like face-to-face compliments about the
quality of my skin in my eyelashes in my
life maybe it's just because my fellow
judges are really nice people or maybe
it's just because they're of a mind to
you know consider things like that a
little bit more so well that made me
feel really good it's not that I have
great skin it's that I'm you know using
some products that can work with the
skin that I have and I think help it
look its best so without further ado
let's jump in I'm going to talk about a
primer that I've been using really
consistently all week and it's the elf
poreless face primer sometimes when I
dispense this from the bottle it comes
out a little uneven sometimes not the
texture but like maybe there will be an
air bubble in there or something but
overall it's been pretty good it's very
silky it doesn't take a lot of products
so considering that you've probably
already put on a moisturizer and then
foundations coming next I don't always
like to feel like I've had to pile on a
bunch of primer isn't
additional step so it just takes a bit
really slides across the skin nicely and
I think evens out the surface of my skin
then foundation this is a biggie a
couple other foundations I used
throughout the week you know there was a
definite breakdown in the t-zone where I
was getting maybe sweaty or more oily
and this Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation plus concealer just it rocked
my world this week I think it really has
nice coverage it does have a little more
thickness than some other foundations
sometimes it's those foundations that
don't stay looking so fresh after hours
and hours of wear and this one I felt
like I looked in the mirror you know at
the end of the night and thought yeah
everything's still hanging in there it's
not looking patchy and another thing
about the week you know when I'm judging
I'm not really thinking about my face
and there were so many times and I don't
normally do this where I have my hands
on my face and that's kind of a makeup
staying power no no because it's a great
way to lift product off of your skin and
start a patchy wearing down process so
I'd be like looking at my notes and I'd
realized oh my gosh about my hand
resting there here here you know
whatever and it really was unaffected by
it so application wise you've got this
big ole doe foot or as I like to say
when they're really big it's a buck foot
applicator and I'm wearing it in the
shade buttermilk so I kind of dab it all
over and then I do go back for just a
little bit more dab a little extra
wherever I feel like product is missing
and then I do like patting this product
in with a Beauty Blender and this is an
elf Beauty Blender that I'm trying out
as you see in the demo and it works
really nicely I got a little trio of elf
sponges and I'm digging them but get
that all blended in it's a matte finish
it's full coverage and I just love the
finished look I love how it plays into
the whole makeup look next key thing
that I needed to do and I needed to do
it more and more as the week went on
because I got less and less sleep and
was more tired I'm correcting the
under-eye circles and so I was reaching
for my it cosmetics bye bye under eye
corrector a lot in medium because it's a
little bit darker than my benefit erased
paste and as I've got teeny bit more of
a tan and even darker circles like I
said
you kind of want to adjust your
corrector accordingly and this did a
really good job it's not quite as juicy
you know creamy as the benefit erased
pace but it still got enough moisture in
there to where I don't feel like it
dries out my under-eye throughout the
day and I can even set it with some
powder and I don't look like a crepey
mess so I Pat that on the under-eye and
you can use a Beauty Blender you can use
a brush bin I've been setting that area
lightly with a little bit of this Milani
multitasker powder in light/medium
light/medium is key for me because it is
a little bit lighter than my skin tone
so it gives that added brightness to the
area that's been neutralized and
corrected with you know the under eye
corrector so I've been using this elf
brush getting some product on there
tapping off the excess and then just
dabbing it on the under eye area it's
very mattifying it's very perfecting
then I've discovered a new powder and
I'm kind of scared of how much I like
this because it is pricey but it feels
like an absolute dream and it does look
very unperfect anon the skin while at
the same time not looking like a dry
cakey powder so this process I refer to
this as Chanel because it's a should
help outer and an elf brush this is the
elf complexion brush I use this a lot
with a lot of different things but it's
the let's see double perfection Lumiere
powder in beige rose 32 and I just kind
of DAB that all over my skin sometimes
with powders I will just focus on my
t-zone
but I've been kind of paranoid about
staying power all week so I really just
went all over the face with this and I
was really happy with the way that look
came off and sometimes once my makeup is
done I will do a little read AB you know
kind of on this area on the sides of the
nose and I think it just looks extra
fresh I have a little bit of a contour
even if it's a soft contour I think it
really you know finishes the look and a
great duo product that I just every
single day this week I've used it it's
the Charlotte Tilbury film star Bronson
glow so this step this does not look
very dark okay but it builds and I
think is the perfect subtle you know
cheek contour right there so I've been
using that with a little Sigma contour
brush and really really pleased with the
effect you know it's easy it's quick it
makes an impact without looking like too
much but a big big key to the whole skin
thing the whole like yeah you've got
great coverage on your skin but the
thing that gives the illusion of actual
great skin I think is the highlight in
this compact so we're going to come back
to that in a second because I just want
to stay in sequence here because I do do
my blush next they're reaching for my
down boy blush from the balm a lot
lately
total rediscovered blush it's a cool
pink it's got that nice little
brightness to it that I think is very
youthful very lively very energized and
I've just loved that right on the apples
of the cheeks now back to the Tilbury
product and this highlight in here which
is just fabulous I mean I can't Pat this
product on the back enough because it
really is the difference between a
makeup you know that it's perfecting
your skin and then giving people the
illusion that you actually do have
really nice skin because this does not
look like glossy glowy highlight on the
skin it's just the look of natural
radiance and I use my up-and-up
highlight brush I take it right on top
of the cheeks like even just on top of
the apple of the cheek as well not just
the cheekbone and something about that
it's like it just gives enough glow to
the skin but you're still able to take
advantage of all that nice coverage all
of the modification that's happened
there but you put this on top and it's
like okay that's a person's skin I
didn't use this a lot with my look today
but I just wanted to mention it my lorac
take me to tan t go bronzer palette it's
got two matte bronzers and - glowy
bronzers they're all like different
tones each one kind of offers something
unique but this was something where I
was wearing dresses that had a little
bit more of the neck and chest area or
the arms exposed I would use this a lot
kind of as a body bronzer and maybe a
light dusting across the face so that
was definitely a part of the routine at
times
another thing that is a huge difference
maker in terms of taking all this full
coverage makeup and making it look more
skin like is the setting mist but
applied in the proper way I think it's
very important because one day I kind of
screwed myself had mac fix+
I sprayed it way too close to the skin
and just shortly after applying it I
could see like the droplet evidence of
that product on my skin like I could see
the little places because I just I
sprayed it up to close it was just too
much so this is the hard candy sheer
envy hydrating primer mist and I use
this after all of my face makeup steps
are done and I spray it up several myths
like maybe three or four and I let it
kind of fall down onto the skin so you
just get the finest application and it
should just be called like good skin
spray because that's what it makes you
look like and if you've got powders on
and you use those powders for a reason
because you wanted to set stuff and you
wanted your skin to look matte in
certain places this is what you put on
on top and it's just like yeah it's all
my skin moving on to the eyes
I definitely bounced around with
different eye shadow looks throughout
the week so I can't really point to one
palette and say you know it was this
thing that had great staying power but
the constant has been my Milani
eyeshadow primer it's a great primer all
over the lids just dab it out evenly and
don't overuse it and I think you will
see you know why this is such a great
product so I can put basically anything
I want on top of it for today's look I
use my modern renaissance palette from
Anastasia and I did use that a few times
during the week and one just really easy
look that is very quick to pull off and
I think looks finished is the buon
fresco shade which is kind of a dusty
lilac using that on the lid into the
crease using this tempura shade which is
a great highlight
I love Vermeer as something that can
kind of brighten up your inner corner
and sort of wake up the eyes from that
angle and then antique bronze for a
little bit of contrast but nothing
that's too terribly deep and dark so I
love that in the crease outer corner I
would also smudge that onto the lower
lash line sort of as a last step to the
eyelid
so this is one palette that you know I
was just smitten with it when I got it
and I've been enjoying it so much with
continued use I would say a more
important staying power product on the
eyes for me has been the black liquid
liner that I use and I've been going for
my Jordana color Envy liquid liner in
black envy this is a full color black
liquid liner that dries matte so I love
that there's no shine from this product
when you put it on you look like you
have a nice black even line it doesn't
smear off it doesn't flake off it is a
waterproof product and it just creates a
great wing it's a very classic liner in
the sense that it is a fine brush tip
applicator and I'm very comfortable with
that personally so I've used this all
week if you got watery eyes if something
makes you cry you know it still doesn't
go anywhere so it's able to withstand
the common day-to-day wear and look just
as fresh at the tail end of the day as
it did in the morning if you find this
in a store snatch it up I personally
can't find them very often in a store so
I will buy them like three at a time
from Jordana cosmetics calm and this is
probably my fourth or fifth one on my
lower inner rim I've kind of been
enjoying a little bit more smoky lower
lash line look so I have used something
darker on my lower lash line and this is
the Milani supreme Kohl Kajal liner in
blackest black it just comes in the one
shade and you know people will have
definitely different experiences with
certain things in the waterline because
everyone's different in terms of the
amount of moisture that naturally
collects there you know so this has
worked well for me it's definitely one
that I can count on and I will put it on
the lower inner rim and kind of smudge
it just below as well and then that's
when I'll bring in like the antique
bronze shadow for example and kind of
smudge that as well to get a little bit
softer look I've got an all-star mascara
duo that I'm really just comfortable
with I know I can trust them I know
they're not going to go anywhere
one is covered real super sizer this is
a non waterproof mascara it's so easy to
take off but it does not smear smudge
flake or do anything bad for me so I
love that and then all
lower lashline I do use the clump
crusher water-resistant not so much of a
problem for me to use the
water-resistant on the lower lashes
because I'm always applying a very light
amount of product to the lower lashes
but this again does not go anywhere does
not smear and that is a real problem
zone for me you know some mascaras will
kind of have that transfer problem now I
kind of forgot to make note of brows but
I used up a product I've been using a
lot recently which is the color pop dope
taupe pencil so I used my NYX micro brow
in ash Brown a lot this week so
basically my theme has been you know
using a lighter product in my dark brows
just because I have very minimal spots
to fill in and it doesn't take much so
I've used this you know it lasts all day
I've been a big fan of this because I
feel like it's a great alternative to
the brow Wiz from honest hacia put a
little gel over the top of that and
you're good lashes false lashes are
another total make-or-break aspect of
long wearing makeup that I don't think a
lot of people consider you know in the
same way you think about a foundation or
something like that but certain lashes
just don't wear as well and you can
apply it with perfect technique and
placement and certain styles certain
brands the lash band just is maybe not
flexible enough it doesn't work with
your eye shape well enough and you will
start to have that horrible lifting off
of the inner part or sometimes the outer
part depending on you know what shape of
eyes you have I feel I have settled in
on the perfect lash to get me through
the longest day ever with no problems
and it is the salon perfect number 615
I've mentioned these a few times and
they are like a really symmetrical lash
you're not flared out at the outer edges
their longest in the center so I feel
like when I apply them I really Center
them up with the center of my eye and
they feel so light the band is so
flexible but yet not too flexible you
know it does kind of mold to the shape
of my eye after a few uses and it's not
too long left to right so not that you
couldn't always trim a lash that you
thought was too long
but just naturally for me these don't go
too far in or too far out they just
cover the right amount of surface area
they feel like nothing and I got to give
a lot of credit to the Revlon precision
lash glue if you're trying to track down
the ideal easiest to use and best
staying power lash glue this is it so
that's what you want to be wearing if
you want lashes that just have a
tendency at least for me wearing really
really well all day long and last but
not least I got to mention the lips I've
been wearing kind of a different lip
look every day of the week so I've got a
lot of products that I've been impressed
with and as I've said I don't spend a
lot of time touching up some days you
know if I got ready really early in the
morning and then I was leaving the house
for one of the rounds of competition at
night I might go over my lips again but
I'm gonna say in some situations it
wasn't even absolutely essential that I
do that and yes I was eating throughout
the day so the NYX slide on lip pencils
are a must fill in your entire lips with
one of these and then go on top of it
with whatever lipstick you like or a
gloss lipstick for the best staying
power over the top of these works really
nicely so I'm holding here and I saw
pink one called bedros I've got a red
tape I believe was this yeah this was
the one I wore last night paired with my
siren and scarlet lipstick from
Maybelline that duo was going nowhere
and I was eating all these little
appetizers and fun things and drinking
water out of a water bottle and yeah we
were good and then for a more orange e
red summer tease is a nice one too but
this whole line is a can't-miss type of
product there were other times when I
was wearing my covergirl outlast
lipsticks and these are great for
staying power to this what was this
color magnetic mauve I wore that I think
I may have worn this red shade as well
which is called red Rouge today I'm
wearing a really like kind of
comfortable lip combo that has really
surprisingly good staying power
these Neutrogena moisture smooth color
sticks really feel nice on the lips and
they last a lot better than you would
expect for as balmy as
they feel and this shade is called pink
nude I think this is one of their newer
releases and I've got this you know
applied to pretty much the center of the
top and bottom lip and then I took a
little bit of my touch of spice lipstick
from the maybelline creamy mattes line
just a great line of lipsticks all
around for staying power and I kind of
bumped it up a little bit on the
outsides with that shade I think these
two together just so pretty so there you
go guys what a week it has been it has
been so much fun it's been so
enlightening to be part of this process
and really see what goes on you know in
the pageant world it's fascinating to me
I'm gonna miss the people I judged the
pageant with everybody was so cool and
so nice to be around and all of the
organizers and all the people who dealt
with us and taught us the things we
needed to know
we're fantastic as well again makeup
wise these are the things that
repeatedly got me through entire day's
long days and still left me feeling like
I got decent looking skin so thank you
for watching I hope this helped you out
thank you so much to anybody who met me
at the pageant or came up to me and said
hey I watch your videos I appreciate
that more than you know and I will see
you again very soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
