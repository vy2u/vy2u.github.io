my most asked questions are about one of
the top categories would have to be
eyeliner and people want to know what
lasts the longest what lasts the longest
in the waterline what's the best liquid
the best pencil the best cream so there
are just so many categories of eyeliner
that I think it leaves a lot of
questions for people you know as to what
they should use so I'm going to take you
through what my favourites are the ones
I feel that are truly the most long
wearing I mean there are a lot of
eyeliners I like using but these are the
ones that are the most long where I'm
going to take you through liquid pencil
and cream so I hope you get something
out of this video like I've kind of been
testing and trying to come up with just
exactly what is best for awhile now so
I've definitely pitted one liner against
the other and these are my favorites a
lot of liquid liners out there that
might claim to be water resistant or
waterproof well I have found one that is
truly waterproof like take a shower and
it's not coming off unless you are
scrubbing or using a makeup remover of
some kind and I've blogged all about
this extensive way so I hope you will
check that out because I talk a lot
about application and the way it appears
when it first goes on as to wear it the
way it sets and that sort of thing but
it is Milani infinite liquid eyeliner it
says up to 24 hour wear and that's a
truth this comes in a variety of shades
the one that I have here is Everlast and
that's the black shade but it is just a
truly truly waterproof heavy duty liner
it may not be something you would pick
for everyday wear because it does last
so long and it is a little bit of a
chore to take it off I blogged about you
know what takes it off the best so
definitely check that out for more info
but all you need to know right now is
Milani infinite it is waterproof so the
longest wearing liquid liner out there
for day to day wear as in something that
I feel like you know let's say I'm not
in a wedding or something like that and
I just want long wearing not going to
smudge off going to make it through the
day
and you know doesn't have to be
waterproof I would say Revlon Colorstay
liquid liner I've used
this one for a long time I've loved it
I've got it on today you know upper
lashline it just works so well it's
black it's I mean this is in blackest
black and it is truly rich wonderful
black moving on to pencils this is
probably the most asked about individual
segments of this video for that I'm
going to talk about two or high-end tour
drugstore this is Nick's slide on liner
this is Maybelline master drama this is
malli ever color automatic waterproof
liner and this is Urban Decay 24/7 liner
they all look the same and they all last
pretty much the same so this is going to
come down to some personal preference
here I do have a favorite for the
waterline and I've tested this and I've
tried it I've used one in one eye and
one on the other eye and malley ever
color every color automatic waterproof
liner is probably the best in the
waterline as in can make it the longest
throughout a day without having to touch
up I believe I put it on before a
newscast which would have been about
5:00 in the morning like right before
the newscast right after I did a video I
remember checking it at around 1:30 and
this was still there with the exception
of a little bit of um fading in the
inner in the outer corner right there
otherwise it was there and I think what
sets this one apart is that it's very
smooth it's very black but it might be
just the slightest bit drier than some
of these other pencils and I think it
might just work with you know the fluids
in your eye to hold up a little bit
longer there however the others last
well in the waterline - you just might
need to reapply it a little bit sooner
it's like no big deal if you don't want
to spend on this you know you can use
these other liners and still get pretty
good staying power like can take you
through a good part of the day but it's
not you know you might have to go over
it these other liners what I want to
make note of is I've used all of these
on like my skin which this is another
another danger zone but when you use
on your actual lower lashline not the
waterline but the lash line and that's
an area where a lot of people notice
smudging going just a little bit below
that throughout the day all of these
liners were able to survive my test I
put them through that would be the urban
decay 24/7 this is another high-end
liner that comes in a lot of colors the
one downfall of this is that I prefer an
automatic pencil some people might just
prefer to use the urban decay brand so I
thought it would mention that this does
last a really long time
obviously I mentioned the Mallee that
comes in it's quite a few different
shades I've got in like navy brown onyx
there's a black cherry that is not as
deep and dark as any of the other shades
that I have so just keep that in mind
with the drugstore versions NYX slide-on
liners this is a pencil
it has to be sharpened but it comes in a
ton of great colors so it's kind of like
do you want a ton of colors or you want
automatic which is Maybelline master
drama okay so this doesn't come in as
many colors but you don't have to
sharpen it it's just kind of like I
don't know I wish we could combine these
worlds and just have everybody make them
automatic that would be my preference
personally but these two drugstore
liners they're inexpensive they will do
a pretty good job better than anything
else I've tried in the water line from
the drugstore and you know color
selection you can have that with NYX or
you can find Maybelline which maybe the
most accessible you know in terms of
something you can find it almost any
drugstore that's going to be there for
you and it is just a these are all
really creamy pencils they glide on
easily they last a long time
or cream liners I've got those let's go
this way
I've got those right here on my hand and
here is Mac fluidline it's not in a
black color it's in Blitzen glitz which
is just a little bit more shimmery so
not total black there I didn't have the
regular black middle one is wet and wild
and that is in black and the one beside
that is Maybelline eye studio again they
all stay okay they all stay the
complaint people will have most I think
about an eye liner like this is that it
dries out quickly because really you're
opening it up you're exposing this whole
thing to the air and it can dry out it's
gonna dry out I mean I can't save you
from that but um Mac fluidline remains
I've had this for a while past for
almost a year still a lot of moisture in
this product it glides on very easily it
doesn't smudge off you might have
noticed that it didn't look as black
beside wet and wild but this is not a
black shade however if I'm looking you
know in the interest of saving money
you've got wet and wild and Maybelline
which I included Maybelline because I
find that it's staying power is as good
as wet and wild however I think wet and
wild goes on blacker in one swipe than
this but I just kind of wanted to give
Maybelline a little honorable mention
there because staying wise I mean it
will stay wet and wild it's going to be
a little drier than the Mac fluidline
but it's still going to be super black
and it's still going to be super long
wearing so I like to use a small pointed
brush to apply these this one happened
to come with my little fluid line it's
at 2:09 se but you can find these small
pointed brushes even from a craft
section of say Walmart you will find
little paint brushes that look like that
but I find that that's a very easy way
to have control and get a thin line or
you can use an angled brush or whatever
you want but that's just my tip there so
thank you so much for watching let me
know what you think about the things I
included and if you agree or disagree
that's fine so thanks again have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
