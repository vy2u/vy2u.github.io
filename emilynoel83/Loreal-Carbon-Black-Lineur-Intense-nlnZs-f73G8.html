in for this video this is going to be a
quick review of an eyeliner from L'Oreal
it's a liquid liner it's called a carbon
black liner intense felt tip liquid
eyeliner and it looks like this so now a
little black tube here just kind of to
go over the packaging real quickly with
you it's got sort of that inkwell design
that I like to call it you know this is
the part of the packaging that's holding
that product that liquid liquid liner
that's almost like black ink and then
this is what the applicator looks like
and while this may appear may be from a
distance to be just a very fine skinny
brush this is actually like a see if I
can hold it so I can actually show this
is like a felt tip liquid liner you can
see it is a an entity in itself it is
not individual hairs to form a brush
it's just that one little felt tip there
so basically you know you shake it up
before you use it you will hear that
little noise in there to let you know
that the formula is really getting
shaken up and then you can easily draw
your line just like so you can get a
fine line you can press a little bit
more to get a thick line however I feel
like sometimes when you press hard and
want a thicker line it actually doesn't
turn out as as dark and concentrated as
I was like you can see kind of there
from those two lines that I drew I
pressed harder but in a sense I only got
part of that line looking concentrated
in black the other part just looks a
little bit like I might want to overlap
that actually if I were to actually
leave that as my line so that basically
is one of the issues I've had with this
liner there are a lot of people out
there that have reviewed this and really
enjoy it and mmm excuse me that's
totally fine I mean we're all entitled
to like what products we we want and
have our own favorites but for me I feel
like this being a drugstore product I
have tried several other drugstore
products that do a little bit better job
of
being that rich dark black liquid
eyeliner not talking about creams here
or pencils but the liquid eyeliner that
comes in this sort of a format so yeah I
feel like one problem I have with it is
that when I do draw a line on and you
know sometimes I press a little harder I
want that I want that line that is nice
and rich and dark it actually looks a
little more diluted now right beside
that I just drew a thinner line which
actually looks somewhat concentrated it
looks as black as you would expect it to
look but when you do press down and you
want that little thicker line especially
as you wing the product out you want
that to be rich in black and going over
it for an extra step not only requires
you to use more product but it takes
more time then another issue I have with
this is I feel like this little tip
while I do like the feel and I find it
somewhat easy to apply I can't really
knock it there in terms of how easy it
is to apply I think it's not that
difficult as far as you know liquid
eyeliner is concerned a lot of people
consider it to be somewhat harder than
pencil but anyway this little applicator
I don't feel like holds a lot of product
on there and the reason why I say that
is because I will line my eye and I will
get most of the way over to the edge and
I usually like to wing it out a little
bit but if I were going to do that I
actually have to go back in and get more
product because there's nothing left
there's nothing left for me to draw it
on there with like I mean it just does
not carry a lot fresh out of it you know
you put it in you shake it up you take
it out and there's just not enough to
make it that whole way and especially
not if you want to extend that liner
whatsoever which black liquid liner is a
classic thing to do with a cat eye or
something like that so what I have to do
at that point is not only put it back in
but I also have to shake it back up free
so totally recap it shake it back up and
then finish so I mean not only is that a
little time-consuming but we all know
how it is with liquid liner you get in
that kind of flow and things are going
good and it's like okay don't want
stop that it just won't go on and
continue and finish the line but
inevitably you do have to go back put it
in I mean I don't know if I'm pressing
harder than most people or if I just do
a bigger winged outliner than some
people do I probably do but still I feel
like this should be able to get me
through you know one time across I'm
prepared to go back into this when I do
my other eye but I think it should make
it all the way across one eye for sure
so those are the small problems I have
with this liner it's not something that
can't be worked with like I said if it
doesn't come off intense enough I can
just go over it if I don't have enough
product on the thing I can get back in
for more but it just takes time and I
feel like there are other products on
the market in the drugstore that can
give me a more intense look quickly no
problems and I'll tell you what those
are right now
one is Revlon Colorstay liquid eyeliner
comes in a little container like this
like the liner intense it has more of
that felt tip applicator not a brush but
it's just a little shorter with the
liner intense I'll grab that out just so
you can see the difference here with the
liner intense you're getting a much
longer more flexible tip and on the
color stay it's a little bit more rigid
and and the little tip is only about
that long so but anyway somehow I feel
like the color stain manages to somehow
hold a little more product on there I'm
not sure but when I do put it on I feel
like it's one solid rich color and even
if I press down harder what a thicker
line it doesn't look washed out or
watery whatsoever so that's a good pick
they're from the drugstore if you are
going to the drugstore and you like a
brush applicator for this also something
that can handle carrying a lot of
product but yeah it does have that brush
tip go for the NYC liquid eyeliner this
is also just a fraction of the cost of
the other two while the you know the
Revlon may cost you seven or eight bucks
the
is going to cost you like $2 and this
does have a brush tip that's a brush
you're looking at and you can press a
little harder and get a you know a
darker light you can see how amazingly
dark that NYC comes out there so only
downside to this is if you a don't like
the brush applicator or B you want this
in some different colors that's the
benefit of Revlon you have blackest
black you have a black shimmer shade
that actually does have some somewhat
noticeable shimmer you know your navies
Browns etc so you don't have as much
color variety within YC but it is very
cheap give you a very intense line very
easy to use and then Revlon those two
are probably ones that I would pick over
the liner intense but thank you so much
for taking the time to watch this review
video just I wanted to basically test
out something that I've heard a lot of
hype about with this carbon black liner
intense I wanted to see how it stacked
up with some other liners that I really
love so I had a pretty high standard I
was comparing it to it's not the worst
product ever it's I'm not even going to
say it's bad it just doesn't perform
quite as well as a couple of those
others so thanks again for watching guys
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
