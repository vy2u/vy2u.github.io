joining me for this video of I feel like
I've been so busy lately and now I'm
getting back into the video swing but I
mean I had a couple days off work and I
went to the Cardinals game in st. Louis
on Wednesday and they wanted it was such
an amazing game I'm wearing my Cardinals
shirt in sport so they're playing in
today I had my parents down to visit and
so we've been busy with different things
and so I'm really excited to pass along
this review to you today on a mascara
lots of people have been talking about
and it is the l'oreal voluminous false
fiber lashes mascara that's the
packaging there is the Prada this
mascara claims to give a false lash
effect it says it has volumizing fibers
that adhere to the lashes for a volume
eyes sculpted lash effect lashes will
appear fuller longer sculpted and curled
at every angle large container with kind
of a gold mirror like finish and then
you have a brush that is somewhat long
but it's kind of skinny overall I want
to get a focus here on it but I mean
look at the amount of kind of clumpiness
that comes on get in really really close
and I see if you can see right here at
the end these little bitty fibers that
are kind of poking off there so what
they're calling the false fiber
component of this mascara so within this
creamy rather dry formula you're getting
these little fibers that are going to
attach to your lashes and make them
longer and thicker as well it's some
mascaras I feel like more is more you
know I feel like you can build them up
and the more you put on the bigger the
lashes become and some net some mascaras
just have that really buildable nature
to them and the more you work with it oh
my gosh they just keep getting longer
and thicker and better and with this
mascara it actually I feel like less is
more
I feel like when I go to put more on
they start to clump together which is
kind of disappointing I want to take you
through sort of some tips and what I've
learned after using this for a couple of
weeks on how to get the most effective
application with this when you first
take it out of the
as I showed you before there's quite a
bit on there and I recommend kind of
scraping that on when you put on your
first coat I recommend doing it kind of
slowly and really just have a soft hand
with this just gently kind of apply it
and you will notice it's highlighting a
lot of lashes see new sweeping the wand
all the way past the tip of your lashes
because then you're going to ensure that
those little fibers kind of latch on and
have their chance to build off of the
ends of your own lashes making me feel
like okay you know this is this is
looking good and you want more of that
and you want even more thick when you go
back for that second coat do not wait
and do your other eye and then come back
this is so dry guys if you go back for
your second coat and you wait any amount
of time it is definitely going to clump
off you have to almost be content with
the look you have after one maybe two
coats of this especially if you have not
a lot of lashes because it's just gonna
start to look pretty close you've got
great lashes I imagine you know one coat
of this would really do some good but if
you put much more than that it's gonna
become very visible that you've got a
decent amount of mascara don't have
issues with this flaking off which is
good which I kind of feared because you
do have those false fibers that are kind
of connecting onto your own lashes and
it makes you wonder okay all that length
is something gonna snap and get it come
down but I don't have that issue while I
wear them but if I'm sitting here and I
would come through my lashes with like a
you know a mascara wand or just kind of
mess with them to get them a little more
separated at that point I do notice
flaking down on my cheeks so just be
aware that if you're gonna comb through
them with something that at that point
you will probably see some flaking down
but you can swipe it away and it's no
big deal
another thing we just have to think
about here the name is voluminous false
lashes if I put on a strip of false
lashes and they ended up looking like
the look I have right now would I be
disappointed yes I hope this answer some
questions about this mascara for you if
you've got wonderful beautiful thick
naturally long lashes I think this will
only help them with one coat but just
in mind a lot of coats a lot of building
is not going to necessarily make them
look better it could make them look
worse so thanks again for watching guys
have a great day and I'll see you again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
