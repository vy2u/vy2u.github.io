using the Loreal hip duo in forgiving
and the colors are kind of a deep
turquoise and then a dark brownish taupe
color which is shimmery and that
brownish color there is one that I've
had on in a lot of my videos as like a
you know a crease color sort of and I've
had some questions about it and people
saying can you do a tutorial on the look
you have on and this is oftentimes the
look I have on just - the blue but today
just because we're having fun I'm
including the blue so this is what the
look looks like and it's fairly easy to
recreate so I'm just going to go through
with you first just the products I have
on my face to start with in case you're
wondering I use the Max Factor pan stick
to just conceal under my eye area I used
L'Oreal bare natural mineral powder in
nude beige as my foundation and then I
used all kinds of minerals today
maybelline mineral power bronzer as a
bronzer and then flush I love this new
blush it's from the Jame mineral
collection and the color is Sun brushed
and it is like the most beautiful golden
peach color ever I love it so much I
love the I mean it could be a good
contour color or just all over your face
and then I just set it all with the bear
natural finishing powder so I also put a
primer on my eyelid and so let's get
started first you're going to use a
champagne colored
like cream shadow or cream shadow stick
this one is the wet and wild perfect
pair it has like a brown liner on the
bottom and then this champagne colored
shadow stick on the end it's number 112
but it doesn't have a name and I'm just
going to go all over my eyelid with this
where my hand doesn't get too much in
the way of what I'm trying to say today
just get that all over the lid this just
helps give that shadow something to
something to cling to
okay so once you got that on there and
you're going to take the glory L Hipp
shadow and I'm just going to use mine
like Coastal Scents double-ended brush
I'm going to use instead of the contour
so I'm going to use the eyeshadow side
just dip it into that turquoise blue
shade and just dust that all over your
eyelid it's a pretty vibrant shade but
it's kind of unique because a lot of
turquoise blues seem to be more pastel
and this is just a little bit darker so
this could actually you could probably
reverse the look and use the brownish
taupe on your lid and then use this
color in the crease if you wanted to but
this is just the way I'm going do it
today okay so once you got that all over
you're going to take I'm going to work
in a third shade here you just need a
light kind of champagne colored why do I
wish you champagne to describe
everything it's um just a like light
shimmery eyeshadow this is covergirl one
kit I enhance
there's in champagne that's what it
happens to be named and then I'm going
to use the other end of that duo brush
it's just a small tip and get some of
that shadow on there and then just use
it on the inner corner and now you're
going to come out with sort of a
graduated effect here light to dark on
your on your eyelid you're going to have
not sure how well this color is coming
through from this side but what you
should have is just sort of a light
color fading into your dark so do not
put this all over the top of what we
just did just on the inner half okay and
then we're going to go back to the we're
working this brownish shade now and I'm
going to use first my eyeliner brush and
we're going to use my blending technique
that I like to use for the outer V so
get some product on your brush get under
the outer portion of your lower lash
line and draw a line outward it's just
about the length of your brush tip
basically alright then I'm going to go
in there with my essence of beauty
crease brush it's a small one it's a
very small contour brush and I'm going
to work over that line in circular
motions and that is defining the shape
the outer shape of this look and then
I'm going to go in for a little more
color and I'm just going to further
define the outside the outer portion of
the crease
and it's like you're almost connecting
see how I had the line right out here
right from the lower line and then I'm
just gonna click come over the top and
connect and that's kind of how you
create and out of the book okay and then
I'm going to go over that with a
fluffier crease brush and just kind of
blend it out and make sure none of those
lines are visible anymore okay so now
that you've got that your eye shadow
work is really pretty much done for now
the next thing we're going to do though
is liner and this is actually the first
day I'm using this so I can't say that
I'm recommending this necessarily this
is just what I'm using I'm trying out
the Revlon line fantasy cream liner in
chocolate so that's a brown shade and
I've noticed it has like a little bit of
like teeny tiny golden e sparkle
sparkles in it so I'm not sure how well
this is going to last so what I'll tell
you is if you don't have this or you
know this is bad and I shouldn't use
this just use a brown liner will work
and I'm going to use a new liner pencil
that I really really like I got this
this beautiful little pencil or this
brush for less than two dollars from
Walmart it is roughly Robert Simmons
round CP 85 brush found in the craft
section and it gives me the best tip
like the tip if you heard me complain
about Coastal Scents liner brush now the
tip like light blooms at the end almost
and gives you a wider line or separates
this hangs together beautifully so I'm
just going to go over from the inside
out and just with a really fine line
because we don't want to we don't want
to get too thick to where we're making
the pretty blue
that we've got going on there invisible
we want to make that really able to be
seen at the same time we want to define
it and you'll find that this this
particular color if you're using it
blends very well into the that taupe
shade of the Laurie alpha of the
forgiving
duo so then we're going to also do our
lower lash line here in that same liner
just on the inside out just kind of do
your best to connect what's going on
here in the corner maybe smudge it a
little bit with your finger if you have
to but like I said any brown shade
should should work quite well with that
brown shadow okay very good and next I'm
going to grab my go back to my hip duo
grab my liner brush who I got hurry up
right now and get a little bit on your
brush and just go over the inner half
we're going to go over we're going over
the top of the ground and then take I'm
taking my Coastal Scents itty-bitty
brush my mini contour dab it into this
again and we're just going over that
tear duct area so that will appear like
almost a light blue Brown it's really
it's you wind up with a pretty color
there so next I curl the lashes and I
usually do this for like 15 seconds and
try to work my way down you know out
throughout the lashes and then I'm using
my L'Oreal hip mascara to finish it off
can I get it done in time
all right looking beautiful I love this
mascara all right and there you go
there's the look thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
