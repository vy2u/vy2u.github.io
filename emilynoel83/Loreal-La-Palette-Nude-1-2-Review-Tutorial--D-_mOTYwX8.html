everybody I hope your day's going well
today I am going to be reviewing a
couple of pallets that I've gotten loads
of questions about and they are the
L'Oreal la palette nude one and two I
got mine for $15 a piece from Walmart
but I noticed Ulta selling them for like
nineteen twenty dollars easy so
definitely a pricier product for the
drugstore so I really wanted to pass
along my review to you guys and I will
show in this video a quick tutorial
using one of these pallets as well it's
the look I've got on today first off I
want to say I love seeing drugstore
brands come out with larger palette seem
like for the longest time you could only
find quads from drugstore brands and now
we've seen Maybelline come out with the
nudes hard candies got some larger
palettes these are out and I love that I
want to see more of that happening but
I'm going to be honest with you I
actually saw before these came out in my
Walmart stores does this ever happen in
your stores they'll like have a little
bear space where like these pallets are
gonna be so I spotted that at first and
I thought oh you know it's really
exciting palettes but then the other
part of me said wait more nude palettes
like come on now how many of these
things do I really need Nate is entirely
the wrong word to use because I have
enough when it comes to nude eye shadows
and just to break it down here for you
real quick I think these are pretty good
pallets but I really like the second one
over the first just because I think it's
more unique and it's offering something
a little bit different I like the looks
I can get out of this better there's a
little more interest in this palette
with some berry and plum shades and here
it's like I've already got a lot of
brown and bronze happening in my
collection if these palettes came out
like say a year after Urban Decay Naked
I've probably been jumping up and down
the aisles to see them but it's like now
while I'm glad drugstore brands are
putting out new palettes can you give us
something a little different maybe a
couple of like interesting pops and
something like this to make it worth my
while you know but what I think these
palettes did well was creating a good
balance of men
and shimmer definitely some nice shades
to wear in the crease a good range of
dark medium and light and the textures
of these shadows if you're familiar with
the color riche quads like this it's
that same kind of formula it can be a
little hit and miss you know some shades
are better than others on the whole I
was pretty impressed I mean I don't get
that kind of like deep down excitement
in my gut type feeling I get when I
swatch you know the softness of an urban
decay or a lorac shadow does anybody
else get that feeling like when you
touch a shadow and it's downright creamy
I mean it's not that kind of next-level
experience with eyeshadow it's pretty
good and I can turn out some great looks
with these particularly if you're
putting these on top of a primer I think
you're really going to notice them pop
and I can definitely get a greater
variety of looks with the two pallet
compared to the one also these palettes
kind of have a nice weight to them
they're not at all flimsy I really
appreciate that I also like how when you
open them up you've got a totally usable
mirror right up top here also come with
a double-ended sponge tip and a very
usable brush applicator here that brush
is great for getting around your inner
corner or you know some more detailed
aspects of your look for a closer look
at Linoone palette 1 you've got three
matte shades in here three entirely
matte shades one is a dusty rose a
medium brown and a dark brown rest I'll
have some shimmer in them none of them
come off as being like super loud and
metallic but just enough shimmer to kind
of catch the light
sometimes with eyeshadows you'll find
that the shades apply on the eyes better
than they swatch or sometimes the
reverse is true they swatch better than
they look on the eyes and that was the
case with some of the shades in this
palette particularly this color right
here which was kind of an attempt at a
gold and it looks like kind of a pretty
soft gold in the swatch but I really I
don't know if you're going to give me go
give me a great metallic gold that's
going to totally pop on the lid and look
practically foiled you know I really
want that kind of a look with that
particular shade and this was just a
little bit dull it's pretty pleased with
the textures of the matte shades and
there's a pretty kind of deep bronzy
color that I like in this palette if I'm
putting this right up against its
closest drugstore counterpart which is
probably the Maybelline nudes palette I
think the quality the texture of the
shadows is a little bit better he's more
pigmentation in this kind of a palette
but I have another comparison to make
here at the end before I wrap up first I
want to show you the two this is my
favorite of the two palettes because I
really have enjoyed some of the looks
I've gotten out of this there are some
great matte shades let's see there's one
two three four five six and totally
matte shades in this palette including
these three pinky berry shades here at
the end I love those those three
together are great there's just more
interesting things happening with this
palette in a nutshell love this
highlight this great pearly shimmery
highlight that might be gorgeous on the
face as well I haven't tried it there
yet but I love that
also the second shade it's kind of
interesting it's a pinky shimmer even
prettier in a swatch as you can see than
it looks in the palette and this shade
right here the camera may not be doing
it justice but this is like the dustiest
of dusty lilacs like it's just hanging
on to a little bit of a purple tone in
that shade and I really really like it
it's very unique I don't have hardly any
shades like that and actually why
there's a lot of cool things happening
these two Browns here are a little bit
warmer one has shimmer one does not and
so that gives you some versatility and
then like I said you cannot go wrong
with this berry this plum shade I love
those compared to the palette one la
palette too I think has more interesting
little things happening that just draw
me in make me want to use it help me
come up with different looks whereas I
mean I feel like I end up getting a lot
of the same looking looks oh gosh
would I use this palette even if I'm
using different shades it's just you
know the gradient of colors always comes
off looking kind of similar now the
other comparison I think you need to be
aware of if you're looking at this price
range okay 15 to 20 dollars for each of
these the Coastal Scents revealed one
and two palettes I really like both of
these these are around 20 dollars last
time I checked revealed palette one is
loaded with naked one and two dupes I've
outlined many of those on my blog so you
can check that out for more details but
it's mattes it shimmers it's metallic
and then the revealed to is everything
you might want in terms of the pinky
berry color family lots of rosy shades
in here burgundy shades rose gold let's
say
this does the pinkie and Rosie looks a
little bit better and this one does the
plumy looks a little better because this
deep dark plum in this palette is really
really good but we really can't talk
palettes in this price range without
bringing up these because these have
double the shades that the Loreal
palettes have for about the same price
range and the quality is great but this
look that I am sporting today is a plum
smokey eye I was really happy with the
way it came out this is probably one of
my favorite looks to do with this lapel
at nude 2 so here's a quick tutorial I'm
first just applying a little primer to
my lid this is from NYC it's the city
proof 24 hour and I'm going to start off
with my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow brush
and this berry color I'm going to just
Pat that all over my lid and I'm leaving
a little bit of a gap there on the inner
most part so we can put a lighter shade
there I'm going into that same shade
with my Sigma e25 brush and this I'm
going to take right here through the
crease going to go to the inner part the
outer part just back and forth
windshield wiper motions here and then
I'm just building that color up even
more pulling it upward and outward I'm
going to take this plum at the end with
the same brush that is going to go right
here on the outer part of the crease
blends really easily over the top of the
berry color and then I just tapped into
that same plum with my small shadow
brush from Sonia Kashuk and I'm patting
that on the outer corner then I'm taking
some of the shade that looks kind of
grayish but actually it's more like a
soft dusty plum berry type of shade and
I'm just applying that over the border
kind of a transition color I love this
pearly shade here as my highlight so I'm
picking up that with my e-40 and that's
going to go just underneath the brow I'm
also going to take some of that shade
with the brush that comes with this
palette and I'm going to put that right
around the inner corner of the eye so
just here on the inner part of the lid
and then right around the tear duct as
well for upper liner I'm just going to
use a black liquid this is my two
Danah color Envy in black envy I'm just
going to sweep a thin line all the way
across
I forgot I actually kind of made that
wing somewhat dramatic over here on the
other side so I'll pull it out just a
little bit further and then I'm putting
a plumb liner in my lower inner rim this
is Mally's black viola
sweep that right through here it starts
to give us kind of a smokey vibe without
being quite as stark as a black and then
I'm just kind of dotting it on my lower
lash line as well then I'm going to go
over all of that with the plum and an
angled brush going to kind of meet up
with my winged liner here and just kind
of top off the plum and then what I
think gives a really nice smokiness is
to take a pencil brush so definitely
fuller than that angled brush and going
into the berry shade and just sweep this
over the lower lash line and it's going
to give just a great kind of smudge you
look to everything and then just finish
the look with some mascara and false
lashes if you want and you're done the
other things happening with this look
just real quickly I reviewed this laura
geller palette very recently over on the
Express channel this is my blush this is
my highlight the baked french vanilla
highlight by the way that's like
legendary in my highlight collection
also this is from the Estee Lauder
koresh collection and it's this really
soft kind of dewy Champaign highlight I
pop that over the top and that's what's
giving this real glow enos right up in
here it's like the French vanilla
brightens but this added the do wearing
my ELF matte lip color in T rose and
then why not make the matte color shine
right I've got a little bit of this
Estee Lauder pink innocence shimmer
gloss the pure color gloss on top of
that so again to wrap this up bottom
line I think these are good palettes
from the drugstore I think they are a
little bit pricey for what you're
getting the Coastal Scents revealed one
and two pallets should not be overlooked
if this is the kind of price range
you're looking at but I don't find these
to be better than an urban decay or a
two-faced palette I just don't think the
shadows are quite as good but I really
have come to enjoy this lapel it new to
because I love the plum looks I can get
out of it so I hope this review sorted a
few things out for you and thank you so
much for taking time to watch and I'll
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
