you this review of a product that I
frankly really don't like and it is the
Loreal the one sweep eyeshadow you've
probably seen this in special little
showcased areas in your drugstore or
your Walmart store and the idea behind
this shadow is that you're gonna take
this applicator this jumbo sized sponge
tip applicator sweep it over all of
those shades and then apply it to your
lid so you're getting the effect of
three shades without having to blend or
take different brushes and go from shady
Shady Sherri I mean it sounds like a
good idea
to be able to really streamline the
eyeshadow process and get a
multi-dimensional look with one
applicator at one time however I really
don't think it executed and I think it
is way overpriced for what your kid
they're charging about nine to ten
dollars for I paid $10 at CVS for this
product packaging why should get the
mirror here you do not get a lot of each
shade think of I mean instantly my
thought was okay what I'm really getting
here let's say this failed you know
which it in my book it did you're
getting just a trio spending you know
that amount of money for just a trio in
which you are not getting a lot of each
shade I mean it just seems a little
ridiculous to begin way I tried it out
you know I got my little applicator I
swept it over all of the shades I put it
on my eyelid and there were multiple
things that I found wrong with this is
making this flat applicator okay and
your eyelid is not a flat like piece of
paper you have contours in your eye you
know your eye is going out here and in
here and then back out again and how is
this how is this catering to any of any
of the shape of your eye you know I
didn't really get that and then I've got
the dark shade the dark shade is
designed to be closest to your lashline
and then the medium shade in the
highlight but my eye I mean my highlight
goes way up here this thing only covered
me to about here and I felt like the
lightest shade was getting like right in
my crease it
did not make sense the way this the way
this went on since that time I've of
course gone in and corrected it and I've
blended it and I've put a little more of
the dark shade here and a little more of
the light shade there and tried to work
with this but I just really don't think
that this is practical I feel for the
people who are makeup beginners that go
into the store think this is going to be
a good idea
swipe down the product swipe it on their
eyelid and then think they are done
because I don't I do not feel like this
gives you a really great look at all it
just looks kind of has sort of that
blotchy look when you first put it on
the shade I have here is called playful
for all eyes so in the display you'll
see some suggested shades for blue eyes
green eyes brown eyes hazel eyes I think
and then shades for everyone so this is
one of the shades for everyone and the
colors are pretty you know this is not
in terms of just watching these shadows
and showing you the the pigmentation
that they have they're not bad colors
but the thing is you're you're paying
for this whole gimmick
of getting this this oddly shaped thing
here and we don't all have the same the
same shaped eyes we don't all have the
same amount of space between here and
here bottom line I would not recommend
this to anyone I mean I just I just
really wouldn't I think that you can
find good quality eyeshadows go find
yourself some wet and wild check out
some covergirl even you know you can
find this quality of shadow elsewhere in
the drugstore you don't have to resort
to the gimmick that that this has and
you know I might say I regretted this
purchase but innocence
I don't regret being able to share with
you all but yeah I mean maybe I'm saving
more people out there by doing this
review than I'm just saving myself by
not buying it at all if you want to go
back and say and try to continue using
this with normal sized brushes you know
they're very they're very narrow strips
so you are going to have a little bit of
a challenge there even going back and
using them with your regular brushes so
anyway let me know what you think about
this if this has worked for you if you
might just have that cookie cutter
shape that that works for that might be
good but it just seems like the the
amount of shadows and the way they end
up getting placed on your I just did not
work for me at all so thanks again for
watching guys that's my review of the
L'Oreal the one sweep eyeshadow hope you
have a great day and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
