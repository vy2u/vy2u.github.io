this review video I hope you all had a
great weekend my weekend was so good I
didn't want it to end
my sister-in-law Sarah came up and
stayed with me in Tyler and we had so
much fun and if you if you follow me on
twitter you know that but it was it was
just a really fun time we got Snuggies
we went out we got pizza it was just a
really good time so hi Sarah if you're
watching this also by lip gloss in this
video that I'm wearing I really really
love this shade I wore it today at work
and I just put some more on it is the
NARS lip gloss in Dolce Vita and this is
kind of like a deep rose shade kind of a
deep reddish rose I really like it I
love the feel of the NARS lip glosses do
you make me remember if you saw my
Christmas haul um I got a whole set of
them and I knew I like Turkish Delight
and I really like this one too so just a
pretty kind of all-purpose classic shade
of lipstick but anyway let's get to the
review on this video this is the
telescopic explosion mascara so if you
know about telescopic you know that it's
shaped like a cool little telescope
which yeah I recall doing my last video
I don't know why I feel the need to do
that when I say telescope but normally I
mean it's just a rubber brush in fact I
think I have that handy here yes I do
this is what the regular one looks like
regular telescopic rubber brush has like
four little like I guess sides to it of
just short rubber bristles and lash
explosion is it's just called explosion
not lash explosion excuse me it has just
like this little like knobby
rounded bristle here at the end and this
is very unique I mean you may have seen
this if you recognize this this is sort
of like a copycat version of the Yvonne
Chi mascara very high-end mascara that
also has this sort of you know spherical
applicator to it
so basically yeah you got this men ski
it's got this little bitty wand with
little rubber tips all the way around it
and I think part of the concept with
this when they say lash explosion it's
like you put it on and your eyelashes
are kind of like very fanned out with
this because you can get like your inner
ones and you know kind of really just
you kind of steer the lashes in the
direction you want them to go and sort
of fan them out at first when I tried
this mascara I kind of thought you know
this is this is easy to apply but I was
not that cracked up about the formula
that was in it and now I think a little
bit of time is passed and you know
sometimes you just start to like the
formula a little better basically it
dries out just a little bit more and
becomes you know I tend to like a
formula that's not quite so wet because
I feel like that kind of clumps lashes
together but I really like this and I
put a lot on today because I was on the
news and I mean I wasn't wearing false
lashes today I really want the eyelashes
to stand out so da normal day I might
just go for a very natural definition
with this but what's neat about it and
the reason why it would really recommend
this to beginners is that you totally
can easily get to every lash like it's
much easier to get to your inner lashes
with this I think and like if you want
to do your other eye you know how it's
always like if you when you think back
to when you first use mascara and like
you were trying to get this other eye
like if you're right-handed like me you
got this eye and then it's like oh this
is a little awkward well here you could
just go from almost any angle and just
get to the lashes so if you're a
beginner that's just trying out mascara
and you're really having problems with a
normal comb or brush this is pretty easy
for that and I do like the lengthening
aspect it lengthens nicely and it
thickens a little more than regular
telescopic does so you're getting a
little more thickness very black lashes
I mean the shade I have is blackest
black in this but yeah the app the ease
and application is really nice where
you're gonna run into clumping is not
you're really not
gonna run into getting a lot of like
clumps or gloves of mascara on your
lashes but the one situation where you
may encounter this as you initially pull
it out of the tube and see that little
bit of mascara formula that's sort of
hanging out like a little tip there on
the bottom of the thing that's not an
extra bristle that is excess mascara and
if you do use this and use it you know
maybe down like this and you're applying
that all the way around this applicator
you may get that on you and that will
create a clump and so what I do is I
just get it out and I just kind of go
like that no more clump that's basically
you just have to be conscientious I mean
look give the brush a look before you
actually put it on your eye and make
sure that's not on there otherwise I
really don't think you're gonna have a
lot of clumping issues I get a lot of
questions if I talk about a mascara and
I always forget to talk about whether or
not it helps hold the curl of the
mascara sometimes mascaras are kind of
heavy
and like you curl them and it seems to
just anti curl you know I don't feel
like this is necessarily outstanding one
way or the other I don't feel like it's
so lightweight to wear it absolutely
it's gonna you know lock my curl in
place but I also don't feel like it's
extremely heavy to wear it's weighing it
down so yeah on that topic I mean I
can't really go too far either extreme
but I have worn this all day to work and
I haven't noticed oh well actually I had
a good close look here I do notice a
couple little little flaking issues down
there and I mean not major nothing you
can't brush off with like your finger
and you're okay again but do be aware
that's possible with this mascara on
what else do I have to say basically I
do enjoy it I think it's nice for length
and the the really the real reason why I
wanted to make sure I posted a review on
this is because AI did bring this up in
a blog a while back that I had gotten it
and many of you were interested in what
I actually thought but B I do think that
if you are one of those beginners with
met with makeup or maybe you've been
using makeup for
and you've just always hated the way
mascara had to go on and you want to try
something different give this a shot I
mean it's it's really at an affordable
price you can buy this at your drugstore
okay you know keep an eye out at
Walgreens they put L'Oreal a buy one get
one get this get some eyeshadow you know
or get some you know whatever you need
and like I said just kind of make sure
that that tip of that brush is is sort
of wiped off there is a teeny tiny
actual nub on there but you can
definitely tell on the mascara is
collected and then you can totally go
applying this in all directions you can
also put it on your lower lash line
you're not gonna have a lot of issues
with smudging there but as always I
don't suggest you put a ton of mascara
on the lower lash line so that is my
review of the L'Oreal telescopic
explosion mascara if you think this is
for you of some of the reasons some of
the pros I gave for this product really
stand out for you you may want to go
pick this up and see how you like it
thanks so much for watching guys have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
