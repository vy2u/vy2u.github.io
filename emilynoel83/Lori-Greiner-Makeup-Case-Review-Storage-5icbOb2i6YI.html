bags yay I'm so excited I have been on
the hunt for a great makeup bag for
myself for a really long time I had one
that I loved it was starting to break
down
zippers were breaking handles were
breaking and I kept thinking I want to
replace this so badly but I could never
find the right bag that had all the
features that I wanted enough storage
enough organization plus brush storage
and I'm going to show you exactly how
I've organized everything this was a set
of two bags for right around $29 and
frankly I would have paid the $29 or
more just for this these come in several
different animal prints I think there's
a tiger print a zebra print and some
solid colors as well as her by Lori
Grenier and I'm not sure if you're
familiar with her creations but she has
just tons and tons of patents for a lot
of great kind of unique tools
organizational products she makes some
great jewelry storage she has some
different makeup storage ideas if you
search her on youtube you'll see a lot
of great like makeup storage videos that
people have done featuring her things so
this is my first on Lori Grenier
purchase and I did use these banks for
my personal makeup storage when I went
to the wedding this past weekend so I
traveled I took all the makeup that I
used on the bridesmaids in my train case
but I used this for my own makeup
storage and I kind of recreated the what
I took in this bag right now so you can
see how it stores thing kind of review
it along the way and let you know what I
think of it so let's take a look up cake
has taken over the chair here she is
supervising the video let's do a paper
stuff this is the smaller of the two
bags for some people this might do it
for your makeup otherwise this could you
know handle some overflow products maybe
some tools or nails stuff that's kind of
what I did here you open it up and
you've got a pocket right here on this
side it's a clear pocket and it has just
a little velcro open I fit in here some
nail polish remover
had some files some different nail
polishes the center section kind of
folds over like a book and there are
actually some snaps here as you can see
so if you wanted to do without this
section and maybe fill out this section
a little more you could totally snap it
out and then you know I just threw some
makeup sponges in here but it has
another velcroed section on this side so
really quite a bit of storage the big
bag also has two separate zippers on it
open it up and you're going to have sort
of a book like feel to this so it opens
it opens one more time on this side you
have a flap here that folds over that
also buttons out that's the only section
that buttons out and then you've got one
more flap over here revealing the brush
story so overall you've got four
compartments on this flap four
compartments on this flap here two here
in the base of the bag brushes and then
three zippered sections right here to
start with the brushes this was a really
important aspect for me a lot of bags
don't have separate brush storage and
it's not that I don't want to use a
brush roll because I think brush rolls
are a great way to keep your brushes
nice and separate and everything but
sometimes when you're traveling
somewhere like you don't have a nice big
space to lay everything out like to both
open up and empty out your makeup bag
and lay out a brush roll so here if you
were stuck you know just sit in your
makeup pack in your lap and doing your
makeup from there you're okay actually
has nine different little slots here for
brushes they're nice and tight elastic
some are larger on this side and smaller
on this side as you can see just kind of
loosely I threw in my eyelash curler in
here said I use this I traveled with
this my brushes stayed nice because
there's this flap here where nothing's
being stored so it really kind of goes
down in there and keeps your brushes
safe got three zippered sections here
and I found these to be good places to
put my pencils or my mascaras or
anything just kind of long and skinny so
as you can see right in here you know
I've got several different lip liners
I've got a few mascara
isn't like a brow gel and then some
eyeliners and brow pencils and stuff
like that now next we have this flap
here which can just very easily snap out
so if you want to do without that if you
just don't need that many sections to
store things you can do without it one
thing that I noticed is that when I
filled each one of these sections
totally full because of course it's
thinking like oh I want to take as many
makeup items as I can it will not zip
 when you fill all of these kind of
to capacity
so either you filled all the sections
and don't like totally go as full as
they'll get and you will be able to zip
it or like when I traveled I actually
took out this section and build
everything else full and it zipped just
fine but I just want you to be aware of
that the sections I'm going to talk
about to have that velcro closure which
you know it's not a big deal but this
can be a little abrasive this part here
as you reach down into it it's not a
deal-breaker for me by any means but it
might Bend cool if like they did like a
magnetic closure or something like that
but this does stay shut you don't have
to worry about things falling a pocket
is big and this could hold like I said
if I stuff this full I could put you
know another row of glosses in here if I
wanted to but just to show you this NYX
mega shine is probably the length of an
average gloss and then you've got still
a little more room in the end for a
couple of men and the bottom I fit like
six lipsticks standing up you flip that
back over and kind of flip this part in
I've got all my eye stuff then right
there I put in this pouch just some
eyelash Prodigy's red cherry lashes are
not bulky at all so you could probably
stick another couple of those in there
here I just put some cream products like
the color tattoos the Mallee shadow
sticks at primer so just to show you
that they can accommodate things like
that very easily over here I put in one
of the wet and wild eight color palettes
just to show you that that can easily
fit there and still velcro's to say if
you wanted to fill this pocket full you
could probably fit three of those
and wild palates there and and some of
these trios and you hear just a variety
of single shadowing this side out
I'm just got a bunch of face products
and you can see how like like I said the
height of the bag shows that you know it
can accommodate a certain amount here
but once you start folding stuff over if
you get everything to full it's going to
be hard to zip down in here foundations
primers concealers I could fit more if I
wanted to here
powder my bare minerals summer bisque my
lorac spotlight powder these are about
the size to fit let's say four large
compacts I've got two here like I said I
want to be able to fold everything over
and then I've got several blushes right
here that hot mama blush from from the
balm I tell you that's pretty good stuff
so this is definitely not the way you
would have to lay out your stuff and you
could definitely you know add some
different elements in there if you want
to I just wanted to give you an idea of
how the sections would accommodate
different makeup products that you have
from there you just fold it over and zip
it shut so just my little review here I
really really like these makeup bags I
like that also you can see the material
on he tell just by the glare on that
that it's something you can wipe off
also I like how all the sections are
clear they're up sort of a plastic that
you could easily wipe off when that gets
dirty we all know makeup bags can tend
to get pretty dirty I feel like you can
be just as organized as you want to be
in terms of separating your stuff
there's that snap out section in both of
these bags where you can you know kind
of fill it a little more full just where
the other sections are concerned or you
can divide things up even more the brush
part is huge for me I love to have that
and in terms of just the way I use this
you know you could put like I showed you
here all your makeup for a full face of
makeup and then some or for me on just a
day-to-day basis the way I use this is I
take a certain amount items to touch up
with for work before the newscast I just
think the price on this is pretty
outstanding for two bags so for the
person who wants to just take a little
or
you're like me and you're traveling
somewhere you want to have options you
don't just want to be confined to this
one I shadow palette or this one blush
or lip gloss you want to have options
this is for the traveller who wants some
options because you can really take it
all so thanks a lot for watching I hope
this was useful to those of you who
might be on the lookout for a new makeup
bag and I'll see you again in the next
video bye you talking what'd you think
of the makeup bags like
you're talkative today
you want to say hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
