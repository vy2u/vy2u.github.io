Mack haul this was all prompted by the
new setting sprays that are out and I
really don't need any more setting
sprays so I am officially cut off at
this point no more I'm gonna use up what
I have they're actually called prep and
prime fix plus and they had several
different since and I had to get the
rose and I think I literally made this
purchase like the day I posted my Rose
Project video go figure
then that always happen like you think
you've got this all encompassing video
you just put out and then the new thing
happens anyway got the Rose I really
have always enjoyed the way Mac's little
phrase spritz out I like the mist it's a
very fine mist but yet it's still kind
of directed this rose one as you would
expect has a soft rosy scent and then I
also got the coconut and I was pretty
pumped about this because I mean I don't
have anything that smells remotely close
to this in terms of a facial mist and it
is just super refreshing but loving the
myths it's a great time of year to have
some sort of facial mist also whether
it's this or you know maybe a less
expensive brand stick it in your
refrigerator pull it out when you're
feeling hot and it's just a really nice
little pick-me-up anything you're really
interested in seeing individual reviews
on that I talked about in this video let
me know in the comments section those
will probably be things that I pass
along in individual videos on my Express
channel something I did show whoa hello
something I actually did show in action
in my get ready with me video is this
new foundation it's the pro longwear
nourishing nourishing waterproof
foundation I have it in NC 30 and I
really am enjoying this stuff I've had
so many questions after the fact after
using it in that video because that was
my first time wearing it and I really
liked it I was a big fan of actually the
original Pro Longwear and I think that's
a much drier formula than this like it
sets faster on your skin and I don't
know it could have the potential to look
a little more cakey on any dry patches
you have and I do feel like this is a
little more natural-looking on the skin
yet it has
really nice coverage it's easy to blend
out I love the squeeze tube type of
design here with the packaging the only
thing I haven't really tested yet is
that waterproof claim I have determined
that it's very long wearing I love the
way this continues to look like by the
end of the day but I literally do want
to like dunk my head in the water and
see what happens then so anyway wearing
this today loving it and really loving
to wear that also just a second here
let's grab it I'm wearing it in
conjunction with my pro longwear
concealer this is something I've had
before so it's a repurchase and I got
this in NC 25 oh I have to use of this
is half a pump half a pump gets me
plenty on the under eye area and if I
want to use it kind of in a brightening
mode like on the high points of the face
it's really great for that I think this
is a relatively thin consistency
concealer but really amazing coverage
for as thin as it is so these two
together I feel like I've got great
staying power great coverage I don't
have to take the stuff on another thing
that I picked up was this prep and prime
CC color correcting compact and I got it
in the shade adjust which is the here
and that is I'm holding it upside down
that's the light peach color and here
was my thought with this I already own
just the regular prep and prime compact
that's basically like translucent
setting powder and I thought okay if
this is a little bit peachy maybe this
would be something that would give like
an added corrective boost to the under
eye area you know you're using your
peachy correctors to counteract the blue
tone circle and then you put some of
this on maybe you're like super
brightened and I'm still really on the
fence about this I've been using it to
kind of set the under eye area and it's
doing an okay job a very natural look
but I'm not sure how really corrective
it is you're not gonna see that because
it's like the exact same sheet is my
finger but the texture of this powder
like my original prep and prime it's
kind of a dry feeling powder and you
might think well duh it's powder but you
know how some powders feel kind of rich
and creamy this has like a thinner drier
consistency or texture so I'm not quite
sold on this yet but I'm gonna keep
messing around
with it I was browsing around on the
bestsellers section of the website and I
decided I wanted to try a blush that
I've heard talked about all over the
place on YouTube and just in the online
beauty community but I had never tried
yet and it's Melba and it's the matte
finish blush it looks very you know
typical I guess there's nothing it
doesn't look too fancy but I am wearing
this today and I must admit I love this
shade I do think it's definitely do
pible if I look through my collection
I'm sure I will find some things that
look like this and as with some blushes
that seem a little bit muted in their
compact it comes off on the cheeks with
a little more intensity than I was
expecting so it was kind of a pleasant
surprise I see why this is a popular
blush I can see this working on loads of
different people but I really am liking
that so I guess it's about time I gave
that one a try I got this mineralized
eyeshadow quad and pink sensibilities
and it's really small I don't know what
I was expecting it to be I think I was
thinking this was gonna turn out to be
like the size of a face compact or
something but it seems a little small
but I really really like this stuff
you're getting like a light lilac it
seems like it might be getting washed
out here on camera but that's a really
soft lilac a pink kind of a pinky taupe
and then a dark brown and I gotta warn
you there is some sort of sparkle
happening in all of these so if you
don't like any sort of sparkle with your
eye look it's laced throughout every
shade but I am wearing this on my eyes
today and I love it I love this topi
kind of rosy taupe color that's great
this lilac color really like I was
expecting it to be kind of flaky judging
by my swatch but on the eyes I think it
packs on and looks so pretty with this
color scheme there's the swatches the
people who stick to like strictly matte
eyeshadows are seeing this and thinking
uh get it away it's all Sparkle I used
again the rosy taupe type color in my
crease a little bit of the dark brown on
the outer corner and smudged on the
lower lash line and then that lilac
color all over the lid the only shade I
didn't use I guess for this look was the
pings it was well as things as soon as
you open it up you're like oh good
this is gonna be like flaky sparkly
powdery City but I have found the shades
to be super easy to work with and blend
out nice pigmentation not too dry and
chalky as I find some like baked style
products to be so very happy with that
the last thing I got uh I'm just I don't
know if this is a good idea but I went
there I got the 15 color warm neutral
eyeshadow palette and I got to looking
at all of the shades that are in here
that they were listing on the website
and I thought I think I only have one of
those has shade called amber lights in
here and I thought I had that know I had
wood winked I didn't have amber lights I
don't own any of these shades already
and a lot of them are like super basic
things I've heard people talk about all
the time like Brule
that's the Shay here saddle where if
I've been on that color I love that
honey lust amber lights dark brew just a
lot of great basic warm neutral shades
in a variety of finishes there's some
metallic ones man it was kind of like
curiosity got the best of me so I really
wanted to try this but this was a pricey
palette it was like 80 some dollars this
is not gonna do anything to get me out
of my neutral eyeshadow rep that I spoke
up on snapchat recently but um I do
really want to like test this out and
see you know is this worthwhile test it
up against some Coastal Scents shadows
some makeup geek shadows some other
things that are sold you know in this
size and see is this really worth it
I've done a few looks with this so far
I've been happy with it but it's kind of
a matter of are they is it different
enough is it special enough I would love
to hear your thoughts if you've gotten
in on this or maybe you already own like
all of these shadows are you like a
staunch Mac Shadow user or are you
totally open to you know the dupes of
things like this because I'm open to
dupes about my curiosity just got the
best of me on that one so I had to try
it out but that is my Mac Hall my
friends a little bit of everything no
lip products in this video I am wearing
a rather loud lip product sorry my
camera just turned off and now it won't
stand up straight but this is my
colour-pop ultra matte lip
in Sunday very very bright matte lip
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you like this whole and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
