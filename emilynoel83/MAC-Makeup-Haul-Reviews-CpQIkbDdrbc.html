share with you I don't do a lot of
shopping at Mac and there's no
particular reason why I kind of think
that it's because my nearest actual
physical Mac counter that I could visit
is like an hour and a half away so I
think if I had something close that I
could be browsing all the time I would
probably be buying a lot more mat just
one of those brands with such a spectrum
of shades you know I think it really
helps to see some stuff in person but
recently I noticed that the Viva Glam
Miley lipstick and lip glass had come
out and I really wanted to get those and
so while I was browsing the site I
picked up a few other things along the
way so I thought I'd share those with
you and I had been using the stuff over
the course of a few weeks now so I will
be able to give you some little reviews
along the way actually the lip glass and
the lipstick the Viva Glam miley
collection I have already reviewed these
over on the Express channel so you can
check that out for a lot more info the
lipstick is a true hot pink it's really
bright it is from the amplified line of
lipsticks and I really really like it I
mean I just think it's so so vibrant I
think I explained this in my review you
know you could possibly wear it a little
more sheer maybe but I think it's really
at its best when it's just full-on
bright full colored lipstick really
really enjoy it and then the gloss on
its own I was not that impressed with it
cuz I thought it was just so sure it
just looked like kind of a see-through
with a little bit of pinky sparkle you
know and I'm not a huge fan of the
texture of the Mac lip gloss I think
it's kind of sticky and I just don't
know it's a little bit uncomfortable but
actually paired with the lipstick worn
on top of it
I thought it gave such an interesting
like next-level shine because not only
is the lip glass shiny for being a gloss
it has all these little like micro
shimmery particles so I think it's able
to kind of go to the next level where
shine and catching the light is
concerned you know and I just thought
that looks so pretty so I was really
glad that I went ahead and got both of
these of the two you know I prefer the
formula of the lipstick just the overall
color but they are a nice team I must
admit so then as I continued to wander
the website I got
more really random things one of the
things that I was interested in is this
machine supreme lip glass tint and I
have it in the shade simply Wow and this
is like a click up
pin style lip gloss and I really really
like this hopefully you can get a sense
of what this formula is like see how
it's almost like a I don't know a creamy
gel type formula it has some Sheerness I
think it's just a really beautiful
wearable berry type shade but what I
really found outstanding about this is
the texture of it you know it's so shiny
but it's not as sticky as like a typical
lip gloss is it has that nice ability to
sort of cling to the lips but yet you
could run your tongue over it let's say
like I've got a little bit of this on
over another thing that I'm gonna
mention in a second but it becomes a
little more one with your lips if you
know what I mean it's not like okay
here's this goopy gloss like sitting on
top of my lips so I really enjoy this
and I like this style where it clicks up
through the brush tip that I was
thinking with it being that slightly
transparent kind of formula I'm
wondering if lighter shades would turn
out to be really shoe because this berry
shade is like slightly on the sheer side
so I'm not sure but this simply wow I
think is really pretty if you're into
the berry pinky colors now the other
product I mentioned having on under the
gloss is this trend forecast spring 15
lip and cheek I just thought this looks
so interesting and I love you know the
multitasking lip cheek type products and
you can see we've got some really warm
shades down one side and then some kind
of berry pinkish color and all of these
shades have names that are outlined on
the back with CC in parenthesis behind
it I think that means casual color which
can be kind of a multitasking lip cheek
type product so they're really creamy
they kind of remind me of the feel of
like a cream Sheen lipstick sort of
except some of these shades are pretty
darn sheer and by some of them I mean
mainly these two guys right up here and
these are just practically transparent
when I put them on my lips but these
other shades you know have a nice amount
of brightness and the cool thing about
palette format things like this or that
you can blend them and really customize
the color particularly I like taking
these two shades and may
setting them up and also these two but
today I'm wearing primarily this shade
and I just put a little bit of this
product on top they coordinate quite a
bit but you can see it's pretty pinky
and I've also got this on my cheeks as
well as my blush and I just applied that
with the elf small stipple brush and it
applies really well and it just gives
this nice kind of dewy glow to the
cheeks but it doesn't feel too um
tacular these three shades right here a
little goes a long way and when I had
like this on my lips the other day I was
really surprised at how well it lasted -
another product I picked up is this
studio conceal and correct duo and the
shades that are on here it says mid
peach on one end and mid yellow on the
other and a lot of like the peachy ish
concealers that I have are in like
little pots so I thought it'd be cool to
try something with a little bit more of
a liquidy consistency and see how well
it would be able to cover
there's the peachy tone right there that
really I mean when I get that on my skin
it seems to shear out more like just my
natural skin tone but the yellow I think
is very pigmented and yellow and it is
brightening you know that one does kind
of wake up the face that can be nice
kind of in the inner corner but this
peachy tone that's in here mid peach
it's just one of those concealer type
products unfortunately that I feel like
when I sheer it out it kind of sheers
out to nothingness even when I really
try to maintain some coverage it's just
not quite enough you know I did see them
both doing a decent enough job of like
brightening you know they're a very
lightweight product I do like the
consistency it just doesn't pack enough
coverage in there if you're really
trying to cover up some imperfections so
the way I think I'll continue to get use
out of this is actually using a more
heavy duty concealer over the areas that
really need some camouflaging and then
go to this really either end of this for
a little bit more of a brightening
affect the real cherry on top from this
hull just a totally amazing thing that
I'm so nuts about is this set of rose
pigments and glitter this is the objects
of affection pink and rose pigments and
glitter set it comes in this cute little
box here here's the top and it's like an
actual
you know heavy-duty kind of packaging
the center part would come out so you
could actually reuse that and this was a
holiday thing but it's still on the
website and I got it for like 35 bucks
which i think is an amazing deal
considering now that I've used these
pigments a few times here and there I
think I'm gonna own these forever
it does not take much whatever you use
them my experience with pigments I have
one Mac pigment it's like a teal color I
think it came out in the holiday
collections several years back and I
liked it but it just wasn't the kind of
shade for me that I was gonna go back
and use over and over and with this
collection actually the one that really
made me want to try it is that it
included the pigment in tan and I know
that's one that I've heard people from
like the beginning of my days on YouTube
people talked about max tan pigment and
so I thought okay once and for all I'll
try that
and I was also drawn in by all these
other beautiful shades so I've got a few
swatches here and it's interesting
because there's kind of like varying
textures within this set so I'll try to
describe that as best I can as I show
you these swatches the first one in
there is whisper pink that is this
really like kind of bright pearly
shimmery shade it's got some sparkle in
there but it's also got like its own
kind of metallic pigment running through
that and then right next to that I have
a swatch of tan and this is really
really beautiful I see why people love
this shade it's got that beige-ish hue
to it maybe even like a hint of a
pinkish tone as well and I just think
that's beautiful it's very metallic when
I've used this one I found that pretty
easy to work with and the next one is
rose and that's swatch right here and it
is a rosy color but I think you're
probably seeing a lot of gold and
shimmer coming off of this and with this
one I feel like it has like a lot of
maybe micro glitter to it because there
is an actual glitter in this kit and
this is not to that extent but it's like
teeny-tiny shimmery particles so you
really have to be careful I think when
you apply this I'm wearing this in my
look today I've got it on my lid and I
chose to put it on top of one of the
kind of tackiest stickiest primers that
I have
it's this Sephora base came in some
little kit a while ago I'm hopefully
they still make it but it's a great
consistency for making any kind of flaky
shadow really cling and lay down I had
like no fallout when I use that but I
can tell when i swatched it dry all of
these are just swatch dry not over a
primer on my hand I could tell it would
have a tendency to be a little flaky if
you didn't put it over the right kind of
base now there is a glitter in this kit
and I didn't go ahead and swatch it
because I didn't think I can really
control it for a swatch this is the
glitter in reigning riches and it's a
beautiful light kind of rosy coppery
shade it's like a deep rose gold this is
gonna be fun this is gonna take some I
think real effort to work with it
because the other day when I was playing
around I tried to put it on top of this
Sephora primer but I think I'm gonna
need something even more heavy-duty to
cling to the glitter like a specific
glitter type primer you know what I mean
I welcome any tips or words of advice
for using these glitters but it's
definitely a gorgeous shade then the
last one in this kit is this gorgeous
plummy color called Heritage Rouge and
this is swatched right here and you can
see how this isn't one of the pigments
that contains glittery sparkles it's
kind of like its own little pearly
finish there's not a bunch of you know
added razzmatazz in there it just really
is pure color I have that on the outer
part of my lid blend it up into the
crease I've got it kind of just going up
above - it sheared out beautifully it
went on you know in a packed on way very
nicely - and I think that works really
great with the rose shade but more of an
unexpected twist that I did yesterday as
I did Rose on the lid and did Navy in
the crease and I thought that looked
awesome that's totally something I'm
filing away to do a tutorial on but I
think this is just a great value this
set of pigments and I'm kind of new to
the pigment game from Mac but I'm really
really impressed with these these are my
kinds of tones and I think I'm just
gonna have a lot of fun with these in
the future alright so that wraps up my
little haul from Mac as you saw I was
pretty pleased with most everything with
the exception of these
conceal and correct duo not quite as
much coverage as I was hoping it would
have but the lip products were great
really like this palette and definitely
enjoyed that little pigment set as well
so thank you guys so much for watching I
really appreciate it and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
