video we're tackling an awesome awesome
viewer request some of the best videos I
do are questions that you've asked me
and this one comes from Jen clen and she
was asking about some great multitasking
brushes and maybe a how-to video using
them and so I've thought about this
quite a bit there are some of these
brushes that you really have seen me use
a lot throughout my makeup routine
others show up maybe from time to time
but all in all it's a total of only 5
drugstore brushes that I'm gonna use to
create this look and I think this could
be really useful for any makeup beginner
who's trying to build just a manageable
brush collection you don't need an
entire like a set of brushes that
includes tons that you're not gonna use
at the same time with certain really
small kits that you pick up you might
find that some of those just aren't the
right fit for you aren't the right type
of brush that you need so every brush
that I'm going to mention here can
definitely perform multiple functions
and they're all affordable so let's just
go ahead and do a full face of makeup
with them and I'll talk about them all
as I go so I've already moisturized and
primed the primer I use today by the way
is the foundation primer from Laura
Mercier and the foundation I'm gonna put
on is something new to me right now but
I figure since the main focus here is
the brushes we can just kind of have fun
with whatever makeup it's the LA Colors
radiant skin nourishing a long wear
makeup and I have it in medium beige
she's got a pump which is nice I'll go
with that one full pump here and kind of
smooth it out all over my skin you might
notice that the places I pay closest
attention to are the or the places where
I patch the most product are just really
the parts of my skin that I hope receive
the most coverage so something to think
about when you're just kind of
slathering on your foundation and then
the brush that I'm going to be using in
several ways is this instant pop cheek
brush from Real Techniques but as you
will see here this is a really fabulous
size for a foundation brush the way it's
cut it's got like this flat sort of side
to it and I find it blends out
foundations really nicely great for
liquids or creams it can even do kind of
a circular motion buffing type of effect
but in addition to that it's also really
great for concealer blending and also it
can work well for its intended function
which is blush okay so that foundation
is looking like a pretty medium coverage
very natural finish foundation I'm not
seeing like a real sparkly profound glow
out of it but just kind of a natural
skin finish and then I'm going to put my
makeup revolution concealer on this is
my c5 shade and we're just gonna apply
this here to the under eye you I just
kind of forgot that I really only need a
little bit of that so I may have applied
a bit more than necessary right there
but then I'm going to do kind of a
dabbing motion with this brush and the
way it can spread concealer over a
larger surface area is really fantastic
like look at that and then you can
really seamlessly blend it down like
onto your cheek and the way that angle
is cut you can see I can get right in
there around the eye with just the tip
of that brush because it's cut finely
enough there
boom super easy application I feel like
with the patting motion that you use
with a brush like this you can really
maintain the coverage that's coming out
of your concealer so I really like using
that brush for both of those steps but
it could also be a very good brush if
you want to bake look at the flatness of
that brush so if you really wanted to
like pick up a great deal of powder and
instead of baking with a sponge bake
with a brush and just go stamp stamp
stamp stamp you know all over this zone
you could bake with it but we're gonna
let another brush come in and have some
fun here this is brush number two we've
got the small tapered brush from elf
this goes so far back in my videos like
years back I'm picturing myself back in
my other room like in the other house
when I was singing the praises of this
brush this is so versatile this is gonna
be great for under eye setting powder
this could also you know dab powder all
over the face if you want to and
something I haven't used it for a lot
lately but it was one of the reasons I
initially started using this brush is
highlighter it's really actually a great
size for that sometimes we lose sight of
how good certain brushes can be in
different respects because we just start
acquiring so many different brushes that
we feel like we have to have this
certain one for every job you know I'm
using my Maybelline fit me loose powder
here and I'm not really baking I'm just
going to set the under-eye with a little
bit of that
and I'm also just using this brush to
set my t-zone as well although I do have
another brush coming up that's fine for
full face powder also but I kind of like
to take the brush and sort of press the
powder in that way it feels like it's
more so integrating into my look
actually setting something as opposed to
just being like this dusting of powder
that's just going every which way across
the skin it's a very intentional
application of powder because it's going
exactly where you're meaning for it to
go on your skin this brush is gonna
return to do another task in a second
but my third and final face brush for
this look is the elf complexion brush
and again another brush that you see me
use all the time in my videos and it's
really great because of the size and
shape it's a full enough brush to where
you feel like you're never getting a
streaky application on your skin but
it's not so big that you're losing
control and something I've loved about
this is how its kind of pinched in right
here at the top so that creates a brush
that's just a little bit flat and that
flatness can really help you contour
bronze with a brush like this also
because of being pinched like that it
can be great for just having on some
blush it can be your setting powder it
can do just any powder in general it's a
great sort of catch-all brush it can
handle a lot of face tasks where powder
is concerned so I'm gonna use this new
bronzer I got from makeup geek
it's called thani medium skin bronzer
and I think this might be my favorite
bronzer ever I love the tone so much on
my skin I can't get over it it's so nice
it's really nicely pigmented but it's
not out of control that I just feel like
it looks so pretty and so natural on the
skin this brush can really cover large
surface areas with ease I think so if
you even need to use this on your body
and you wanted to like to do some
shimmer down the arms or something like
that
no sweat
love doing just a soft soft bit of
definition there on the cheekbone with
this kind of brush and we're not
skimping on quality at all here with
these brushes I mean this is a soft
brush i've used the heck out of it it's
still standing same with this one from
elf and this one from Real Techniques
these three brushes for face really have
you covered for blush I'm gonna go to my
new Milani blush trio in floral fantasy
this is the one that's a little bit
peachy and I have options here if I want
a little more targeted application of
blush perhaps a heavier application of a
blush that might be kind of sheer I
could go for the insta pop cheek brush
that I used earlier or if I just want a
really diffuse light soft cheek I can go
ahead and use the complexion brush which
is i what I think I'm going to do right
now I'm gonna go for the center shade
here's a little bit of a satin finish on
this color but you know that if you
already watched my video on new Milani
I was able to put that blush exactly
where I wanted it to go even with a
brush this size because again it's
pinched now for highlighter another new
to me thing from makeup geek love our
little compacts here they're so pretty
and so beautifully stamped with that
design in there but this is the
Starlight highlighter and I'm gonna use
the small tapered brush which it's cut
to such a point if you only wanted to
pick up highlighter on the very tip of
this brush you would get such a
pinpointed focused application I'm just
gonna seek to pick up products sort of
along that little angle there at the top
as you'll see we'll be able to get that
exactly where we want it that is a
really pretty highlight then you kind of
buff over it circular motions just like
I would when you see me use that Moda
brush
it's really fascinating when you try to
decom placate your brush situation you
see how many brushes can do so many more
things than you thought I can take a
little bit of that I can go around my
Cupid's bow
gonna get myself a little mist of some
setting spray I'm using my Smashbox
photo finish primer water in centering
citrus today this set makes me think of
a hotel room a hotel room bathroom
smells like hotel product that they're
giving me so entire face was only three
brushes our Real Techniques insta pop
cheek brush the elf small tapered brush
and also the elf complexion brush and
I'm going to go ahead and do my brows
and then we'll continue with a two brush
I love brows are done I used the usual
suspects the elf $2 brow pencil it's
called instant lift in deep brown and
then not this thing what did I just pull
how thick this thing the brow stylist
boost and set from L'Oreal in the dark
brunette I believe yeah dark brunette
shade love that and I put on some Milani
eyeshadow primer and now we're going to
do a little playing around with the
Shayla and color pop perception ballot
I'm excited I feel like I got a little
rainbow here and the two brushes that
we're using are actually just a duo you
can buy from Real Techniques and they're
called the insta pop eye brushes one is
the insta pop crease brush which you've
seen me use a lot and I was back and
forth on what to choose as another eye
brush or two for this look and I
realized that I could really actually do
a lot with this in step up shade brush
and again every brush in this instant on
including that cheek brush like this is
the easiest way to see what the shape of
these is it's this you know there's a
big like flat space here and then it
tapers up pretty steeply that's what
we're working with on both of these
brushes as well one a smaller one is a
little bit larger and more full and I
think that shape makes for a really
really versatile brush so I'm going to
start with the larger of the two and I'm
gonna go into just a general crease
shade because even though I'm using
fewer brushes that I might normally
reach for I don't want to really change
up my style or my look that much like I
want to prove to you that you can still
achieve every step of a typical I look
that I might do so I'm gonna go into
this color called culture right here
that's a good starting point dab the
brush in and then we're going to wedge
this so that the most pointed part is
going right into the crease and what
you'll find here is that this is a great
application of crease color because the
point
part is getting it right in the depth of
the crease and then you're able to just
kind of fan it out and work outward just
ever so gently pulling out it's so easy
and it's great because this shade is
borderline kind of light for the crease
this color right here you know so this
brush is giving me a really concentrated
application and I just think that's
great it's very easy to use it's super
soft and I can wedge it even right down
here gosh I should be working with this
brush more often again
we're turning it so that pointed part is
going to choke right in the crease and
then you'll find yourself kind of doing
a combination of dabbing and pulling up
with the color and look at that and then
you're saying okay that's fine for
application but how do I blend you can
just kind of do a windshield wiper type
movement actually with this brush and
that'll function to blend out your edge
and so we're getting a nice little
diffused super soft crease here with one
brush that's oddly shaped like this and
then I want to dab on some highlights so
I'm gonna use unbothered I'm gonna dab
into that this will place your highlight
exactly where you want it to be if
you're a one who kind of likes to carve
out your eyebrow a little bit more this
is nice because you can take advantage
of that edge if you wanted to but I'm
just going to dab a little right there
under the high point of my brow the arch
so this brush has managed to do crease
soft blending and highlighting now the
smaller of the two is just an absolute
dynamo because this is going to be great
for controlled application and actually
packing shadow on the lid we can get
outer corner with this and we can also
do the best smokey kind of buffed out
lower lash line so I'm feeling like
taking a little bit of this unbothered
shade again now with my smaller brush
and I'm gonna build this up a little bit
right here in my inner corner like that
going around the tear duct just by
patting it there and then just pulling
up onto like that inner third of the
eyelid then I feel like using some of
this green right here this is ie get a
little bit of that on there it's kind of
an interesting mix of like spring green
and all
definitely some fun color choices were
made with this palette
but this brush is fantastic for packing
on that shadow the density of it it's
really great and it's just built to do
kind of a packing on type thing
and I'm also kind of turning that brush
around a little bit and getting some of
that green all the way to the crease and
then I feel like I need something kind
of deep and rich there in the outer
corner so I'm going to use mmm I'm gonna
use shade we're dabbing shade right here
on the outer corner and how perfect is
this size of brush it's so not too much
brush but it's just right you can flip
it around like I did before and really
wedge that tapered up part right there
in the outer corner
the old Abin wedge just dab it on the
outer corner build up as much as you
want flip the brush wedging it in your
crease pulling that color around
kind of cleaning off this other large
brush that we used and you can use that
all the fullness of this brush you can
use that to kind of go over your edge
and soften up everything that you've
applied there just keep it on the
outside a little back forth motion boom
we're blended now I'm going to take some
liquid liner and this is my makeup
revolution flick eyeliner it's just a
felt tip pen that I find wears a really
long time
I'm just going to take this across the
lash line
then I want to brighten my lower inner
rim because I feel like I need it this
morning I need the added wakefulness
this is the wet-and-wild ultimate brow
highlight here's a multitasking product
because this you know is meant to be a
under brow highlight but I always put it
in the lower inner rim now one of the
things that I have for a long time
talked about and use this brush for is a
nice soft lower lash line using this tip
part of the brush so you really want to
think about that when you're dabbing it
into product if you know okay I'm gonna
put this on the lower lash line don't
load up the entire flat side of the
brush because that's not really
necessary just dab the tip of the brush
into whatever shade you want to use and
go from there so like I'm gonna go in
with shade first I've only got color
right there on the tip and then I'm
going to just softly apply this under
the wing and to the outer part of the
lower lash line
and then I say we pull in a little more
of this green on this brush and we carry
that green throughout the rest of the
lash line inward it's kind of a murky
green it ends up on the eyes looking a
bit more like a true olive then I
thought here I'm thinking is it kind of
a spring green is it an olive green I
think once it blends with any little bit
deeper shade it comes off a lot more
olive but it's pretty and I love that
kind of green I love kind of a neutral
murky green but do you see how this
brush is able to so softly and yet so
effectively give us color just the right
amount and like width of color here on
the lower lash line and then maybe we're
kind of re-evaluating the look and we're
saying hey I actually want even more
green on my lid so this brush again it's
small enough it can pick that up it can
place the color again exactly where you
want it kind of there on the center of
the lid zone it is such a brilliantly
designed brush if you want a brush that
is so worth the money because it can
perform so many functions for you this
is it so now I'm gonna take care of my
lashes I'm going to curl them put on
some mascara may or may not put on some
falsies and then we'll pick out a lip
product just for the fun of it because
that doesn't really require a brush and
then we'll be done here's the eye look I
ended up putting on my Koko lashes in
risque I really love that style for
fullness and it's kind of fun like
because a lot of the fullness of the
lashes right in the center so it really
opens the eye up but on my lips I'm
gonna try out one of these Becca glow
glosses in the shade called foxglove it
looks like kind of a soft berry
I feel like this is something I probably
said a long time ago on my channel but I
love kind of the combo of a berry lip
and an all of the eye
and these smell just like that orbits
sweet mint gum there are quite a few
products I feel like that kind of go
that direction and there we go everyone
I'm so happy with the finished look I
mean full face five multitasking
drugstore brushes highly accessible
highly affordable maybe you saw me use
one brush and you're thinking I need
something like that to plug into my
routine maybe you're gonna totally start
from scratch and get all these or
perhaps this video just prompts you to
like look to your own collection and say
do I have anything that could possibly
do more than one task and if I'm
traveling I don't have to take as much
because I'm realizing that one brush
could do multiple tricks for me but
thank you guys so much for watching
thank you jennifer asking this question
and getting my mind rolling on ideas and
I really appreciate it and I'll see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
