video is not going to be the hunky-dory
I love it I love it I love it that video
because it's just it's made up of all
the products that really haven't been
working for me lately and when you try
as many things as I do you definitely
run into some stuff that just didn't
quite hit the mark and some of it may be
just things that I personally didn't
like and may work for someone else
some of them might just be kind of an
odd formula or just the way the product
was put together I didn't really enjoy
it but I do think it's just as important
to share these things with you as it is
you know the stuff that worked awesome
so I've got a small basket of things
here it's kind of overflowing I'm always
one that does I get like a small
container and that I mounded up with
something first thing I will mention is
this palette from Sonia Kashuk and it's
called ion textured nudes and I hadn't
heard a dang thing about this and then
one day I was in Target and I saw like
the regular matte nude palette that they
have the shimmery one and then this
sounds like all something new here we've
got a row of mattes
a row of kind of pearly um shimmery
finishes and then these are straight-up
glitters and one problem I have is with
a palette this large there's not a lot
of contrast with it I will say that like
this shade and this shade kind of come
off a little bit deeper than they even
appear to be in the palette and I mean
as far as these two rows go I like
what's going on here I would have
preferred to have you know a couple of
deeper colors in the mix as far as the
quality of the mattes and then these
kind of metallic shimmery ones go
they're really nice my issue with this
is that one third of the palette this
whole row here is just kind of a loose
glitter type of finish and they all end
up looking the same they're all fairly
light I mean you could use any one of
these and get the same look on your eyes
whether it was the one at the bottom or
the one at the top it's a kind of finish
that gives that wet look because there's
very little actual shadow pigment
happening it's just straight-up sparkle
in there so I mean if they wanted to
throw in one or even two shadows like
that I don't think I'd be too upset
about it but to have just this whole
section of the palette made up of
something where the shadows all look
exactly the same kind of disappointed
because
I really love you know other Sonia
Kashuk shadow products that I have but
this one I just didn't quite understand
so I think about a month month and a
half ago I had a night where I just
could not get to sleep and Belle was
snoring Bell was not snoring
Tyler was the ones snoring Bell at the
time had come down with something I just
kind of worried about her and up and I
was on my iPad and guess what I may have
stumbled into a little online shopping
on mac cosmetics calm because I had done
an email that said free next day
shipping and I don't know the thought of
that just really appealed to me at the
time so I got a few things I got a few
lipsticks that I really like different
lip products and I also went out on a
lemon decided to try a foundation that I
just never really hear talked about now
I'm kind of understanding why it's the
full-coverage foundation this is a cream
foundation I have it I'm holding it here
in the shade NC 30 and it's really
really thick to the touch I found it a
little tricky just like with my Beauty
Blender to even pick up a lot of product
off of there so I ended up I think using
a brush to kind of swipe it all over my
face and a beauty blender to blend it in
I don't feel like I achieved the fullest
coverage with this first off I think I
can get good coverage but it's not
necessarily as good as some other
liquids that I have but my primary gripe
with this is the staying power it has
anybody else used this and had like
great luck with it looking fresh for a
long time this is the kind of thing I
wonder if it was maybe designed for like
on-air TV type circumstances where you
want your makeup to look nice for a
couple hours and then you know all hell
breaks loose because on me and I'm not
terribly oily I'm pretty much normal
maybe a little bit combo in the t-zone
and this state looking pretty darn fresh
like I really like the finish for a
couple hours and then it just like
completely broke down it was like every
part of this foundation said yep we're
out it truly looked like it had
disappeared from the center of my face
and also like down into this area too
onto my cheeks which is never usually a
big problem areas so this product
probably the least workable Mac
foundation for me that I have tried I
tried something from makeup revolution
called the ultra strobe balm it's in the
shade euphoria I think this might be the
only shade
comes in to look at it from a distance
it just kind of looks like a white cream
to look at it close up can you see it
there's kind of an opal type thing going
on there and I kind of like the texture
of the product cause it's not too sticky
but yeah it's still easy enough to pick
up but my issue is when you swatch it
out you can totally tell and when you
put it on your cheeks it's just like
straight-up baby pink I don't get sort
of that subtle oh it might have a little
pinky glow when it catches a light type
Sheen it's just like pink it's so much
more pink than you would expect it to be
in this compact and the issue may just
be my skin tone but when I apply this in
places where I want to highlight it just
looks like misplaced blush on me maybe
deeper skin tones could get away with
that and benefit from this shade a
little more but on me it just looked
like you know why is that there while
I'm talking about failed highlights
let's bring in some elf shall we these
are the baked highlighter and bronzer
and the baked highlighter and blush this
says bronzed glow and this says rose
glow on this one so they've put their
baked products into duos I've never been
a huge fan of their baked blushes or
really baked anything that looks like
this kind of deal but I thought okay
they're putting two in one maybe they've
changed the formula somewhat and I just
find these to be weak weak weak weak elf
I'm sorry they just don't really show
for whatever reason the highlight on the
bronzer side is a little bit better than
the highlight on the blush side but the
blush and bronzer themselves like barely
show up I mean I did not sign up for
barely there and I appreciate the effort
to make it convenient and do a little
two-in-one but just not working for me
while on the topic of elf they've got
some of these new duo stick type things
and they've got them it's kind of like
their take on nude sticks because
they've got little tins that they sell
as well little sharpeners and I've got
several for lips and those seem to work
fine I also got the one for contouring
contour and highlight basically so one
end is your contour colored stick and
it's actually a decent shade for me it
was kind of soft
it was way easier sorry about the phone
it was way easier to blend out than I
would have expected for being something
so small
you're swiping over your skin I could
just like buff it out with my finger and
so I'm thinking okay this is going well
very good and then there's a shimmer
side and this is just like straight-up
gold I mean let me swatch this for you
and this is so hard to blend I mean
after immediately swiping it on my skin
I could not blend it out whatsoever it's
right there like what why can't this
side just be a creamy pencil like hint
of shimmer or something easy to blend
out something in the consistency of
what's happening on this contour side
that would be great has anyone tried
these elf lock-on gel liner pencils
they're actually really smooth they've
got a nice capping system I will say
that they really have a tight cap and
the shades that I have you know they
felt soft to begin with and they still
feel soft but this nude shade which I
was hoping would be an ideal like lower
inner rim type color I have never had
this experience before this this wears a
long time because I was looking at this
I was trying it again yesterday I looked
at it after maybe eight hours of wear
and it was still in my waterline but it
looked so odd it looked a little too
dark
first off so it really showed like as
being makeup he not just as hey look at
my super fresh shoot Oh lower inner
rhythm here's the thing lower inner rim
when you're going nude when you've
decided I just want that to be kind of
colorless I want to undo the
discoloration that's like all you want
to do you don't want to be like
attracted to really look at that area
you just want it to be nice and clean
this is the shade swatched out right
here it's a little dark like the shade
is off but it looked so dry which is a
really weird thing to be saying about
the waterline because normally it's like
that the area where stuff just wears off
because it is so wet and generally
dryness is like the last issue I would
have there but it looked like patchy dry
like foundation or something it was
weird and I didn't like it and then you
look at my eye with the false lashes the
smokey eye shadow this that and the
other thing and the only
thing I could see was that weird as
water line what I'm getting too heated
over this video and this is the kind of
thing where somebody will say in the
comments you didn't seem like you were
in a very good mood well I'm talking
about stuff that did not work when I
talk about things that do work I
probably seem completely fine but okay
last elf thing of this video I promised
the lengthening and defining mascara
when I was trying like dirt cheap elf
stuff I was going nuts I ran into a lot
of great things and I thought this
lengthening and defining mascara I was
pretty sure I'd tried it many years ago
and I thought I'd give it another go not
good don't just don't even waste your
time with this one like it the brush
spirals around it's kind of a wide
spiral the formula is not super wet and
it's kind of like a thick cream formula
and that paired with this kind of spread
out bristle brush it really clumped my
lashes together a lot and that was about
the only thing it did a lot of because
it didn't build up a lot of length it
didn't you know do a lot of great
separating and this and that
it just did a very effective job of
clumping my lashes together which is
obviously not what I want a mascara to
do let's talk about your way for a
second here they've got these like
liquid or I think they're called lip
creams and they've got a lot of
beautiful matte shades the one actually
I'm wearing one of them today the matte
shade in dulce de leche so it's a pretty
light kind of soft blush type nude color
really gorgeous I've tried several other
shades from bright to absolutely nude
that I think are really pretty and as
far as a matte liquid lip color formula
they're not all that uncomfortable I
mean they are dry as you would expect a
matte to be but they feel decent well in
the same line they've got metallic ones
and the metallics look god-awful like I
mean they just under sold out they're
sold out on their website so people own
these and people are wearing them and I
mean maybe maybe it's a mix it in type
thing with some other lip color like
kind of highlight the lower center of
the lip area that might be good but all
over the lip
worn full-on like I looked at the way
the lips on the website looked and they
didn't look too bad but on my lips these
really don't look good and these were
sent to me so I didn't choose these but
the shades I'm calling out our papaya
Pamplemousse
pimple Pamplemousse Citroen odd rose and
praline and praline would be the deepest
so that might be the one that I would
think could be the most workable but
just to show you like a picture a few
hours after application it looks so bad
it doesn't look good right after
application first off but give it a
little time and the lips become even
more dry and I think it's the fact that
these are formula that does kind of dry
down on your lips and then these are
totally metallic like I just don't I
don't like that look so these lightest
ones are even bigger offenders in my
book but I gotta say the brands got a
beautiful thing going on with the matte
finishes so if you are you know planning
to order some of these in the future
look into the mattes just make sure what
finish you're getting last thing here is
just more of a cry for help or a what's
going on with this can somebody explain
this to me
the Stila illuminating powder foundation
compact okay I got this I was just
nosing around in Ulta a couple weeks ago
and I was watching things and I saw the
pans of this product here I got it in
the shade 40 watts and I was touching
these I thought oh that is like the
smoothest most creepy feeling powder
ever it does feel great it's soft it
actually has nice coverage to it but I
don't get the packaging whatsoever first
off you've got to buy a pan and then you
got to buy the separate compact okay
fine we'll do it can you see the little
square of sticky right there it actually
had something that you peel off that
would make you think it will stick into
your compacted product I think it said
3m on there like some herbs delicious
went into staples and said hey we need
some double-sided sticky for these I put
it in it does not stick it just it's not
even touching anything like there's a
little rim
right in there I think that's what's
keeping that sticky from actually
adhering to anything so you've got pan
of product in there no sticky and then
the puffs that I think came with the pan
you put this in here and it won't
actually like close down on top of it
the puff keeps the pan up it's too big
like you know that's supposed to be
shedding so I go ahead and I like press
it down and it will close but you know
that's putting stress on this hinge and
it's probably going to like snap on me
one fine day but why is that so weird
does anybody have this compact and it
actually worked or is did I buy the
wrong thing actually the back says
illuminating powder foundation compact
this says illuminating powder foundation
refill that's it everyone I hope I have
a lot easier time uploading this video
than the last one I put up because that
was like a whole day of frustration so
maybe that's a little bit of what I'm
thinking out on this video but like I
said some things work some things don't
there's a ton of makeup on the market
it's not all going to work perfectly for
anybody so I'm just sharing my
experiences with you feel free to vent
about your own experiences in the
comment section and I will see you in
the next video
probably in a much more cheerful mood
