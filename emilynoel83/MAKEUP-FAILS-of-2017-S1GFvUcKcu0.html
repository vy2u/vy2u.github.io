tuning in I am shooting this video on my
birthday December 27th so gay so I
really am happy and excited for the day
although I may come across a little bit
down as I talk about some of these
products because when I'm talking about
something that didn't work well for me
I may come off more sassy negative not
in a good mood
I don't know sometimes y'all are
seriously convinced that I'm down in the
dumps when I'm talking about something
that I don't really like that much when
really it's just you know these are the
emotions that come out what I'm talking
about something that I didn't absolutely
love so you'll have that but I know you
guys are always interested when I do my
end-of-the-year round up after I do the
Emily awards you want to know what are
the things that work the worst but we
shouldn't get too serious about this I
mean this is just makeup and these are
just my experiences as always other
people might have different experiences
with these things this year I don't
think I'm gonna rank him like bed to
ultimate worse because as I really
started looking at then sort of the same
idea came to mind is when I was doing
certain categories with the Emily Awards
it's kind of apples and oranges one
thing is bad for this reason the other
thing is bad for this totally different
reason and they're both just bad so
we're gonna go through and discuss and
by the way isn't this shirt so cute my
sister got me this for Christmas and
it's kind of like a sweatshirt actually
like the way the sleeves are in the
bottom it's like a sweatshirt but the
top look how cute I feel so cute today
so this is just the worst stuff over the
past year I'm just looking back the past
year with this and I always worry when I
sit down to do these like if I've
forgotten about some things have there
been some things that I maybe tossed
like just like oh this stinks and got
rid of it and there is a situation where
that happened and I don't have the
product here to show you but in most
cases when I have a hunch that's gonna
be a pretty dang bad product I keep it
stowed away somewhere for a moment like
this so here's one thing okay warmed up
here the IKE a beauty sponges here just
they're blending sponges I Kate house is
a great website to get affordable makeup
I mean I've gotten a lot of great
pallets they have some brands that you
might find in drug stores like Milani
for example and then some things that
are kind of like you're really only
gonna find them there and under there I
Cape UT brand they had these sponges and
these might be the worst blending
sponges I've ever used and obviously
here this one has not been dampened
a long time ago that I was using these
but they don't grow in size they stay
very like rubbery to hard they just are
not an effective blending sponge at all
when you get a good sponge you want it
to be soft you want it to kind of like I
don't know hug the contours of your face
as you press your product and this just
simply does not soften up enough and it
just sort of smears product around
that's what you end up having when the
sponge is too hard so I've got a lovely
2-pack here okay here's an award for the
driest of the dry matte liquid lipstick
that I think I've tried this year and
it's from Bronx colors so this is a
brand that was new to Ulta over the
course of the past year then that lip
tint
I think this shade might be ml to4
although it doesn't have an actual shade
name written on it but it's a very pinky
color and you may have heard me talk
about this in a previous video how this
had a dry down that wasn't just dried
down it like went a little bit beyond
that by actually seeming chalky on the
lips just not pleasant at all and it
didn't change colors it didn't like
darken up and transform into a really
weird shade of some liquid lipsticks do
but so incredibly drying and you know I
don't have the patience for that I don't
want to feel that on my lips all day
just super annoying so that's a big old
dud for me
here's another lip product that I would
totally skip and it's the Burt's Bees
tinted lip oil I've got a couple of
these I think when I ordered them at
first I got two so I got caramel cloud
which this goes on looking like nothing
on my lips and crimson breeze has a
little bit of a reddish tint but it's
legit it's just straight-up oil and I
feel like when we're talking lips it
needs a little something to thicken it
up like there's a reason why I like the
Milani lip oils for example those have
sort of a gel gloss thing going on in
there too so I felt like I was getting
the moisturization but there was a
thickness these are so thin they wear
off the lips so so quickly and the
texture is just so incredibly thin it's
like there's not even much point to
having a tint to these at all because it
just doesn't hang on to the lips
whatsoever there's nothing really
helping this adhere and Burt's Bees has
some tremendous lip balms like really
great just plain lip balms and I love
their lip sticks to their satin
lipsticks are so nice but these just
miss the mark for me oh no Burt's Bees
had another dip this year for me I'm
sorry Burt's Bees like like it's like
you got some good stuff but this flavor
crystals lip balm the tropical pineapple
smells like it'll knock your socks off
with how nice and sweet and fruity the
scent is but it's like why do we need a
flavor crystals gritty litt mom like
it's just grit it's not like this is
enough grit to act as a lip exfoliator
it's just a gritty lip balm why it has
kind of a dryness to it it's like not
nearly the moisturization factor that
you would find in their standard lip
balms I don't know guys it's just those
are the kinds of products that make me
wonder who stood up in the meeting and
said that was a good idea and a bunch of
people agreed and it got made like how
you guys have heard me talk about this
thing before that I just don't really
get this infallible pro glow powder now
I can enjoy the foundation I think
that's a decent foundation I really like
the pro glow concealer but the powder I
think it's important that I point out
that I am not really a fan of the powder
because it's got like half sort of
Sparkle infused
stuff up here and then half like a
different tone of plain powder on the
bottom and I say Sparkle infused because
that's not a highlight it's not like it
doesn't have this pearlescent like Sheen
across it like we're gonna do a split
pan powder and highlight thing it's just
got this weird like glitter Fleck eNOS
that's gonna show up exactly as that
just little flecks of random glitter I
don't get it at all L'Oreal does amazing
things with their True Match pressed
powder I would say just leave it at that
you know maybe give us like a true match
pressed powder illumination you know
when it has just a little less of a
totally matte finish that would be cool
and it says in the finish there are
three finish options denne matte natural
and glow and it identifies this powder
as a glow powder it's not really glow
it's just kind of an odd split pan dual
tone powder with small glitter flecks my
Maybelline master camo face studio in an
apricot for dark circles light to medium
skin tones the problem here is I think
who they're marketing this toward this
for light to medium skin tones is really
really dark bats light to medium skin
tones
'i'm to tan maybe but then they need a
whole other peach shade that's a lot
lighter than this that would cater to my
skin tone because this is way too dark i
find it kind of stiff to blend out it's
not SuperDuper creamy it truly just
shows way too much on my skin and I
don't have like world's lightest skin
either so the people who have a lot
lighter skin than me and they're
thinking okay I'll get the sticker at my
dark circles yep light to medium skin
tones this is flat-out orange if not
University of Texas burnt orange I
really believe they need something
lighter legit what were they thinking
moment with this product the elf
hydrating gel mist a gel to liquid mist
that plumps and hydrates it's one thing
to miss your skin with just a
straight-up liquid because do you know
you get this fine mist it's almost
soothing and relaxing kind of an
experience when you put it on when you
put on this gel I'm just gonna spray my
hand here like it comes out hard I'm not
sure who's using this and thinking oh
that was that was enjoyable doll this
gel just gotta blast it in my face like
remember double dare on Nickelodeon and
people got slimed like that's kind of
what this takes me back to I suppose
like a mist of gel I don't really get it
can we not just moisturize and then we
can use our settings sprays to me it
just feels like this gimmicky reach for
a product that's really not that
pleasant to use at all next I want to
call out a product that just didn't do
what it said it was gonna do and it's
the milk makeup blur spray and this is
something where maybe yeah just to use
it as a little bit of a setting mist at
the end of your look it could perform
fine but they say it's gonna be an
invisible matte makeup setting spray
that provides a soft focus blur effect
the matte part yes I don't think it
really adds any additional glow to my
skin but a soft focus blur effect
through this spray it does not do that
I've looked very closely before and
after multiple times using this spray
and it's not blurring my skin I mean the
things that are blurring my skin might
be the powder I put on the foundation
I'm wearing that day but this mist in
itself is not providing a soft focus
blur effect it's just their blur stick I
think when you use that carefully and
kind of gently apply product on top of
it use it as a primer first when you
don't do too much hard rubbing across
where you've applied the blur stick I
think that can maybe give some soft
focus blur effect but
I think they just slap that name hunting
this spray and it does not do that
really here's an eyeliner that I just
could not make work for me this year
it's the Too Faced I want candy liquid
liner and there were some great parts of
this line for me I actually especially
enjoyed the liquid lipsticks but this
eye liner now this is coming from a
person who's very set in their ways
using a pointed tip eyeliner but this
angled tip here and it's a very stiff
angled tip that's not a brush that's
just a cut edge there and I find it very
very hard to control across my eyes so
I've learned like when I'm looking for
eyeliner what I'm probably gonna like
best is something that has a tip form to
more of a point that's the liner I can
work with the fastest and get the best
line and this is a classic situation
where for some people maybe this just
really worked for you like this made it
easier for you to do liquid liner but
for me who really excels more with the
pointed tip I found it's so tricky to
work with a few brows here the first one
I'll just throw out a mention here and
pop up a picture because I don't have
the product anymore but it was from
covergirl it was called like easy breezy
brow and it's a tinted brow mascara type
gel product with a curved brush okay I
understand sometimes putting a curved
brush in a mascara tube but why on the
brows I don't know it held a lot of
product way way over goop the brows like
hard to control not a good product
design and they need to make it so it
gets way more cleaned off as people take
it out of the tube because it's just too
too much in the brows for probably about
anyone the almay brow pencil I have it
here in brunette and this is an example
of a brow pencil where I think the
design was nice it's kind of a teardrop
shape here so kind of that softened up
triangle look it's really not oversized
it's got the spoolie wand at the other
end so I'm not really hating on it for
designs sake but the formula is far too
soft for me so when I'm getting in there
with my brows it can create kind of a
clumped uneven sort of patchy effect
because it just is so soft so I need
something a lot firmer for my brows if
you like a softer brow pencil this might
be one to look into for you something
that I really wouldn't advise anybody to
go out and grab
is the Loreal brow stylist kabuki
blender we've got a thick pencil here
okay so that's gonna wear down
eventually because there's no real way
to sharpen it and then like the stiff
little brush that you're supposed to use
to I guess assure it on through the
brows I don't know it's way too much
it's way way too much like I don't need
the finest brow pencil in the world
although I'll take it you know I'll take
a brow wiz I'll take a NYX micro brow
and I'll make some slightly thicker
pencils work too like I said the owl
made that was not too thick but
something that resembles a jumbo pencil
that you might use like all over your
eyelids or a jumbo stick for lips like
something that big for brows I really
don't think it's necessary and then this
brush like okay we've already put on a
really thick pencil through our brows
now can we thicken the path even more
with a really dense brush it just
doesn't work for me folks and then the
last thing I'm gonna mention here is the
worst probably yeah I'd say the worst
eyes shadow product that I've tried this
year it's from Jake at beauty and it's
their Beverly Hills 90210 24 eyeshadow
palette I know it sounds like it should
be a winner but this is perhaps one of
the most inconsistent eyeshadow palettes
with some of the most flaky shadows I've
ever seen like you see the shadow just
falling from there it's just it's like
snow I'm dreaming of a wide birthday
chunky with a slight touch even just the
slight touch of a brush I thought like
there's no way I can control this stuff
and then you've got some shapes that
don't behave that way at all that could
be you know fine but the unfortunate
thing is is that the chunky shades are
everywhere there's like one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven at least twelve shades in here
that have that kind of really flaked out
chunkiness and I don't think I've ever
seen
any brand have quite that degree of
chunky flaky just looseness to the
shadow bought it because I thought that
looks like a shade range that would
appeal to me got it home completely
different story once you start touching
it again guys I apologize if I forgot
any bad products that I mentioned over
the course of the past year and they
didn't make it into my little fail box
here but hopefully this gave you more
than enough in terms of warnings of
products that you might want to steer
clear from and if they are working out
for you go.you I hope not everybody
has to get as frustrated as I do over
some of this stuff but thank you guys so
much for your time today watching this
video I hope it was useful and I will
talk to you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
