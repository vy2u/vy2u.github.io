for this video today we're gonna be
really just calling myself out on a lot
of different things that I reach for
repeatedly in my makeup collection and
me you know doing what I do here for a
living having the amount of products
that I have it needs to be switched up
and I'm pretty good about switching it
up in a lot of aspects of makeup I'll
use different foundations all the time
different eyeshadows blushes highlights
lipsticks lip glosses things like that
like I will just go for it and try new
things but then there are these staples
that just keep repeating themselves time
after time and it's like if I don't
reach for it
I get that feeling as though I don't
know I'm a coach and I'm not using my
starting lineup or something or you know
you're really clinging to it when you're
doing special occasion makeup like you
got a big event and then it's like what
things are you gonna reach for oh well
it's gonna be the Laura Mercier powder
or it's gonna be the Milani eyeshadow
primer and I'm not giving other things a
chance a chance to shine
I know decluttering is fun and awesome
and trendy and great and I like it and
I'm not abandoning the concept and I
really want to do it however there's
something that feels very uneducated and
wasteful to me when I look to a certain
element of my makeup collection and I
think I don't know enough about this
stuff that I own that's sitting here
that I in a lot of cases paid for that's
in my drawer I don't know enough about a
lot of that stuff to in an educated way
weed it out and decide what I need you
know and that's a scary and weird and
wasteful feeling so in the new year I
have resolved that I want to use more of
what I have because makeup is not
without an expiration date so you need
to go ahead and use this stuff and then
when I do decide to declutter certain
things I can be like yes you know I gave
that a shot I gave that an honest shot
and now I can say it's time to let it go
or it needs to stay into the everyday
makeup user maybe this is coming across
like well what like who cares you know
it's fine to have that one product that
you love and keep repurchasing and keep
using it over and over
we're all in search of the one whether
it's the one foundation that one
concealer that one eyeshadow primer with
what I do I feel I owe it to you guys to
speak from the most educated stance
can and the best way of educating myself
is just to use what I've got and you
know part of this big collection comes
from trying to buy the newest things and
stay on top of it part of it's a lot of
PR stuff coming in he just got to manage
it and use it so this is a very serious
very on purpose shopping my stash moment
here where I'm not forbidding myself
from using some of these things that
I've loved for years I'm not telling
myself I can't go back to them I'm just
saying let's give those things some
competition let's try some new and let's
just also use what's around I think by
now you get me you get my point you
understand where I'm going okay first
thing Milani eyeshadow primer you know I
love it it works fabulously well I feel
like I can always count on my shadow
look to last when I put this underneath
it and I like the way shadows kind of
cling to it so it's awesome but this is
something that is going to take a little
time out in my collection for a while
and in a lot of cases here I might be
sharing one two three alternatives that
I really want to use and if you've got
suggestions for me beyond what I'm
mentioning let me know but one is the
Marc Jacobs undercover eyeshadow primer
I have this I really want to use it and
from the drugstore the Wet n Wild photo
focus eyeshadow primer why not use them
if they fail me terribly you know at
least I'll know if my last video was any
indication here's another project that I
cling to for dear life my Jordana color
envy waterproof liquid eyeliner to its
credit it is truly waterproof is truly
matte black and it's the best brush and
it's cheap so it's got so many things
going for it but not only do I want to
try other black liners but I really want
to just bust open the doors to the liner
landscape in general and stop using so
much black liquid liner now I have
branched out a little bit with the
L'Oreal super slim that is a black
liquid liner with a felt-tip pen that
works really well it kind of does
compete with my color Envy some I mean
it's not waterproof but it works really
well but just colored liquid liners
different finishes have liquid liners
I've got metallic and glittery things
that I want to be experimenting with and
liner is a fun way to like add color to
your look but in a very like minimal
amount of surface area so it doesn't
have to feel too scary but like today
I'm wearing this Too Faced sketch marker
and deep navy blue you know I know
really branching out from black to navy
blue but rome wasn't built in a day
here's a
one guys for coverage and color
correcting my benefit Boeing brightening
concealer aka erase paste and shade
number two love this nothing is quite
like this there are a lot of things that
come close there are a lot of things
that I would even call really good but
this is special to me and I know it is
because again you think about when
you're sitting down to do special
occasion makeup when you really want to
look your best like what's the first
kind of coverage thing I reach for after
putting my foundation on it's always
this because I know that this totally
takes away the dark circle look I am so
like entrenched in using this product I
don't really own that many different
ones I mean there have been other ones
that I've mentioned liking like the
pixie correction concentrate there's
sort of some correctors in that urban
decay shapeshifter palette but if you've
got any other standalone correctors in a
light peachy tone that you think I
should try let me know one of them
though that I can definitely put my
hands on and that I tried today is the
LA girl Pro conceal the peach corrector
and it felt a little dark going on but
yet it wasn't quite as dark as that
Maybelline one that I complained about
recently in my fails video so I'm gonna
be working this in and trying to
distance myself a bit from the erase
paste even though I know it's awesome
another thing you know my Laura Mercier
powder I feel like I shout this from the
rooftops it's such a special setting
powder it really does well with baking
and just the under eye area plays so
well for me there and I have been trying
to branch out like the Maybelline fit me
powder you know I discovered that as a
result of trying to step away from this
a little bit but I think what gets me
here is that there's still more my loose
powder collection is massive if I ever
have a hope of decluttering that I've
got to try some of this stuff so I know
what I think and so just a couple of
examples here would be the RCM a no
color powder I've got this it's been
sitting around for a long time needs to
get used also my Ben Nye cameo luxury
powder this I used today on my under eye
area and I can look up really freaking
close at it and I feel like I kind of
look like I have special dull skin or
something like that it worked actually
really really well
another hardcore go-to for me is the
Tarte shape tape it works so well the
coverage is amazing I've got
some other pretty full-coverage wand
applicator concealers that I want to put
up against this one of those that I've
had on hand for a while but just haven't
used much as this Bobbi Brown instant
full cover concealer okay I want to go
back to you some NARS radiant creamy
concealer which I for a long time
thought was almost to drying for me but
I want to reappropriation creamy
concealer and I'm still seeing I'm
seeing more under eye circles than I
want to see oh and again it was set with
this the texture of it looks really nice
we'll see how it wears but I could
definitely stand to have a little more
coverage there you know another new
thing that I want to work in is the
makeup revolution conceal and define
full coverage conceal and contour which
seems to have a lot of the same claims
you know as the Tarte shaped eight but
is it as good of coverage with a special
thing about shape tape is that it's
really good coverage and it wears so
well on me so I'm looking for other
things that can potentially do that with
lip products I feel like I'm pretty open
I will bounce around as much as I
possibly can sometimes I get into a
little rut with what I take in my purse
or like the stuff that ends up staying
in your purse you know after you've made
like five trips out and then you realize
oh I'm just kind of every time I'm out
I'm reaching for these one or two
products that always stay in my purse so
that can be a bit of a rut but overall
like I start the day with the best of
intentions with trying different things
most of the time but lip pencils are
kind of a problem and these NYX light on
lip pencils they're great like they're
smooth they're creamy they are even like
if you want to wear one of these and one
of these alone you will have a locked-in
matte lip look with all the precision
because you put it on with the pencil
right like this nude suede shoes shade
is such an essential but I've got other
lip liners that are just kind of busting
out in my collection and I need to use
them one of those is from bite I am so
super familiar with bites lipsticks but
not so much the lip liner and I just
have this one here that's number 36 and
it came in that champagne discovery set
and I'm wearing that today as my base
color actually with a little bit of this
becca gloss on top this rose quartz and
seashell gloss pretty look right I'm
enjoying that and another whole line of
lip liners that I think I'm
really gonna fall into and love are the
l'oreal colour riche matte lip liners
this shade called mastermind is a really
nice basic but I've got a lot of others
that I haven't even tapped into yet last
little thing here I bounced around
mascara wise more than a lot of people
even realize like I sing the praises of
lash paradise and I use it a ton I mean
that's really a go-to but I'm trying
different ones more than I even discuss
and something that I really want to
resolve to do is use my Estee Lauder
little black primer with a lot more
mascaras because sometimes I forget
about this and this is absolutely
transformative under so many different
mascaras like I'm wearing it today with
my essence lash princess the purple one
the sculpted Volume one which was good
but not great for me on its own paired
with the little black primer my lashes
are a lot thicker and longer and you
know I'm not wearing falsies today so I
just kind of want to experiment with
this with a lot of different mascaras
that have been ho-hum for me and just
see how they work now yeah guys that's
my very specific very pinpointed sort of
makeup resolutions shot my stash type
video less talk more action you know you
just just a matter of doing it it's
sitting down and every time you put a
product on you're making a decision and
so with my collection having the things
that I have I want to be able to open a
drawer and say yes I know all about
these different things instead of I know
a lot about a good chunk of them but
there's still some mystery I don't want
any mysteries in my stash anymore and I
want to know that when I start my
decluttering I can do it from a very
educated like well-rounded mindset so I
hope you enjoyed this video guys the
sister to this video will be coming up
pretty soon I think and it's gonna be
more about palettes and it's gonna be
like all these palettes that I have that
I haven't really bonded with yet that I
really want to just take under my wing
and use because I'm excited about them
and I think they look great but for
whatever reason they just haven't been
getting used so thank you guys again for
watching and I will see you again very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
