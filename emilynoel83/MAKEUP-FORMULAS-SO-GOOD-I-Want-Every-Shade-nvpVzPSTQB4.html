you so much for being here this video
idea not something I've seen done before
on YouTube not something I've done on my
channel yet but it's kind of playing
into that idea of when you really really
like something you want one in every
color kind of like with clothing you
know you find that t-shirt it's the
perfect fit and then you want to go out
and buy all the other colors that it's
available in I'm kind of that way with
makeup products sometimes when I find a
formula that I love so so much it makes
me want to try more and more from that
certain line so I thought it might be
fun to focus in on some things recently
where I have just gotten a couple and
I'm really hooked you know I really want
to try more and guys I am really making
it my mission to come up with different
kinds of video ideas things that I just
haven't seen over and over again on
YouTube I'm really trying to spend a lot
of time brainstorming new ideas just
trying to keep things fresh and
interesting here so if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and I
would love to have you as a subscriber
if you haven't subscribed already so a
lot of times with videos there's a
certain product there's a certain thing
that like propels the whole idea forward
and for this it is the maybelline
superstay matte ink these are the two
shades that I have in this product and I
totally would love to have more because
I think this is an awesome awesome
formula it's giving me like that liquid
lipstick idea in the sense that you're
going to apply it with the wand it's
super full coverage full color all over
the lips but it's very thin and you
don't feel that heaviness that a lot of
liquid lipsticks tend to have I don't
feel as though a separate layer is kind
of cracking and separating off from my
lips as the day goes on and the staying
power with these I've heard other people
say it too it's really really good like
I'll get to the tail end of the day and
I'm having to use some sort of an oil
based remover to just get this stuff
totally off my lips that's not to say it
couldn't fade a little bit you know it
might stay a little from the center of
my lips or whatever but not much I mean
this stuff is really kind of in it for
the long haul and it does have a matte
finish but it's comfortable and I would
say it's not maybe as comfortable and
like cushiony feeling as those bare
minerals Jen nude liquid lipsticks but
you're also giving up something there
because the staying power like you
wouldn't be able to kiss your baby on
the cheek and
it doesn't come off on them because it
will transfer off just a little bit
these don't transfer off at all they're
very true to color I haven't noticed
either these shades like getting deeper
as I wear them and that's a huge problem
for me with liquid lipsticks I hate when
I put something on it looks one way in
the tube and then like 15 minutes later
I look at my lips and it's darkened like
five or six shades so these seem to be
like exactly what you see is what you
get they last all day they don't feel
uncomfortable you might feel the tiniest
bit of tackiness after you put one of
these on it is certainly the kind of
thing where I could pick up and like
reach for about any other shade that
they have available and I would be happy
with them at Pioneer which is this
beautiful red and then lover is this
very wearable the kind of Mavi pink
shade I think this is a great everyday
color so I love you so much another
thing lip product was that I absolutely
adore and you guys have heard me talk
about these before but they're the
Revlon Ultra HD lip colors these truly
feel like lip balms they're a great
throw in your purse type product or a
smaller slim design lipstick and I love
that because it's so easy to just put
them exactly where you want them to be
but they're so smooth they're so
comfortable and I certainly wouldn't
mind having some more shades but this HD
sand is what I'm wearing in this video I
think it's the perfect wonderful news
there's HD sand there's HD desert which
is a little bit like deeper and rosier
and then that's HD Vineyard which is
like a nice soft wearable berry type
shade so those might be my three like
most frequently worn most easy to wear
type shades but they have some really
fun colors as sort of a violet shade
that's really pretty also and there are
others that I know they have that I
don't have but I would like to have and
this is something I've talked about
liking recently also these new
Maybelline fit me blushes well they've
made fit me blushes for a while but I
feel like what they put out here in this
kind of format where there's no brush
included it's just the product I feel
like these are better quality better
pigmentation and I love the shade called
nude I'm wearing nude today I also
absolutely adore the color called wine
and I've referred to this as like Snow
White's blush it's just the most
beautiful rosy it makes me think of like
when belton playing outside it's really
hot she got those she's all sweaty and
hot nerd cheeks are so rosy make me
think of
color her cheeks turn so those are two
like home run and then I went and I got
the color called plum and this is like
this dusty kind of soft matte shade nude
by the way has just a little bit of
Sheen to it mine is just a very soft
satiny finish but plum seems to be met
and this one kind of disappointed me I
don't feel like it shows up as well on
my skin and it seems more like the way
these blushes used to be so because I'm
weird and I kind of love trial and error
I still like want to try more from this
line now that I feel like I've landed on
maybe a little bit of a dud it's like I
want to try more so I can tell you guys
which ones are good and bad so in a
weird way that one shade that I wasn't
messing about got me kind of intrigued
so I do still like try more of these
blushes I suspect many other shades
would still be good but I absolutely do
love nude and wine and talking about so
much drugstore stuff in this video but
this is just a lot of what comes to mind
when I think of the collect Amal
mentality you know but another thing
that I think is great and would be so
much fun to have in the different shades
they produce are these Milani everyday
eyes palette these are really amazing
quality and they got some definite
praise in my Emily award series but I
really love the way these are put
together they give you a nice mix of
matte and shimmer of dark and light so
it's a versatile yet small palette and I
think that makes it very user friendly
very non intimidating and the quality of
it the formula they've got going on in
here is what really makes me want to try
more and more so I love this one called
earthy element that's totally wonderful
for those of us who like the warm I love
the one that I think no one can go wrong
what is the must-have Naturals and this
has your matte black your taupe just
such a basic easy palette to work with
and then the other one that I have here
is called smoky essentials this has a
nice little pop of blue some sort of
greyish charcoal shades so I think
that's stunning as well but I know they
have more I think there's a plummy one
they have a more colorful palette I wish
my local drugstore carried like the full
gamut of all of these on the high-end
side of things maybe a little bit
wishful thinking here like oh wouldn't
it be nice to own every single busy art
now but truly I love the quality of
these shadows so much they are above
beyond they are so consistent I love the
different color schemes that they place
into each of their pallets and I feel
like every time I get one of their
pallets I see it online and I think it
looks prettier I researched some
swatches and I think yeah you know that
looks really good but I get it home and
I'm always even more impressed like I'm
always even more blown away by the way
just the palette looks and swatches look
and the way they apply is like a whole
other story to talk about some of the
ones I've been playing with the most
lately I love my amethyst but just the
best purple palette hands-down of any
purple eyeshadow palette there could be
I also love this other recent release
which is the nuance palette and that's
very like rose gold you can layer
different shades and get the most
beautiful rose gold effect even though
you don't edit glance see this and think
rose gold and then I've been using my
Paris nude palette a lot lately just for
quick and easy look some of these colors
show up on the eyes with so much more
depth than they might even appear to
have and I just love the little
surprises like that so yeah if somebody
dumped every visi art palette in my lap
I would be in heaven I own a lot of
palettes actually I was looking through
my collection I'm like dang I have
accumulated a lot but I think regardless
of the color scheme doesn't matter if
it's matter shimmer if you handed me any
of their palettes I'm confident that
they would be really good and I would be
happy to own them all also any kind of
stick from milk makeup I'm getting very
very interested in this line and the
ones that I have like I've talked about
the mini blur stick and the mini cooling
water actually in my last video I think
these are really cool products and in
the full-size actually they're in my
downstairs bathroom right now but the
matcha toner and the hydrating oil stick
I've been using like every single night
before bed and I'm loving those too so
recently I was actually perusing the
Sephora website thinking oh what about
their highlighter sticks is there
anything else that they make it a stick
form that I need to get my hands on
right now well they're not all the same
formula obviously they're making
different sticks with different purposes
some are highlights some are you know
like primer type products they all kind
of have their own formula and their own
thing but I'm loving the convenience
factor and the ease of all this kind of
stuff and I would definitely like to try
more of what they make in stick they
coming back to another
drugstore item here the silk Kissimmee
liners from L'Oreal these are some of
the softest like most glide on type
liners you can find I don't feel like
these have the most incredible staying
power for me but when I use them I tend
to use them for a very specific reason
I'll put them in my waterline and a lot
of times like on my lower lashline and
then layer a powder shadow on top like
that's exactly what I've done today and
I love the way these work like that I
think of these almost is creamy shadow
sticks but in a perfectly easy to
control small pencil size you know not
really sure what other colorful shades
are out there but I would love to try
them they are the kind of liners you're
going to sharpen but like I said when
you layer a powder over the top of these
the staying power really is quite good
and you can just ants up the look of
those shadows that you pair with them so
guys I think that's all I've got for now
that's all the things I could think of
in terms of I don't know new ish stuff
that I've been trying loving and would
just love to have in every shade
collectible yes that's what I'm talking
about I would love to hear in the
comments section what products you feel
that way about and I will see you very
soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
