headband today because I just felt like
it I actually kind of forgot I hadn't
had it tucked here underneath my desk
but we are here today to talk about
makeup geek and this is a brand that for
me I feel like it's fallen off the radar
a little bit I just haven't been really
good about keeping on top of the new
launches and whatever's been going on
but I asked a question recently on
Twitter I said what a beauty youtuber
created products are you interested in
seeing me try and someone said you know
I haven't heard a lot about makeup geek
lately and so I went on her website and
I picked up some things now I'd heard
rumblings that makeup geek was coming to
Target but I didn't know that that was
happening anytime soon then I came
across a tweet from Marlena saying that
makeup geek was gonna be in Target
stores in ten days but if you want to
get a jumpstart on things she had a link
and so went to the link and realized oh
my gosh it's already happening there's a
selection of makeup geek products at
Target which is I think huge for this
brand to be able to have that kind of
exposure you know and by the way I have
a really painful canker sore on the left
side of my tongue so there's really just
a small issue selection I would say of
her products available there there are
bronzers highlighters couple of
eyeshadow quads and a couple kinds of
lip products so I just sort of sampled
that and then I also have the things
that I got off of her website as well
but I want to put the main like Tryon
focus in this video on the things that I
got from Target because this is me kind
of like rediscovering makeup geek here
and maybe exposing it to some of you who
haven't really tried the brand too much
so what's on my face now is foundation
concealer and powder I also have my
brows done so I can jump right in with
the next logical product that I might
use and that is bronzer and I mentioned
this product actually I think it was in
my last video the medium skin bronzer in
tawny this is available at Target and I
am so into this bronzer it's so good
it's a really great depth a great tone
and so nicely pigmented as well the
compacts are really nice also you've got
that mirror there a nice almost gunmetal
look to the top of the packaging maybe
my memories failing me here but I felt
like when makeup geek first
like the products were a little bit more
in the low-cost price range and as I'm
looking through the cost of everything
at Target you know the eyeshadow quad is
gonna be $21 about $19 for the highlight
$21 for the bronzer and the lip products
like $13.99 and 1199 I don't have a
problem with it really because I feel
like maybe that's what's necessary to
create better formulas and make
improvements and I don't know do
whatever you have to do but I think
that's just something to be aware of
going in like just because you're buying
this stuff at Target it's not gonna be
like a $7.99 bronzer just so you know
but I'm going to apply this bronzer I'm
using my ELF complexion brush which I
love for bronzers and you'll see you
really don't have to work hard with this
thing it's deep enough to show you don't
find yourself building and building and
building but yet the tone seems very
natural for me and my skin tone I have
truly not stopped using this bronzer
since I got it which i think is saying
something because I got a drawer full of
bronzers but there's something I think
just really special about that tone I
love it it's like a soft cheek contour
and then sometimes with bronzers I'll
just like lightly pick it up on the
brush and then dust it you know where
the Sun is actually going to hit like
tops of the cheeks across the nose it
can be used both as a classic bronzer or
to contour with in my opinion now I'm
going to need to cut to something that I
got from the actual makeup geek website
this is not available in Target but I
have tried some makeup geek blushes
that's probably the thing from her brand
that's worked his way into my makeup
routine most often here and there but I
saw that she has this flawlessly ever
after
bronze bareness face palette so there is
a bronzer in here also a couple of
blushes and a highlighter and I think
I'll just use this blush today I was
playing with it the other day and I was
like wow that shows up more on my cheeks
more like kind of pinky rose on my
cheeks than I would have expected
you know it's a soft blush it's matte
but it's definitely there I think this
is the shade called French kiss
now just a little bronzer comparison
here this is the bronzer in the compact
and this is the tawny bronzer that I got
from Target and at least in person the
tawny bronzer appears a lot more golden
and lighter than this one but let me
also swatch the face products here
there's a highlight that kind of is
golden there's a Coralie blush and then
this cooler like light dusty mauve blush
that I just used so those are the other
three elements there in that compact it
seems like a nice compact but I just
haven't played with it as much as my
stuff that I got from Target so far now
the next thing that I got this was from
Target it's the highlighter and I have
it in the color called starlight and
from what I can tell this particular
highlight on its own is not available on
makeup geeks website but I think it was
part of the kathleenlights highlighter
palette that came out with makeup geek a
while back and this is absolutely
stunning you glanced at it and you kind
of think what am I gonna expect to see
on my cheeks out of that like I do see
maybe a little bit of a rosy tone but it
has the potential to just be super
reflective but I love how fine it is how
smooth the powder is it's not chunky at
all there's no pieces no texture of
shimmer in this thing it just gives that
nice a really smooth glow and it doesn't
take a lot of product to get there so
I'm gonna use this little $1 brush that
I got from shop misae and on Zab a
little bit on my brush here tap off the
excess and I just kind of like to sweep
it down toward the top of the cheek and
back I just think it's so darn beautiful
quality wise on this I mean it feels
like it's right up there with my Becca
powder highlights honestly I'm not sure
what tone this would be equivalent to
because it seems a little lighter and
brighter than opal but at the same time
at a glance I kind of think opal when I
look at it in the compact
I just adore that luminosity there I
think that is so so beautiful on the
cheeks and I could see anybody you know
getting an effect out of that for sure
next product that I turned up on the
target website from makeup geek is the
eyeshadow palette looks like they have
two options there's wish and dream
I got wish and what we have here is kind
of like a cardboard style packaging this
is gonna be 21 99 by the way and the
shapes in here are I'm peach las'
roulette Coco bear and dark roast and I
seem to remember some of these names as
being like original singles that have
been part of the makeup geek line but I
thought this would just be fun to try
we've got a couple of shimmery shades a
couple of mattes some nice richness
going on here so I think it gives us the
potential to have a really nice natural
look or something really dark and smoky
so I've already got my eye primer on and
I think I'm going to start with this
shade right here called cocoa bears so
we've got a warm deep brown I'd call it
and this is my insta pop shade brush
from Real Techniques and I'm just gonna
add that color in right here in the
outer corner if you saw my video on
multitasking brushes you know what's
going on here but I'm taking that little
wedge shape and I'm sticking that right
there in my crease and just using that
to pull the color around and just shape
it exactly how I want it coming out of
the crease
and I am remembering now how great it is
to work with makeup geek eyeshadows
because they just they're so soft
they're richly pigmented it doesn't take
a lot of product and all I'm doing here
is taking this bear brush and kind of
going over the edge a little bit there
and then I think I'll also use that just
to grab some of that shade which is
called I'm peach las' and take it up
under the brow and this color I realized
the other day when I was playing with
this I love this I'm peach lashade going
around the inner corner it is a gorgeous
inner corner highlight it might be just
coming across as beige here in the
palette but it's like a soft gold but I
swear maybe there's just a teeny bit of
pink in there as well with the
reflectivity of the shimmer so I'm gonna
pick some of that up on my insta pop
crease brush here the smaller of the two
that come in that duo the larger one was
what I used in the crease and I'm just
dabbing this shade around the inner
corner look how pretty that is like it's
not your classic just white or champagne
color as in terms of being an inner
corner highlight it just glows
nonetheless
so what I'm doing here is just kind of
bringing that shade up on to my lid and
then this color here looks like a lot of
fun this is called roulette
it's a really beautiful like metallic
rust color and I'm just getting that all
over the lid
feel like if you're one who's kind of
into a peachy I look like this comes off
as a rich peach now I'm gonna play with
this deepest Brown which is right over
here it's matte and it's called dark
roast and just with a flat brush I'm
going to add this in on my outer corner
and that color just really meshes in
seamlessly with that warmer brown if
you're hearing noises downstairs that's
just Eve waking up at like 6 o'clock
this morning so Bub's gotta watch her
she's really tuning up now so I guess
there's no hope before going to bed what
should we do here on the lower lashline
I feel like I kind of want to keep that
a little bit soft today I'm gonna take
some of the darkest color and I'm using
an e 21 smudge brush here and I'm just
getting myself a little bit of that
color on the outer maybe third of my
lower lash line
and I'm just popping in my wet and wild
ultimate brow highlight there in my
lower inner rim and then I'm just gonna
curl lashes and apply some super sizer
mascara I'm just gonna keep it a light
look lash wise today I want to give my
eye it's a little break from the falsies
here's my finished look just kind of
soft and natural but still fun I really
am satisfied with the eye palette I feel
like every shade in there is beautiful
it works well it does what you think
it's gonna do I think a person who's
never tried makeup geek before and then
just as exploring this Branden target
might try something like this and be
completely thrilled I also do kind of
feel obligated to come at this review
that's someone who indeed does own a lot
of eyeshadows and palettes and if you're
also in that boat and you have a lot of
neutral palettes these might be shades
that you're already working with
somewhere there's just a lot of
different ways of looking at it and you
kind of have to make that call for
yourself either you see the value and
having a quad and you like the
simplicity and the size and just the
lack of decisions to have to make
compared to a larger palette or you
think I've just got these colors
floating around everywhere I don't need
that but if you are just questioning is
it good quality yes I think it
definitely is now the last two things
that I got from the target website are
these lip colors I got a plush cream and
then I got a cream stain so the
difference in these two is in the
texture because I think the appearance
what comes off just to look at it from
the outside looking in they would appear
to both be matte lip colors this one
just ends up maintaining sort of a
smoothness on the lips like a creaminess
when you press your lips together and
this one kind of has more of that matte
dry down so I'm gonna try on the plush
cream for you I got this in the shade
BFF and I thought it'd just be this nice
kind of nudie pinky nude type color and
I'll put it on for you and we can chat
about it it's an unusual texture and
that it feels like kind of dry and
obviously matte going on that yeah it
does maintain this creaminess that never
really you know fully dries down for me
this color is really really light and it
was kind of lighter than I was expecting
it to come off like it's almost erasing
my lips but maybe adding in a hint of
pink for me to really like this color
I would
layer up some sort of maybe slightly
deeper gloss or maybe a little bit of a
lip liner on top of it that could kind
of give this look a little more
definition and a little more contrast
with the rest of my face but it is a
really interesting texture in that it
does have this matte appearance but yet
it feels nice and creamy and it does
stay feeling that way it's sort of an
intriguing lip product and intriguing
formula to me and it's something that
maybe in a deeper color I might really
enjoy if I've said it once I've said it
20 times I'm really into glosses these
days but I'm trying to think about these
products just for what they are for what
their goal is and how well are they
achieving it and I must say the cream
stain I think is really really good I
have the color called tango I think it's
an awesome color as you'll see it go on
it's very full colored and it's thin on
the lips it doesn't provide a lot of
weight and it's that stay in place matte
color so I'm going to go ahead and put
it on here
what's really interesting to me is that
it goes on seeming more liquidy than the
last one
but this is going to be the thing that
sets and dries down
I could get quite a bit off of just one
you know time pulling the applicator out
but I think I need a little more
but is this not just the perfect summer
statement type lip I mean its bold its
bright if I am gonna wear a bright bold
color though in terms of do I like it
creamy do I like it and that I would go
more toward wanting matte if it's gonna
be really bright or also really dark
because I trust it more to hang on to my
lips and this is the kind of product
that's gonna do that it's not gonna be
quick to transfer off I mean you can
kind of pull a little color away from
your lips if you're really trying but
there's definitely a nice thinness to
the product I felt like I wasn't having
to build it up to reach this color by
any means on my lips it was very
pigmented with just a thin amount and
then it ends up just not feeling like
much on the lips and so I do like that
liquid lipsticks done right can be fine
for me there's just so many that I think
have kind of gotten it wrong in terms of
being too thick too sticky to whatever
and this is really really good in that
respect now you might be saying well
what else did you end up with off of the
actual makeup geek website well I did
get a few more lip products I got the
cream stain and bunny hop which I
noticed was not available on targets
website so just FYI you know it's not
only just certain products from the
makeup geek line but maybe just certain
selections of shades from those things
also but just like this is very what you
see is what you get in the tube on your
lips this one is very hot pink I'm glad
I have a couple of those because I think
that's a nice formula to have in your
bold statement colors I also tried one
of the iconic lipsticks love that it's
in a slim tube and I got the color
called shy and this is gorgeous this is
a fantastic formula there's a nice bit
of thickness to it there's definitely
some shine it's like an ideal rich
pigmented cream lipstick I would say
there's a little more thickness to this
unlike a classic Revlon Super Lustrous
cream lipstick you know as it goes
across the lips a little bit of cling
but it's so comfortable and I feel like
that color is just so so perfect so I'm
very happy with the lipstick and then I
also got one of the foiled lip glosses
in the shade VIP and this is a really
really light shimmery color I knew that
going in and I thought this can be a lip
topper this can be I don't know
something to just really have fun and
ants form different looks and it reminds
me so much of a classic gloss that I
used way way in the start of my channel
from Jordana called lovely if you've
been with me for the longest time ever
you know what I'm talking about there I
love that gloss this is kind of like
Jordana lovely all over again it was
very metallic highly reflective but when
it wasn't in direct light it looks like
kind of a deep rose gold I'm thinking
about actually just I don't know
was this a mistake should I have even
messed with this color and I'm putting a
little bit of this here and then I think
I'm gonna just dab it in we'll see
no that's kind of cool if you just tap
it in you know you give anything a
little extra dimension you know it
doesn't look quite so flat although I
think the flat matte look in a bright
color like that is really beautiful too
but I'm excited guys this whole
situation has definitely reinvigorated
my love for makeup geek if I were to
pick like just a top two products it
would be the highlighter and the bronzer
like these were next-level good I feel
like that highlight was just absolutely
stunning on the cheeks and the bronzer
maybe it's just this time of year maybe
it's my skin tone right now I'm not sure
but it seems so perfect so exactly right
for me so I really enjoyed the textures
and just the look of those the staying
power of them is also really good and
close behind that would be the tango
cream stain I love this color right now
not saying I don't like the eyeshadows
it is what it is it's a basic eye
palette and some of y'all are gonna feel
like I'm loaded with that and others
might think that's the simplicity that
I'm looking for so it is quality wise a
great quad and a well selected grouping
of shades because it lets you go deep
enough you know what I mean if you don't
have a deep enough shade in there you
can end up with kind of a murky mess but
you have not one but two kind of deeper
tones to play with alongside the
shimmery shades this larger palette that
I got off of the makeup geek website I
think is gonna require maybe a little
more experimentation for me because I
have a play with that bronzer a whole
lot but the blushes are pretty and I do
like the highlight although I don't love
the tone of this as much as that single
and lip color wise outside of the Tango
cream stain I really think the lipstick
is absolutely beautiful from her line
did not love the plush cream mainly for
the color but I think it is a texture I
might look into and try something else
from pick it up at Target because hey
it's convenient like that now but thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video hope it gave you a
little insight on what's available now
in Target stores from makeup geek if
you're not seeing it in your local
Target store you can access it through
target's website now which is really
cool so thank you guys so much for your
time and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
