always today's video topic is kind of
fun it's talking about some of these
sort of unusual you might even say
gimmicky makeup products yeah the way I
look at it is this like they're things
that my initial reaction toward them was
sort of like is that really necessary
you know if somebody just going out on a
limb trying to create like one more
thing that they think we need makeup
wise you know and when I have that kind
of feeling it makes me think maybe it's
kind of a gimmick or unnecessary type
item but in this video these are five
things that really turned out to
surprise me things that I really enjoy
and I've always thought that the
situations where I end up having
unexpected results are the situations
where it's really important to do the
video because the products just might
not be exactly what people assume them
to be oh and before I get started can I
just say I am fully committing to this
whole wearing less black liquid liner
and so today I'm like I'm gonna do green
I'm gonna do this nice forest green and
this is the Too Faced sketch marker in
smokey emerald well it's real smokey
guys it's like a barely they're green
it's like a green black I tried I
thought this was gonna be a lot more
green I thought it was really gonna look
like the outside packaging of the pen
right not so much but that's okay I'm
gonna jump in with the first product
here and it is from Real Techniques and
it's their expert air cushion sponge it
says this is designed for buildable
airbrushed coverage gently tap on
cushion makeup until blended and I just
recently saw this come out I actually
bought it around the same time I got the
set of like Real Techniques skin care
related brushes and I thought that was
odd because I feel like cushion
foundations were having their craze like
about a year or so ago but I don't know
maybe they were just giving everybody a
chance to get their cushion foundations
and now here's the best way to apply
them so it's got a little handle it
looks sort of like a UFO or something
and it's really soft and definitely
squishy they do call it an expert air
cushion sponge you're supposed to use it
dry and it doesn't have this feeling of
a lot of density in there I can't quite
tell if it's totally hollow or not or
maybe there's just a small hollow space
in there somewhere but I've been trying
this out with various um
cushion foundations that I have I've got
the L'Oreal Lumi one the Maybelline one
and also the most recent one I've
purchased is the mega cushion SPF 15
foundation from wet and wild by the way
I am cream ivory in this and just for a
little demo here I thought I'd show it
going on like you dab into your
foundation with this and then I just
kind of do a sort of blotting method
across my face and if you want more
coverage you just dab into it like a few
more times and you'll just pick up more
and it might be like the size the
surface area of this I feel like I end
up with really even coverage on my skin
I'll be it light to medium coverage
because cushion makeup is just sort of
that way you know it's a very
lightweight liquidy not super high
coverage thing but the evenness of the
application on your skin is still really
important with stuff like that and while
I think other sponges can do a good job
or even brushes can do a good job this
seems to give me like the surface area
here something about that seems to give
really even coverage and it can build up
even more coverage I think more
effectively than anything else like I
said to do that you just kind of dip dip
dip instead of just doing one quick dab
and I don't feel like the sponge is
actually absorbing much product because
even when I only pick up a little bit I
feel like it is remaining on my skin and
able to be all like nicely blended out
so I think this is a neat tool and it's
kind of changed the way I feel about
some of my cushion makeup and I've
realized it can be actually quite a bit
better coverage than I first thought
okay here's another thing that kind of
feels a little gimmicky to me but I
don't know it's just a new texture you
know Physicians Formula is really going
there with their butter concept and now
they've got butter highlighters and they
are downright like oops they are really
really creamy like that's not just a
stamped in texture that you're seeing
although you know it is stamped in but
when you touch it it's like it moves
around there's a thickness and an actual
creaminess to this and I remember
thinking when I first got it is that
just too goopy to work like is are they
just trying to create something that's
fun to touch and feel but is that really
going to perform on the skin but I got
to say this pink shade not have all the
shades they were sent to me and there's
something special about this pink I take
this on my finger and I
just kind of grazed the skin like put
absolutely zero pressure you don't feel
like you're pressing into your skin but
just give it the lightest amount of
pressure right on top of where I would
do blush and I think it is so so pretty
I love it I love that effect
it's a blush topper kind of coming to
realize that it's not always my best
look to have a ton of highlight like
right up in this particular zone but it
can actually be super flattering right
on the apple of the cheek it gives that
look of fullness and just natural glow
like that's where the lights hitting you
it's a pretty gleam on the skin so I
actually really really like this
particularly the pink shades it's like a
radiance booster it's like you got these
dry dull winter days and you're getting
up feeling and looking kind of blah but
then you put this on even on top of your
blush which your blush is already doing
good things for you by giving some color
and pigment to the skin but you topped
with this it's really extra beautiful
here's another cool thing that I ordered
a long time ago and it just kind of sat
around I don't know why I just wasn't
compelled to use it until just the last
couple of weeks but it's from Sephora
and it's their perfection mist nude glow
and it says Universal here on the back
so just a little can it's two fluid
ounces and it is just it's a spray you
spray your face with this and it's odd
because you don't really feel moist
earth away we're used to feeling it from
different setting miss you know I feel
like I have a cloud now in front of me
between me and my camera lens here but
you know how you get that feeling of
immediate moisture from a setting spray
this doesn't give you that this is
actually giving you like a glow to the
skin I just put some freshly applied
there on my hand and it's like there's
no detectable shimmer but it's immediate
glow yet without feeling wet or sticky
it's so strange the description of it
says an illuminating spray with a
translucent base and subtle rose gold
colored micro pearls
it says creates a natural Sparkle free
dewy sheen on the skin that's exactly
what it is no sparkle no real moisture
yet somehow magically there's a dewy
sheen on your skin it's really
now I've just noticed that they have the
airbrush foundation and they also seem
to have this formula in a blush so that
would be possibly another way to
experience this and I am intrigued
I am freaking I'm here for that next
thing that I have to chat about is a
four in one eye transforming brush this
comes to us from it cosmetics and how
are they making this foreign one well
there's a little thing that's happening
here on the one end first off the other
side is just a liner okay so it's a
stiff liner brush this works nice and
the brows by the way and I used it in my
brows today I used it also for a little
bit of like lower lash line just a light
bit of shadow there on the other end
here's what's happening there are three
little marks one says all over so you've
got this full brush here that you could
use like up under the brow just to get
shadow all over your lid or even into
your crease and you move this little guy
upward just this little rod here and
then it says crease so you've just got
this little like almost brush guard type
thing that's just holding those bristles
together and basically creating a
different shaped brush for you suddenly
it's less fluffy and more densely packed
and so for crease you know it does work
that way it does give you a very soft
amount of color in the crease and then
you click it up one more time and it
says smudge so now you've basically
lessened the mobility of those bristles
even more to where it can go smudging on
your lower lashline or maybe really
being a bit more defined in your crease
area before I ever used it I thought do
we really need this is it really making
life easier is this just some fun idea
somebody came up with but it really does
work and I'm gonna show you that and
using this new wet and wild quad that I
got they've redone walking on eggshells
they've redone their whole shadow
formula and if you want more on that in
a video I know that's not the newest
news because it's been out for a little
while but I just now found it so I'm
doing this demo with that and I actually
used the brush in its fullest state with
the transition color right up top got
that going in the crease and then I made
my brush a little smaller to the actual
crease size and used the deeper shade in
the quad and just got that going in my
outer corner a little bit i fluffed the
brush out again i used a little bit of
the eyelid shade just kind of dabbing
that on my lid and then I went to the
brushes smallest size and I used the
darkest shade sort of lightly smudged on
my lower lash line you can also use that
to get right in your outer corner of
your crease pretty easily too and then
like I said the liner side are you
setting my brows beforehand and also
afterward just kind of like smudging
some shadow right in there with the wing
so an unusual concept but it definitely
is like a minimalist I brush idea it's
effectively doing a lot of things in one
my caution I guess would be to those who
have really small eyes and you tend to
feel a little out of control with larger
eye brushes because I feel like this
whole end of the brush overall airs on
the side of being a little bit large
even though you are making it smaller
it truly is working for my eyes but I
could see that being a little out of
control and perhaps a little muddy for
people with very small eyes but if
simplification is a priority lessening
the amount of brushes you're carrying
with you or just the brushes you own
this might be something to look for I
don't think I want to mention here is
the blotter Otzi from Beauty Blender
this has been out for quite some time
and I only recently decided to actually
try it and the thought here is that you
can literally like blot your skin when
you're getting shiny and they're giving
you like Beauty Blender material but in
this little thin sponge and the compact
here is such that it contains another
one under this query sheet and also a
mirror so you could pop this in your
purse and take it on the go perhaps the
best and most genius function for this
is something makeup by Tiffany D
mentioned and it's using it to kind of
like rehydrate your skin actually like
as you see yourself getting a little bit
dry or something that's a little crusty
there on the under eye area she had
mentioned I think it was quite a long
time ago like misting this with a little
bit of a facial spray and then dabbing
it right on the very areas where you
feel like you look dry or a little cakey
and it almost like refreshes your makeup
practically redistributes the product a
little bit but in a very fresh and even
way cuz you're patting it on with this
nice sponge now my makeup has just been
applied recently so I'm not in dire need
of this tip right now but you know by
3:00 4:00 in the afternoon if I was
wanting to you know refresh my look and
maybe go somewhere do
thing without totally redoing my
foundation or my concealer and stuff it
really does work it's a fantastic trick
so guys that concludes my roundup of
things that may potentially be seen as a
little bit gimmicky but I actually
really like them and I found them to be
very useful I would love to know what
other products are out there that you
feel this way about so let me know in
the comments section and thank you as
always so much for your time I really
appreciate you tuning in for these
videos and I will see you again next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
