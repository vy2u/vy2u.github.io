me for this video um I was gonna do
something super cute with my hair today
but instead I went for the shortest
ponytail ever because I just kind of ran
out of time before I'm sitting down to
shoot this but I have been running into
some products lately that have kind of
surprised me things that surprised me in
a good way so that's always nice right
it's not like I've got a bad attitude
about everything I purchase and I think
oh this is gonna fail this is gonna fail
but I think there are some things that
just maybe for the price or just for
what your general preferences are there
are some things that just surprise you
they just outperform you know your
expectations so that's what I want to
talk about in this video some of these
things could sort of be thought of as a
best in beauty maybe for December but I
feel like I've just favorited myself out
with the Emily awards on this past month
in December so I really wasn't intending
to do any monthly like best and beauty
wrap up on that month but these are some
things that I have been enjoying and
I've just gotta been surprised that I
have the first thing I'll mention is
this foundation from Maybelline and it's
the dream velvet and I have had this on
hand for a while and I remember using it
initially not really falling in love
with it and I think it may have been
because of my application when I first
got this I think I was applying it with
a brush and I've just learned that this
foundation apply with the Beauty Blender
it's kind of a similar effect to what
I'm getting with the dream matte mousse
in the little tub that application
method really makes a difference because
this is kind of like a thicker feeling
foundation they call it a soft matte
hydrating foundation and it does feel
kind of like a whipped mousse like
consistency but not in a very dry way
it's kind of like a thicker mousse it's
what I expected that elf foundation to
be like that I had tried in a couple
videos ago and the coverage is really
really good but I think I was getting a
heavier look out of it when I just
blended it out with a brush and when I
just bounce this in with a Beauty
Blender type sponge you know whatever
kind of sponge you like to use I've used
several different kinds with it it
really has such a pretty finish on my
skin I'm wearing it today and I'm just
like yeah you know the coverage is
really impress
is kind of one of those foundations
that's come back from the dead in my
collection you know I've started using
it more you try a different method
you're like yes you know that was the
key for that okay I had a pleasant
little surprise from BH Cosmetics I
placed an order I think it was a cyber
monday deal so I got this thing like so
so cheap I want to say it was maybe ten
dollars or less than ten dollars that I
got this palette it's the marble
collection warm stone it's like the
second time in two videos that I've
shown a palette with the marbled finish
top but this is just a 12 color neutral
eyeshadow palette that turned out to be
really freaking awesome in my opinion I
feel like you've got three distinct kind
of quads looking horizontally one very
warm one more of a cool kind of stone
type look and then this rosy one at the
bottom and they're really like
legitimately good I like the mattes
I like the shimmers I do too look with
it today on today's look is pretty much
all the bottom oops all the bottom row
but also this shade to that color worked
into the crease actually plays really
nicely with the rosy shades in the
bottom but Oh a little bit of the
darkest color as well but nice finishes
nice textures there was one kind of
questionable shade that's the pink down
here in the bottom and I thought okay
that's going to be the chunky-monkey of
the bunch you know it's going to have
like that unruly sort of texture to work
with but actually packed on the lid
which I've got a little bit here like on
the inner part of my lid it applies
really well it doesn't necessarily
swatch that well when you really you
know apply some pressure to it but for a
light light kind of patted on the lid it
actually worked pretty decent but I'm so
curious what this is regularly selling
for okay they've got it priced at $18
but right now it's $12 and it seems like
BH Cosmetics almost always had stuff
marked down but I am pretty sure in that
sale I got it for like $10 or less and I
was just shocked I was not expecting
anything to be that great obviously I
was hoping I wouldn't hate it but
sometimes you know the deal the
financial deal but you get on something
is so good you just don't have your
sights set too high another thing I got
during that sale was the HD
brow pencil in brunette so it's BHS take
on one of those really skinny pencils
and I like this a lot too I mean it's a
nice cool brown for me it really works
well in my brows I like that it seems to
have pigment but yet it's not um too
creamy
I don't like products because I have
hairy brows you know I've got some hair
going on in there I don't like things
that are too creamy and kind of make my
brow hairs clump together so this is a
nice kind of lightweight pencil for what
I'm looking for and I was just surprised
that I enjoyed it as much as I did again
it was a really you know inexpensive buy
during that sale but been wearing this
in my brows on and off it just gives me
kind of that pinpointed fill in that I
need at times what I have been finding
lately is that I'm enjoying this kind of
a brush a lot more when it comes to just
using a brush through your brows for the
purpose of spreading product out a bit
more making sure it's all nicely evenly
applied like a spoolie wand can yea you
know kind of get it going through the
brows but this brush with all of these
ends right here this is the Real
Techniques slash brow groomer that
really does a good job of kind of
dispersing product so those two have
made a nice little pair and that was
kind of an unexpected thing that I
really like okay let's stop Smashbox for
a second and their eyeshadow palettes
that are so fun to look at and these are
the cover shot eye palettes I've had
these on hand for a while I'm just
looking at the whole selection of them I
could kind of see it first which ones I
thought I was going to like and yeah I
did end up liking them there was one
called ablaze that was just a beautiful
you know warm selection of really
saturated colors there was one that had
like kind of plum and peach tones very
neutral that one was called golden our
thought I'd like it yes I did end up
liking that I like the matte one as well
but one that kind of came out and
surprised me was the one called soft
lights and this one I just I can't help
myself I got to do that this color
selection like I did not expect to enjoy
this nearly as much as I do everything
and you
has shimmer there's not a lot of
contrast between it all it just doesn't
necessarily speak to me at a glance but
applied on the eyes I tell you what is
such a pretty or no kind of ethereal
look what's the word I'm looking for
it's kind of a pretty eye for no makeup
makeup or just that barely there type of
contrast because you've got a couple
shades here like don't discount these
two which are kind of bronzy and apply
those lightly in the crease and then use
any of these little bit lighter pops
just to get a little bit of glow going
on your lid and on your brow bone and
it's a very unexpectedly pretty look and
the impact from it is just I don't know
it's more than I expected and not
everything in this palette is like
SuperDuper metallic and shimmery but you
know there's an element of shimmer or at
least a satin finish it might be the
better description in everything in here
so I remember thinking this is going to
be sort of that palette you set off to
the side don't really get use out of but
for that easy natural quite frankly very
effortless look this is a really nice
little go to your lip products so funny
how I mentioned in the Emily Awards
like I felt like it was the year of the
lipstick for me I've come across so many
great lipstick formulas and just you
know full coverage bold kind of great
lip products this year and almost as
soon as I say that I've got some glosses
coming out of the woodwork that I do
actually kind of like one of them that
surprised me and it might not surprise a
lot of people because this is kind of
like a hyped up line I feel like the
Instagram hype you know just the overall
social media hype of Kylie cosmetics is
huge and so therefore sometimes that
works backwards on me I actually stay
away from the project if it's been like
super duper hyped up online and so that
was kind of the case for me with the
Kylie cosmetics line I tried an
eyeshadow palette that I thought was
good you know it didn't absolutely knock
my socks off but it was decent and then
I try to liquid lipstick / liner combo
and that worked well although the shade
I got was it was that love by
and it was dark to begin with but it
really really darkened up as it wore and
that's kind of a pet peeve of mine when
those liquid lipsticks change color as
you wear that the gloss the gloss that I
got in the color coke okay I thought was
such a perfect pink and I'm going to
give credit where credit is due it is a
good gloss like it's a good formula it's
rather opaque on my lips more so than I
expected I like the brush tip applicator
and I just like how when I apply it I
feel like I've got full on color it's
not sheer like I expected it to be for
whatever reason so yeah I've enjoyed the
color and the formula quite a bit and I
didn't think I would the other kind of
glossy product that has really excited
me lately is actually the part of the
sweet peach line that I thought I would
be least enamored with let's say you
know I know the sweet peach palate is
good by the way I have a video on um
drugstore lower cost alternatives to the
sweet beach palette if you're not
getting that I remember I put that out
when the palette initially launched and
availability seem to be so slim for
people and then I put out that video
with alternatives so anyway still that
peach palette is a good palette you know
I enjoy that and I thought I'm going to
be excited about the blush I really do
like the Papa don't peach blush but the
thought of a creamy peach oil lip gloss
I guess I just kind of thought you know
these are going to be slippery and they
just the sound of it to me I didn't
think I was going to love this I
expected them to be thin light just kind
of do nothing glosses in reality I
really really like these a lot
and they surprised the pants off of me I
am wearing the one called Papa don't
peach and that's probably my favorite
it's sort of like a I don't know a
peachy tan nude sort of mix but when you
first open these up I mean the scent is
undeniable it's like you've just opened
up a bag of peach rings and stuck your
face in it I mean it's so potent and
really really sweet and I kind of love
that not everybody may love that but I'm
going to tell you right now I love that
but um gosh just can't get past that sin
smells so good
but actually the texture the formula
that's happening here is really really
nice and it's like it goes on your lips
and it feels super smooth it's not at
all sticky or tacky but as it wears like
I've had this shade on now for probably
half an hour and it's like I can kind of
run my tongue over my lips I'm not
pulling off product it's like it became
a little bit more one with the lips it's
not like it's just a thick gloss just
sitting there anybody know what I'm
saying here's so hard to describe it's
like the gloss isn't overly thick but
it's just thick enough to have a good
amount of cling to my lips and it feels
actually moisturizing I can wear this
product over the course of several hours
and even once you know I've eaten
something I've had something to drink
it's starting to wear down my lips feel
good like for having had this on for a
while so I like that I really like like
I said this shade I like the peach
please which I thought was a really true
peach and came off a little bit brighter
on my lips than I expected the downside
of this line is that like every shade is
sort of rooted in peach or nude and I'm
just really hoping that they keep this
kind of formula around and put out like
some different colors you know I would
love to see an even broader range of
neutrals and pinks and reddish colors
and plums and stuff like that but in my
eyes I think it's a really quality
formula it's a kind of thing I like the
feel of on my lips and it's it's
something not to be overlooked with the
peach line for sure so there you go
everybody there are six products that
really kind of surprised me that I enjoy
them as much as I am it just goes to
show sometimes we get so rooted in our
own preferences and our own like
expectations of products we really have
to keep an open mind because there will
be some things that come in whether it's
like at a surprising price point kind of
like the BH Cosmetics stuff I thought
gosh this stuff is so on sale can it
possibly be that great but I really
enjoyed that sometimes it's just like
that preference that you've got kind of
set up in your mind that I like this
type of thing and then you try something
different
it's like well you know I really do like
that too so I'd love to hear in the
comments section if you've had this
experience with any products lately
thank you guys so much for taking time
to watch and I will see you next time
