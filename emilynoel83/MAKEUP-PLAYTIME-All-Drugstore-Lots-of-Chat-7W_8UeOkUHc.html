makeup playtime it's not like the call
it now and then I mean that's what I've
called it in my everyday life for a long
long time when I've just sat down I
really honestly didn't care how the look
turned out I was just looking to try
things and you know just play around
with it and have fun and I never want to
lose the fun side of makeup I mean it's
always been something that relieved
stress in me that made me feel creative
it's truly very enjoyable for me in any
capacity but I really think one of the
funnest times with makeup is when you
can just sit down and not be overly
concerned with how it's going to turn
out so I figure why not go to a good
judgement free zone like the internet or
I can do that in front of people right
um ya know I love you guys here on my
channel you get me and I appreciate that
so what I'm doing today I do have a
little direction with this look I want
to do a really dark lip I'm something
about this short hair it's making me
want to wear like all the bold lip
colors you know like anything bright or
dark or just different um I don't know
what it is but I feel like every shade
just kind of pops in a little different
way it's like I got a new face when I
got my new hair and it's gonna be all
drugstore here I've got some things that
I really like I've got a few things here
and there that I'm gonna be definitely
like testing out with you though there
will be plenty of time for chitchat a
long way so let's just get started and
I'm gonna use my ELF hydrating face
primer which I really like feels so nice
at first you feel like you're putting on
kind of like a lightweight gel
moisturizer but then you realize how
much smoothing it's doing and it's like
yes I really needed that and then I
wanted to share with you guys I got this
little Ulta beauty brand set of two
sponges and a little mini setting spray
the setting spray looks like this
it says matte makeup setting spray it's
fine it doesn't really do for me what my
um hard candy sheer envy primer miss
does because that like I feel like it
gives me instant glow this one I haven't
really picked up on anything special but
the sponge is you're getting one like
Beauty Blender size sponge and one
that's like the size of the Beauty
Blender blood
sure which is exciting so both of these
are in there and they're both a really
soft and spongy so that was that was an
exciting fight I've had pretty good luck
with some Ulta brand sponges remember
like the bigger white ones that I think
blew up to be even bigger than this when
they were saturated with water those
were nice and now and this is a nice
little kid as well link to it below and
I'm going to use my dream matte mousse I
don't know if I've applied this I've
talked about this a lot in videos
recently but maybe not applied it and I
have it in the shade nude this is an
example of a product that my goodness I
used it years and years ago and I think
I just used it out of you know like
fascination with the format but maybe
never necessarily really loved it now I
feel like I'm kind of going a second
time around with it as I said I was
inspired by Katherine Webb's Instagram
post about it and I'm kind of really
really digging it and I'm just like
dotting it around I mean I might look
like I'm trying to blend it but I'm not
fully blending it yet um but it just
feels creamier than it used to it feels
less dry
I don't think dry skin people should be
too scared off by this foundation I
guess is what I'm trying to say I really
got the blood flowing this morning as I
went up and down the stairs about three
times trying to clean up a massive
hairball Baker left me Baker's cupcake
that's just her nickname you know how we
like to nickname around this house yeah
it's been a while since she's had a big
hairball so that probably really needed
to happen but it really makes me a
little bit queasy trying to clean that
stuff up everybody else was sleeping so
if bub was up and around I'd be like hey
bub did you happen to hear cupcake throw
oh you didn't okay
anyway this Beauty Blender is working
fantastically well it's very very soft
it's soft in its own special way you
know it's more like soft it kind of
reminds me of the Real Techniques sponge
softness which is just fine by me you
know it works great so I get that all
blended in I really put a very light
amount of it on my skin and then I find
I like to go back once I've gotten it
all blended and I apply just a bit more
over the areas where I've had it little
like melasma which I've had
comments like oh you haven't had melasma
this pregnancy well I did have it um
definitely more toward like in the
summertime months earlier in the summer
I noticed it more because I think it's
tied to not only my hormones but you
pair that with sun exposure and it
really blooms more recently I just
haven't been out quite as much I've been
extremely conscious about also you know
keeping the SPF on there and all that
business but yeah I feel like I've been
able to kind of control it a little bit
more right now I went shopping my stash
for some concealers from the drugstore
one of them that I know I've really
liked is this Almay aged essentials
it's an SPF 20 concealer in shade oh
shades not important is it okay the
shade is seriously not on there so I'll
have to look that up maybe in a past
video where I mentioned it knew it but
this is a nice creamy stick concealer so
I'm going to apply this kind of in the
way in the zones I've been using my
honest hacia creamy concealer and just
go around like that because it's
basically see how it's like really
matching my skin tone and then I'm going
to use this little guy my little Real
Techniques sponge that has the one
angled side there I did review this in
its own video I'm just going to dab that
in all about the sponges today yes can't
believe I'm in my third trimester of
pregnancy 28 weeks right now my little
update said you're in the third
trimester II like you know you get the
updates on your phone telling you
exactly where you're at I love that and
the baby is the size of an eggplant so
eggplants are pretty big there's my
profound thought for the day you know
it's how I've been including profound
thoughts from like important influential
interesting people and then I put a
random thought down the bottom of my
description box these days I've really
enjoyed doing that for whatever reason
it's fun
so okay went that in and then for my
added brightness I think I'm going to go
back to some age rewind in the shade
brightener this is the little bit kinky
tones one have not busted this guy out
in some time and I just want to hit that
inner corner and just see how this
because I've just been using a lot of
high-end concealers lately and it's nice
to touch base with your drugstore you
know things you used to use a lot maybe
this Pat over that
next I think I'm going to bake I'm going
to use my airspun powder here so I just
kind of give it a little shake and then
I'll take this sponge that I've been
using and dab dab dab and then right
under here
I feel like makeup just gets really
serious once you start doing stuff like
this you know like yep there is a
process underway people get ready and
then I find that about the time it takes
to do my brows seems to be a good amount
of time for that to just you know sit
there and I've got this Maybelline
definer brow and it is in the shade
medium brown to me this was like the
original fine brow pencil feel every
brand jumped on the bandwagon because of
honest hacia but this guy was out there
too just sitting there at the bottom of
the displays saying I'm lime-green look
at me
I kinda wish it was a spooly though not
this little like yeah I need to pull him
this Fuli I like to really be able to
rake through the brow and the product
that I've put in there
you know I got to thinking about
recently in the reading comments for one
of my videos I think it was the big
lorac and mega pro 3 review I know some
people talking about what they do for a
living and that's so interesting to me I
love to hear like I mean there's a lot I
feel like I don't know about you guys
well some of you share you know I'm
never really sure like who's watching
what could they do because I noticed
some people in the comments were talking
about how like that palette would be
good for them because they were you know
in the medical industry their nurse and
they try to keep it kind of muted with
the makeup every day and stuff like that
and I would love to hear more like about
you all and and what do you do for a
living and how do you spend your days
and is there a certain way you have to
do your makeup because of your job or
does your job prompt you to do something
really like flamboyant and crazy with
your makeup I would love to know I just
really find that interesting like I'm
the type of person who would really like
to just stop ladies on the street and
say what makeup are you carrying around
with you in your purse right now
that'll be if I ever have a talk show
down the road one day that'll be what I
do I stop people on the street and just
see you know what exactly is in your
purse makeup wise I don't really care
about all the other stuff got a little
clear covergirl natural lash set those
puppies right here something I think
it's kind of interesting it's like as
I've aged you know doing makeup if I
were younger and let's say something
didn't quite turn out right not that I
was any type of like it knew anything I
was really talking about makeup wise
let's say in high school but I felt like
I sat down and I took it so much more
seriously
you know like I've got a got to get this
kind of look I was maybe just overly
concerned with other people's
perceptions you know and now I feel like
I approach makeup in a lot more
laid-back manner like if something
doesn't turn out just so yeah that's
fine it'll wash off and another day I'll
do it differently and I think some of
that comes from trying a lot of
different products all the time
and knowing that doing it with the
expectation that not everything's going
to work perfectly at all times you know
sometimes you hit on something that's
just like yes it does everything I
wanted I loved it I loved it but now
everything looks perfect and it's just
like you know so what we move on sorry
if I've said you know a lot in like the
past 30 seconds there I feel like I did
so I kind of dusted away that bacon us
that happened and I got my Revlon nearly
naked powder in light I don't think I
really mean the patter but I just kind
of pulled it out so I'm gonna very
lightly just add this around something
about this powder I feel so even when I
put it on you know it's like maybe the
powder wasn't a necessity for the
texture of my skin but I just like the
way everything looks okay next this
thing talked about something that's been
sitting around in my collection that I
have not really been compelled to pull
out or kind of let's be honest I forgot
about it
it's the covergirl trublend contour
palette and this is the lighter or kind
of like the lighter slash cooler of the
two and I thought this would be a good
opportunity to use this little um Ulta
brand Beauty Blender blusher type prod
and this wasn't like labeled exactly to
be for blush your contour or whatever
but it just it's a similar size to what
Beauty Blender put out I am talking so
much in this video it's going to be like
a freaking epic when it's done okay I'm
going to go into the contour i'm just
using the butt end of this
I'm going to try to really sculpt these
out a little bit today I feel like every
time I've done my makeup recently I just
kind of haven't really paid attention to
contouring too much that's okay
not always like a must-do thing it's
nice to play with new products now and
then alrighty it's a good tone this
cream
do a little bit up here
I think the next one of these makeup
playtime's that I do I'll do like a
really really natural look you know with
without so much Glan and so many steps
added and all that business so somebody
did request that recently and I think
fall just hurls me into this season of
yes
more makeup you know heavier makeup
darker makeup but doesn't have to be
that way and not everyone's you know
daily routine lends itself to that and
this is the one labeled bronze and it
seems just kind of like a almost a
borderline rose gold shimmer I'm not
really feeling like I want to use that
so much I don't know but I think I will
use and this is a total Tiffany D
inspired move here she's gone back to
her Dream bouncy blushes I have this one
in plum wine and she's used I think a
Beautyblender type sponge with them and
said it works really well so now I've
kind of got some contour on there but I
think we'll be fine just go right in on
top pick up some and I'm going to put
this on the lower part outer apple of my
cheek with these darker blush shades I
just try to be careful not to take it
too too high stay in your lane blush
okay that's pretty very very much dig in
that shade and then gay essence pure
nude highlight number ten be my
highlight love this highlight I talked
about this in my little hole that I did
recently very sneaky as far as
highlights go because I feel like I
achieve glow but I don't see a line of
product there you know it's just
suddenly glowing suddenly glowing my
future highlight that I will release
around the same time that I launched my
TV show where I dig into people's purses
to look at their makeup bags so many
plans so little time okay
this is kind of glow you just want to
put all over
it's very buildable I find like if I
want more glow on my cheeks I can just
take another pass and yep it's there and
I'll just use this little setting spray
and that came with my sponges the thing
I have to be careful about if I don't
get the pump fully all the way down it
will spurt out like too big of droplets
on my skin so I've got it got a focus
here okay pressures on okay nice fine
mist one more it doesn't just have
necessarily that instantaneous effect
that I see from the hard candy but it's
still good now what I think I want to do
is go ahead and put my lip color on so
when I do my eyes I can coordinate
somewhat or just like keep in mind hey
your lip is dark as heck this is the elf
matte lip color in scarlet Knight and by
the way there is the sharpener on the
end of these I know I've mentioned that
before but somebody said that there is a
sharpener on the end of the bite matte
lipcream crayons which is so exciting
and so I checked my full-size has it the
one downfall is that the little
travel-size like the stuff they put in
there sets a little best bite Redux set
does not have it I forgot to prep with
any sort of balm so this is my Almay age
essential balm smells and tastes a
little bit like cotton candy do I say
the color scarlet Knight gonna be dark I
feel like there's a sports team all this
scarlet is that like the
Squad from Rutgers I have a lot of
random College cheerleading and dance
team knowledge stored up in my head when
I was in high school like the only thing
I really wanted to pull up on TV were my
tapes of recorded ESPN cheer and dance
competitions it's funny because now that
there's this online world that feeds my
makeup obsession there's also like all
these Instagram accounts from different
cheerleading squads and they post like
all these little videos and stuff and
I'm like man how I would have loved this
when I was in high school in college and
I saw a cheerleader I think they were on
Alabama's team and sorry I'm just busted
in a cheerleading mode here for a second
but they did a triple up like a triple
up Lib three spins dude tosses are up
and lands it in and solid I was like
whoa I watched it so many times if any
of my viewers can do that like can we
just sit down and have coffee and talk
for a while I'm going to prime my lids
with my Milani here I really need to
paint my nails I say that all the time
to myself
problem is finding the time and when I
reached that end of the day moment where
Belle's in bed and I know I'm not going
to have like a toddler to pick up and do
something with I just frankly want to
flop down and not worry about anything
like that
nails happen to fall kind of low on the
Beauty priority list for me I would say
number one is obviously makeup number
two is hair and it's it's not even
really close between those two makeup is
way ahead and then nails are like way
off in the boondocks over there as you
probably realize with the oldest sponges
I'm trying to get into more drugstore
price range and giftable kits and
stocking stuffers that I got this little
kit from NYX and it came in this box and
it had eyeliner and also a matte lip
color as well and it's called brighter
days and I saw this little palette here
and I thought hmm I love the Avant pop
eyeshadow formula and anything they've
like sized this way with eyeshadow
I've really liked it and so I saw all
the pretty jewel tones in here and
decided yep that's me I'm going for that
I'm trying that I just watched a few
shades randomly and they looked really
really good so this is my first time
using it on my eyes I don't know what I
want to do though like if I do green I
don't want to do like green overkill
this is what the green looks like you
know I'm wearing green I'm gonna just
start with my crease and I'm going to go
cool I think to start here with this
gray get that here in the kriesel region
it's Friday I'm pumped I feel like when
you're a mother
the day's all kind of like they kind of
run together and when you've got little
one to care for and it's like you've
still got duties on the weekend
it's nice having bub around a little bit
more on the weekend to share some of
that
you need to have a big makeup room
clean-up session this weekend and I need
to do a big brush cleaning session this
weekend because I've got like piles of
things that I've reviewed just kind of
piling up around me I'm like okay some
of this needs to you needs to go
somewhere this is a pearly shade right
here a little shimmer go ahead and pop
that under the brow I'm just stalling
right now because I don't know what the
heck I'm going to do color wise
I'm sure you guys are shouting at me was
like a really good idea heck with it I
want to do green I'm going green I'm
going to Pat this on my lid let's see
what you're made of green who rather
nice
since I am a face makeup first eyes
second route makeup routine type person
I just have really trained myself to
build up my shadows little by little
especially when I'm unfamiliar with the
shadow I'm not quite sure what it's
going to do to me like is it going to
cause a bunch of fallout is it is it
going to do something unexpected
I just am very careful with the way I
build it up and I usually don't end up
having too much of a fallout problem but
yeah that's a fun shade and then there's
this matte Brown here which why not
let's just kind of see if this is makeup
play done this is the definition of it
you don't know what's going to really
transpire but you do it anyway
the green is interesting because it's
got like it's not just a flat-out green
it's got like a little golden shimmer to
it
what I've just been doing with this
brush is alright I just added a little
brown to it but I'm kind of just
blending across you know the brown and
gray and just getting this nice like
neutral smokiness happening now that
I've gone and blend it around a bit I'm
just going to dab some of that in green
right here center of the lid just to
bring it to the forefront again
you're the star green what I also feel
compelled to do with this look with the
dark lip I think I'm going to keep the
lower lash line very very minimal today
I'm going to do something a light in it
like this Rimmel scandaleyes in nude
and I'm going to do liner I'm going to
do Jordana color envy and black envy so
I'm starting to have moments with bill
where I'm really it's really sinking in
that like this is it like we're getting
into the last period of time here where
she's the only one and honestly like I
shouldn't have I totally should not have
brought that up right now because it
makes me want to cry like I am so I'm
sure every person who's gone through a
second you know what one child to two
child experience knows what I'm talking
about here but you're so excited for
that new person in your life but you
want to side just want to give bail
everything she needs and deserves you
know i don't want i i i've just had a
lot of those moments with myself lately
where I'm like am I going to be able to
handle it all and not just from the
perspective of am I going to be able to
do videos or keep the house clean and
all those things but am I going to be
able to adequately tend to two little
people who both need me badly I'm going
to give it my best and then the way that
little internal conversation always ends
is me telling myself you'll just take it
one day at a time take it as it comes
because if you feel like you're looking
at these situations with a kids entire
childhood in front of you it's going to
seem overwhelming and like hard to
handle but if if I look at it from the
perspective of well you know you'll take
one day one situation one hour as it
comes to you I can do that you know
maybe doing the eyeliner at this
movement and randomly bringing up that
topic pressured me not to cry
that wing turned out really nicely
though I'm very happy over there in case
anybody thought that my wings always
turn out good which I'm sure you didn't
think that but just saying they don't I
mean do you ever feel like you're just
shooting off into no-man's land like
where is this wing going I've just got
to take the plunge and do it because I
don't know if it's matching up with the
other side or not
now all I want on the bottom like I
don't even want to see like I've done a
bunch of shadow I just want a little a
little blend in from that so I think I'm
just going to go to the black with an
angled brush and just gently very gently
come down
no heavy lower lashline I'm just
stopping it right there on the outer
property okay so my memory card is
almost full and I have nowhere to go
right now with my other video clips so
what I'm going to do is do my lashes put
some super sizer mascara on I'm gonna
put on a ridiculously big lash and then
join you back at the end okay I'm all
done
those are my Michel lashes my Coco
lashes in the style Misha by the way
sometimes they look like they just
totally fit with the look I'm wearing
and sometimes they look like way way
overkill so it's just you know we just
kind of gotta wait and see but I do like
the green pop overall impressed with the
quality on that guy and my lip I just
blotted it off a little bit so I could
have that kind of matte finish going on
and I dabbed on just a hair more blush
oh one other thing I did I had forgotten
that I wanted to go around my inner
corner for a highlight and so that's
this shade very pigmented that worked
nicely too so I'm feeling all full right
now with my dark lip and my olive eyes
and my olive green shirt but I hope this
was fun for you all it was definitely
fun for me I like to just sit down and
play around with my makeup so I love you
guys so much thank you so much for
welcoming me into your home's into your
life through these videos it means the
world and I will talk to you next time
