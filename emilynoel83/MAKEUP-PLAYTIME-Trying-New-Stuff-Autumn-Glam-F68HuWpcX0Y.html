soundin a little rough today got a cold
definitely cold is fully underway in
this video and there's not really a lot
I can do about it as far as being
pregnant and not being able to treat it
with a lot of things so it's kind of
unfair but it happens so thank you for
joining me for this video it's gonna be
just kind of casual I wanted to do kind
of like it's get ready with me but to me
it's like makeup playtime you know I'm
trying out a lot of new ish things and
it's just kind of casual let's see where
this goes type of makeup so if you're
joining me with a cup of coffee today
Cheers
I've used this a couple times already
it's the it cosmetics new by by pores
primer it says oil-free poreless skin
perfecting serum primer and the first
time I used it it took forever to get
that like pump working but now it's
pumping out just fine it's kind of like
the style of the CC creams and it has a
super super soft feel like it just feels
really soft immediately on contact with
the skin almost feels a little bit like
Smashbox photo finish but creamier next
product I wanted to use that I have had
on in various videos but I have not
showed an application yet and it's that
hourglass vanish Foundation stick it's
this triangular shape stick and it looks
like check it out I haven't used it more
than I don't know half a dozen times
maybe and I feel like a lot of product
kind of wears down off the stick and
it's a little yellowy
and a little bit dark on me right now
but I'm gonna work with it I'm still
kind of just trying to get a feel for
this texture and what's happening here
it's really smooth and just kind of like
velvety and the coverage is really good
I'm using just a classic beauty blender
to blend this in now
I was hesitant on whether or not to even
use this because I knew you know my skin
has even lightened up a little bit since
I first got this product and now it's
gonna like it's a little dark by the
time we do some brightening and stuff on
the under eye area I think this will all
work itself out to those of y'all who
are panicking clearly I don't have the
energy to panic right
some of my favorite foundation sticks on
the market are the elf moisturizing
foundation sticks no joke those are like
some of the best products elf has
created the this stick it seems more
velvety it seems a little bit more
toward like mattifying and it's
definitely buildable and what do I mean
when I say velvety I guess I mean like
once I've got it blended out I always
feel like there's kind of a softness to
the skin it mattifies but it doesn't
look too heavy and it is somewhat
buildable I noticed a little more
redness around my nose so I'm going to
just add a little product there that
redness really peeks through easily when
you got a cold and you're rubbing your
nose all day next new thing is this it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye illumination
in medium so bye-bye under-eye is a very
well-known squeezy tube concealer that
it cosmetics has and so now they've got
this illumination version I am very very
like you know judgy on a concealer that
claims to be illuminating because I
don't you know I just want coverage just
cover it up I'll illuminate it with
something else you know and in the
places where I want to illuminate but
this is really interesting because it
does seem to be a little bit extra
brightening like for a medium shade it
seems even lighter than I would have
expected but it's got a lot of coverage
and I don't feel like it gets really
shimmery I guess don't get too scared by
is what I'm saying but I'm also not
convinced that it's that much like more
special than the regular bye-bye
under-eye because it feels a lot the
same and as you can see because this is
so much lighter than the foundation I'm
just kind of dabbing this anywhere where
I might want to brighten and this is my
Swiss Perce sponge let me show you a lot
of you guys clued me into these that
they're being sold at Walmart they're
sold like near the q-tips or cotton
rounds and stuff like that Swiss pers
mini sponges so yeah I've been using
this one on and off and it works well
it's a very soft sponge I mean it's it's
incredibly soft
garbage man's here Thank You garbage man
so I was not feeling well really most of
yesterday too and I around dinnertime
nothing really sounded good it's like
the combination of being sick and being
Pregnant's like a double whammy of being
a picky eater and the one thing that
sounded kind of good and it might be
like that chicken soup mentality but
that chicken ramen in the cup the cup of
noodles
you know what I'm talking about the
chicken flavor something about that like
I ate it and I thought I don't feel the
least bit bad about this this actually
tastes like exactly what I wanted it was
warm
it was noodley and that seemed to do it
for me
so this concealer even once blended in
it has a kind of dewy to the touch type
of feel very much like the original
bye-bye under-eye and I think I'm going
to see if I can build this up a little
more because when I look head-on you
know you might think well yeah kind of
covered all right and then I turn and
yeah there's that circle area coming
through so I would like to see if I can
more effectively get that area right
here
the thing about my face and products you
know you might see me on a given day in
a video and think oh that whatever she's
wearing doesn't look totally perfect
well odds are I'm testing like four or
five new things on my face on any given
day and not everything's going to do
exactly what I want it to do
as long as you're always learning
something or picking up some new
information you know I don't feel like
there's any harm in that so building up
a little bit yeah I think it may have
helped the coverage somewhat but the
glow enos factor it's interesting
because I feel like it's what's making
it glowy is the fact that it is lighter
than you would expect for a medium
labeled concealer and it's just got a
lot of moisture in it anyway so I feel
like we're it's catching the light yeah
that actually does feel tacky if it
looks like it might feel tacky it yes it
does that there's not actual shimmer in
the product or anything it seems to be
similar coverage to by by under eye
maybe a little bit lighter just for the
fact that you're going to end up getting
shades that you think correspond with
your skin but they turn out to be
lighter on your skin did that make any
sense I need another sip of coffee
feeling like I really really want to
bake this I'm going to use a little bit
of my airspun powder here just cuz that
works will it really well in
circumstances where I'm baking and I
think it's something I want to add
coverage to I just have this one wet
it'll cover a little more surface area
than that Meeny and just dab this on
powder everywhere
fYI this cold started with Belle and she
seemed like so down and out for a couple
days and then I mean it worked its way
out of her system quickly I'm hoping it
does the same for me because we're
traveling to a wedding this week and I
would rather not feel like I dunno now
this is normally where I pause on the
face stuff and I do some brow and I'm
gonna use this makeup forever Pro
sculpting brow I have really liked this
I have it in the shade 40 and it's like
a really cool sort of taupey brown and
instead of being one of those super fine
tipped applicators or sticks it's a
little bit you see how its formed it's
almost like triangle shape like a very
skinny triangle and so I just go on and
fill in
if you're a bushy-brow a girl like me do
you ever feel like you sleep on your
brows funny and then it's like one
morning you wake up and they're going
everywhere
and then if you twist this there's a
little like spring-loaded powder thing
here if you wanted to highlight
now I'm just gonna sweep away any excess
from that little baking situation
they're gonna do a light bit of my to
face primed and poreless powder just
kind of on the t-zone and this is my
city color contour effects to palate and
you get three really big shades I'm
gonna go into this deepest shade with my
Sigma small contour brush first I'm
using this product actually and I'm
gonna build up very little by little
because I know how pigmented city colors
blushes can be so I don't want to like
drown myself in contour here
really nice tone on that contour powder
though and pretty easily blendable too
I really want to mix in like these kinds
of videos where you're seeing more
applications because especially this
time of year for me I feel like my
channel becomes very review heavy with
all the palettes and gift sets and stuff
and I know you guys are interested in
that but I don't want to lose sight of
like random new products showing the
application even you know showing the
application with some of those sets and
palettes so you can get a little more
feel for them you know what I'm saying
now I'm honestly not sure how new these
blushes are they were recently sent to
me some full-size Tarte Amazonian clay
blushes all the ones I was sent were
very like neutrally kind of easy colors
but this shape called risque I think
might be my favorite like it's the
perfect neutral matte kind of dusty rose
color so I'm going to put this on for
you
mmm loving loving life in my face needs
some blush on it today or what I mean
come on now okay good stuff that I'm
going to return to my city color palette
and they've got what looks to be a
shimmery glowy yeah it looks like it
could be very glowy on this highlight I
like to take it down right over the
apple of the cheek so when I'm head-on
you're still seeing glow not just when I
turned setting mist I'm going to run out
of this soon actually my hard candy
sheer envy hydrating primer miss
this feels good feels cooling I needed
that now the one thing I did know like I
did have a little mental direction on
going into this video is that I wanted a
dramatic fall I and I am going to bust
out one of my juvie is placed pallets in
this video so we can see this in action
and this is the Nubian too so they've
got I think it's called The Masquerade
is the big biggie and then they've got a
smaller one that's all new trouble and
this is that middle one that I think has
some beautiful jewel tones and neutrals
just mixed together it's like the kinds
of colors that this time of year I would
be very compelled to wear so I think
this is this might be my favorite of all
the palettes
I'm gonna kick it off as always with a
little eyeshadow primer
oh I want to use in my creases
Madagascar perfect medium brown and this
brand was basically designed to be
something that would contain products
that really do show up and come through
on people with deep rich tan really deep
skin tones in an interview I was reading
and that's what they said and then they
commented that you know if it if it can
show up and be true to color on those
skin tones then it should be great for
everyone else as well and I think that's
kind of a good mindset for brands to
have when it comes to their shadow
palettes and the pigmentation and these
are just incredibly pigmented in the
pans as you probably noticed are super
large so still working with Madagascar
just kind of bouncing back and forth
trying to even this out go ahead and
blend over that edge with a bear brush
when we have for a highlight here we
don't really have a matte highlight but
we do have this
I'm going to use Nairobi down here
really like yellowy gold and take that
on the inner part here and you
accidentally go into the plum
a little highlight like around the inner
corner here
and I think I had some dark room and
still on my brush there so I meant to
correct that
really hate layering more concealer on
that area but has to be done then I kind
of want to transition away from the gold
with this coppery color up here
I was gonna continue with olive green
but I just don't really see myself
liking that too much so I think I'm
gonna go with this berry color here this
Matt berry called Jezebel hat that on
the outer corner how about
super-gorgeous alongside that gold and
copper Wow
I'm just patting that on with a slightly
larger flat brush
this color is like the heart of fall
leaves changing don't you think like
when you see really bright yellows and
reds and burgandy's then I just want to
brighten my gold a little bit more and I
think I'll work in a little more this
Brown just kind of on my borders here
this is my segment you 36 brush by the
way and then for a lighter I'm going to
use this TARDIS
it's a double-ended liquid and pencil
liner and it has a really nice very dark
black liquid here
do little Rimmel scandaleyes a nude
lower inner rim that area needs all the
brightening it can get today now I want
Kenya this nice dark brown coming right
under my wing
and then I think I want to go for some
green I'm going to use this Egypt shade
down here
I'm using it kind of softly not no show
is a big bright pop of green it's not
because it's not pigmented it's just a
very small surface area where I'm
applying it
adjusting just a little bit once I get
my weighing out there then I can really
see exactly where I want to take my eye
shadow out to I'm just going to curl my
lashes and I'm applying this voluminous
feline on each eye it's been an ok
mascara for me you know not amazing but
a situation where I know I'm putting
lashes on top so I just need a little
bit of a base coat on my super straight
lashes to get them falling in line with
the falsies
I would really encourage anybody though
like if you have any time you know spare
time even at the end of a day to just
absolutely play with your makeup not
feel like oh my look has to turn out
this certain way or I'm really concerned
about you know making it be appropriate
for this this and this just playing with
your makeup like wiping off what was on
there from the day starting fresh doing
whatever the heck you want or maybe it's
the start of the day thing like what I'm
doing right now like just give yourself
a little bit of freedom just to have fun
with it that's how I have discovered so
many times like oh I like using this
product like this or these two together
or you know you just run into more
little finds when you're just in a
relaxed just makeup use and mode you
know and then clump crush your
water-resistant lower lashes
and then I'm going to put some lashes on
and join you for lips got the lashes on
and I had kind of a time with these they
are the Ardell double ups the 202 so
really thick lashes and I had trouble
like getting this side to like bend in
and really curve to the shape of my eye
that's what happens when you use a fresh
pair of lashes that hasn't been on your
eyes before because it kind of like
needs a little time to mold almost and
my eyes really go you know have a
roundness to them I notice when I have
like these flashes so you've got to
watch out for that new little holiday
thing that I was super excited about
snatched up just as soon as I saw it on
Sephora sight bite it has a little four
pack here it's a set of their
amuse-bouche lipsticks you've got four
shades fig pepper honeycomb and nori and
this is actually my first time using
this new formula that they've put out
because you know they discontinued
luminous cream which I'll admit I was
bitter about that for a little while
love that lipstick formula so I've got a
couple of these that I think I'm going
to work into my lip look today I'm going
to use honeycomb which is the most nude
and yeah these are mini lipsticks here
and I was trying them on the other night
and I thought wow you know they still do
feel really great on the lips you know I
don't have any complaints
and then I kind of want to work in a
little bit of nori which is this really
dark shade I might work in a lot of it I
wasn't sure you know exactly how much
layering I wanted to do
there are no rules during makeup
playtime
these really are exceptionally creamy I
wonder if they feel like there's even a
little more like moisture a little more
wetness in the formula than before so
yeah Noorie kind of took over but I like
it that way so I hope you guys enjoyed
this little fall themed makeup playtime
session I'm sorry I wasn't feeling
better or I didn't sound better you know
I know I'm a little congested today but
this is really what I would have done
anyway today was just kind of gotten out
my newer products and played with them
and experimented a little bit so I
figured let's just turn the camera on if
we had sort of a high and low from this
look I think the low might have been I
was a little disappointed with the
bye-bye under-eye illumination just
because I don't know I'm still looking
at my under-eye area thinking if I would
have corrected that or used you know
like a peachy corrector or my
heart-shaped tape or something different
I could have totally eliminated my
under-eye circle there but I just didn't
feel like this was capable of doing
quite enough even though I did layered
on twice High Point for me definitely my
Nubian to palate I really loved the
shades in there I think that's such a
great fall like pop of fall type of
palette and I must admit this bite
formula does feel fantastic on my lips
and I absolutely adore this color that
I've come out with which is maybe just a
little lighter considering I layered
Nouri over honeycomb it's probably a
little lighter than nori would be on its
own but I really think that's working
with the berry accents on the eye so
thank you again guys for watching and I
will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
