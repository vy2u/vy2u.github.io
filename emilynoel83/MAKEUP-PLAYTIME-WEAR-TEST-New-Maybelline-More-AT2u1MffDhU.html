today's video I've got a bunch of new
stuff mostly from Maybelline but I have
a few little places where I'm gonna fill
in the blanks with other things but I
was gonna just sit here and play with
the stuff and try it on for the first
time because it literally just came in
the mail yesterday and I personally am
really more of a fan of like a formal
review you know after something's been
tried for a while but I still thought it
would be really fun to turn on the
camera while I tried things out so what
I will do is pay very close attention to
your comments and if there are things
here in this video that you want an
additional like more in-depth like test
it for a couple weeks type deal and then
come back and review it for us if you
want that on something then let me know
but I will take you with me as I do some
check-ins throughout the rest of the day
as well but we're gonna start out with a
new primer this says master prime
hydrate and smooth so a lot of brands
have hydrating primers I mean this seems
to be packaged almost exactly like smash
boxes is but NYX has a good hydrating
one elf does too so I'm just gonna get
some of this out and see how it goes on
I've already moisturized my skin mmm
this feels nice I had actually just been
using Nyx's hydrating primer a little
bit and this feels definitely a little
thicker than that this could be a really
nice thing for dry skin folks it's
really smoothing out easily but it's not
one of those like silicone e smooth
silky primers like the skin just feels
supple like I've double moisturized or
something then that we're releasing this
as new and it says super stay full
coverage and I don't know if that's a
change from the original super stay
formula it's been years since they first
put out super stay like I'm thinking
back to earlier days on my channel when
they actually first released and I'm
always tempted to twist but it's not add
wet stuff it's a pump and I picked up
the shade warm nude so let's just get
about a pump and a half here going on
it does seem a little bit yellowy right
now I'm going to use this brush from
Tarte to buff it out this is from the
holiday set that they're selling at
Sephora
the coverage is the coverage is better
than I ever remember with this
foundation wowza okay and it's setting I
think kind of quickly so I better move
here
I don't ever recall this foundation
being quite this good like I remembered
it being a lot like a Revlon Colorstay
which is good but as you may have seen
when I recently used that I think that's
more medium coverage you know I think
that in normal the drive formula can
actually be rather buildable but this is
like this is pretty dang full coverage
this is giving me I would say nearly
concealer optional skin like I've got a
little bit I might cover up there at
certain angles you can see it more than
others right but like that was good and
it's very matte and I think I'm gonna be
glad for as mad as it is and as fast as
it's set that's a sign that's telling me
I'm probably gonna be glad that I use
that hydrating primer because sometimes
you know foundations that really set in
quick they can tend to look a little
more drying on your skin so maybe it was
no accident that they released the
hydrating primer at the same time ah
coffee is perfect right now see right
after it comes off the cure it gets a
little too hot for me but now it's
perfect now one of the things I'm gonna
sub in since I did not see a new
concealer from Maybelline on ulties
website I have the Urban Decay all
nighter concealer I know a lot of people
are probably curious as to how this
compares to Tarte shaped tape both are
full coverage longwear concealer z' i
got the sorry I'm just making sure
nothing's settling it in an odd way
there I got the pr package and so I had
the whole shade range and I've been kind
of struggling to hone in on my correct
shade of this I've used light warm and
fair neutral and light neutral I think
I'm gonna go ahead and use light neutral
today but I'm not gonna apply a whole
lot just really get it right in here
where I'm darkest because coverage wise
I mean things were pretty well taken
care of right by that foundation but
this can add a little bit of brightness
but this stuff I have been using for the
last several days and I've experienced
good coverage and good staying power and
there is kind of a I don't know it
definitely does dry down like if you're
not a fan of that if you need
that's more emollient and moisturizing
like this is not a real hydrating
concealer but I can just notice it right
away as I blend it in like it's not even
necessarily the kind of thing you would
feel the need to set
the tough thing about it is I'm pairing
it on top of different foundations and
different primers moisturizers and stuff
I need to create some constants here
maybe just test one side compared to the
other versus shape tape you know so I
can really pay attention to how the
concealer itself is doing
to me it seems like it's lacking just a
little coverage compared to shape tape
just because I felt the need to go back
and actually add a little more this
circle here even though it's not
absolutely necessary I have a new
setting matter that I want to try it's
from makeup revolution and it's the
luxury baking powder in ghost and I just
want to try this and see if it's any
good but first you got to outsmart that
sticker over the sifter I'm just gonna
tap a little bit of this in the camp
here so it's a totally white powder this
may be like their take on that like RCM
a powder I'm not gonna do a full-on bake
with this right now just because I
really don't think it's necessary but
I'm going to use a little bit of the
powder just for a light under-eye
setting
it's most definitely going everywhere I
can tell you that much hmm get an
airborne I will have to try this in the
baking capacity and see if it looks as
good as some of the other powders that I
like but it's definitely like ultra
mattifying so if you just even put it on
lightly like I have right now you'll
look super matte and I was already
pretty mad from the foundation don't
worry we got a beast of a highlight
coming up but you know what I don't have
a bronzer so I'm just gonna grab out
some laura geller bronze and Brighton
haven't used this in a little while
really love this bronzer so I'll just
take this around the hairline right
quick
this is such a good bronzer I like fall
in love with it again every time after I
use it next for the blush we're gonna be
using actually a pallet here this is
called the pink edge the city kits
palette and it's really I don't know
kind of different when you look at the
layout of the shades isn't it funny how
like everything is coming right up to
the surface like there's no dip down
into the pants it makes it look so
different when it's packaged that way
but they had this color scheme and then
they had something that seemed from what
I recall on the website very like pastel
and it just didn't really appeal to me
this seemed like more of a full look so
I'm gonna use that blush there we're
gonna see how pigmented this is you
swirl it a little bit on the outside
there this is kind of nice I would say
this is a matte blush and there's a lot
of fallout when you go into it yes I
like that good color but the tough thing
is as you can see you are gonna have
this happening where you get fallout
into the neighboring shades so before
you start digging into your next shade
it's probably best to kind of blow well
Huffer tap off the excess actually off
of the palette itself otherwise things
will probably start to mix there I'm not
a big fan of blowing directly on makeup
but this is my personal palette so
that's one do now what I think I'm gonna
do is use the highlight provided here
because I think this is gonna be a
little bit more perhaps on the subtle
side and we'll see how that looks and
then I have this master holographic and
this I just did like a little finger
swatch of it the other day I don't know
if that's gonna be my jam folks it's
it's very it's glitter right here again
just a little light swipe of the brush
picks up a lot this I can deal with yes
soft and pearly very pretty
we're two for two from this palette
what do you do now when your perfectly
satisfied with your current highlight
you add more highlight I've just got to
try this for you guys because I'm so
curious it's so shiny and if I do a
swatch this is what we're talking about
like you can see kind of a purple pinky
reflective quality to it I'm not really
seeing like the full spectrum you know
to make something holographic and I
really seen like any sort of blueish or
greenish shift to that it's mostly from
what I can tell in this lighting kind of
a pinky shift but we'll see here I'm
picking some up on the brush tapping off
the excess
it seems chunky loading up on the brush
but we'll just put it on here and I
always say you gotta buff a little bit
with certain highlights
it's certainly like intense but mmm I'm
seeing kind of the glitter trail like I
don't know looking up close at it as you
really buff on some of that stuff just
like spades away into the air but it is
just coming off as I would say slightly
pinky it's like a brightened light pink
undertone do the other side it's like
when you first swipe it on you're gonna
see some chunk chunkiness I'm in such
direct lighting here it's almost hard to
see the highlights show as much as it
could but it's the kind of thing got
check your shirt after it be like do I
have high light or dandruff down there
not blown away by that one gotta say I'm
gonna do a little setting mist I did get
a new one here that I wanted to try from
Garnier and it's the soothing facial
mist 99% naturally derived ingredients
vegan formula made with rose water okay
so I'm gonna try that out here the
maiden voyage of a new setting spray is
always a little scary you're like a
brace for it but spray on this is kind
of funky maybe I can go a little closer
like nope that only hit my forehead what
see this is the trial and error I go
through before I shoot a video usually
I'm just not narrating it this I got a
new brow product this is the total
temptation brow definer and I got it in
medium brown so let's pop this puppy out
and see what kind of shape we're working
with the total temptation line by the
way seems to be they also have this
shadow and highlight palette which I
think for the consistency in this video
I'm gonna stick with the pink edge for
the rest of my shadow but there's also
this palette let me know if you're
interested it's highlighters actually
here and then shadows and just judging
by initial swatches this one seemed more
impressive to me and they're also making
a total temptation mascara but back to
the browsing here we've got yeah sort of
a you see how it's kind of that teardrop
shape but it's more of a a petite
teardrop it seems smaller than others
and then look at the size of the spoolie
what like it's teensy it's just I don't
know I guess like
and guess that's gonna work I just I
never seen spooly that small before all
right what else bring it on tiny spoolie
hold me closer tiny spoon what is this
doing anyway let's let's get some
texture of this is kind of like dry
which I do tend to like when you hold it
more going for the tip look at how fine
the line can be it can just be teeny
tiny hairlike strokes when you're using
it more to get the full on surface area
of that teardrop shape you're gonna get
thicker however you're inevitably gonna
wear down the fine part of the tip you
know with time always something to be
aware of with these sort of shaped brow
products but the color is on point for
me
I don't hate it I feel like it did the
job pretty quick and I had still had a
lot of control little spooley doing its
job
do your thing spoolie okay I don't know
why this kind of excites me I've only
had like one sip of coffee yet today Oh
another new thing that I found you guys
in Walmart was a the kiss brows stamp
I think it's kiss that makes it but it's
a brow stamp and I was thinking it was
literally like an inky kind of stamp but
it's like a powder you know it's it's a
sponge that you're dipping into a pretty
you know rich colored powder and then
you can stamp it on and it has virtually
no effect it seems like with my brows
because my browser just so dark and are
pretty shaped you know anyway like
there's I just have a lot of natural
brow that's thinking this could be a
really bad parenting decision or maybe
this could be awesome but um I was
thinking I don't even know for once it's
that love but should I do the brows
stamp on bail or Eve or both maybe just
to see I mean it would brush right off
right or am I just opening up the
floodgates to all sorts of crazy makeup
application on those two I can hear the
comments now just let them be kids don't
put makeup on what if it's just for my
own entertainment value what if I've
just had a really hard day and I want to
stamp some brows on my children is that
so wrong
I hope you all have a sense of humor
today okay here we go
of course you do excuse of my tiny
spoolie here
tiny spoolie is the real MVP here I feel
a lot of control with that situation I
feel very safe with the little spoolie
and I just need a little gel the thing
about when you're using a really dry
pencil there's gonna be virtually no
hole in your brows so my brows need a
little something so I'm using this og
covergirl gel here which I don't even
love I mean it's so loaded with product
you take it out and it's super goopy but
I don't have any of the NYX control
freak on me at the moment so also gonna
need to pull in a little eye shadow
primer I'll just use Milani I have so
many brows strokes on my hand and like
turning into a bit of a werewolf over
here okay so our little pink edge
palette this is the way it's claims to
be laid out okay blush highlight we've
got that and then it says look one over
here and look two over here I hadn't
even noticed that till I really paid
attention to the back I don't know if
we'll really play by those rules today
but we'll see I'm gonna do a little
mothy crease action here because I like
Mavi creases
these are like a nice a really nice
softness to these shadows it's really
yeah applying nicely and applying very
true to color in a quick way you know
not a lot of fussy build-up a little
fallout but the fallout at least on that
shade is not as ridiculous as it was
with the blush or the highlight it might
just be the brush that I'm approaching
it with though you know like a smaller
brush isn't gonna necessarily create as
much but I'm still tapping off excess
just FYI now I feel like I want to go
even more with that same shade and just
build it some like take it out more get
it going a little more dramatic style
here it's a really pretty shade and I
love that it just didn't turn to like
murky whatever color on my eyes like you
can really see that ma Finas the pink
eNOS in this okay next I got to see what
this shades gonna do is this plum I'm
gonna actually show up with some color
as well just Pat that on the outside
here are you ready for some plum
everybody because it's coming at you
this is good this feels nice I think we
got a good like matte and shimmer
balance happening in here they do have a
matte cream color there's a shimmery
like rose gold in there as well which
I'm kind of tempted to put on my lids no
I'm just blending I don't really have
anything on my brush here but I'm sort
of blending between the mauve and the
plum in the crease
and then I think we'll use this matte
creamy color as a highlight very nice
and now I think we got to see what the
rose gold is made of so I'm going to tap
into that I've been really disappointed
with shimmery shades lately from certain
palettes so this is doing pretty good
though there's just a little dryness to
it I don't think it's really hurting the
color payoff too much but it looks
pretty I think alongside and the other
colors so you see what I mean like I
keep going back adding a little bit more
and more of that and I'm gonna see what
this color does brightening lives just
around the inner corner see that's kind
of nice the mats are really really
smooth and nice in here now I got two
lasting drama liners and they're more
like kind of statement type liners like
accessory liners not really something
you're gonna necessarily use to define
your upper lash line but I got moonlight
purple and shiny bronze I'm gonna swatch
them both although I think I'm gonna use
the shiny bronze with this look I have
had really good luck with Maybelline's
retractable liners in the past so I'm
excited okay the caps looked promising
I really like the copes I thought this
shiny bronze was gonna look more um
taupey I guess both very metallic and
they had some different shades I think
they had some deeper colors too I don't
know now I do kind of want to use that
moonlight purple a little bit more I
think I'm gonna use it on my lower lash
line it goes on like absolute but a
really nice and I think what I'll end up
doing is um I'll put something kind of
brightening in my lower inner rim and
maybe smudge over the outer part of this
with some of the shadow in here
ah that's better this is my wet and wild
an ultimate brow highlighter by the way
you wouldn't think a brow product would
be great in your lower inner rim but
this stays well it's the perfect tome
for me so yes all about it now this tone
we got working on the lower lash line a
little more cool and practically bluish
especially compared to the mauve set top
so I'm gonna take a little bit of this
plum and kind of overlap the outside and
maybe help it make sense a little bit
more with everything else like still let
a little bit of it pop on the inside but
you know I'm saying I'm kind of going
between both of these
I'm gonna use the total temptation
mascara so I am NOT putting any liner on
my upper lashes because that's how we
can best see what it's doing and this I
have used a few times like it was one of
those situations where my Ulta order
came in two different boxes like one box
came on what was it Saturday and then
two days later the other came and this
came before all the other Maybelline
stuff which was odd but the brush right
here is really my cup of tea it's thick
with bristles it's a little bit tapered
toward the tip it's well it's kind of on
the big side but it's not ridiculous you
know I don't feel like I see good
effects from this until I build it up
with the second coat like see how it's
doing a little something here and I'm
not really mad about that but it's more
profound when I come back in just a
couple seconds and add more but I do get
a little disappointed by the curl
holding of this I think lash paradise
holds the curl better for me but you
know I am curl challenged with my lashes
they just they want to be so straight it
looks to me like both Belle and Eve are
getting the thickness and curl actually
of their dads lashes but their hair
color and the darkness of their lashes
is coming from me so that could be like
a perfect lash storm right there well
now that I've used is a few times it's
building up like a little bit better
than it did on the very first
application like when I first put this
on it just seemed to kind of slip
through the lashes you know now it's
it's clinging a little better but once I
go back and I add more over here then I
can see more length and more thickness
start to build with with coat number two
which is not really surprising probably
to anybody it's just a little different
for me because with lash paradise that
stuff was you know Vava voom usually
with one coat now what I have not yet
tried with this mascara is doing lower
lashes so just for the heck of it I'm
gonna put a little bit of this down
there and we'll just see if this smudges
off throughout the day I kind of like
the shininess of that liner sort of
peeking through
I used to have a really good liner from
Maybelline and it was like the perfect
oh no you see what happened there spec's
my gut tells me like wipe him off
immediately but I know you need to let
those dry and then they'll flake off
okay let's see oh they're not really
flaking off they're just kind of
blending into my skin and looking
slightly dark not layering on more
concealer I'm just gonna take a little
more ghost powder and see if that can
save me here yeah I don't know it's fine
we're just playing okay we're just
trying things out having a little play
time it's no big deal the lip options
are vast here I'll tell you what I was
playing with last night they have
something called a powder matte lip and
I have cruel Ruby I put this on last
night it's it's dry as can be it is like
a almost a powdery matte finish like it
feels trying to lick your lips and it's
just I guess the benefit from this might
be that there's absolutely no appearance
of shine on your lips but it's not a
real smooth application and I wasn't
that wowed by the staying power of this
either
I love Maybelline's regular matte
lipstick formula just judging by the
website this was the only shade of the
powder mattes that really appealed to me
but I just I not a formula I'm really
into
please please pick up the cat food the
other lip thing that I got these did I
not call this and some of you have
already tweeted me and you're like they
did come out with nudes I said the super
stay matte inks are probably gonna
release like a whole line of neutrals
because they only had like one nude in
the whole bunch before so I got
Amazonian which looks to be kind of like
a brownish it looked like sort of a
rusty brown on the website and then I
got poet which seems to be a straight-up
nude like a little bit peach and then
they've got this Python metallic lip kit
I'm kind of tempted to try this although
I don't know that the color of it would
look that great with what I've got going
on on my look today like I really would
rather wear one of those nude matte inks
but I'm just going to show you the
packaging it's a two-step thing where
there's a lip color and then they say
metallic powder well let's just open it
up and see again I'm really gonna be
referring to the comment section as far
as what things you really want to know
more about or you know see another look
with or whatever but here it is this is
the lip color feels creamy feels just
like I don't know
very classic red cream lipstick not
especially matte it feels like a cream
and then this powder gosh it feels like
just a really creamy eyeshadow there
it's definitely somewhere between a
cream and a powder it's not a pure
powder like it's not a powder that's
gonna make fallout or anything but if
you dab them together you do end up
getting a little bit of a sheen on there
let's add a little bit more you know I
see it happening it's kind of cool I
haven't tried it on my lips yet so I'm
not gonna fully judge this one see my
lashes are falling so bad and they're
still drying good lord
I didn't realize the dry time was this
intense they're like the length is not
awful but man okay let's pick one of
these let's see this would probably be
most appropriate with my look but I'm
really curious about this brownie kind
of color so maybe we'll combine the two
I love the matte ink
by the way they smell a little more
coconuty than I remember did they smell
like coconuts before
now before that gets really dried I
think what I'm going to do is just dab a
little bit of this lighter shade into
the center of the lid
that's a pretty look I am really glad
that they put out some more neutral
shades I think it really completes the
line you know in terms of these because
they had bright reds and different kind
of fuchsia colors I'm excited to have
these two I may explore those even more
because I know it's a great formula it's
like comfortable thin staying power is
really intense with those so a nice
drugstore matte lip option just kind of
looking over what else I have here I
mean I was really impressed with both of
these the primer was nice it was very
hydrating I thought more so than my NYX
primer and perhaps even felt a little
thicker than my smashbox hydrating
primer and then the super stay full
coverage like came to play today i mean
this was really truly full coverage you
can see on my skin it's just really
getting me nice even coverage we'll see
how well that wears because you know as
you can see now i'm very matte I also
did add to the madness with a little
Urban Decay concealer which we can also
keep an eye on and the revolution makeup
revolution ghost powder I was really
pretty impressed by this pink edge kit I
thought the blush was nice the highlight
was beautiful on these berry shades in
here were really really good excited to
get some more use out of these liners
because I think that's gonna be a fun
little step and they went on so easily
and they do set the swatches are not
going anywhere on my hand and they're
not even flaking off any shimmer even
though these are really metallic
shimmery eyeliners the holographic
highlight I definitely prefer what was
in this palette for my taste still need
to try the total temptation palette the
mascara is a Miss for me the brow
product was alright I am going to
continue using them and the mascara for
the record still does not feel dry I'm
doing this to see if you know as you
kind of hold your lashes in place as
they dry if I can get a little more curl
like working in there but I'm fascinated
by the fact that the mascara has still
not dried and I only put on two semi
light coats like I've kicked up mascara
and more than that before that's for
sure anyway thank you guys for watching
I hope you enjoyed this little makeup
playtime here again I would have just
done this and not even turned the camera
on as I'm trying these things out
initially but maybe this was fun to
watch let me know if you liked it and I
will
again very soon by just a little check
in here mainly for the sake of the
foundation it's looking really good I
think overall on most of my face it's
maybe looking just a hair more lived-in
if you know what I mean like you can see
just a hint of glow there on the nose
we'll call that globe but maybe you know
just a hint of oiliness but it's nothing
bad everything still looks even nothing
looks really patchy I can see a little
dryness like maybe a bit around my
eyebrows maybe I didn't mooster eyes as
well as I could have in that area the
overall I think it's looking really nice
but I got to tell you in like broad
daylight that holographic highlight is a
bit much I can totally see the glitter
in that and I don't like seeing how it's
drifted to other parts of my face so as
expected that's kind of a no-go the
lower liner is still looking fierce and
eyeshadow looks good too and the lip
color has hung in through a slice of
leftover pizza and the pears that little
bit didn't eat so there we go okay we
are looking at the makeup now after gosh
what is it
1112 hours somewhere in there I think
it's actually wearing quite well I'm
seeing a lot of evenness maybe just a
little breakdown around the nose it's
definitely a little shinier than it was
like at midday but overall looking
pretty good the wear of the eye shadow
is quite good as well you can have the
ghost sticker that's fine the lip color
is because it's a neutral shade even as
it wears down just slightly it's not
super obvious so I like that but yeah
I'd say I'm pretty impressed this
go-round with the foundation and I'll
continue experimenting with it maybe
some different primers different
application methods and yeah I will
follow up on that one thing I will throw
in here just in reference to the
concealer I was looking up really close
at it and and it may or may not be
showing on camera here but it it
definitely does look kind of dry it's
not awful but it's a little more dryness
than I'm used to seeing and I have
noticed a little bit of this in previous
days whether I've used any kind of
setting powder on top of it or not it
just it has the dry down and
and it can continue to look a little dry
and you're definitely still seeing that
pesky glitter from the highlight so
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
