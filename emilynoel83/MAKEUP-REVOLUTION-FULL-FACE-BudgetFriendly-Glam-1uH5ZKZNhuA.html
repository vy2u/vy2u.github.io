first
is this cute is this goofy little from
column a a little from column B I got
this from ulta I really really like it
actually it keeps my hair off my face
while I'm doing my makeup and I also
have a bunny ears one point of today's
video is to do a full face or as much of
a face as I can do in terms of the
products that I have with makeup
revolution so here in the US this is
available at Ulta
do you remember around the time when
makeup revolution first became available
here in the States and Ulta and I did a
video like trying tons and tons of
different palettes some of the first
ones that they like came in to Ulta
launching at that time and since that
time they have come out with a lot of
different things so I have been
inundated with requests to talk about
some of their different palettes and
other products too they are known for
doing some palettes that are sort of
dupe type palettes also just a lot of
original palettes to the line as well
but I've gotten some fantastic palettes
that are from less than $10 to like $15
there's just some extraordinary and
surprising quality in this line in this
video I've got a real powerhouse eye
shadow palette that's like $7 and I
really really like that but a lot of
things that I did discuss the first time
around when I did a big devoted makeup
revolution palette video a lot of those
things are still on the market so I will
link to that video below if you want a
roundup on some of those things but this
will sort of be the newer Edition so
what I'm going to start out with is just
a little light coverage on the skin
because I am gonna demo their concealer
here and I don't want too much coverage
underneath helping out these under-eye
circles but I must say I'm loving this
Garnier skin active BB this is the light
to medium oily combo skin formula
wouldn't normally think I'm early to
combo but this wears like so well again
about that much going on here
and I dab this all over you could blend
this in with your fingers but I really
like using a brush you know it's just a
really precise thing as you can see this
is my little airbrush complexion brush
from Ecotools and I will just buff this
in it's by no means a full coverage
product on the skin but it covers really
nicely and looks really really fresh as
far as BB creams are concerned for a
long time that Rimmel BB cream had been
a big favorite of mine but this
maybe edging that out you've been a
little bit I just really really love the
look on ya and it's warm so well on me -
I think maybe part of that is that combo
oily thing coming in and not getting me
too greasy as the day goes on I would
say the skin does look matte but it's
not like unnaturally so like I can still
see some natural kind of skin like Sheen
I suppose coming off of there but I just
really like that product now I'm gonna
be using the conceal and define full
coverage conceal and contour and I have
this in the shade c5 and I do think this
is definitely definitely in my best
shade because I started out with this
line using c4 and I found that to be
just a little too light going in I would
have thought that would be my perfect
shade but I just wasn't getting the best
coverage out of it and then I just
bumped it down a little bit out of shade
that was a little better skin tone match
for me and the coverage it made a
surprising amount of difference so I did
talk about this in my 5 like new
drugstore products worth trying video in
that video in the demo I blended this
out with a Beauty Blender so in this
video I think I'm gonna use a brush
either method does work really nicely
but you don't need to over apply this
product and in terms of a comparison to
Tarte shape tape I don't feel like it's
the exact same thing as Tarte shaped
tape as I said in that last video using
my Sigma P 80 brush here heart-shaped
tape is a very very potent concealer and
for this to give me the same effective
shape tape I have to apply just a little
bit more just like the amount I did
there with shape tape I might just do
two tiny dots you know but this
concealer is just a little more
lightweight in consistency and that may
be a good thing for some people who
couldn't make shape tape work but they
do wear very similarly and they have a
very similar like texture on the skin
once they sort of set they're not super
tacky products it's a really nice matte
coverage there on the skin as you can
see so I just take this brush and sort
of spread it about where I want to get
it all the way up there to the lower
lash line I'll even take some of that
product and draw it down to cover the
redness on the
my nose but definitely that inner most
cavernous what I'm looking to conceal
and I end up coming away SuperDuper
satisfied with this coverage that I'm
getting another option if you feel like
you have the darkest of the dark
under-eye circles and you want to amp
this up even more
you might layer a peachy tone corrector
underneath and really target the bluish
tone circles that you have but as you
can see I did have some and I feel like
this really did a great job with them
now I want to have a little chitchat
about loose powders for baking I have a
couple from makeup revolution here I
have the luxury baking powder in ghost
so this is just a white powder if you've
tried the RCM a powder this is almost
exactly like that and then I also have
the shade lace I've heard people refer
to this as a banana powder but it really
isn't that yellow and I'm gonna show you
something actually I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say makeup revolution is giving
their take on the Ben Nye luxury powders
this is what banana looks like this is
the thing that years back like Kim
Kardashian's makeup artist was using
this on her and that really put this
product on the map and lace is not as
yellow as that lace seems to be a direct
like dupe of the Ben Nye powder in buff
so a little bit more along the lines of
a match to a baby skin tone it would
appear however when I bake with this on
my under eye area for my skin tone I
feel like it ends up being just a hint
too dark and I don't always notice that
right after I apply it sometimes I
notice it after a couple of hours and I
feel like this whole area just ends up
being a little darker than I want it
might be perfect for a little deeper
skin tone than me but as far as makeup
revolutions line goes the ghost powder
is kind of like my ideal thing to use so
I shake up the little container here and
I actually will use the little cap and
just tap a little product in there and
then use a Beauty Blender or any sponge
that's been slightly dampened and you
can just bake your concealer not that
this is an absolute necessity step for
this concealer because I mean I was
pleased with the coverage I was pleased
with the madness but this tends to just
make me look extra flawless and just
shoot silky smooth awesome staying power
baking is not maybe some
thing everyone wants to do but if you
want to experiment try different things
you know go for it
also sometimes baked right down the nose
and this little area kind of up in
between the brows if you like it sort of
smooths and brightens that and then I'll
sometimes bring it right down here along
the jawline also and it's sort of I
don't know maintains a little brightness
in that zone especially in contrast with
any contour that I'll do there
and I do feel like this is an effective
baking powder it's never made the look
of my concealer look any deeper or
anything but baking your conceal and
define concealer is not an absolute must
do step I'm just kind of trying to show
you as much as I can from the line a lot
of times I'll be content to just use a
little light setting powder maybe maybe
just use the ghost powder with a very
soft brush dust over it get that texture
completely like silky smooth and just
call it a day but while we're baking
while we're looking a little funny here
clearly I don't have any issues with
looking funny we're going to do brows
and a product I love for makeup
revolution for brows is the brow pomade
I think this works really really well
for me I love the texture of this
because it's not too creamy ok so
there's an element of dryness in this
that makes it very easy to control um if
you've ever used anything in your brows
that was a little too goopy a little too
creamy maybe you've found that it's hard
to get only the bare minimum in your
brows so this works great I wear it in
medium brown comes with the little
angled brush another neat thing about
this product is the fact that it doubles
as color and hold it's a lot like a
product from Too Faced a pomade Too
Faced had out quite a while back I'm
completely blanking on the name but I
think it was called like bulletproof
brows very very similar texture that
okay now that browser complete I'm just
going to take this small tapered brush
and I'm going to begin to dust away the
powder that was used to set that
under-eye here
very matte very very even skin so that's
the end result from that step now I've
got a couple different contouring
products I want to mention here this is
a newer thing that I got it's called
Bronson glow it's got that cute little
chocolate bar design here and given the
tone of the powder it kind of reminds me
a little bit of the Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow it's a very very
light contour shade and then this pretty
sort of soft pearlescent highlight so I
do like this product but the contour
shade that I definitely like best comes
from their ultra contour palette I just
love this palette this is a fantastic
tool for contouring the powder textures
are so so soft and these shades right
here if you need any sort of a matte
powder to add a little brightness this
is great and then this contour shape for
me is just so on point so I'm gonna be
using my ELF studio complexion brush dab
into that contour and just give myself a
little something right over here I've
mentioned this before but I'm trying to
keep from taking the contour too low on
my face as I think it can kind of drag
you down a bit so I'm just keeping it
just a little higher than I might have
normally gone in the past but I love
this shade it's the perfect combination
of a little bit of coolness but also
it's not just too super grey I don't
have to hold my own hair back here
because at this lovely headband
and it will take a little bit this down
the neck as well such a great shade
for blush here's what's up we're gonna
be talking about one of their newer
palettes this is the pro HD amplified
palette and this is called get baked and
it says 15 highlighters although to me
this really seems like a combo blush and
highlighter palette I see shades here
that are clearly blushes and there's
varying intensities of highlighters so
we've got some that are really really
soft like this one called Oh pearl is
pretty pronounced I love this color
called sweet it sort of reminds me of
the effect you get from a Becca opal
highlight the other day I wore this as a
blush and I thought oh my gosh is it
gonna be crazy but then I remember
reading this thing on Twitter that said
if you go for more like plummy berry
blushes that's more like the tone that
your skin naturally produces when you
look flushed and I never really realized
that this is the kind of thing where I
feel like yes I like what's in here I
don't know that I'm meeting this massive
of a selection you know what I'm saying
but there are some good points in here
I'm gonna use lit this is this sort of
pinky glowy blush I'd call what I'm
hitting the sort of outer part of the
apple of my cheek with that taking it up
a bit just like my contour I'm not
trying to drop the blush to low but it's
interesting how some of these shades
that you might use as a blush are not
out-of-control shimmery I just kind of
build it up little by little and buff it
in kind of circular motion style I don't
know about you but I think that's fresh
as a daisy and then I think I will use
pearl as my highlight somebody shades a
little bit on the flaky side that they
do apply with much intensity much much
intensity lay it on and then as with any
highlight that I feel like it's kind of
pronounced buff it in really take a
little extra time to just buff it in and
then it stops looking like just a glowy
streak that's sitting on top of your
skin
put a little on the cupids pillow do a
little on the nose but this sort of
feels like to me it's like a blown-up
version of their blush palette like this
which is called the blush palette queen
and it has a bunch of you know blushes
with a sheen several that could
definitely be used as highlights so if
this seems like a bit much in terms of
selection or you're just not looking for
that amount of product you might look to
this also funny enough the shade called
pearl that I use that super glowy
highlight is right here at the end of
the contour palette that I just used
next I'm gonna go to a setting mist or a
primer mist that I love it's called the
pro base aqua priming base I have really
really liked this if you're one who has
also enjoyed the hard candy sheer envy
primer mist this gives me very much the
same effect as that and so I just do a
few mists I feel like that really just
takes the surface of the skin and on
contact makes you look a little more
dewy and I really like that so now I've
put on a little bit of eyeshadow primer
and the palettes I was talking about
these seven dollar palettes that are so
so nice I got two of them off of ulties
website there are even more options
there's one that definitely has the same
kind of color scheme as Nastasia
subculture for that one and another
we're out of stock but I did get this
one that kind of reminds me of modern
Renaissance this is called reloaded
iconic vitality and then I got this one
that is very very pinky rosy this is
called reloaded iconic neutrals and ewt
RLS - this has a lot of warm Brown rosy
shades obviously some kind of peachy
orange colors in there as well the issue
I find I come to with this palette is
just not enough depth not enough rich
dark shades that can really provide a
lot of contrast with the eyes I mean
it's a wonderful library of rosy colors
if that's what you like and then you
could plug in other shades that you have
but this one seems to be a bit more
well-rounded in terms of creating a full
look plus I do have some of that rosy
brightness as well but I mean the matte
formula here is knocking my socks off
these shadows apply so smoothly evenly
rich easy to control and the shimmers
are no slouch either I mean those are
great but I just think the biggest
surprise to me with these palettes came
the quality of the mats I think what I'm
going to start with is this shade right
here in the center and I'm just gonna
build up a little crease color here so
you can see just a little product on the
brush you know I tapped off the excess
and I've got plenty to get that nice
soft crease color
sorry about any glare bouncing off the
tip of my nose right early hit that with
some highlighter earlier and it's
glowing like I almost have to come away
from looking at it like I just looked at
the Sun or something
okay so that's a beautiful soft way to
get things going in the crease and now I
want to deepen that up a little bit I'm
gonna go to the red that's right down
here real nice berry red get a little
bit of that on my brush I'm just gonna
start blending that into my outer corner
ever try like a dupe palette of
something and then your love for that
type of palette just kind of gets
reinvigorated like I think I may have
forgotten how much I loved the modern
renaissance color scheme for a little
while here and then I tried this pout
and I'm like oh yes these colors look so
nice together but this was seven dollars
so I loved that just taken a bear fluffy
brush and blending around the outside of
what I just did there and then I think
I'll go ahead and apply this shade right
here as highlight
next up I want to bring in even more
richness I'm gonna go to this sort of
cranberry brown mix color here it's very
interesting it's like the perfect red
and neutral fusion and I'm going to
start patting this on the outer part of
my eyelid
how pretty is that tone I mean I'm all
about that and then to kind of amp up
that lid let's pop on some of this
golden e shimmer this is largely a matte
palette here by the way so if you are a
matte shadow lover I mean the only real
shimmers we've got this sort of pinky
pearly shimmer this golden shimmer and
this brownish color right up here has
some machine to it other than that
you've got a fabulous mix of these
beautifully textured mattes sometimes
with makeup revolution shimmers I feel
like I want to press the brush down I've
mentioned this technique with other
brands as well press the brush down on
the skin and give a slight tug and
that's when you get the best light color
pack on payoff the best intensity let's
call it it's the old press and drag
babies okay looking good mmm I love that
I love that soft gold and I like how
it's not so brassy it's just like the
softest hint of gold in that shade and
the way that fades into the rusty red is
just fantastic
you love mattes if you love this kind of
color scheme and you love bargains you
won't get you some of this on my lower
lash line I'm gonna take this shade that
has a little bit of shimmer but it's
more brownish and I think I'll just
lightly smudge it just a gentle smudge
down in here you know anytime something
starts happening on the lower lash line
the mouth has to go like this just a
mandatory thing I can't explain it
unwritten rule with makeup I'm not
really trying to make a statement here
on the lower lash line I just sort of
want to define it in the softest way and
then what if we took this pearly shimmer
and just bob to that right here yeah
that's what I'm talking about
now here are a few things I don't have
from makeup revolution eyeliner mascara
and lashes so I'm going to go ahead and
use my Milani stay put in that my
Neutrogena hydro boots plumping mascara
gonna pop those on find some lashes as
well
oh I'm also going to use my wet and wild
ultimate brow highlight let me just show
you that see what this does for the eye
right here
ba-ba-boom but i'll do those other steps
and then we will talk lips okay guys I'm
back I've got my beautiful red cherry
number 43 type lash there and I had a
thought I thought maybe it might be fun
to do a little bit more of a smoked out
but with a soft color on the lower lash
line like now that I'm seeing the whole
look come together I'm wondering if
maybe you like a little bit of these two
shades here in the palette and I'm
taking this Real Techniques this is
called the insta pop Reese brush but
it's got this perfect little wedge shape
angle to it and it's great for smoky
lower liner and yeah I am liking the way
that looks down there it's nice and soft
on the smudgy side
and now that I've done that just a
little more Oh more mascara there
another thing that I forgot to mention
earlier that I just wanted to give a
shout out to these are the highlighter
liquid highlighter drops the champagne
color I love this I have mentioned this
numerous times on my channel already so
I didn't really feel the need to show a
demo of it today since I was talking all
about that larger palette but these I
love this specific shade I mean I know
there are other shades but this one is
just so glowing and beautiful on the
skin but in terms of lips thinking about
what I've tried from makeup revolution
not a huge fan of the matte liquid
lipsticks that they've put out I found
this to be very very drying they have
cream lipsticks that are called
Renaissance lipstick and they are in
like a rose gold tube and I think those
are wonderful I've tried some great
shades there and most recently I've
tried there life on the dancefloor
lipsticks I think they have some
different families of these and I bought
all of the gold ones and I loved them
all it's just a great little wardrobe of
nude lips here and the packaging is so
lovely in fact my very most favorite Eve
when she was up here the other day she
grabbed it and she gouged it up but
these are so soft and creamy this color
is called exclusive then we have elite
which is a little lighter and more pinky
than kind of a classic sort of peachy
nude here this shade is called
invite-only but yeah these are super
affordable
such lovely lipsticks and if you're into
nudes I mean you know I think what I'm
gonna do with this look I'm gonna take
invite-only that was that last one that
i swatched i'm gonna get a little bit of
that going right here in the center of
the lower lip my lips have been really
dry by the way I've had a cold lately
and then I'm going to take exclusive
which is the deepest is like the
dustiest of dusty roses I'm gonna take
that here it's so creamy I feel like
it's the same sort of smell as those
renaissance lipsticks too
I'm just gonna kind of mush that lighter
shade into the mix here oh I'm in love
with that look and that shade yes do I
even want to take this off at this point
do I just want to wear this for the
entire day
well I will take it off the looks not
official til the hair comes out of
whatever Clipper headband I got it back
in but I am loving this look I am so
impressed by the coverage which you guys
saw I used a BB cream at the start of
this so my main coverage my main
evenness coming through there is that
concealer and it's so so smooth and the
staying power is really wonderful just
looking at some other things in my
basket here I mean those lipsticks were
phenomenal love those liquid highlight I
mentioned if you want a really easy to
manage brow pomade I think they're
definitely doing that stuff right $7 eye
shadow palettes as I said just wonderful
quality if you're a major matte lover
and you like the kind of color scheme
that's coming from modern Renaissance
I think you will absolutely love this
because it's mostly matte and as you can
see with this look I got this kind of
coppery red gold thing going on with the
soft Browns and the more rusty Reds but
they do have the pinky kind of berry
tones that can take it in a completely
different direction so I love that
palette this one I mean not quite so
versatile in terms of the depth of looks
like you'll want to pull in a super dark
brown or a plum or a black to kind of
balance this guy out as far as contour
you stuff goes if you're very
fair-skinned you might enjoy on this
little guide it's a super soft easy to
work with contour shade Here I am so so
deeply in love with the ultra contour
palette which has been around for quite
a while and I continue to enjoy the heck
out of that this palette here it's
question of a mountain whether this is
too much for you I do love what's going
on in here it's just a lot of it and
like I said earlier there are other ways
to get a little more bite-sized amount
of things here but that blush I think is
gorgeous and this highlight which also
appears in this palette the ultra
contour palette
I mean I'm loving that and usually like
highlights don't even show up that well
in this full-on lighting that I sit here
in go into a slightly dim room and then
look at your highlight and you'll see
how much it like glows off your skin but
for this to even be showing up here and
now I think it's great here's another
thing I'm going to throw out to you
though beyond what I've shown in this
video they have all those palettes that
kind of look like chocolate bar
why some time ago my friend Eric had
gifted me one of those kinds of pallets
and now they're all pretty much readily
available on oldest side but I really
think there are some hidden gems within
that kind of range of products and I'm
starting to think before doing this
video like that could be a whole other
thing in itself like rating and ranking
all of those different makeup revolution
chocolate bar things if that sounds
interesting to you let me know in the
comments section but thank you guys so
much for your time today thank you for
watching and requesting this video it
was my pleasure to do it I had so much
fun and I will talk to you guys later
