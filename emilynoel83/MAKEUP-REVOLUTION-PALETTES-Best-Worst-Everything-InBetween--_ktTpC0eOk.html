finally doing a video on all of my
makeup revolution palettes all 23 of
them will be mentioned in this video
because at first I was going back and
forth like do I just give top 5 and a
bottom 5 or what about all the things
that are in the middle and then I
thought no let's just take away all room
for question and give every palette some
sort of classification so I've got like
a best or favorites category I've got
sort of a middle average category and
then a worst category of course these
are my opinions but I really wanted to
wait until I was fully ready to shoot
this video for you I like to be really
sure about what I say because I know
people might spend money based on what I
say so I'm not going to spend too much
time on any one palette but I think I'm
going to start with the ones that I like
the least on because I think that will
give you a little background as we get
into the best ones and give you a little
bit of like a frame of reference now the
packaging on all of these palettes is
remarkably similar most of them have
like this kind of glossy black exterior
very simple I almost wish there would be
a little more difference between them
just for the ease of grabbing one and
knowing what you're getting but hey
that's okay you're not paying a lot for
these palettes around ten dollars for a
lot of them so one palette I didn't like
so much is this ultra professional
corrector palette so you've got all
these like really pastel looking
corrector shapes
honestly I feel like I need even though
my skin tone isn't super dark or
anything I feel like I need more depth
and more pigmentation in these shades
more coverage in these shades to
actually correct something and I'm
really looking at you you know your
peachy shades over here because those
really aren't able to do enough because
they're so light on my skin so if I put
those over a dark circle it just
lightens my circle a little bit but it
doesn't erase it all so texture wise I
find these to be a little bit on the
greasy side once they planned out you
know very very thin so I was not
impressed with that and as you might
expect I wasn't really impressed with
the ultra cover and concealer palette
which I have in light/medium you know
you've got a variety of skin tone
concealer type shades here but it's a
very similar texture to what I mentioned
in the
other palate it kind of thins out so
much that I don't feel like these chains
maintain a lot of coverage now maybe you
don't need a lot of coverage and you're
thinking well for a light coverage and
you know having a whole spectrum of
shades maybe that interests you but for
me concealer wise outside of that tart
wipeout palette I'm finding that a lot
of you know massive concealer palettes
aren't really doing it for me and I'm
more content to really hone in on one
specific formula of a product that I
really really like and just go for that
is I feel like I just had been
disappointed by a lot of different
concealer palettes that are out there
one makeup revolution blush palette that
I really wouldn't recommend is this
blush palette Queen and this one does
have the clear window and I think I
mentioned this in a haul video or
something how this is just a bunch of
really shimmery blushes and there's not
a whole lot of difference between them
you've got kind of lighter pinks a
little bit deeper pinks at times they're
pretty to look at in the palette but
honestly as far as color payoff on the
cheeks they all look really really
similar so I feel like it doesn't really
constitute having eight different shades
a general look that you get from this
palette could have been accomplished by
like two colors I think now a couple of
eyeshadow palettes that I just could not
really get into for makeup revolution
are the two on 32 color palettes that I
try I think there are even more 32 color
palettes beyond what I've got here but I
have the flawless two and it seemed like
a really you know big range of neutrals
and these are small and it seems like a
little larger than the size of a dime
maybe and I just felt like there was a
lot of inconsistency with this palette
you know I went toward deeper shades
these kind of rusty colors I thought
they did really nicely from dark Browns
I was very impressed with but some of
these mid tone mattes which there are a
lot of them I just I didn't quite see
the need for so many because a lot of
them were looking very sheer and very
similar to one another so I'm going to
be talking about a lot of other
eyeshadow palettes coming up and I just
found these this is the one called
mermaids forever
I found these 32 palettes to be more
toward the bottom of my list there were
certain shades like this kind of aqua
green were like whoa that is just
fantastic and then I go to this metallic
pink over here it's like it's barely
showing up so I
wish there was just a little more
consistency had there been more
consistency I'd probably be recommending
this now I want to move into my average
category so these are pallets that I
still think are usable some people might
like them but I'm not going to give them
my fullest recommendation in this video
one of them is the all about bronze to
pala and I personally like this palette
but I'm really trying to look critically
at this and all the other things that I
have there are a lot of kind of similar
shades happening in this palette and I
think a lot of people might get it and
think you know what was the point of
having the eight different colors I did
use a little bit of this today use like
these two shades down here and this one
that has a little bit of shimmer and I
like the way it warmed up my skin but is
it an absolute must-have I'm kind of
putting it more in my in-betweener as
you will see I have a lot of makeup
revolution face related palettes that I
adore you got to draw the line somewhere
and this golden sugar to rose gold like
this palette as well it's got two kind
of interesting very normal shades over
here and then a bunch of really highly
shimmery shades and I guess I'm just not
finding myself reaching for this one
very much I've had it in my collection
for a while and it does have this wide
variety of highlighter glowy type shades
but as you will see as I continue onto
the palettes I really liked it's kind of
similar to one that I liked but I found
to be even more versatile than this so I
just haven't been using that one a whole
lot also this blush palette that's
called the blush palette melts this is
just a cream blush palette I didn't find
there to be quite enough difference
between all these shades you know you
can see a little bit of a spectrum
happening here you know you've got some
rosy shades some Pink's but I feel like
a lot of them come off really similarly
by the time they're sheared out on your
cheeks and I do find the formula to be a
little bit thin a little bit on the
greasy side whereas some cream blushes
that I try I feel like they're
practically staining my cheeks these I
didn't feel like they had the best
staying power and two eyeshadow palettes
that I'm putting in my average category
are the salvation palette iconic Pro one
and two and these have kind of a matte
finish on the outside as you can see and
these are definitely makeup
Lucian's take on Bloor opera one and two
palates and I guess my issue here is
that I love my lorac pro one and two
palettes I think the formula the texture
of those shadows is just impeccable
they're all really really consistent you
know every shadow in those palettes
seems to be a really good quality and
with these palettes I just felt like
something was missing and I noticed just
such a pronounced difference with the
texture compared to lorac it's like they
may have been able to duplicate the
overall look of the palettes at a glance
but I think these are a long way off
from being able to perform like the
lorac Pro one and two palettes if I had
to choose one of these as being better
than the other I think the iconic Pro
one is a little bit better and more
consistent than the iconic Pro - this is
the one I use today and I've been
playing around with this and I just
couldn't quite put my finger on what was
happening but I feel like because these
shades aren't quite as pigmented as all
the shades in the lorac Pro - that's why
I'm getting a lot of muddy looks like
the shadows aren't quite setting
themselves apart from one another enough
because they're just not as pigmented as
those lorac shadows were now let's jump
into the palettes I really really liked
I'm going to go with eye palettes first
and one of them which I know I talked
about quite a bit recently is this
neutrals versus neutrals palette love
the color selection in here if you're
looking for a two-faced sweet peach
alternative I'm not going to say dupe
because it's certainly not a dupe of
that palette but it does give you some
kind of fun peachy pops some warm shades
to pair in there a lot of interesting
really beautiful taupe type shades to
mix in I love the quality of this
palette I've used it perhaps more than
almost any other makeup revolution eye
palette that I have I really love it
next up I want to talk about these
palettes that are formatted like this
they've got a bunch of rectangular
shadows and then some little circular
matte shadows at the bottom this one has
some really pretty bright kind of teal
blues but my lovers of taupe zonin over
here these are gorgeous and I think the
quality in these is really consistent I
love that you're getting a really basic
row of mats and it's like kind of a
no-brainer as to what you can pair
alongside some of these brighter shades
so this one's welcome to the Pleasure
Dome
this one's called unicorns unite this
one I think has a few more bright pops
it's got this kind of nice coppery shade
in there some Pink's a little more of
like a purpley plummy vibe I found these
palettes to be super consistent really
nice quality some fun little pops and
you know you're clearly getting a
selection of matte and shimmer in each
palette so I think these are nice for a
little something different to try then
we get into this whole sector of
palettes that dupe the naked palettes
and these are the redemption I shadow
palette and they're called iconic one
two three these naked dupe type palettes
I think run you a little bit cheaper
than some of those other ones that I
mentioned I don't think everything in
these palettes is a shade for shade dupe
of everything in the naked palettes but
can it give you a similar look
absolutely if the price tag of a Naked
palette is holding you back from buying
it definitely look into these if you
already bought a Naked palette and run
out of it and it's like I don't want to
spend that money all over again try one
of these because I was really impressed
with how nice quality these are the
iconic one is going to be most similar
to the Naked 1 palette so you've got
this range of the light shimmery shades
where there are mattes in The Naked
palette generally speaking you've got
mattes in these palettes as well I am a
big fan of Urban Decay's Naked 1 that
might be my favorite Naked palette so I
really like how they captured you know
some cool neutrals getting into warmer
neutrals they didn't quite tackle the
plumy shades exactly like The Naked
palette did but then toward the end of
the palette you're getting into some
cooler deep smoky colors so overall I
think this is an awesome deal here's the
redemption i shadow palette iconic -
very very similar to your Naked 2
palette with a lot of taupey colors a
lot of variations on taupe you've got
this really nice black at the end I mean
totally workable usable shades if you
were trying to get and make a palette
type look you could definitely turn it
out with that palette and then here's
the one that would be kind of like your
equivalent to a naked 3 again do I find
preciate to be a perfectly accurate dupe
not necessarily but the overall package
that's here yes I do think you can get
some looks that are very similar to an
Urban Decay Naked 3 type look and the
quality across the board in these
pallets seems really really consistent
and I was surprised at how much better
it seemed to be in these and naked dupe
type pallets than even the ones that
seem to be trying to do blur off now
they also have this palette that I got
more recently that's called the iconic
element and this one kind of makes me
think of a combo of the Urban Decay
Naked basics 1 &amp;amp; 2 so a lot of super
basic super neutral matte shadows
nothing goes incredibly warm so
especially if you enjoy the cooler matte
shades you might enjoy this and I love
the quality and I've done some really
great lips with that and then I'm not
really sure what the story is with this
Redemption eyeshadow palette romantic
smoked maybe this is trying to do
something I'm not aware of but I really
like this one too everything right there
is matte and then everything over here
has shimmer and there's just some really
interesting looks you could get I think
it's really cool that there's this
pretty purpley kind of greyish purple
shade in there and if you're into the
rosy burgundy shades I think you'd enjoy
that palette as well I got a say across
the board great consistency makeup
revolution in those naked dupe palettes
now we're moving on to the face related
palettes that I would recommend from
makeup revolution and I kind of alluded
to this earlier that there was a blush
palette that was kind of in my soso
category because there's one kind of
similar to it that I really really
recommend and it's the blush palette
goddess I love this because you do get
versatility in your highlight shades but
you also get four distinctly different
blushed shades and I think sometimes you
know you get a full-on highlighter
palette and it's like do I really need
eight different shades here you know
four different tones of highlight four
different tones of blush one palette
quality of the palette is excellent I
popped on a little bit of this peachy
color along with another blush shade
that I'm wearing but I really love that
now that's another one of these palettes
with the clear window and
there are some others that have more the
standard black packaging and these are
called ultra blush palettes and you've
got two I'm going to hold them up side
by side use so you can really see the
difference in tone running out of air
losing my voice this one is called hot
spice so warmer and then you've got
cooler more pinky shades in the sugar
and spice palette love them both great
pigment you've got a mix of met and kind
of shimmery blushes and then two highly
shimmery highlight type shades and it's
the same story over here except this one
is mostly met you've got like one kind
of satiny finish shade in here with the
sugar and spice all of these others are
met and then some shimmery highlight
colors and I think the quality on these
is just so good I remembered reading
some kind of online review not
recommending the hot spice palette and
I'm so glad I went for it anyway because
this one might even be just in terms of
the shade selection and this one I might
like even more but something I think
you'll like about these palettes if you
get them is how there are some nice pops
of color among the blushes but also some
more like neutral muted blushes in both
of these that I think are really easy to
use and fun to try different looks pair
them together and then you've got those
shimmery pops as well so without a doubt
we are not at a loss for great blush
options from makeup revolution but also
I must say this ultra contour palette is
one of the best contour palettes I have
loved these shades so much use out of
these and I kind of feel like you know
if it was between this and that all
about bronze palette that I mentioned
earlier this is probably going to be the
thing that I reach for because I feel
like I do have kind of a bronzey color
in here but I've also got straight-up
perfect contouring shades i've got matte
shades right up in here that i can work
with this shade has just a little bit of
sheen and thence a very highly shimmery
like go as big as you want to go with
your highlight type shades over here on
the side so this is a phenomenal quality
contouring palette definitely one of my
top top makeup revolution products that
i've tried for sure last but not least
this palette kind of went against my
better judgement but I just can't deny
how much I
like it even if I want to put it in my
average pilot I just like it too much
it's this palette called the protection
palette light slash medium I have really
enjoyed this this is a nice little
multitasking palette it's got three
creamy concealer shades in here and I'm
not really nuts about makeup revolutions
concealer texture but I find these all
to be so light I don't really use them
on my face as concealers but I use them
more like a cream highlighting type
thing if that makes sense so I'll go
ahead and correct my under eyes and then
maybe put one or two of these on this
area just to brighten it up further I
don't really love that there right side
by side with powders but at least
they're right next to a light powder if
that makes it a little better but I just
kind of like using those from time to
time and then this face powder just a
straight up face powder really creamy
matte good coverage and I love these
three things happening over here this
contour / bronzer this blush and this
highlight I'm wearing all of these and
like I said I mixed in more of a coral
II blush shade on top as well but these
work so nicely very creamy very
pigmented but yet you don't feel like
you have to be too too careful with them
I love this shade of blush but if you're
into the multitasking if you're into the
space-saving kind of put a lot in one
palette this is good so there you go
guys
