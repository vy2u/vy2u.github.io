you're gonna love this idea okay it's a
full face of products basically a full
face real close to a full face using all
products that I think feel funny they
just I mean that's the way when I had
this video idea I put it in my notes
like products that feel funny
they just feel weird unusual unexpected
interesting textures and I thought this
would be a fun way to kind of address
them all at once and there are some that
I really liked there are some that I
struggle with a little bit we've got
some high-end some drugstore and it's
just all over the place I'm really
excited about this okay so first thing
is my dream matte mousse so this one the
foundation is taken at old school
because when I realized I was coming up
with so many products that I could
possibly make nearly a full face out of
this I couldn't come up with a
foundation that was really a weird
texture this is probably the weirdest
textured foundation that I have and it's
a good one like it's old-school too it's
the dream matte mousse from Maybelline
in the shade light for nude and I think
what kind of reinvigorated my interest
in this product was seeing Kathryn Webb
on Instagram talking about how this was
part of her makeup routine and I was
like oh yeah that foundation was pretty
good for an overall even quick flawless
look so I'm patching this around on my
skin and it's truly like actual mousse
like it's very light I would almost
venture to call it fluffy and you might
even see some little chunks this I
blended in on my skin but as it kind of
warms up into the skin there's a little
bit of a meltdown that happens with this
product and then I've got a weird sponge
top it all off today I'm trying out this
one well I've tried it a couple times
hence the little bit of stuff on it but
this is that Real Techniques they call
it the Diamond sponge or something it's
got a lot of different sides and facets
so I like to kind of blend in the dream
matte mousse with a sponge I think it
works really well like it gives nice
coverage definite matte appearance on
the skin this isn't really a foundation
I would advise for SuperDuper dry skin
and I have moisturized really well
underneath I actually didn't even apply
a specific
primer I just you know it's my
moisturizer and stuff which by the way
I'm experimenting with something that
smells I'm using it's the globe recipe
watermelon glow pink juice moisturizer I
feel like I'm so jazzed up about this
video I'm just I don't know this is
gonna be one of those ones where I go
back through the editing process and I'm
like oh dear but I just want to have fun
okay just let me have what fun I'm
building up the product as you can see
I've reapplied a little bit more ever
around these zones I'm not seeking to
eliminate the under eye right now we've
got a concealer for that that feels
weird but truly guys dream matte mousse
has been around for a good long while
and I like it it's not as amazing in
terms of coverage as my super stay full
coverage but it's a quality mattifying
foundation that does wear well on my
skin and even though I built it up I
don't feel like I applied to too much of
it and the damp sponge definitely helps
things kind of melt down now for
concealer this is the weirdest feeling
concealer that I've gotten as of late
and it's the Mac Studio water weight
concealer so this is the thinnest
concealer I've ever tried I have it in
NC 20 it up I would still like thin
products really need to be shaken and
guys look actual true liquid so what I'm
gonna do is just dab a little bit of
this right here in my in my darkest spot
and we're just gonna start there I
really feel like I want to use a brush
with this cuz I don't want to thin it
out you know with a damp sponge any more
than it already is so I'm using my
little Sigma P 80 houses doing because
you know the foundation I didn't really
build it up in my under eye too much cuz
I don't like the thickness of dream
matte mousse in this area but that did
pretty well for as thin as this is as
lightweight as it is the last time I
used this I tried topping it off like on
top of a creamy corrector it was
probably benefit here a space that I was
using and I felt like this looked kind
of odd on top of it the water weight and
I thought it would be a real good
product to layer because it would be so
to me it seemed oddly visible and kind
of exaggerated little bits of texture on
the under eye but on its own it's
actually covering a lot better than I
expected it would and I think this is
really the right shade for me and that's
playing into it too because sometimes
you go to light and that just kind of
messes up the whole thing it doesn't
give you quite enough coverage I'm going
to give myself just a hint more right
here and here and it spreads a long way
you see that like as it hits the skin
it's so liquidy
I like it
it kind of feels like nothing do I have
any other spots I've got a little like
leftovers it their little redness here
we'll just go ahead and attack those
areas
oh man so when I was going on about how
much I liked the lights down low song by
Max in another video I can't remember
which one but somebody said you should
check out some sort of special Amazon
feature acoustic version of that yes I
did it was wonderful I also am a huge
fan of like anytime a popular song is
recorded in an acoustic version I love
hearing the specific like unplugged
instruments a little bit more I love
hearing the vocals even more clearly and
when it's a song I really like I usually
will try to seek it out in an acoustic
version so thank you for recommending
that because it was just wonderful
beautiful song and American Idol starts
davay oh I am a true American Idol lover
that's part of why I'm like so jacked up
today I think is the deal because it's
coming back and I'm really excited for I
love that show it's one of my favorite
all-time shows like I've watched it from
the Kelly Clarkson first season and you
know it was a little sketchy like during
college I wasn't quite able to keep up
with all the shows and everything but
generally speaking I've been an idol fan
through and through this whole time
here's a powder that I think is kind of
a weird texture it's the urban decay
velvet Iser and this powder is so fine
that it just I mean it like pours like
liquid it's just so fine it's incredibly
fine and I know this can be used as like
a mixin product with a foundation but so
far I've just been trying it kind of
like under eye setting powder and that's
what I'm gonna do today with this look
I'm gonna use my ELF small tapered brush
and just pick a little bit of this up
and lightly go over where I put the
water wait concealer which by the way
leaves just a little bit of a slightly
moist texture sorry I had to use the
word moist I kind of like to smooth that
out and this powder is so fine it's
capable of going on with very very light
amounts you know and I'm also gonna just
use it to lightly set my t-zone just
kind of DAB and press
to the nose here because this is really
good on pores - what do you think of the
velvet eyes are like is it worth trying
as more of a mixin product or do you
like it more as a setting powder I think
it makes a really nice smooth
ultra-lightweight under eye setting
powder but that texture is truly unique
to me I mean if you have it you know
what I'm saying buy it like it's so fine
it pours like liquid out of those little
holes can I just do a little regular
bronzer real quick I'm just gonna swipe
on my Milani bronzer XL and fake tan
sorry I don't have a more interesting
bronzer to talk about today but I'm just
gonna get this going
okay we're getting to the heart of the
weirdness right now guys if you were
just kind of thinking as stuff isn't
really all that weird now it is now it
is this is the butter LONDON blazing
blush Jala it's classier than just a
jelly it's a Jala and so these were sent
to me and and they're strange I'm going
to use the one that looks most blushy to
me like there's a plummy one and I
played with this before and I couldn't
quite make the color work there's sort
of a peachy one deeper bronzy looking
one yeah I'm gonna use the one called
glimmer it looks the most like rosy hmm
and it just Wiggles you see this it
wants to kind of pour out on in it just
sort of wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle eels
look at that like odd so I've got a
little on my finger and I'm gonna dab
that right here on the apple of my cheek
and the thing about these is that they
are rather metallic and once they blend
in they leave they set quickly like that
was risky for me to dab a little bit
there and then kind of leave it for two
seconds because they set fast and they
leave nothing tacky on the skin which I
like but yet ice at the same time I need
a little more play time to blend it in I
don't feel like in person that blush
looks super duper blended like a powder
would and all the blushes have this real
metallic quality to them as well so I'm
gonna add just a little more and I'm
using my ELF small stipple brush I'm
just not super pleased with the way
these go on and I thought maybe it was
just the plumbing one last time I
thought well maybe that shades just a
little dark and that's why it's not
blending in seamlessly into my skin but
this shade should be pretty appropriate
and it's just I can't get a really good
blend and even immediately after putting
it on it just wants to set so quick when
you having trouble just grab that old
Beauty Blender and see what you can
press away this is too much work that's
too hard to use but oddly enough they
also have a face glow this is larger in
comparison to the blushes so
from butter LONDON blazing face glow and
this isn't crystal so you look at that
is super creamy and this shade has a
little pink iridescent to it it's a
little more creamy than straight-up
jelly see the stiff peaks we're getting
there any any bakers in the house okay
gonna dab it right here onto the cheeks
and I'm not scared about this one let me
use my little cream highlighter brush
man I'm so not scared I don't even have
the proper brush got it okay see how
much easier this is to work with and
this doesn't leave any texture on my
skin either see that was sitting there
for some time and look it blends
beautifully really nice glow hint of
pink in that no unusual stickiness there
either and I'm gonna use a little
setting spray I'm using my makeup
revolution Pro base aqua priming base
this is very similar to the hard candy
sheer envy primer mist I gotten into
using this a lot and then it sort of got
pushed back behind some other things so
it works really nicely it's the type of
spray that gives kind of an instant dewy
effect now we're gonna do brows and I'm
playing with something that's a very
different texture for me and it is the
Maybelline tattoo studio brow gel and I
think this is a drugstore take on the
Wonder brow product that's supposed to
be like insanely long wearing I'm pretty
sure the claims on this set like 48 hour
brow or something and you've got like
kind of a furry extra furry doe foot
applicator and they also give you a
spoolie and so this is going to deposit
a lot of creamy color in your brows
which is kind of a risky thing for one
who already has a decent amount of
thickness and their brows so I got to be
careful with this but I have this in the
shade what I'm gonna say the shade I'll
get back to you on the shade I think
it's like medium brown or something but
I'm gonna lightly apply this as lightly
as I can because there's really a lot of
product on this
and you really got to be careful around
like the tail of your bride I want that
too thick oh and then you can take this
little spoolie through it I can vouch
for the fact that this lasted really
well I've worn this probably two three
times already
thought the staying power was good it's
just a little hard to get in there and
keep it looking really controlled
although something you could do is take
like a small angled brow brush and pull
some of the product off of here if you
wanted really precise application in
your brows all right I feel like I did a
pretty good job there it looks like once
the first brow got some of the product
off now it's a little easier here on the
second I'm trying to work right off the
tip too so I don't get too much on from
the sides of the applicator the fear of
overloading your brows is real with this
now I'm gonna take the little brush this
brush is very important I think to the
workability of this product and it does
have hold in itself which is nice so I
feel like my brows are kind of keeping
their shape without any additional thing
I'll tell you this much it might not be
a perfect filling right now but that's
as far as I'm willing to go with this
product next up here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna put on a little eyeshadow
primer I'm going to prep my eye area
with a little bit of matte shadow and
then we're gonna go in with another
oddly textured product
our crease is prepped with a little
couple shades there from the sassy
siennas palette from dose of colors and
then here's the unusual thing that I'm
putting on my lids it's from LA Colors
and it's called iced pigment powder and
the unusual thing for me about this is
that when I shake this product into the
cap like you might expect it to be just
a loose powder maybe you're familiar
with pigments and stuff it comes out
looking like teeny tiny little like
flexor balls of product it doesn't
really look like a powder that's gonna
hang together and you're thinking it
looks so flaky how is that actually
going to hang together on my eyes but it
actually does a really awesome job
here's what I do take a flat brush and
kind of press the product into your
brush right there on the cat just kind
of go press press press and you're still
gonna feel like maybe you things are a
little flaky and uneven but once you get
on your lid press and give it a slight
drag just a tiny tug and then look at
the metallic quality to this like it's
super pigmented super full color here
this is kind of a rosy taupe shade I'd
call it and it's like those micro little
separated looking particles turn into
the most beautiful foiled shadow there
and you just got to take a little bit of
a stroke with it instead of just a Pat
because if you just pat pat pat honestly
it's not enough to pack those pigments
together
and see how it can be built up to look
just insanely metallic this color is
called toasted by the way so what I'm
going to do is just kind of finish off
this eye look with a little bit of a
deeper shade I think I'll use like kind
of going between these last two shades
here in the sassy cns palette and just
kind of finish the look off in the outer
corner but that's going to be it
that brown at the end of this palette is
magnificent by the way well love that
now just blending over the edge go go
back to this Center shade and just apply
a little more of that real lightly right
in here
and a little bit of my wet and wild
ultimate for a highlight in the lower
inner room
now we're gonna try a weird mascara and
I'm purposely not doing eyeliner so you
can see more of what the actual mascara
is gonna be doing the bets and make cake
mascara yeah you're telling me this
isn't weird this is the mascara it goes
in the tin and you basically wet your
little brush this is the little
old-school brush that they give you
you wet that you kind of rub it in here
you work it into like a pasty cream and
then you brush it through your lashes
this could also be used as eyeliner they
even have instructions for this to be
used as a brow product I was playing
with it yesterday trying to kind of
acclimate myself to this because this is
very very different and I didn't want to
go into this completely uninformed like
I wanted to have some info to offer you
so I'm gonna curl my lashes first what
I've done is I've taken a little cap
from a product here and I'm just gonna
stick the itty bitty baby brush in this
and try to get some moisture on all the
bristles and then I'm just gonna begin
rubbing it here right onto that mascara
brick and as you can see it's working
into a little bit of a paste you really
got to press into it but you can start
to see this paste enos developing on the
brush and then you just start brushing
that through and what I noticed from
this was that it seemed to hold my curl
and almost prompt more curl in my lashes
which was really unexpected and I was
experiencing that when I was like first
putting it on and I thought I barely had
enough like moisture added to it so it
was pretty dry and at that stage of the
game and I can see it even now like it's
getting some curl in there but you'll
find that when you go back like I just
added a little water to that and now I'm
going back to it and it's already kind
of drying back out so the back and forth
I think between the water and the
product is something you kind of have to
continually be messing with and I'm not
nuts about how the brush kind of makes
my lashes stick together a little bit
adding more water to the brush
I mean isn't it even slightly impressive
that this actually is doing what mascara
is that we're used to we'll do it's
definitely darkening and thickening up
my lashes and it's making them actually
stand up a little bit more but this is
the way it used to be done y'all yeah it
says do not add more than one drop of
water at a time too much water will
dilute the product and give it a
see-through consistency so again we'll
give the brush a chance to get fresh
leaf moistened you're gonna rub onto
this and it looks really wet at first
and then you look at your brush and
start seeing okay it's looking actually
a little pasty I welcome any tips from
any of you who have tried this or
religious users of this style of mascara
if there's any trick to making this work
its best let me know oh no oh no I hit
my lid several times there crisis oh
that came off easily all right no big
whoop I'm so excited because I ordered a
new little storage contraption that's
gonna hold my cotton rounds and I think
my q-tips maybe some sponges in there
I'll show it to you when I get it to
this side I'm really struggling to look
give the appearance that I have more
than five eyelashes maybe it's the brush
like if you have this is there any other
brush like would you actually take a
spoolie wand and try to you know Jimmy
it into that product I'm coming away
from the mascara honestly feeling like
the formula is kind of cool I credit the
formula a lot for not like immediately
dragging my lashes down and being able
to control like at the amount of dryness
that's still in the mascara that was
nice but I think what's frustrating me
more than anything is this tiny little
brush just because it's kind of hard to
get real good separation and I think
we're used to more modern mascara wands
giving us a lot of good separation see
it's not so bad like the length that it
added is actually pretty good I am
however gonna take my clump crusher and
put it on my lower
lashes just cuz it's what I need to do
and did I say that that blush jelly was
the weirdest texture I've got because I
think I've got something even weirder
coming up actually for the lips yep I've
been saving these lip products up for a
video just like this I ordered these off
of QVC a while back and they are from
Maui
they are powders for your lips they are
called pure pigment melting lip powder
so you shake it around in here it's
clearly just looking like true powder
take the top off it's a doe foot
applicator you can see this sort of
funnel it's keeping most of the powder
down in here but I think what makes the
change is when the product heats
basically or the pigments kind of
pressed down together it does become a
little bit liquefied so there's the nude
and I found that the nude stays really
like true to color the one called tender
rose I'm going to show you this one this
really went a different direction than I
was expecting you know that's not really
tinder rose to me that's like pretty
darn bright actually like a reddish pink
mellow moths powder looks like a real
dusty lavender but once it melts into
your skin it really does have kind of a
dusty rose look I'm thinking about
putting that one on my lips and then
gentle pink looks downright purple in
the powder state it really does have
this sort of cool purpley pink look so
that's the lineup of shades it was a set
of four when I got them and so these are
a matte lip product and I'm gonna do the
mellow mauve I think so this one really
does end up looking different on the
lips than it does in the powder state so
you take the applicator out and it feels
cold immediately you do feel that powder
melting right in like there's not even
really a point where you see powder on
your lips it's melting just on contact
and that's interesting because with the
swatches you know you could see that it
was taking some time for them to melt
down with your lips it's really
instantaneous and there's a very cold
feeling when they go on so cool
this video is for the people who are
bored with traditional makeup and who
wants something different like the the
product risk-takers and as I talk and
apply this I feel like I'm blowing the
powder like it's micro-fine powder
truly to me this feels like a matte lip
stain when it's all said and done I can
tell there's something on my lips but
it's so much thinner than any liquid
lipstick the nude actually has worn
pretty well for me like I wouldn't say
it's anywhere near an all-day wear but
part of a day it wears pretty nicely I
think a color like this will actually
wear a lot better for me just because
there's so much more richness to it but
yeah it just truly feels like a
lightweight lip stain but guys this was
so fun I'm so glad I did this let's do a
little roundup here the foundation the
concealer I like both of these things I
like the dream matte mousse I'm gonna
keep a closer eye on how the concealer
wears but I actually thought that had
surprising coverage for as absolutely
thin and watery as it was butter LONDON
jelly blushes not a fan I think they're
really hard to blend they really start
to cling onto your skin so quickly it's
hard to blend them out however the
highlight seem to be a creamier texture
it still gave you that feeling that like
oh I'm using something really different
but it was creamier and much easier to
use oh the velvet Iser by the way the
setting powder I like this I think if
you're looking for one of the finest
powders you can apply to the under eye
area this is it some people may like to
mix this into a foundation to give it
more of a mattified perfected looking
texture I can try that too if you want
me to or let me know if you've tried it
in the comments section but I think
that's a quality powder the tattoo
studio for me and my brows I feel like
it's a little bit more than I need I'm
always trying to just get the bare
minimum on there however it does have
good staying power and I feel like it
has decent hold I think I could get
better control of it if I did take an
angled brush and got just what I needed
in the brows but then that's kind of an
extra step an extra thing to use to me
it's a little bit tedious but I could
see for some people this could really be
worth it if the staying power is super
duper important to you LA Colors ice
pigment powder was awesome I thought
this gave a really foiled mitat
like look to the lids and you're gonna
have your doubts definitely when you
first crack this open and you see what
the texture looks like seems so flaky so
all over the place but once you start to
really boss this product around with
your flat brush it's just gonna sweep on
and it's kind of amazing how it hangs
together the cake mascara was so
different for me I mean I like the way
it kind of gave my lashes sort of a lift
and a boost I feel a little out of
control with the brush I think that was
the biggest downside to that product for
me and then these powder lip products
from Ali I mean it is a really unique
sensation on the lips I'd say if you're
looking for something very different
about as different as it gets for lip
products you might give these a go they
really are kind of gimmicky in terms of
it's more about the process of applying
that's so different than it is so much
the finished look because the finished
look is essentially just a stained lip
but in terms of application I do think
they check the boxes for being fun and
different so if that's something you
want to experience they're there but
thank you so much for playing with me
today this was fun I will talk to you
guys very soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
