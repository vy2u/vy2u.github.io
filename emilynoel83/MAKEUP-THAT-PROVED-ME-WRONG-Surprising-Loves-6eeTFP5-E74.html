gonna have a little casual chat here to
start off the video I want to talk about
reviewing products and the fact that I
think it's very important that when
someone decides that they're going to do
reviews on YouTube or blogs or wherever
I think it's really important that you
don't have your mind completely made up
before you review like if that's the way
you're gonna be you probably shouldn't
be sharing things like that on YouTube
because I think it's a real problem we
conceived notions positive or negative I
think can be really dangerous to the
accuracy of a review now that being said
we're still human beings and it's human
nature to develop judgments just
instantly without even really
consciously being aware that you're
doing it so I would say before I review
a lot of things in most cases I've got
some kind of hunch going into it and the
products I'm going to be sharing with
you in this video there are five within
a couple of those lines there's more but
these are products where as soon as I
got them or maybe I saw them you know
spied them on social media or something
like that I developed this not too
serious deep thought but just a little
hunch like oh yeah don't really need it
I think you'll know what products I'm
gearing this statement toward when you
see them but like things that I maybe
just thought it's here for the moment
not gonna be a total must-have like you
have that hunch but I will tell you this
I am always open to that hunch being
reversed
I'm always open and willing to be
surprised by a product I don't care what
the price range is you know I will try
anything with an open mind whether it's
something I got for 99 cents from Dollar
General or $59 from Sephora or a luxury
makeup counter here on my channel it's
all got the same shot the same potential
to succeed so here's what I want to talk
about today those things that I just
really didn't expect to like but turned
out to actually love so I'm gonna jump
in here one of these things actually got
a little mention in another video where
I reviewed some new products from
covergirl and they have this go glow
luminizing lotion this is the sunkissed
shade they have a lighter more like
highlighter esque shade and then this
one is kind of just a shimmery bronze if
you remember me describing the scent of
a product as similar to corn chips this
is the product that I said smelled like
corn chips and in the last couple weeks
I've been wanting to like play with a
more
ronzi toned like makeup look a little
more glowy maybe with the foundation or
just like a more dewy glow finishing
touch on the makeup and this has
honestly been the perfect product to do
that with and even though that's a
little sick I don't go on to smell it as
I'm just like living life you know but
it is a really beautiful bronzy tone and
I've worn it mixed in with foundation
I've worn it just kind of like dabbing
with a full brush like even the kind of
full brush that you might use for
foundation like I'll get it on my hand
get a little on the brush and then
perhaps just kind of DAB it maybe on the
apples of my cheeks or just somewhere
where the Sun would naturally hit and I
feel like it's a really beautiful bronzy
look and because it's a liquid it just
looks so natural on the skin here's
another product where I saw it and I
don't even know the thought really
registered with me as an initial
reaction I certainly didn't expect it to
be a must-have this is Shanny this is a
brand that is available on Amazon they
did knock my socks off with a fantastic
six color blush palette recently there's
just some random little tidbit in PR and
I thought man let's see accentuate your
look with a touch of shimmer great for
highlighting or mixing with your
foundation for an illuminating glow so
it's called liquid shimmer Luminizer and
the shade is called pure joy and it just
looks like a pearlescent kind of liquid
highlight there here's one thing I
really like this pump is so easy to
control because sometimes you just get
what you get with liquid highlighters
and usually way too much comes out and
then you're like well I didn't want to
use that much here if you just want to
pump down the tiniest bit like you can
definitely control how much you get and
then the second great thing about this
is the texture is so perfect it's not
literally like a cream to powder product
but it's like a cream that doesn't get
too liquidy and it's so perfect for
padding on top of the skin because it
just like kind of blends right on top of
the skin it does not interfere with your
foundation your concealer whatever
you've got going on underneath it does
not mess with it at all it is such the
perfect cream highlighter texture and
I've got it on my cheeks today let kind
of tops of my cheeks just kind of
lightly everywhere else and it's so easy
to use your finger you just like barely
apply any pressure and it's blended it's
so cool there's no glitter in this and
I'll swatch out a little bit more here
so you can see it's a
just brightening glow and natural gleam
that your skin takes on not necessarily
an unnatural like streak of highlight or
anything like that but a very surprising
product indeed I just didn't have any
kind of high expectation for it here's
another product where you know it's
gotten a lot of buzz I'm sure it's been
seen a lot on social media and just for
the whole theme of the collection I
thought a trendy you know whatever it's
just a little skeptical went arts
mermaid collection came out okay and
then they've got this palette this is
called the BM mermaid and make waves I
shadow palette and it's shaped like a
shell super teal turquoise shiny you
open it up and I remembered thinking
okay well you know these these aren't
unwearable shades these are actually a
lot of colors that I would wear and
generally enjoy but you know they've put
these blues down here in the bottom and
how are those really gonna mix with
these shades and I sort of expected more
of a muddy look but I'll tell you guys
I've gotten surprised every time I've
used this I've expected it to sort of
hit a wall or you know be very limited
versatility wise but really there's so
much that I've been able to do with this
palette and I have been pleasantly
surprised by the texture of some of
these really really shiny shades like
they build up easily with very little
effort and the mattes the few mats that
are in here are really nice also like
you've got definitely some mats that can
be a good kind of start out the look
crease color they should certainly could
have thrown us a bone and given us one
really dark matte shade you know I'm
always on board with that idea but still
the palette manages to work for me when
I use this in this alone this is
actually a pretty dark shade down here
this Lagoon color it's a gorgeous
shimmery deep blue and cavern is a
little darker I guess in application
than it might even appear to be as part
of this palette who is this not for I
would say if you don't like metallic and
a lot of shimmer you might want to sit
this one out because there is a ton of
shimmer in it there's only three true
mattes and then also if you're not a big
fan of like rosy toned eyeshadows as I
cover up this bottom portion here see
how much of this takes on kind of that
pinky look so if you generally don't
like those colors I wouldn't waste your
time with this because that's most of
what it is but there
like this unique kind of duochrome shake
here called bubbles sometimes it looks
blueish sometimes it looks a little bit
reddish-brown we've all seen shades like
that in different palettes but it's
executed really well in here because the
sheen that that shade gives off actually
works so well with the rosy colors and
then surprisingly shades like Lagoon and
splash look very pretty with an
underlying theme of rosy matte in the
crease let's say so I've won this quite
a few different ways I have been
continuously impressed by it I think the
textures are nice I'm not saying it's
the be-all end-all palette for everyone
as I explained but even though like part
of my brain wanted to say and this is
just a gimmicky little like mermaid
collection whatever everything's coming
out and like mermaid unicorn rainbow
these days I almost wanted to not like
it but I can't help but truly like every
look that I do so therefore I do like
the palette what I'm wearing today by
the way I've got a lot of this sand bar
shade in my crease a little bit more
like light brown and beige eye compared
to a couple of the other shades that you
might use in your crease that have a bit
more Rose so then kind of a mix of
mimosa and shell yeah I've got those
shades on my lid that's what's giving me
that really profound bronzy pop and kind
of blending into my liner here on the
lower lash line
that's cavern and that shade like I said
is a little bit darker than it might
appear to be capable of being as you
look at it in the palette but what can I
say I've liked this palette I think it's
caused me to create maybe a few
different looks that I might not have
originally thought you know to pair
those shadows together like the bluish
tones and then the rosy tones but it
really does work here's kind of another
spring/summer fad product where as soon
as I saw it I thought I don't need it
sort of decided that I wasn't gonna buy
it then lo and behold it arrives in PR
he may have seen Tyler unbox this week
or so ago and I'm talking about the
Smashbox photo-finish different like
scented primer waters it's the Nicole
Concilio collaboration type thing and so
they've got these primer waters they've
got the little palm trees on and the
first one I decided to test out was the
so chill coconut write it on and I'm
like okay okay that smells really good
it's like a sweet coconut he sent it's
instant summertime like summer in a
bottle for sure it's Pleasant it doesn't
feel like an over
well mning sent it's not as though I'm
spraying body mist in my face but it's
just refreshing it a little sweet and
I'm like okay that's really nice I like
that and these are called photo finish
primer waters you can use them before
your makeup you can use them throughout
the day as sort of a refresher mist I'm
really into doing that because I think
it takes like a cakey appearance that
can sometimes develop with makeup
sometimes makeup starts to look better
when it gets worn a little bit with some
products not so much so the mist can be
nice but anyway this is the centering
citrus it's a very awakening scent a
very refreshing scent it instantly makes
me think of maybe some of the products
that I've used in hotels that have that
sort of citrusy scent like the shampoos
and conditioners and soaps that have
this sort of orange e just light citrus
vibe to them a little lemony as well
it's really really nice and so now I'm
kind of thinking this is some some legit
stuff you're like I'm actually really
enjoying these sprays and then the last
one is called serene greens and so here
I thought well maybe this would be the
one that I probably wouldn't like as
much like it just seems a little bit off
the beaten path for a setting miss for
your face I don't know and then the
first time I sprayed it at first you
think ooh that's different and then I
really like it like that's so it's it's
very outdoorsy but in the most subtle
like refreshing lovely way like kind of
spa-like it's very like rejuvenating I
really truly love them all it's a very
well-put-together collection from what I
understand they're limited edition and I
think it will be sad when they're no
longer available nothing that I have
setting spray wise smells like any of
these but the hardest one for me to
really describe to you and put my finger
on is the serene greens this one the one
that I questioned the most is probably
the one that I like the best and they
also give just kind of an instant a
little bit of doing this to the skin
you'd have to apply a lot of one of
those to look super visibly like wet on
the skin as you can see I applied like a
few mists of each and my skin's not
feeling tacky as a result of it it's not
looking especially shiny either but I
definitely don't look powdery and I
really really like the scent experience
last thing here is a lip
and I did mention one of these in my
most recent favourites video that I was
really really enjoying it and it
definitely surprised me I got the entire
line in a PR package from Revlon and to
be honest I was a little bit back and
forth the first glance at everything I
thought ooh this is a gorgeous color
scheme like all these neutrals and kind
of rosy tones very very wearable and
then I thought we were regressing to
like the early 2000s with this kind of
slant tip here and I don't love that I
don't think it really spreads products
very nicely and back in those times when
a lot of things were sold in squeezy
tubes I was always getting some off on
my finger having to spread it on my lips
with my finger which you know not very
hygienic I'm over that experience but
the texture of these plumping lip creams
have I even said what the product is
Revlon kiss plumping lip creams is what
they're called the texture is such that
this squeezy tubes slant tip design is
sort of a non-factor because it is a
cream it's a little bit thick it's not
like it's gonna just come out and mousse
from this tube and then become a streaky
mess on your lips my only advice would
be don't over apply just get what you
need you know squeeze out initially onto
your lips and then just use this as sort
of a spreading device don't continue
squeezing and applying as you go because
you'll eventually just have way way too
much but the texture of these glosses is
very nice it really does function to
kind of line fill and that's really what
the illusion of a lip plumper is I think
is something that gives shine to the
lips it sort of fills in the cracks and
crevices and just makes everything look
a little bit smoothed out and more rich
and plump and I have liked so many of
the shades they're like three colors
that I might give you a little bit of a
warning on and all note on the screen
because I'm gonna take you through the
full try on in like rapid-fire style but
cashmere cream is the lightest one and
this one is just a little bit streaky
it's so light it's really really hard I
think for brands to do light glosses
really well and make them something
that's going to be opaque and just
really look flawless on the lips that
one's not real perfect for me also the
shade called fresh petal in terms of the
rosy shades and this would be the
lightest one there it's the same deal
with fresh petal and then also the
darkest shade in the law
I can make this work and I can be okay
with it but I would say it's the most
difficult to work with and it's the one
called rich Bordeaux and that's number
five forty five so everything else I
would kind of classify as a nude -
mid-tone rosy shade and it's all really
good really liking it the shade I've
been wearing throughout the video is
this one called nude honey so it's just
a little deeper than this shade but as
you can see it executes evenness very
very well these are super comfortable on
the lips there's that little bit of
thickness you might notice a little bit
of a minty coolness about 30 seconds to
a minute after you apply them again I
don't think it's really like a huge
plumping action that's taking place
there it's just the effect that they've
chosen to give this product so you guys
know I'm really getting back into
glosses these days I'm loving the look
of shine on the lips I think it makes
them look so much more healthy just kind
of nourished revived just compared to a
lot of the different matte lip looks and
another thing about these they would
pair really well with some of those Too
Faced natural collection lipsticks
because it's almost the exact same color
scheme you know nudes shades with maybe
a hint of pink dusty roses deeper
neutrals if you wanted to top those kind
of lip colors off with something that
coordinated really well these are great
but I like that they're also pretty much
what you see is what you get color
there's not a lot of Sheerness with
these so aside from those three that I
pointed out I think everything else is
pretty much fair game although I do love
nude honey almond suede was the one I
pointed out in a past video that's a
great deeper neutral - the spice Berry
is gorgeous velvet mink is a really cool
kind of like deep Mavi neutral so I
think that is truly a line worth
checking out so thank you guys so much
for watching this video I really wasn't
planning for it to be a super long video
but I felt like I took off and really
talked a lot about this stuff but I'm
really eager to hear in the comments
section what products have you had this
kind of experience with where maybe your
hunch you before trying them was that
maybe not gonna love this but maybe you
gave a little time and gave it plenty of
chances and it just sort of proved you
wrong it didn't take a long time for me
to have that realization with most of
these things with the Tarte I think I
stayed skeptical
or like look after look and then it was
like hey you actually enjoy every look
that you've done with this you you do
like the product so thank you guys again
I hope you're having a great day and I
will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
