joining me for this video this has been
probably one of the most requested
videos for me to do especially recently
because I have been switching up the
types of primers I've been using I
really have been trying to decide what
is the best eye primer and honestly it's
been getting kind of push back and push
back because this is not an easy review
to do it's not like I'm pulling out a
great lip gloss and telling you how
pretty the color is or how bright and
pigmented a certain shadow is to review
a primer I mean you've got to think
about staying power which can be very
hard to gauge because there's different
factors that come into play like what
kind of shadow were you putting on top
of it or what kind of skin do you have
is it oily or is it dry or you know
there's so there's a lot that goes into
it and that is why I do need to do a
little disclaimer at the beginning of
this and tell you you know this is my
opinion on how these shadows worked for
me I will try to be as explicit as I can
in terms of my description to let you
know like if you have this skin type
this one might be better for you or
whatever but just please be aware this
isn't me saying run out and buy this one
just because it worked for me because it
may not work for you there are two
different categories that I judged these
in I am talking about five different eye
primers today and number one I judge
them on staying power and number two on
how well they help the color show up
basically of the eye shadow how much
they contributed to the vibrancy of that
shadow so vibrancy and how long wearing
is that those are two things that came
into play and that's how I rank them and
to show you to talk about staying power
you're gonna have to kind of take my
word for it on that however in terms of
color I have swatch this is one shadow
guys and i've swatched it with all five
primers you can see it doesn't look
exactly the same in any two swatches so
I'm gonna be describing that as I go
along I'm gonna start with number five
which is my least favorite up to my
number one favorite and by the way the
color I was watching there was forever
fig it's from covergirl
I try it's kind of a purplish maroon and
I tried to go out of my way I applied it
with my this little brush from Coastal
Scents and I tried to go out of my way
to make sure I was applying the same
amount the same amount of like swaths of
the brush on top of the different kinds
of primers so alright number five this
is the one that I would rank last for me
and it is L'Oreal decrease eyeshadow
base this is available at the drugstore
Packaging is you know it's in there like
a wand applicator and basically the
reason why I rank this so low is that
this is one of the most dry primers that
I've tried I have I don't have oily lids
at all so to put something on my lids
that was very dry I found that it didn't
help the vibrancy of the shadow at all I
feel like these primers have to have a
certain amount just a little bit of
tackiness left once you put them on to
grab that shadow and make it stand out I
mean you're not Oh at least I am not
only putting it on there to make it last
but I want it to have a little more
punch you know when I put it on this is
sorry I I kind of like put them on at an
angle and I need to kind of turn my arm
a little bit but this last one here that
is the Loreal decrease and I find it to
be the least vibrant of all the swatches
it's just very dull especially in person
even though this one and this one look a
little similar it's still the least
vibrant of all of them if you have very
oily lids this may be a different story
for you because I mean the dryness might
help basically balance you out a little
bit but for me it just did not help my
shadow stay on long enough I did however
notice a slight bit of creasing with
this which I don't quite understand why
did I see creasing with the one that
made my lids even more dry it may just
be the formulation the way this is put
together the way it's reacting with the
shadow I'm not totally sure but this is
definitely something I could not use
with the pigment because it would not
grab those little particles whatsoever
so yeah this is while it's workable and
it may be workable for different skin
types
it was not my favorite out of all of
these okay number four um this is one
that gave me some of the best color
payoff but you do have to be very
careful with this in terms of getting
the staying power this is this one right
here and this is the B luscious shadow
magnet okay it's that one there that
looks pretty dark you know it just it
does a lot of there there is some
sparkle in this shade and it came off
looking pretty matte with this but it
did come off quite intense and it didn't
take much to build that up at all so
this product is in a little sort of
shallow pot here and this is the BBU I
should shadow magnet alight I use this a
lot with pigments because this is the
primer that remains the stickiest on
your lid okay even if you rub it in it's
still gonna have a certain amount of
tackiness when you take your finger away
from it okay it's gonna almost cling
there a little bit so this is great for
getting instant color however you have
to be so careful with this to not make a
crease because it remains so tacky that
it doesn't necessarily work well for
staying power okay and if you are doing
like a one time thing like maybe you
have a quick photo shoot or you just
want your eyes maybe just for yeah like
a certain picture or one sort of certain
quick event that you don't think you're
going to require a lot of touch-ups for
something like that if you if if that's
what you're looking for this will give
you a great great look I mean if the
appearance of your shadow will be
outstanding however you have to use such
a thin layer if you want staying power
out of this and that's difficult I mean
it's difficult to sort of control it and
I mean the more you work it up into the
crease the more problems you might have
with this you want to keep it contained
to your lid in my experience and
sometimes you want primer in your crease
because that's you know if you want to
prevent the creasing and you put that
nice little layer all over your eye so
that's the reason why this is number
four is because yes it well it does give
you great color it does not give enough
of the staying power for me to make that
um
a number one pick number three I was
asked so much about this in my last
tutorial video this is the elf mineral
eyeshadow primer okay this is this one
on my arm it's not maybe the most
vibrant in terms of bringing out the
color of this shadow
however the staying power I used it
under what I have on my eyes today and I
really think that it stayed quite well I
was outside all day in pretty hot
conditions doing my story at a winery
today and I really felt like it helped
this shadow hold up it's not greasy it
does leave behind a teeny teeny very
small amount of tackiness but it's not
overboard nowhere near what the be
luscious stuff is but it doesn't
necessarily bring out the best in your
shadow you have to work a little harder
still to get your shadow to show up how
you want it to on top of this but like I
said I can't argue about the staying
power of this if you're looking for an
inexpensive eye primer I think this is
one of the best you're gonna do the next
two that I'm going to tell you about are
a little more expensive I've never tried
Urban Decay primer potion by the way so
take that out of this equation because
that's I may be you know what throw this
back into the review if I had tried it
but I haven't but this elf mineral
eyeshadow primer for low cost
alternatives this is probably one of the
better ones but like I said I don't feel
like it gave me quite the color
intensity not that you couldn't get it
by building it up but I just wanted to
show you what these did on a consistent
using the same amount on each color so
as you can see it's not maybe the most
bold application but if you want
something to try in your next elif order
this is not expensive this is just it's
under the mineral line and it is three
dollars had to check the computer there
but not bad we're seriously I've been
pretty impressed with how that's worked
out okay number two is from Mary Kay
it's the Mary Kay signature eye primer
it
you've been with me watching my videos
since the beginning this was what I
started out using and this is really
really good guys while a lot of primers
come out beige this one actually comes
out white and it maintains a little bit
of stickiness when you put it on not
tons but a little bit and it gave me
really really nice color payoff with
this shade again some what all of these
is struggle to do so far is really bring
out the shimmer in this shade this one
didn't so much bring out the shimmer but
it did bring off the bold kind of color
intensity of the shadow this is great
that this this wears quite long I have
noticed extremely minor creasing with
this but seriously to make through the
average day like your work day at me I
mean this is going to get you through
that no problem I have once again I have
dry eyelids they don't get oily really
throughout the day this has worked well
for me it does leave just enough
tackiness for you to put your shadow on
and for it to stand out now there is one
primer that has managed to bring out the
true color of the shadow bring out the
color of this shadow as it appears get a
good look as it appears in the container
it's got some sheen to it it's got a
little bit of shimmer and bold color and
this is not a high-end shadow keep that
in mind this primer was able to bring
the most out of that shadow and I have
never had a issue with this creasing on
me I've heard some people say that with
Too Faced shadow insurance that's what
I'm talking about that it's been a
little too like there's too much
moisture in the formula for me there's
not um I feel like it's worked just fine
I feel like it's it's maintained my
shadow it believes like behind these
slightest bit of tacky it's kinda like
the Mary Kay in that way just enough but
not too much I really I really stand by
that and it has I mean I've gone through
days where I've had stories out in the
key
and I don't have to worry about this one
that you know going out for a night if
you're dancing or something like that I
have not had problems with this I can't
complain it is expensive so you are
gonna pay for that kind of quality but
look at what it did for this shade it
not only brought out the vibrancy of
that but like I said there was some
Sheen there was a little sparkle to that
color and this made it look like its
truest form this shadow and all of these
kind of changed the way it looked but
this one really I mean I feel like it
stands above and beyond what the others
did in terms of making it look like it's
true colors so you've got to give props
to a shadow primer that can take even a
very inexpensive shadow and make it look
just like it should in the package even
you know cheap shadows can look awesome
in the packaging but they don't always
look great on your eye and so just keep
that in mind that though you are paying
you know some extra money for this
this may extend some of your shadow the
wear of some of your shadows and the
quality of it on your eye so anyway that
is my little recap here again this this
is L'Oreal decrease this is the luscious
shadow magnet this is the elf mineral
eye primer this is Mary Kay signature
eye primer and that's Too Faced shadow
insurance those are my top 5 again I've
not tried urban decay primer potion as
soon as I try that once I hear some of
this stuff up I will you know report
back on that but again that's the way
those all ranked for me these all have
their strong points but I feel like they
all on you know do have some ways that
they can improve except for me two faced
shadow insurance has been great I will
tell you about my top 3 the elf the Mary
Kay and this one are all very very
similar in terms of staying power so if
that's what you're looking for I think
you got some good picks out there so
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I'm sorry if I get long-winded
like I said this is one of the most
difficult reviews that I've had to do
comparing so many different products and
really trying to distinguish between
them so thanks
much for taking the time to watch and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
