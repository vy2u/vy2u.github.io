gonna haunt me until I sat down did it
it's been like three weeks that I've had
these particular products on my hands
and I've just been meaning to sit down
and do this video it's almost like
saying I was kind of wrong about
something before but my feelings have
changed a little bit but also kind of
not because this is a formula of this
particular product I had not tried let's
just explain these L'Oreal color riche
singles back when I did my L'Oreal top 5
bottom 5 I had put these in the bottom 5
the little square ones that look like
this and this one I just happened to
still have on hand this is number 207
because this one I actually still
somewhat liked but there were several
that I just flat-out got rid of because
I felt like they're kind of inconsistent
some of them swatch good like bright
when I got them and then they didn't
really perform well or pick up well with
a brush or apply to my eyes nice and
evenly so I put them in the bottom 5
category of that video not long after
that I find out about these in a PR
package from L'Oreal they've made them
in a matte version and they're
absolutely phenomenal like these are
fantastic matte basic eyeshadows here
and it kind of made me want to eat my
words a little bit from the other video
or at the very least clarify the fact
that there are some apparently good
shadows in this line I don't know when
they came out with mattes
I don't know how new these are exactly
but we're talking like about 5 dollars a
pop on these and they're really really
good and no L'Oreal didn't like con me
into saying anything like this or
anything like that if I didn't like
these you know I'd let you know
somewhere along the line that I didn't
like these either but if you're browsing
the selection in the stores you see the
shimmers I still think the shimmers are
a little bit in the hit-and-miss bracket
but the mattes that I've tried are
knocking it out of the park doing things
staying power wise just adhering to the
skin in ways I haven't seen since like
the bombs in stain blushes that was
quite a few years ago that I reviewed
those ok it does say in the info new for
2017 L'Oreal introduces matte finishes
to the popular collection so I've gotten
swatches on my hand here so I'll pop
those up and just take you through the
names of each one you've got two light
shades in this mix and one is a little
more pink
one is more buttery a little bit more
yellow in it so the pinky one is called
mixin matte and then the buttery one is
called matte chill very creamy
nice mattes they go on with full color
they just feel ultra smooth to the touch
and I seem to get the same result every
time I use them so I think they're
consistent nice shade next color would
be like the shade I would instinctively
put in my crease to start a look and
it's called matted up so kind of a
transition shade soft warm Brown really
gets the job done nicely just the
perfect kind of color to maybe blend out
the edge of a deeper shade or like I
said just start your look and get things
going in the crease with the color like
that and then the two biggest
showstoppers of the whole bunch are
these deepest two and one is a really
absolutely awesome rest shade if you
have skipped over maybe a lot of more
expensive palettes that have had this
shade in it but it's still been kind of
calling your name just get this single
it's called a crow matte and it is so
good I mean we're talking extreme
pigmentation here very very smooth
applies so easily and did I mention if
fallout really annoys you or you
struggle with that where it really like
kind of hinders your ability to get a
good eye look very very minimal if any
fallout comes from these shades it's
something about the formula it's about
as creamy as any powder eyeshadow I've
seen really good stuff and then the
darkest shade is called Madison Avenue
and at a glance you might think oh
that's just dark brown but I swear
there's a little bit of like a burgundy
plum thing happening here because I see
it not so much in the folio peg swatch
but as it sheers out just a little bit
in application these two colors together
if you love the thoughts of that rusty
really dark kind of burnt peach shade
mixing in with a little bit of dark
burgundy plum these two together is so
pretty and I'm working that look on my
eyes today this I feel like it's
pretty important too because it's a very
good all-purpose crease color and I'm
not trying to take anything away from
the lightest shades because they are a
consistently good formula like those
deeper ones are I think it's a little
more likely that you might have these
shades floating around your collection
but they're still really good but now
we've used these swatches we've seen
these swatches on my hand I'm gonna rub
over them just rub over them and stuffs
happenin there with the lighter shades
but these darker shades and yes I am
putting pressure right there on them
like they are hanging in there they're
practically staining and I think that is
so so cool because these applied evenly
they weren't drive they weren't giving
me copious amounts of Fallout or like
any fallout at all and sometimes we
think like if it's gonna be a pigmented
shadow it's gonna do that well I guess
what these prove to me is that they
don't have to be that way and they can
still hang on for dear life and swatch
on your arm and I mean it's just so cool
that's the darkest two shades that are
really performing like that so again my
point here I still find the shimmers in
this line to be kind of hit and miss
kind of like maybe good when you first
get them home and starts watching them
but then I struggle sometimes picking
them up with a brush but I've seen
nothing but consistency and greatness
out of these matte shades and so I just
wanted to tell you about that and I do
want to show you how I got the looks you
can see an application happening here so
the first thing I did actually I applied
some Milani eyeshadow primer of course I
love that stuff and then I went straight
to the crease with my middle shade
called matted up and just used my e25
brush worked that color in there it's
nice to put on right away or it's nice
to kind of use in blending kind of
overlapping a darker color then I chose
to use the more buttery of the two light
cream shades and I worked that in as my
highlight under my brow then bring on
the rest this is again called a crow mat
and I patted that all over the lid I
also worked it up into my crease a
little bit and sometimes it's fun to use
a combination of different brushes
hiding it on you get one look bringing
in a fluffier brush like the e25 or
something can give you yet another look
with these shades and I used Madison
Avenue the darkest color in this lineup
patting that on the outer part of my lid
as well loving seeing the way that
overlaps with the rest color and then
you know using my small brush working
that color up into the outer corner
shaping the look really with that shade
I think is so beautiful I also used the
more slightly pink toned light shade
called mix-and-match
and I put that in on the inner part of
my eye just for some brightness they're
just the innermost corner and then with
a pencil brush I went along the lower
lash line using my resti shade and then
I layered on with a smudge brush a
little bit of my darkest color and I've
got this nice smudged out you know warm
but still kind of defined lower lash
line and I just finished off that look
using a white like kind of brightening
liner in my lower inner rim that
ultimate brow highlight from wet and
wild there and then just a matte black
liquid liner across the upper lash lines
and false lashes and boom and oh what
about this lip this is one of the Loreal
Pro matte liquid lipsticks in shakedown
but anyway guys I'm super impressed I
really wanted to share maybe only need
like one or two of the colors but I
assure you those two deepest shades are
just in it for the long haul
I love the staying power I love the
application really really great formula
so thank you guys for your time today I
really appreciate it and I will see you
again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
