the hi everybody
oh thank you so much for joining us we
wanted to introduce our newest little
addition yes this is baby grows we're so
excited that she's here at the time
we're sitting here shooting this use one
day away from being three weeks old and
this of course is big sister you decide
everybody can't wait hello hello

I want yes that's bill and she's the big
sister and baby II was born on january
9th yeah and one of the specific Feb 7
pounds 1.7 ounces and there's a unicorn
it was 20 inches long
what time was it like 505 505 the
Evening News had just begun all in all
this was a really non-dramatic adverse
situation we like it that way I pushed
for about four minutes with this one
with that one I pushed for 15 so we've
got a history of sort of quick quick
quick push in situations here but it
went great and she's healthy and sweet
and likes to stay up late at night she
just a little baby what is what is he
bros do all day no one else so she's
been gone did she eat yeah a little vest
on no what do you like your best
oh are you yawning already on goodnight
she's been sleeping in like three hours
stretches out here about every three
hours throughout the night and all that
seems like a little more frequently
during the day she's just she's precious
she's gotten little look around
yeah she has so much comb wakeful time
it seems like and looking at faces and
listening
ever since she has been born it seemed
like overnight bell just grew like
doubled in size my converse every body
part on her seems like twice as big as
it was before did she cry sometimes hey
what do you think about that what do you
say to her when she cries okay okay baby
oh that's really nice yes buzzy it
definitely like no two days are the same
and I think everybody anybody with a new
baby has to keep in mind like you're
tempted right at the get-go to be like
oh the babies acted this way for two
days she's going to be like this like
those first days are just kind of
survival mode you know you just get
through them and everything's kind of
crazy for a little while isn't it is it
kind of crazy around here yes but you
get through it and things you know you
start to notice little pens eventually
but it takes a while so you got to be
patient coming or oh are we making our
sauce sauce hammers oh my most of all we
want to say thank you can you say thank
you everybody for the prayers and the
kind words and just all the support
you've given us throughout this time it
does not go unnoticed and we just
appreciate it so much and we very very
very much keep an eye on the vlog
channel in the near future I will do a
more detailed birth story video I think
that's what I did last time for those
who want the nitty gritty thanks about
it but that's what got the hiccups now
