a hidden gems of the drugstore video
it's not quite as mysterious as it
sounds but this is just a time when I
like to talk about those products that I
feel like are kind of going under the
radar
you know things I don't hear people
talking about a whole lot of those
things where it's like oh that's really
good I never really thought about using
that product before and some of these
things are items that certain people
have tipped me off to try some of them
are things I just happened to try on my
own I'm not saying nobody's ever used
them before talked about some things I
don't hear as much buzz about so let's
get started and I hope you enjoy my as
Tyler would call this lumberjack chic
it's really interesting it's like a
stretchy plaid top I got it from Ross
and I just love it so comfy first off
Jordanna blushes these are just a great
little find if you can come up with the
I got one of mine at a Kmart store and
the other two I came up with at Cherry
culture calm very affordable very
high-quality drugstore blushes and the
first one is peach blossom I also love
the color variety and the variety and
finishes - this is a great matte peachy
shade you can see right there good
amount of color comes off on this talk
about an all-purpose type shade and just
so soft and smooth the other shade that
I have here is called coral Sandy Beach
see that compared to the peach one this
has more pink in it has more of a satiny
finish to it there's coral sandy beach
right then another one I just picked up
purely out of curiosity to see if it
would really pop like it appears it what
this one's called redwood I'm thinking
people who have deeper more rich skin
tones that just have trouble getting
blushed to show up yeah this is so
pretty but it's pretty used light too
it's just a really great rosy color so
there's redwood coral sandy beach and
peach blossom great blushes from Jordan
Anna and I'm sure there are more that
are great in that line to my good buddy
David makeup artist extraordinaire tips
me off to some things I might not
normally try sometimes just like he did
in the
hidden gems video check that one out the
last time I was in New York and that was
a few months ago we went to a Duane
Reade where they have the black opal
line so a line specifically devoted to
the Richard deep skin tones David was
telling me if I really want to contour
like a champ I should grab one of the
foundation sticks and he advised me to
get the truly topaz shades so it says
cream stick Foundation and use that like
after you get your foundation on use it
as your contour here so this is what it
looks like obviously quite a few shades
deeper than my natural skin tone it's
got a drew this on in the areas where I
wanted it and then I took my ELF small
stipple brush and blended it in this
does not blend into the skin as
flawlessly as say that Michelle Phan em
cosmetics phantom contour highlight
stick that has a real cream to powder
finish that's very easy to work in this
is a little more straight up creamier
but you can totally work with it and I
think this is completely one of those
hidden gem type ideas I'm glad he told
me about because I was really happy with
the effect that it gave also while we're
on the topic of black opal they had some
really pretty glosses are you seeing the
iridescent on this coral gloss so pretty
this is called plush and this is the
lustre gloss this is so pretty it's got
like a golden shimmer but yet the
iridescent
almost makes it look pinky purple right
look at that gorgeous an improved
product alert and my buddy Kristin game
was telling me about this she asked me
have you tried the mosaic blushes from
NYC or they they're called color wheel
mosaic face powders and I felt like I
had years ago but not recently and this
is the one called pink cheek glow and I
gotta say this is so much more colorful
than I ever remember it being it's got
tones of Plum tan brighter pink light
pink and really nice pigmentation and
it's watching on my cheeks I feel like
it's practically matte so there's that
right there love it you don't have to
work hard at it to build it up I mean go
NYC that is a great little fun so from
NYC I mentioned one of these in my top
glosses for fall blog PO
but the liquid lip shine these are so
saturated so richly colored like full-on
color one swipe type products I'm gonna
swatch these for you here real quick but
the shades are wine and dine that's you
know your classic fall Birkin Fashion
Avenue fuchsia is another really vibrant
one and then if you like the lighter
stuff Brighton Beach peach is really
pretty and that's got a little shimmer
just layer a little bit of this on top
of the NYX butter a bomb that I'm
wearing but see that really pretty shine
they see the wine one is definitely like
the most intense the most saturated out
of them all this pink really reminds me
of Revlon's pink pop Super Lustrous
gloss and there's the peach it's
definitely one of those that you know it
always looks shiny but it really pops
when it catches the light you have a bit
of a strong scent to them I don't mind
it but just a heads another thing I
never hear about is from Alma it's the
wake up i shadow plus primer this is in
the shade exhilarate sorry I feel like
I'm a sneeze oh well and this is kind of
your creamy base slash primer and then
you've got a pearly shade a plum and a
shimmery toast products work so well
with each other I still use a primer
underneath like my ELF or two-faced or
whatever it may be under all of this but
then this creamy shade it's like so
freakin creamy and it does go a little
bit cream to powder but it really does
make the shade you put on top pop and
look really pretty taupe can be a bit
flaky it really does perform best on top
of that cream but there's the plum and
this pearly shade is so gorgeous right
around your inner corner love and might
I add that this is one of these softest
sponge tip applicator I have ever felt I
don't know what this is made out of but
this is awesome if you're needing
something for brows this is something I
think I walked past four years and then
finally decided to pick it up somewhat
recently and I really like it it's from
Milani and it's the brow fix kid nothing
new here it's been around for a while
but this has some really nice brow
powders I actually got the shade 0-1
light because I felt like these shades
were so close to the deeper one except
these were cooler so I thought they
would work better and not look too red
if she's got too matte brow powders and
this says highlight that is actually a
gorgeous shimmery eyeshadow Milani knows
how it's done right and then there's the
brow powders cool-toned I can totally
use this on my brows and I have really
dark eyebrows but I could see that
working for a whole range of people then
you've got this little thing here that
comes up to reveal a mirror and you have
three tools a little angled brush which
i think is totally usable a little
sponge tip there which i think is
completely usable i do not love the
little tweezers i think you got to work
too hard to squeeze them together really
in this kit i think you're getting a lot
and just for those matte brow powders
alone that's a great body nice little
thing I'm going to throw in here the old
school mascara is from covergirl um
Kristin game once again got me onto the
super thick lash that's a great mascara
also the remarkable washable waterproof
I have a full review on this one on
beauty broadcast Express these are
traditional brush mascara little
bristles on there but these are great
thickening mascaras they take what
lashes you have and really add some
oomph to them I think the remarkable may
add just a hair more length but both are
great thought I'd throw those in they
seem like they really fit in this kind
of a video when people are always
talking about the lash blasts and the
rubber brushes down toward the bottom of
the display but I think they are no less
worthy of people trying them so thanks
for watching my hidden gem what have you
tried that you think I should try that
nobody else is talking about definitely
let me know and I'll talk to you in soon
