video here's what's happening I got a
bunch of stuff probably not more than
twelve dollars worth of stuff from
basically an online make up dollar store
called shot miss a I have talked about
this site before it I feel like I've
done at least one or two videos here
they're incorporating products from this
site but everything is really really
cheap so here's what I thought would be
an interesting take on this try out the
things that are best sellers according
to the website and see if they're really
that good even though they're only a
dollar like is it really worth your time
and energy to order them and I'm always
really intrigued by the best sellers on
a website even more than things that are
top rated because top rated might mean
that they are like legitimately good
because they've had a ton of reviews
posted on them and there's like a lot of
feedback there that you can count on but
with best sellers sometimes it makes me
wonder like did the website just start
plugging these certain things so they
were very visible on the website and
they just got purchased a lot but is it
for good reason you know are there's
this stuff actually good so that's what
I'm out to find I'm always up for a
hidden gem and I've been playing with
this stuff actually a little bit already
so I can have a little more info than
just a first impression to give you but
the first thing I've got here is this
one dollar primer it's the AOA studio
wonder skin poreless primer there are
gonna be a lot of products from this aoa
studio brand which seems to be the the
house $1.00 brand that wonder skin
poreless primer minimizes the appearance
of pores and fine lines leaving a smooth
canvas for long-lasting makeup
application in using this yesterday i
mean at first glance i thought oh my
gosh i wonder if this is gonna be some
super cheap dupe for photo finish but i
don't get that feeling at all on my skin
there's nothing silky about this okay so
it does look like photo finish it is
clear like photo finish but it's much
thinner and it just doesn't leave you
with any kind of nice smoothness it
feels like just a really lightweight
moisturizer I would say I guess what I'm
really getting at here let me just cut
to the chase I don't think this did a
darn thing from a foundation application
it doesn't leave my skin feeling any
smoother than when I started just maybe
added a little bit of moisture
just calling it like I see it for me as
always I don't always feel like I have
to give that disclaimer in my videos
like if I don't like something don't
take events but obviously like this is
my channel this is where I'm giving you
my take on things and obviously somebody
else might have a different impression
of something or a different preference
for something so keep that in mind next
I got this $1 sponge and it may have
been this website in the past where I
tried a really really bad sponge or
maybe it was I Kate house one of these
affordable websites you know you never
know what the sponges but this one is a
best seller and I have dampened it and I
also use this yesterday too and it just
really you know blossomed I felt like it
took in a lot of water and it grew a lot
in size and it's definitely pretty soft
there's a little different material
happening here than what you're getting
with like a Real Techniques sponge
definitely different from a Beauty
Blender there's a little more hit to the
skin even though it's softened up by
being dampened it softened up in that
sense just the texture of the material
this is made out of still has a little
hit to the skin you kind of hear that
bounce as it touches your skin
I don't know now at the time I place my
order which was probably a couple weeks
before my vacation I didn't see any sort
of coverage face product under the
bestsellers so I'm going to be using
something here that I already have I'm
gonna use the L'Oreal infallible Pro
glow and you will see me filling in the
blanks here with some other products
simply because I didn't find every
element of face makeup as a best-seller
on this site for a dollar so I'm going
to give myself a little foundation all
over
and then we're just gonna pop it in or
tap it in I feel like the size of the
sponge is kind of nice because it's
giving me even coverage but there's
something about it that even when
saturated it feels firmer than like what
you're using from Real Techniques or
that sponge from Nicks that I really
like
like I guess they found a slightly maybe
cheaper material that they can do this
with it's workable it gets the job done
I just don't like it as much the tapered
side is really nicely shaped because I
can really you know get into the eye
area they're just fine and I think
ultimately it blows up to be a little
bigger than your classic beauty blender
I'm also gonna use this sponge to work
with a new concealer I'm trying this is
the bare minerals Behr Pro and I have it
in a fair light and do a little bit of
this around the eye and the nose
hopefully it's gentle to my little
breakout I'm having down there I never
really break out in that way it's very
red very irritated seaming I'm wondering
if it's maybe that thicker um like farce
ollie
face oil the volcanic elixir I'm kind of
wondering if that was responsible
because it is a really intense oil and I
feel like maybe other parts of my face
could handle it but that area maybe
there was a little breakout brewing even
before I started with it and it just
kind of went crazy and then I tried to
put my clean and clear Pursey gel on it
which I hadn't used that stuff for quite
a while not really by choice but because
I'd been pregnant or breastfeeding and I
just didn't want to use that ingredient
and I feel like my skin flared up in the
exact area where I used that so hard to
be a freaking detective next time I push
this sponge a little further in we're
gonna see how it does for baking so I'm
gonna use my Maybelline fit me loose
powder and fair I love this powder love
love love it and just dab it on okay
that was nice and even it seems like
picked up the product well
I'm gonna go ahead and do my brows with
my ELF brow pencil this is only two
dollars this is a great deal I use it in
deep Brown mentioned it in my favorites
video and then I set that with the brow
stylist boost and set in the shade dark
brunette so I'm gonna go ahead and do
that and then I'll join you with the
next stuff okay brows are done my bacon
has swept away or might did I just say
my bacon is my baking my baking is swept
away now don't be sweeping away my bacon
though I need to do blush and bronzer
and I'm gonna lightly dip into this
little compact here for a bit of a
bronze this is my honest hacia blush
trio and cocktail party and there's that
really rich shade that uses lightly on
my skin I think does kind of make a
pretty bronzer so I'm just gonna get a
little bit of that on here and then I
promise we're moving on to more of the
bargain things it's just that not every
element of makeup was a $1 bestseller on
the website
but that sponge did I mention that that
was an AOA Studio product by the way
it's called the wonder blender that was
not a terrible sponge it was definitely
workable not really my ideal just for my
preferences but it can do the work it's
not one of those sponges where you're
like I cannot find a way to make this
work it can do it then I'm gonna pop on
some of this pink blush
maybe just a teeny bit of the coral here
- I tap a little bit off on my hand
because these colors can be very intense
but these are matte blushes and I wanted
to make sure I used matte because we've
got some glowy stuff coming up this is
the best-selling highlight it's called
wonder baked highlighter and I have it
in the shade called cupcake so it's kind
of small but I mean adequate size for
anybody for a highlight
it feels very dry to the touch kind of
like a baked style product but there's
the swatch do I need to build that up
just to hair so you can see it more it
really doesn't seem glittery or too
over-the-top here but I've got two
different $1 brushes that kind of fell
under this bestseller category both I
think are appropriate for applying a
highlight one is this big old fan brush
and it's kind of a thicker fan brush you
know not one of those barely-there ones
and this says f11 and then the F 19
which I really really love um this is
actually again only a dollar and this
totally mimics the size of my Moda brush
the size and shape pretty much not that
this one cost me a bundle but you know
it's probably like six seven dollars
when I got it at Walmart so I'll use
each brush on each side so you can see
they'll pick up some of the highlight
here I just feel like this brush is
totally worth it like it's that size
everybody wants for a pinpointed highway
anywhere on the face really I think a
brush this size really makes the most of
even kind of a so-so highlight I'm
putting a little on my Cupid's about
here but I don't know if everybody would
really think it's so so but what am I
trying to say here it's not intensely
pigmented and you might find yourself
needing to build it up a little bit if
you like a highlight that's extremely
shiny you know this brush I mean this is
a giant fan brush this is so big I'm
just gonna get a little bit on there I
don't normally even really use fan
brushes all that often in my makeup
application I feel like this is just a
whole lot of brush for me right now and
I'm kind of the products getting a
little bit too sheared out like this
isn't quite strong enough of a highlight
to be applied with a brush this big and
still be seen that was the experience I
had yesterday when I was playing around
with this too so I guess that kind of
confirms that I mean I'm not
saying this is a bad brush it does feel
very soft both seem to be really
actually well-constructed brushes nice
and solid with the ferrule and the
handle and everything you know if you
like or need a fan brush but I just
think this is my ideal for putting on a
highlight but this particular highlight
and the cupcake shade is seeming just
kind of average for me I feel like I can
build up to a pretty look but it's not
one of those little goes a long way
products you know it's just kind of okay
but the brush is fantastic and I am
gonna do a little of my so chill coconut
spray here from smash Voss smells good
sets the face and then I'm going to use
a little Milani eyeshadow primer
and then eyeshadow wise I have something
here that's gonna be kind of like a
statement type product here this loose
pigment so I'm gonna be popping that on
the lid but I'm gonna set the look up
with some other shadows I'm pulling out
my BH Cosmetics festival palette and I'm
gonna take a little bit of escape this
nice warm terracotta brown for the
crease
under the brow I think I'm just gonna
use some of the highlighter that I have
here see how that goes on kind of like
an eye shadow again you got to build it
to really see it
then I'm gonna work in this guy which
was one of the best sellers on the
website I'm pretty sure it was only a
dollar just like everything else and
it's the eyeshadow powder from princesa
says pearl powder and I got it in the
shade 27 and this is like a really
really light lilac color the top twists
off and then it's truly just a little
like thing a pigment here there's a
little swatch for you in a very awkward
spot on my hand but I use this yesterday
and I actually found the staying power
to be surprisingly good I thought okay
there's just going to be this really
lightweight powder and even though I'm
putting it on a primer I'll be surprised
if it lasts all day and it actually did
so I'm gonna pick up some of that on a
flat brush and just Pat it all over most
of my lid and then I think I'll bring in
maybe one deeper shade from that BH
palette my stance on these kinds of
things of these loose pigments I feel
like yes they can be very pronounced on
the eyes and some people might enjoy the
different texture to work with but more
often than not like am i realistically
gonna be pulling this thing out all the
time just to get this shade it is
performing well but when you've got a
pallet it's just that convenience factor
of pallets that I think it's kind of
undeniable but I think it's good quality
and I think it's well worth the $1 if
not more now I'm gonna finish off this
look with this color called swag really
pretty matte here in the BH palette and
I'm just gonna Pat some of that in my
outer corner and gently overlap that
light lilac that's there so pretty
I'm gonna just blend a little bit with
this color called candy who's kind of
buffing that out over my crease area
isn't that a nice palette though I mean
you can do so much I respect the
versatility and the quality okay I've
still got more products to use but I
don't have an eyeliner so I'm gonna be
using my makeup revolution it's called a
renaissance flick eyeliner this is one
of my favorites in my last video it's so
good really black and extremely long
wearing and also that pen style format I
know a lot of people are a fan of that
maybe as opposed to the little inkwell
me I can go either way but I feel like
I've had a lot of liquid eyeliners fail
me lately the Milani 17-hour has been
good this one has been good but so many
things just lacking on the staying power
I've been in my little mode of Jordana
color Envy for life it seemed like and
then once I started looking around to
see what else was out there it wasn't a
lot of great stuff so I'm doing just a
little wing with this today
and it put a little wet and wild
ultimate brow highlight in my lower
inner rim best thing for this zone if
you want to brighten it I mean if you
want to go with a pillar in there of
course you can do that too but if you
just want to have that wide-awake look
this stays so well and then I will
smudge a little bit of dark brown here
got an appointment to go to today I
don't need to be the most colorful thing
in the world
all that just so we can start playing
with some of the other best-selling
products one of the things that I got
and this is an AOA Studio product is the
lash curler and I have been so into my
tweezerman lash curler for the longest
time I think this is a great one it just
seems to really suit my eye shape I
think I have a very like rounded eye lid
lash line area and it just fits it so
well but I gotta say I use this guy the
other day it's got a nice amount of
squash right in here and it curled my
lashes very well um I feel like it's
maybe a little smaller in size than my
tweezer 'men so that took a little
getting used to just fitting the lashes
in there I'll usually hold a lash curler
on for like twenty to thirty seconds and
I'll do this little pulsing movement
that for whatever reason I feel like
that helps
and sometimes I'll slightly move it
outward as I do that and then you get
more of a curve to your lash curl
instead of just a bend one Bend then
I'll put on my super sizer mascara there
was not a one dollar best seller mascara
at the time of my purchase I guess
should be the asterisk on all this stuff
because best sellers obviously can
change over time this did curl pretty
well it didn't curl quite as well today
maybe I just didn't do as good a job
they also give you tucked in this little
place right here is the extra pad your
backup pad to put right in here see if
we can do even better over on this side
but lash curling is one of those things
where some people are so blessed
they have naturally curly lashes and
they can totally skip this step but for
me like I mean false lashes would not
blend if I didn't give my own lashes
kind of a curl like this and then you
find it really important to find those
mascaras that don't immediately take the
curl away so super sizer is pretty good
about holding curl not being too heavy
but I would say that lash curler is not
a dud I think it's pretty darn decent
and I think a big part of it is that the
pad that's squeezing into is squishy
enough because when they're rock-hard I
feel like I never get as good of a curl
next up you guessed it we're gonna try a
lash there was a best-selling one dollar
lash and it's called the Cara DW I guess
that means demi whispies maybe I have
tried quite a few lashes from this brand
before I don't know that I've tried this
exact style though and then also under
the bestsellers was this eyelash
applicator and these can be absolute
gold for someone who is starting out
with lashes and is really uncomfortable
about determining the placement so when
I'd been testing these things I thought
I'm not gonna try these out in advance
because I didn't want to run the risk of
these lashes getting like deformed I
wanted you to see them fresh and how
they can possibly look you know at their
best okay this is a little more
heavy-duty than I thought I thought it
was just gonna be a little plastic guy
but it's got some weight to it like
maybe it's metal maybe some sort of
coating on there but BH Cosmetics also
makes one of these that I've always
liked but the thing you sometimes run
into I think with bargin lashes is are
they evenly cut are both lashes cut the
exact same way like the same length
across and the same length to the lashes
themselves and these just looking at
them you know me glancing at them in the
packaging they seem to be really even
but you know you might sometimes run
into that situation I have before with
the cheapest of the cheap lashes but I
like the lash band if you're used to
working with salon perfect or Ardell it
feels just like those I would say these
car lashes though are even wispier than
just the regular demi whispies that you
would get there's just a little more
irregularity in how like some of these
lashes are kind of pointing every which
way they're a little fluffier looking
and I do like that sometimes when you
see it really really perfectly you know
evenly cut false lash it just screams
false lash right so I just put on a
little bit of my kiss on the strip lash
adhesive with a low and kind of working
through that and I'm gonna be comparing
it to a couple of other lash glues my
mascara what happened I would be
surprised if really anybody would need
to trim these down from left to right
they seem to be a really manageable
length not too long and I'm just gonna
lay these down and we'll see what we've
got
Wow really nice natural-looking lash as
you can see it didn't add really a ton
of length for me but it added a lot of
thickness that's nice I think that's a
very very worthy bestseller you know
like I could see a lot of people liking
that it would be great for people
starting out and playing with lashes and
you know expecting to have some
screw-ups along the way so you don't
want to spend too much and you also
don't want to look like really out of
control with them at first then you
reach a point where you're like me and
it's like just just give me the longest
in the thickest please but these are a
nice like sneaky lash if you really
don't want people to necessarily know
that you've got false lashes on but you
just want to look like they're naturally
thickened oh and I forgot the applicator
okay I'm gonna use that for this one so
here you've got this really wide gripper
and the nice thing about that is
sometimes lashes that you get are way
way too curved and someone you grip the
lashes you're gonna grip the actual
hairs themselves with something like
this it can straighten out the lash a
bit more and make it easier to come in
contact with your lash line and also if
you're just not comfortable getting in
there with your fingers and you find
that tweezers aren't a wide enough grip
this gives you that wide grip onto the
lash so I think these are ready I don't
know how much you can see here but I'm
just gonna lay them down yeah that's
very easy to work with they're
definitely I think a worthwhile tool for
someone who's starting out with lashes
and just wants to make easy work of
setting them down on your lash line it's
it's nice and for a dollar you know so
once I get my lashes on there and the
glue is drying I kind of gently blink
down onto my finger and I find that that
sets the lashes up just slightly so that
they're not drooping a very good natural
lash highly impressed okay now for my
last two products they are both lip
products and they were both a dollar one
is from beauty treats and it's the lip
scrub and a lot of the scents are the
flavors were sold out but I did get the
almond cream and it smells really good
guys and it looks you know looks like
your standard lip scrub it's creamy and
you can see the little bits of grit in
there and I would say my complaint with
this is that there's not enough grit not
enough grit to do the job you'll like I
can feel maybe two or three granules
that I'm trying to move around here onto
my lips the overall balm are like the
binder that's in here seems to be good
and and moisturizing and it has a nice
thickness to it but there's not enough
scrubbies I would say if you're serious
about lip exfoliating kit and elf lip
exfoliator stick that really does it
it's
nice bomb again I don't think they
really got exfoliated then you guys
these lipsticks the wonder lipstick
24-hour lipstick uh no I am NOT a fan of
this I have this in the shade Queen
it goes on kind of feeling like a cream
lipstick and then it's like sorry I
thought I had more grit on there now I
can't get rid of the grit this is the
lipstick that sets and it kind of gives
you this borderline tacky long wear yes
and this color happens to be like kind
of a dusty coral maybe you might call it
but it is matte it's got a nice scent it
smells like some kind of candy like a
gummy worm or gummy bears or something
but then it sets in like from this
moment on now I can't like mush my lips
together the way I might with a normal
cream lipstick like it's setting in
there it's kind of drying out but it's
gonna remain tacky for like I don't know
it seemed like hours honestly and after
I ate lunch like that was all it took
for the product to really start wearing
down and like drinking out of my water
cup and stuff like that
there's no way this is in it for 24
hours it's just out to make you kind of
uncomfortable on your lips for a good
you know three to five hours maybe and
then I was looking up close up my lips
like from the time that it took for me
to do my makeup yesterday there was like
an hour in between where I was drinking
my coffee editing and then I went to
change Eve when she woke up and I looked
up close in that mirror at my lips and I
was like oh it just looked cracky and
separated and patchy in the field look
how my lips stick together like they
really stick if I'm gonna use a lipstick
let it be creamy let it be moisturizing
I really need the moisture in my lips
right now I don't need something to put
on and dry me out and also not look good
it's not like I'm getting some any sort
of benefit out of this really because it
doesn't look great and it doesn't feel
great either and the color is something
that's kind of take it or leave it for
me so I am just going to go ahead and
remove this
and I think I'm going to use a little
bit of Too Faced birthday suit
and then I'm putting this Revlon kiss
plumping lip cream over the top just for
a little added comfort and shine so what
do we think shall we recap here the
first thing I used was that primer I was
not a fan I didn't think this did a darn
thing for my skin so that I'm gonna say
personally is not even worth your $1 the
sponge was definitely workable I was
actually surprised at how workable it
was because I've tried so many cheap
dead sponges that just were hard as a
rock would never really take in the
water and soften up but this did do that
being very picky about it and just
thinking about other sponges that I have
in my own preferences I really
appreciate the softness of the Real
Techniques sponge the NYX sponge just a
classic beauty blender as well I think
those all have a little bit softer
texture when they come in contact with
the skins this is kind of in the middle
for me we had the highlighter here it's
the Wonder baked highlight which was
just average for me I would say it gave
me a pretty enough look when I sort of
went to the effort to build it up but if
I just you know tapped into it and put
it on like I would do most highlights it
wasn't quite enough it's not bad and I
think it left a pretty enough look on my
skin but in the scope of affordable
highlights I think you can do better I
think essence the pure nude highlight is
really great of course if you want to
spend a little more money those honest
hacia highlights and the sugar glow
palette are like next-level good now
this brush this f19 outstanding great $1
brush seems to be made really well just
a perfect size and fullness for applying
highlight and it does exactly what my
mode of rush does so I can't speak
highly enough of this this fan brush I'm
not saying this is a bad brush it's one
of those really full fan brushes doing a
little shedding on us right now but I
don't think this is a bad brush it's
just for me it seems like far too big
the lash curler I think is pretty good
actually I would keep this maybe in a
travel bag so maybe I wouldn't risk
losing my tweezer man I think it can
definitely work it's got a squishy
enough pad there the size seems to fit
my eye better than expected so then
that's from AOA studio just a $1 lash
curler and I'm pretty happy with that
these Cara dwu lashes I think are a huge
hit if you are looking for something
that can just give you that little bit
of added length at the outside but
overall just thicken up your natural
lash line these are great this tool also
for a lash beginner I think is awesome
this Princesa pearl powder on my eyes
it's a pretty like light lilac sheen and
I like the texture of these they're not
like chunky textured glitter it's just a
very fine shimmer so if you're into
something like that if you see yourself
actually using and reaching for a loose
pigment type product I think this was
good
realistically I don't see myself
reaching for it all the time but for
what it is it was a good product and
then these last couple of things the lip
scrub I would skip this because really
it didn't exfoliate my lips as it should
it was a decent enough balm it was a
nice scent but it didn't really scrub
down the lips and I do not like this
wonder lipstick or I'm sorry it's wonder
lip lock is actually the name of it it
sets to a really uncomfortable place for
me I just don't like it also you guys I
haven't used these yet but I just want
to let you know these were under the
bestsellers and I do plan to use them
they're the AOA Studio makeup remover
cleansing wipes the rosewater kind they
give you 15 pre-moistened wipes in here
for a dollar so I will be testing those
out and I will report back as to how
that went yeah this was fun guys thank
you so much for watching it's always fun
to uncover some of those unexpected
things where you're like oh my gosh it's
only $1 is it actually gonna be good I
think we definitely found a few really
good things here so thank you for your
time and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
