taking the time to join me today this
video is all about a big sale that's
coming up through Sephora I guess it
comes around this time every year I know
I have missed it on occasion but it's
the VIP sales /bi B Rouge or vib Rouge
it's November 4th through the 7th
received 20% off all in-store and online
purchases with the code 20 Rouge and
then for the regular vib people its 11th
through the 14th receive 20% off also
all in store and online purchases the
code there is 20 VI B and I've got a cat
trying to get in my door in this video I
thought it would be fun to give you a
few recommendations
just like kind of some top picks things
that I have talked about recently so I'm
not gonna like and dig in and talk on
them forever but I will link below to
videos where I have explained them more
in depth if you want a closer look at
the products and then sort of go over my
wishlist of some things that I just am
really interested in may potentially
purchase from this sale I've got kind of
a ranking actually of the things that
I'm most interested in to the things
that are kind of like I don't know I
could possibly be convinced about them
so this will be a great video to discuss
in the comment section if you'd like to
encourage me towards something or away
from something or just help one another
out but I watched a video by I love
faces and I loved just getting to see
her wishlist and I thought it was really
fun to sort of get in someone's head and
see what are you shopping for so I'm
gonna start off with just some
recommendations of things that I think
are solid recommendations things that
I've tried things that I think I really
can't miss items one of them and I again
will link to every video I've done with
more info but it's the Kat Von D metal
matte eyeshadow palette this is a big
palette with a lot of variety
I think it's neutrals it's also wearable
color
it's an really awesome mix of your mats
on the bottom that your shimmers or
metallic shades on the top and I think
it's really a gentle push out of one's
comfort zone if you're always all about
the neutral I've said this a couple of
times before but I can look at half the
palette and think those are my safe
colors that I would reach for a lot and
then I look over here and think hmmm I
could see myself working in those shades
as well because they're not out of
control bright for what they are I mean
they're still colorful but there's a
depth to them and I think it makes them
approachable and wearable and the
quality of Kat Von D shadows is just
simply tremendous they blend well yet
they're intensely pigmented another
thing I want to mention are a couple of
lip kits that I think are fabulous deal
and a really great giftable option as
well in fact I see myself going back and
purchasing maybe one or two more of
these to give as gifts to people and
they are the bight lip sets one of them
is the amuse-bouche
lipstick set so you're getting four mini
sticks in that amuse-bouche formula and
the thing that I think sets each of
these kids apart and sorry they're so
shiny this set is lipstick this set is
the matte cream lip crayons and you'll
notice every shade in here is much more
vibrant you've got a couple of tones of
red a bright like kind of orchid color a
really really dark shade so if you're a
bold lip lover if you like a matte
formula this is fantastic and then over
here
creamy more neutral you are getting a
really deep rich shade here but I feel
like the bulk of this kiss all rooted in
a little bit softer color for example
I'm wearing two shades from this kit
today I mixed together pepper and fig so
like these two shades right over here
but gosh do these lipsticks feel amazing
on the lips $25 sets and to save a
little extra money on top of that I
think it's just a fantastic deal for the
quality that you get and I'm definitely
lincoln below to both the videos where i
did it's like a full Tryon of those sets
another thing that I just most recently
talked about this Peter Thomas Roth mask
set 25 bucks
available on sephora's website a mask
sampler it's so good I love already knew
I love the cucumber and the rose stem
cell masks interesting points about this
set is that the formulas are all
different you may have different
instructions for each one for example
this pumpkin mask you know that's gonna
be kind of a scrubby thing that you kind
of scrub on leave on for a little bit
and rinse off each mask has a little
different purpose it would be a great
thing to split up among friends keep
them all for yourself as a sampler it's
multiple masks uses in each one of these
little tubes great for travel as well I
can't say enough good things about that
kit and then one new thing that I'm
going to throw out there because I have
used this for now one too I've been
using this for like three days so far so
it has not been like a long-term
experimented with heavily product but I
got this Besame brightening setting
powder trio I think this was $25 as well
and you get three powders they're loose
powders in vanilla Rose vanilla and
violet now they're just light tints so
the one in the middle
in that packaging is like a very soft
yellow and then this one is a soft pink
and a soft lilac and this is the size
we're talking about with each one the
tint is very very subtle
I find the violet one and the Rose one
to be extremely brightening they have
been great little under eyes setting
powders for me over the last couple days
and I feel like I don't really see the
powder there but it has a really good
brightening effect very subtle sense on
these like you've really got to get your
nose up to it to pick up on what's there
but today I am wearing the brightening
vanilla powder which has a little bit of
a yellowish tone and I actually baked
with that like I laid it on thick that's
the first time I've tried that with any
of these on my under eye and I think it
looks really good but they all label
themselves as translucent powders each
one just takes on a slightly different
tone like it's a couple that I've
enjoyed just to wear lightly for a
little dusting set whatever concealers
there and then I tried this one for
baking and it was really good I'm just
throwing out there in this video that I
am really loving these so far and I do
plan to do a video talking a little bit
more about these and some other things
from that line soon so there's some
things right there that I think are
really good buys that would be great to
you know save a little extra on during
this sale and of course I've done a lot
of reviews lately so you know if you
know there's been something you've seen
me talk about that really resonated with
you and you've held off on buying it
this sale would probably be a good time
to jump in but now let's jump into the
things that I am kind of craving and
I've seen on the side I kind of scouted
the website and I found some things that
really interest me and I'm gonna go in
the order of most likely to purchase to
least likely to purchase but
everything's still something I'm very
interested in you feeling you got this
okay
it's the Clinique very honey holiday eye
palette I saw this and I instantly
thought this looks gorgeous it's deep
it's plummy it's rich and I really like
the quality of Clinique shadows those
are like this sleeper item in the makeup
world that some people talk about but
not enough people are talking about and
there
usually really soft really pigmented
I've loved their little eye palettes
that are like rectangular you need a new
neck um that is officially the worst
description I've ever give another
perfect rectangular unit these palettes
okay this is what I'm talking about I've
gotten a couple of them in the last
several years I got the black honey
affair palette which I loved this one
great quality there and then I think it
was last year that I got the pink honey
set okay looks like that if the quality
of this very honey holiday eye-pal is
anything like those I think I'm gonna
really go for it so I'm excited about
that next thing that is on my wish list
that I'm pretty sure I'm gonna go for is
a pretty pricey item this is an $80
palette from hourglass and it's the
ambient lighting edit surreal light
palette it's the one that looks on the
outside like it's got a marbled finish
and then it's got five different
products on the inside and they're all
things that would be new to me I do have
one ambient lighting blush in my
collection it's the one in diffused heat
I am wearing that as my blush today and
I really like it so I kind of welcome
trying to new blushes and then there's a
strobe lighting powder in there there's
an ambient lighting bronzer which I'm
really interested in and then just an
ambient lighting powder in surreal light
and that's the one that's in the biggest
rectangular portion of that palette
here's my thought on this I haven't
always been the biggest backer of the
ambient lighting powders in general just
the regular ones that are called ambient
lighting builders the one like that came
in a little trio a while back I've used
it I've used it I'm failing to find
really great purposes for those things
and so I feel like well you're just
getting one of those kinds of powders in
here which may be you know that one will
work out for me and then I've got four
other more colored powders that I'm very
intrigued about with the blushes the
highlight the bronzer I mean it's a lot
in one booth tell me what you think if
you've already tried this I know that's
been out on the market for a little
while now next thing that I'm fairly
certain I'm gonna go for is the Sephora
collection face masks set it's a sheet
masks
and while I love my Peter Thomas Roth
you know these rinse off masks I love a
good sheet mask too and I have used the
Rose mask from this line so I would be
getting let's see five other masks that
I've never used you're getting orchid
Lotus algae rose pomegranate and avocado
and they each have you know a little bit
different thing that they claim to do
but you know $25 maybe get a couple of
them like that could be a fun gift for
somebody sheet masks are easy you know
you just sit with them on you take them
off you throw it in the nearest trash
can and you just rub in the excess you
rub in that nice serum just looks really
good to me I have a feeling that's a
can't-miss type item now we're
officially getting into things that I am
highly interested in but I'm on the
fence about actually going for I really
really would like your comments on these
as to what you're most interested in
seeing me try because that could turn
the tide on some of these but one of
them that I know I've been asked about
before and I'm really thinking about
getting is the Marc Jacobs remarkable
full cover foundation concentrate and
I've heard some great things about this
product and I kind of love to try it for
myself I'm very intrigued when the
consistency of the product is thin and
really light but yet still has coverage
to it that just I'm very compelled it's
a 55 dollar foundation is it worth it
I'm kind of dying to know his
revolutionary formula offers twice as
much pigment as leading full-coverage
foundation but in an oil-free base that
blends instantly across the complexion
cover pores blemishes gosh this is the
longest sentence ever another foundation
that I'm very interested in is the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation statuses
$43 says a long-lasting multitasking
cover stick with invisible coverage for
foundation touch-ups and contouring and
this line and the claims really
intrigued me developed specifically for
the film and TV industry's most advanced
technology it is completely invisible
under the latest super focused 4k lens
hmmm one of those things where I think
do I need that in my everyday life or do
I just really want to see how good it is
you know and then
um first day beauty I had mentioned
having kind of a rough start with some
first date beauty products in my other
video little duo was called fab delights
and it was the first day beauty cream
like their ultra Repair Cream the thing
they're kind of known for and then there
was a lip product in there as well there
were things about each of those that I
couldn't really get on board with with
the ultra Repair Cream it was the scent
it was a vanilla citrus scent that I
could not really wrap my head around so
I found another set that's 48 dollars
and it's got a lot of things to sample
including an ultra Repair Cream that
just seems to be the standard like no
additional weird scent there's a
cleanser in it there's a lip balm in it
like in a little tub there's a serum and
the facial radiance pads which I have
tried and really like the facial
radiance pads so I feel like that could
be a pretty safe option if I want to go
for that final thing I'm going to
mention here and this is the thing I am
most on the fence about getting but it
still really interests me so I wanted to
tell you guys about it and if you've got
it you can let me know but it's the
Bobbie to glow shimmer brick palette by
Bobbi Brown and I have sucker for
palettes or what I only own one shimmer
brick it's in the shade nectar and I
really really like it it seems to be the
kind of thing that can highlight on me
but it's also just beautiful like it's a
little glaze right over the top of your
blush you know it looks really pretty
that way here it says you're getting
shimmer break in gold wild rose and
bronze all together in one and those are
said to be best selling shades in her
line the thing about shimmer bricks that
intrigues me is that there's multiple
colors that are accessible in each one
by that I mean I could stick a brush in
different strips and use them as
eyeshadows there's kind of a
multi-purpose function to them you can
go toward the lighter side and get more
of a highlight out of it certain ones
are going to be more like a blush and to
me this palette at a glance almost looks
like it's highlight with the gold
bronzer with the bronze and like a blush
type tone with the pinky shade that's in
there so I don't know $69 is not
insignificant at all but I'm very
intrigued and it looks so pretty
stop
myself there that's the recommendations
the wishlist love your feedback if
you've got any for me this was so fun
and I realized like giving you a wish
list is definitely not the most
informative video you know that I can
put out for you because I'm speculating
on stuff I'm just kind of chatting
off-the-cuff about some things that
interest me personally the same time is
really fun for me and I really like the
other video that I came across that did
this too and I did give you some
recommendations some solid stuff that
you can come away from this video with
so thank you for watching I appreciate
your time and I will see you next time
