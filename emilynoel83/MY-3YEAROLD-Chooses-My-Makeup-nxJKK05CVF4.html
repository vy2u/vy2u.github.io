she's doing a brow gel yes brush them
just whatever direction what's your bone
good morning everybody here I am sitting
down to my makeup area getting ready to
apply all of the stuff that Belle picked
out for me so she really enjoys getting
in the makeup room anytime she's awake
and she knows I'm in here like she's up
here so that was probably where that
video stemmed from I was up here kind of
organizing a few things thinking about
some upcoming videos and she comes up
and she's like mommy what you doing and
then it just kind of dawned on me I
should go ahead and do this video and
then later this morning after she's up
we'll discuss you know how the look
turned out but she did choose the Rimmel
lasting finish foundation which is kind
of hilarious that this happened because
I just recently picked up the new
version of this the lasting finish
breathable I think it's called and
that's going to be definitely covered
upcoming video so this is the original
and it'll be kind of nice to have
recently worn this so I can really you
know do some comparing but I wear this
in the shade soft beige and I'm going to
dot this around here I've already
moisturized but in case you're not
familiar I do love this foundation I
have a history of loving this stuff so I
think it's really good staying power
good coverage too you know it's not
going to be the fullest coverage thing
on the market but I do think it's
impressive and it's also buildable but
it's been a foundation that I have truly
liked since the start of my channel and
this is my Kaelyn brush by the way that
I got from Amazon a while back really do
like this brush
got all that redness around my nose from
having a cold lately
so real medium coverage they're
happening on my face you can still see
circles still see some freckles there
but a really good evening out of the
skin then I've got the infallible Pro
Glo concealer which I have talked a lot
about I feel like lately I think ivory
is my best shade in this and I feel like
it's a really great concealer when
you're using lighter coverage products
because it just doesn't cake up it sort
of wears really well alongside those
things it doesn't end up looking like
its own cakey little concealer layer you
know and I do find this shade to be a
little bit brightening so I can put it
wherever I really want to brighten on
the face so I'm going to blend that out
a little bit with this same brush
Everage wise you're gonna be lacking a
little something on those dark circles
this and this alone you know you'd need
that corrector to come in and help you
with that level of concealing if you do
have you know some circles to cover yeah
I haven't really taken bail through
color correcting 101 yes
I think this is looking quite good so
far and she grabbed this powder this is
the to face primed and poreless this is
like a pressed translucent powder which
I really like this one and I know she
chose it because it was pink but I'm
gonna get a little bit of this on my ELF
small tapered brush and use this for a
little under eye setting powder
mattifier Perfector kind of step
then I'm gonna very lightly set all over
with a larger brush just getting a
little of this powder elsewhere on the
face the lasting finish isn't like a
ultra tacky foundation but I think it
helps to sort of you know even out all
the texture on my skin now Eve aka
little bit aka little bittle aka Biddle
aka bitty baby picked out these next
couple of products out of the bronzer
drawer she seemed to instinctively know
that sometimes you need a contour and
then you may need a separate product for
bronzers so that's what we're working
with here we got this NYX cheek contour
duo I've barely used this product it's
in the shade double date and you've got
kind of a cool matte contour and then
this light shade here in fact I might
use some of the lighter color wow that
picked up a lot a little bit here for
brightening on the under eye area very
brightening and I'll do a little contour
here with my elf brush I think I've
mentioned in a past video I'm trying not
to take the contour quite so low bring
it up a little higher and the whole face
just ends up looking a little more
lifted
then I think I will use a little bronzer
from this palette I'll go between maybe
these two deeper shades and just kind of
put that where the Sun might shine
this is really not a bad bronzer palette
honestly I mean if you like more of a
subtle look I think that's more what
it's going to give you they do have a
pretty nice highlight in this palette as
well I just a lot of times don't find
myself necessarily needing a range of
bronzer shades like just one will
usually look like I said in my favorites
video I'm so into that julep bronzer
these days now for blush they both kind
of reached and grabbed something I think
Eve picked out this one from makeup
revolution it's beloved the matte powder
blush this is a really really subtle
shade on me but I think we'll go ahead
and try this one on first and then if we
want to amp up that color a little bit
we have the Too Faced love flush blush
and justify my love that Belle found not
at all surprised it has a heart and pink
but these makeup revolution matte
blushes are really wonderful this just
happens to be a super subtle shade like
on my skin tone it's a little light to
really show up so yeah I will bring in
the other shade yes the wise 30 year old
knew I might need a little more okay
yeah this is a pretty blush these love
flush blushes the thing I love about
this is that it's really prompting me to
use certain things that I haven't really
played with in a while just bring them
back into my mind and enjoy them I'd
even be fun to have like Tyler choose my
makeup or my mom or you know let me know
who you want is another special guest
then we have our lovely highlight here
this is the Too Faced love light and you
light up my life so this is really gold
guys very gold highlight like seriously
I'm gonna need to use this really
lightly for this to work on my skin I am
NOT a big fan of this because I feel
like I can see that sort of shimmer
trail at least up close
now I must say looking up close you know
my my coverage is actually a little
better than I expected but things are
looking a little dry just all over I
think it's all these different powders
and I forgot to ever choose a setting
spray so mommy gets to choose the
setting spray this is a Mario Badescu
the one with a low cucumber and green
tea I just love the scent of this one I
think it's really refreshing and it just
does a good job of actually giving you a
slightly dewy look when you get done
putting it on we didn't forget about
brows this is what Belle picked up the
wet and wild color icon brow pencil in
brunettes do it better
no offense so this is just a little
pencil it's actually a really decent
pencil like the color
definitely transfers off nicely but it's
not too goopy and creamy you know
creamy enough would be the way to
describe it I should totally be getting
more use out of this because this is a
really decent good pencil it's got the
spoolie on the other end and kind of
lighten up the intensity
so that step I am really quite pleased
with I love the way the brows turned out
and guess what my girl picked out for my
eyeshadow primer you know some wisdom
you're just born with I guess I'm gonna
put on this Milani eyeshadow primer
which is a favourite of mine I have been
experimenting with the Marc Jacobs and
also the wet and wild mostly the Marc
Jacobs so far and it works well I truly
can't say I have any complaints but my
Milani does work well as well and it
doesn't cost as much and then for an eye
palette she picked out the in the balm
of your hand palette here which is
obviously very cute and it does have
like all the different face stuff in
here as well which I guess I could have
gone for but I know she specifically
picked out those other face things so
that's what I used this stuff I will
work in as my eye shadow so the first
thing I'm gonna do I think I'm gonna use
this meat Matador shade the Matt Russo
color it's kind of like a rosy light
brown I'll work that into my crease and
yeah I love this palette actually so I
have no complaints here I mean if you
were ever looking to try something from
the balm this kind of palette is the way
to go you may be able to get your hands
on in the balm of your hand one but this
is the most recent release that I know
is you know out there and available and
you get like the iconic really popular
well-known blush shades in their line
you get the Bahama Mama bronzer mary-lou
manizer highlight and then these like
four different eyeshadows that are
coming from certain palettes and they
point out exactly what palette it's
coming from I think it's a brilliant
idea I love that greatest-hits sort of
best of the brand type concept so now
that I've worked that shade in I'm kind
of blending over my edge a bit I'm using
a little bit of the mary lou manizer
highlight right here under the brow
makes a great eye shadow and I think I
want a lot of brightness on my lid today
so I'm gonna use mary lou manizer also
with a flat brush and just kind of Pat
that on the inner half of my lid
and then a let's copper this beautiful
plum it has a little shimmer in it but
it's a deep plum II kind of burgundy
shade I'll Pat that on the outer part of
the lid and kind of bring it inward to
overlap
and then I'm kind of using this brush
this is the Wayne Goss eighteen brush
using this to sort of pull that shade
around a bit and kind of bring it up
into the crease and blend it there I
tell you once I start using birkin Dee's
moths any color like this on my eyes I
instantly see the green come out that's
in my eyes and then I think we'll go to
the dark dark brown here from the meet
matrimony palette and just blend that in
slightly here in the outer corner and
then we'll just submerge that right on
down to the lower lash line
then Bell picked out a blue liquid
eyeliner here that I don't know that
I've ever worn it's from Kat Von D it's
the ink liner and it's a true blue I
guess it's not even really a navy it's
like a pure blue we'll see how this
plays with the rest of the look we got
going on here I've got to use it right
and guys it's really opaque I mean it
really shows even going on top of
different eyeshadows and stuff
the heck we'll give it a little in a
little waiting here
honestly everything was kind of going
along fairly normal ahem in this blue
liner game in feel like it's losing some
juice on this other eye though
feel like it's struggling over here I
don't get it it's a very fine tip maybe
all the powder that it's going over it's
kind of getting to it and that's about
as good as I can do with that but
there's my blue liner and I think to
make it hopefully mesh in a little bit
better I'm gonna take some Alice copper
the kind of plumbing maroon here and I'm
gonna sort of run that right underneath
and that way hopefully it will tie in
just a little bit better maybe
oh my god I just remembered we have a
red lip coming up oh boy next up curling
my lashes and she chose the essence lash
princess and she also chose my covergirl
clump crusher water resistant bless her
heart she knows she knows what's up
putting the sculpted volume lash
princess up here which is a mascara that
I don't hate like I actually think it's
pretty decent I call it the mascara that
won't die in my collection because I
feel like I actually have used it quite
a bit but I don't seem to be using it up
but like it creates some decent length
and volume the thing about it for me
where it's a little lacking it's like
when I go to see if it's held the curl
you know it doesn't do that necessarily
real well and the mascara really does
kind of take the edge off of the blue
eyeliner just a little bit so it's not
quite so wild couple coats never hurt
nobody
and we'll pop this of course on the
lower lashes this is my no fail lower
lash mascara so I was so glad she
happened to pull this out
okay there's the ice little blue pop of
liner nothing wrong with that and the
only thing I have left is this
infallible Pro matte liquid lipstick in
the shade Matador so this is not one of
the pro matte glosses this is the pro
matte liquid lipstick which does have
more of those liquid lipstick tendencies
as you would imagine I haven't played
with these as much as I have the pro
matte glosses but there have been a
couple colors that I've liked from this
line so
I mean let's face it what little kids
gonna do this challenge and then pick
out like a classic nude lip I think when
a kid clearly sees color they're going
for the color the shade did apply really
nicely and I do like it as a red I could
feel the dry down starting to happen
right now and perhaps a little deepening
of the color you know I was expecting
maybe a little more brightness out of
this but liquid lipsticks do tend to dry
down soon so what do we thank you guys
how'd our girl do I mean I'm over all
like not displeased with this really she
chose a foundation that I've loved for a
long long time the lasting finish and
plus I'll have a really good frame of
reference for when I compare this to the
newer Rimmel foundation they've just put
out the pro glow concealer I enjoy and
these days if I'm struggling a little
bit with more under-eye darkness I
probably would be more likely to pair
that with the corrector of some sort but
it didn't do a terrible job by any means
and it's a really nice natural-looking
concealer that wears well I had topped
it with the two-faced powder which is a
nice little you know translucent
finishing powder this NYX cheek contour
duo I did notice a lot of like kind of
powder anus a lot of sort of fallout
coming from these shades but it's a
decent you know contour palette and then
the bronzer came from this Maybelline
palette which is good ended up building
up most of the intensity on the cheeks
with the Too Faced love flush blush this
is the justify my love shade and this is
just a mini by the way but those are
really nice quality blushes I enjoyed
that the highlight not so much this was
like putting pure like sheer gold on my
cheeks and I had to go really light with
that for it to make any sort of sense
sorry I'm losing the bud but if you can
just hang on for like two more minutes
terrific brow product here that I think
is really gonna make it into my regular
rotation for sure who doesn't like in
the balm of your hand volume to that did
a great shadow look for basic everyday
this stuff was really impressed by the
color like if you're looking for that
exact blue color it really does show up
although I did think it lost some
juiciness and intensity but I moved on
to my other eye it just wasn't really
transferring on as easily oh the Milani
eyeshadow primer thank you very much the
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
great for lower lashes this as I
not maybe my favorite four upper lashes
but not a bad mascara and then the red
lip with the blue liner I mean now I
feel like this is kind of really hit the
dry down and I can get a little bit of
color off of it but it's mostly like on
there it seems like and it may have
deepened a little since the first like a
stroke across my lips and there's a
little cling like when I touch my lips
together like that but it's not
uncomfortable it doesn't feel super
drying or super mask like so I don't
think this will be like an unpleasant or
uncomfortable shade to wear so thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed and I will see you again in my
next video bye so now I'm wearing all
the makeup you picked out what do you
think of it what's your favorite part do
you like the eyes the lips or the skin
best which is your favorite and what
about the blue eyeliner what was the
logic behind that you just like blue
eyeliner okay well that's good enough
for me I love you say thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
