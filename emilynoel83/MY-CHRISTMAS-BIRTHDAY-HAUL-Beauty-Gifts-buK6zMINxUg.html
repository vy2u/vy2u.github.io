me if you like hauls you are totally in
the right place here because I've got a
lot of new stuff to talk about I've got
some gifts that I got for both Christmas
and my birthday some stuff from a little
birthday hole I went out and did on my
birthday and then just some random stuff
too there are some like pallid II things
in here that I want to go ahead and just
show you guys but most of them are gonna
be more of a swatch thing because I
haven't used them very much yet there
are a lot of things that I have used and
I'm just piling up this stuff where I'm
like there's so much info I want to
share so I really want to go ahead and
do it and also in terms of getting gifts
there is this very personal side of this
to me you know someone's given you
something I don't feel any sort of need
to like shout that from the rooftops and
be like hey look what this person gave
me oh my gosh like that gift is just as
special and precious to me if I was the
only one who knew about it and I wasn't
like talking about it on YouTube like I
don't feel like I have to do this is
what I'm getting at but at the same time
their beauty things they're things
you're gonna see on my channel and
things that I'm gonna be talking about
if I haven't already I also find it
fascinating like the things people
choose to give you because they feel
strongly about things that they think I
would like I have several makeup
oriented friends here who are just so
good at picking stuff for me so I love
that the first thing I would have
mentioned here is actually the thing
that's on my lips it's a very orange e
with a splash of red in there I feel
like and this was from my friend Erica
and it's so beautiful it's the gigi
hadid from maybelline a lip duo
collection and this is in the shade
austin and it's so good i can't get over
the staying power here because this is
just a cream lipstick and this is a lip
liner but the two together and this
shade all day long all they we're really
comfortable just kind of that reminder
that you don't have to be wearing a
liquid lipstick to get really super
amazing staying power out of something
this lip liner super smooth like goes on
like an absolute dream 100% coordinates
with the lipstick by the way but you
know you could wear this on your own if
you wanted more of a matte look but this
is kind of a creamy lipstick it gives
you like a teeny bit of shine but I've
been wearing it now for I don't know
last half-hour or so it kind of goes on
to we're sort of looking like a matte
not super shiny but feeling like a
really comfortable cream and you guys no
feathering no feathering whatsoever I
was wearing this a few days ago when I
was out and about and I was like not
touching it up at all and I loved how
evenly at war and how it kind of like
stained the lips so that's a great great
duo I tell you Erica she's onto
something there I put this on in my last
get ready with me video but the Catrice
Prime and fine I've been using this
quite a bit it's for long-lasting makeup
it says prepares the skin improves
makeup wear refreshes complexion so a
lot of the things that setting sprays
claim to do but I do find that I've had
really good results with it and the
scent is really interesting it's like a
fresh kind of a clean and simple set but
a Centon under the less and it's very
enjoyable so I loved that I had also
used this highlighting palette that
Erica sent in by and I love like the
randomness of this because she knows how
much I like to just try anything and
everything and my makeup interests will
go from drugstore to high-end and I love
when other people have that same
enjoyment too but this is the Wet n Wild
mega glow highlighting palette I did not
have this and it's a big palette like
these look like full-size pans of
highlighter here and I've really used
this one the most so far there's a tonne
of impact from that shade very very
shiny the shimmer in it is superfine so
you don't come off looking really like
glittery and sparkly sweet peony that's
the one I've worn most but I have
another highlighter palette that I'll be
talking about that I'm wearing today but
this is a lot of fun to play with and
then you guys the caviar and rubies
eyeshadow palette from Bobbi Brown Erika
it's it's stunning talk about a
beautiful selection of neutrals colors
and textures I mean there's a lot of
matte in here these two are matte these
three are matte kind of a soft shimmer
on the top to a real like I'm sparkly
topper type shade right here and a nice
rich brown shimmer at the bottom I
hadn't realized the other day when I was
talking about my black plum singled that
black plum is actually in this palette
so I know and love that shade but
everything else is really new to me the
other day I did a look with the Navy and
it's such a good Navy like mmm I feel
fancy putting this palette on I also
feel like I have so much warmth
in my collection right now this is
really like extra fun to play with but
it is absolutely beautiful so classic I
love it so much and I just kind of want
to sit that out cuz I love the way that
red catches the light it really like
makes me want to cry when I think about
the generosity and the friendships that
I have gained here through YouTube and
the real like deep supportive roots of
this makeup community like I just I love
these people so much and these are from
my girl Kristin look at how beautiful
these brushes are Wayne Goss brushes
like she did not have to do this I have
never had any Wayne Goss brushes and
these are so so interesting like
different shapes different sizes
starting to pick up on all like the
little nuance purposes for these things
the ones I've used most so far this
number 20 I love this size and shape it
reminds me a lot of my makeup Academy
315 brush that I'll used in the outer
corner only this is a bit more stiff and
I feel like there's a little more
control with it and you can also really
nicely use it on your lower lash line
this number 18 is kind of in the
ballpark of my Sigma e25 although it's
more tapered down each side and kind of
comes up it looks a little more oval at
a glance you know and I've been finding
like with my look today I could kind of
Pat some shadow on the outer part of my
lid work it up into the crease like it's
walking that line between being a flat
brush for me and also having enough
fluff to blend so I love that this 19
brush I think I said this in my last
video where I was getting ready but it's
like a thicker denser more dense version
of my little wispy white brush from
Sigma I really like taking this along
the border of the crease shade kind of
using it as a transition and then I've
got this number 16 bigger brush like in
comparison to the others you can see
this is the biggest and then the 17 is
like the slightly smaller younger sister
to this so this is Belle and this is
Yves do they both come to the same sort
of point this one seems like a bit more
pointed at the tip but very very capable
of blending so I've used this a time or
two just sort of working around the
outside of a look but I think it could
apply shadow also and this number 17
could definitely do some application as
well because of the density the size I
feel a lot of control with that so my
word these are such beautiful brushes so
soft so well made so thank you so much
Kristen because I feel like you've
opened up a new world to me and I think
I'm just at the tip of the iceberg at
figuring out my favorite ways to use
these so that's very exciting I know
I've talked about David a lot on my
channel he is my good friend and makeup
artist for Estee Lauder he lives and
works in New York City he tends to hit
the nail on the head with certain
products he will recommend to me things
he thinks I'll like amazing creative
video ideas he is the mastermind behind
the singles cruise and all kinds of
different challenges that he's given me
and also Kristen on her channels he sent
me this Aaron rose perfume and it is out
of this world
like I can't I haven't put it on yet I'm
saving my moment for right now to put it
on today but oh oh it's so like this is
the scent
I want to forever be associated with
like I want people to smell this and
think of me like seriously if I were
having my Elwood's Legally Blonde moment
and handing my resume over to someone I
would spray it with this like it's got
that rose this outdoorsy kind of
freshness but there's a depth to it
there's nothing cheesy about it there's
nothing like okay that's the rose scent
like it's just do you know what I'm
saying it's a very refined very
beautiful scent it just makes me so
happy just a gorgeous bottle there it's
by Erin again rose to grass so lovely
David also sent me a foundation that is
really really knocking my socks off and
it's not like some new release or
anything but it's just it's fantastic
it's the YSL Touche clay am I saying
that right
'la tent radiance awakening foundation
it has SPF 22 in it and this color by
the way when I first opened it up I
thought oh but it's gonna be too dark
this is sand no it's actually not this
is actually my perfect shade I'm wearing
it today it's just right it's so good
one full pump this is gonna be like a
medium coverage perfect looking skin
foundation like I cannot believe how I
guess real it looks that's the only word
I can really put to this it looks like
real like you have actual really good
skin and I'm having some really good
skin times right now cuz I've got
with some good skincare that I'm working
with I'm not dealing with a lot of
discoloration on my skin I'm not having
a lot of things to cover up but still
there's a major need for the evening out
you know when you start your day and
you're getting going with your
foundation and this evens out yet looks
so undetectably gorgeous it's sort of a
classic liquid foundation texture but
it's a little more nourishing I would
say than just the straight-up average
kind you feel a little thickness going
onto your skin with this and I would say
the closest like drugstore alternative
that I've tried that kind of reminds me
of this would be the L'Oreal infallible
Pro glow like I definitely see some
similarities between the two but I mean
this is just fabulous I've enjoyed that
so much he also gave me some fascinating
origins products here this smoothing
souffle whipped body cream guys double
mint gum
I don't know that I've ever been this
confident in a scent comparison it's
purely like you just unwrapped the
Doublemint gum I feel like if I took a
spoonful of this it would taste exactly
like double mango I'm not going to do
that but oh it's so light and the kind
of that feeling of melting right into
the skin very very instantly there's no
work to be done to like break this
product down into your skin but smells
so so fresh I just love minty stuff and
that is just that's fascinating how
closely this double mint gun and also he
gave me this origins leg lifts to rev up
tired legs has anybody tried this this
is ridiculous this is so cooling like I
had this on the other day and just
applied it I can tell it has a very
strong minty scent but then I put my
pants on it's like okay whatever I
wasn't expecting that much out of it but
it's truly like minty cooling tingle
sensation it's awesome I really like it
it says to rev up tired legs
invigorating menthol cypress peppermint
and cedar wood absorb in a sweep to
tingle energized and detents tired
throbbing thighs and calves long day
chasing two kids around I need this I
need this kind of thing it's very very
refreshing and as they described you
know the menthol Cypress peppermint
cedar wood it's more than just a minty
scent with this one this one's
bit more complex kind of mint cooling
plus outdoorsy this one is just
straight-up Doublemint gum but both very
good in their own special ways so thank
you David he also threw in this guy from
the Victoria Beckham estee lauder
collaboration here it's the I medals and
bitter clove it truly looks like leather
like all the way around and gold its own
little mirror and then this I would
describe as like dirty bronzy taupe it's
got some sparkle in it it's hard to like
keep it from catching the light so that
you can tell it has some depth as well
but I love a shimmery mid-tone because
this is the kind of thing that is gonna
pop like that on your lid but then in
your crease it's gonna wear looking more
like that you know when it's kind of
shadowed so yes one Shadow look is
calling my name here but also mixed in
with God knows how many other matte
palettes that I have like this could be
the bright and shining gem for that so
thank you so much David I just can't get
over how fun and enjoyable it's been to
try these different gifts when I am
always like so immersed in my own makeup
world it's really fun to see what
someone else gives you now my parents
they kind of went with some Sephora
wishlist items that I had so they knew
kind of exactly what I wanted and let me
tell you it's some good stuff one of the
things that I got is this cope re set
this is from Sephora it's the face of
the day a knife set and I put everything
back in here I've been using all of it
except I haven't used the cleansing oil
yet but there's the coconut roast toner
it's like a spray it smells amazing
I like kind of spraying it on before I
even moisturize the coconut face cream
which really reminds me of like the
different water creams that are out
there you know the kinds that absolutely
immediately melt down it comes out just
looking like a standard white
moisturizing cream it goes very like
liquefied very fast yet it's still a
potent moisturizer and all like coconut
oil infused stuff but the lip love I
really really enjoy this and I am so
wanting to compare this to my the names
escaping me the Laneige lips sleeping
mask because I think this could also be
a major game changer it does have kind
of a shiny look to it and that's what
sort of fools you and makes you think
like is this so much a treatment
but I do feel like it really penetrates
it deeply hydrates there's a wonderful
thickness to it so I've been really
impressed with that and my next step is
to use that at nighttime and also that
cleansing oil that I haven't yet used I
also got this cute little guy from
Clinique it's like a little ornament but
it's got the black honey and also the
pink honey lip colors in here just small
sizes but talk about easy throw in your
purse type colors I think I had the
black honey on was it in a video or
maybe just a picture this is a perfect
shear in my case it's your lips a bit
deeper lip color my lips but deeper
ultra-comfortable
balm like I mean this stuff has been
around for ages and then there's the
pink honey right there so soft
pinky tint kind of baby lips type color
I love these so much and what an
adorable presentation - also I got a new
little fizzy art baby this one is the
theory palette in cashmere and I
mentioned how I love the minks
I love the amethyst but there are still
more wonderful Basics in this line that
I hadn't tried got your mat like really
cool brown medium brown light just
off-white color and then your shimmers
here with the cool taupe the shimmery
kind of light brown and the pearl color
I mean busy art shadows can do no wrong
in my book I'm absolutely thrilled to
have this set of basics so thank you so
much mom and dad and another thing that
they gave me that I don't have up here
is an amazing hair gadget it's this cool
little hot brush thing it's down in the
bathroom because I've been using it I'm
very likely gonna be talking about it in
an upcoming like monthly best in beauty
video but it's tremendous my goodness
guys should I broken this up into two
videos or something cuz I got more to
talk about and this is the stuff now
that I bought some of this I bought like
on my actual birthday in Ulta who
doesn't like a birthday in Ulta I got
the Mario Badescu facial spray with aloe
chamomile and lavender and this is so
accurate I think - the scent it's an
interesting combination of both
refreshing and soothing after using it
on and off for a while now I would say I
don't like the scent better than the
cucumber aloe green tea but it's good
and it's incredibly accurate and if you
are a hardcore lavender fan I think
you'll love this by the way I was
recently sent
amid some PR goodies MaxEnt there fix+
and also a lavender fix+
and i thought that versus this this
smells
ten times more accurate when it comes to
achieving that lavender scent so
definitely a good buy and i think i saw
an old his website they do sell a
smaller size of this if you just want to
experiment I'm kind of literally
struggling talking today because my
muscles in my face or sore I had a root
canal yesterday and if you gotta have a
root canal I mean there's nothing to be
scared of it's really no big deal the
toughest part is literally just having
your mouth open for that long and your
muscles you come away with so much
muscle soreness around your jaw at least
I do
so I'm sitting here talking first thing
in the morning and my face just feels
tired you know already because it was
pretty much 24 hours ago that I had that
done I also got myself this this is the
CeraVe hydrating micellar water I was so
pumped to see that CeraVe came out with
one of these and it says ultra gentle
cleanser cleanses hydrates removes
makeup and helps restore the protective
skin barrier and as with their other
products in their line they say it has
essential ceramides hyaluronic acid and
niacinamide
and it is accepted by the National
eczema Association I have not used this
yet to remove makeup my purpose for this
ever since I got it this has been what
I've been using I've been doing it first
thing in the morning just kind of like
as a cleanser on a cotton pad sort of on
you know clean skin but it gives me that
fresh slate before starting my makeup it
has been very dry here I feel like I can
definitely benefit from my seller water
being more of a hydrating step as
opposed to just a quick cleansing step
if you guys are interested I'll try it
and see how well this actually removes
makeup - like I said my basic purpose
for this is just giving my skin that
clean slate right before makeup and my
skin's been feeling really good so it's
been doing well I'd also picked up this
makeup revolution beyond radiance
highlighter palette and when I like went
up to the checkout like I was like oh
this is so amazing and I got it home and
I agree this is a beautiful highlighting
palette it's very interesting I feel
like these two shades are very much
about highlighting like you're gonna get
some glow from those I've got the white
one kind of right here on top of my
cheeks but then this last shade here
this sort of beige you
it almost reminds me a little bit of an
hourglass dim light type powder it's
more about changing the overall effect
of like everything on your skin like
wearing it all over giving your skin
just a light and gentle sheen it's
actually a lot like my Milani prep set
and glow powder okay so if you're
interested in having that kind of thing
in the midst of a couple of other actual
highlighter shades you might enjoy that
palette quite a bit but I love it the
textures are really soft kind of a dud
here but just something I wanted to try
is this NYX powder puff lippy powder lip
cream and I got it in the shade squad
goals
it's a squeezy tube and it's a very
interesting texture it is lightweight I
see where they're coming from with that
kind of powdery but yet very thin finish
and not super drying but here's where I
can't get on board with it this tip is
so big
really and you can't get a defined edge
on your lips at all it's truly like the
least precise thing out there and I felt
like I was going to the edge of my lips
I was getting it all messy it looked
like it was just already seeping outside
of my lip line before I even got started
you know I just put it on but just the
way it applies it's not neat at all like
you would have to first line your lips
with a coordinating lip liner then apply
this to like the larger flesh here parts
of your lips and then maybe feather it
out with a lip brush but that seems like
an awful lot of work I just don't like
that design let's just say these lips on
the back of the box my lips did not turn
out looking like that but look two new
mascaras one is good one is not good
from the drugstore this almay liquid
lash extenders I think maybe I got a
real dud here because it seems like
nothing's on the brush like when you
come in and out of the tube I feel like
there's some resistance there like I
know product exists in the tube but you
pull it out and the brush does look
pretty bare but there is a little creamy
formula coming off at the tip so I don't
think it's that my tube is totally like
an odd defect dried out or something
like that but I think it's the the brush
being pulled out of the tube it gets too
cleaned off and you just can't see
anything loading up on your lashes like
I couldn't see a thing
an alum a has put out some absolute Holy
Grail mascaras for me over the years and
thinking about get up and grow I'm
thinking
the one coat nourishing triple effect so
whenever they release a new mascara I'm
kind of waiting for one of those to come
back to life but I also tried and got
the new covergirl peacock flare mascara
and this one worked pretty good for me
it's a rubber bristle brush first it
looks like the bristles are twisting
around the brush but it's more like you
know there's some longer ones here and
then it kind of blossoms out with some
more length and then it goes back in and
then a little more length down here but
I would say even the longest bristles on
this brush are pretty short going on it
kind of reminds me of a super sizer
which I love but just a little bit dryer
formula than that which I kind of also
loved also there's like a grip here like
it's almost rubbery right there which is
oddly more useful than you might even
think it says flaunt a full fan of thick
lush lashes feather fan brush catches
coats and separates each lash and yes it
is very defining it's really good about
length it's not so much giving me a ton
of like thickness to the lashes but
maybe I could coat it up a little more
and achieve that I'm gonna keep playing
with this for sure I think this one has
some real potential and I'm very much
enjoying it so far couple things here
from Burt's Bees that I have not yet
used the moisturizing lip mask instantly
hydrates and defines lips can't wait to
try that and they have an overnight
intensive lip treatment again something
else to try against Milan edge lip
sleeping mass have not used but I will
and I will report back lastly here a few
more pallets several that I have not yet
used including a two new dose of colors
palettes which I have been incredibly
impressed by their little eye shadow
palettes the baked Browns and the
berries one that they came out with us
was that about a year ago those are
beautiful they just do some wonderful
all matte super pigmented palettes so I
had to jump on the sassy siennas let me
tip the mirror down here that's sassy
siennas oh is that screaming summer at
anyone else love it and then I also got
blushing berries with these intense
pinky moths like that Center shade there
i chi Wawa yes I'm all here for it
really rich black the brushes in here
actually look amazing a little pencil
type brush and then a brush that you
could use kind of detailing outer
possibly the lid also and then the
product I am wearing on my eyes today I
got my very first violet Voss palette
from Sephora and this is the hashtag--
palette I've had questions about this
line I just hadn't taken the plunge and
finally did so I feel like we've got a
very clearly laid out Cutler scheme here
you got your purples you got your peachy
kind of warm shades a bunch of colors
with a golden and very like yellowy gold
twist right in here and then across the
top five basic mattes in using this
today the thing that I thought was
missing was a light shimmery shade
because this is your light matte
highlight color which is fine but I kind
of like you know a super light shimmer
to go around the inner corner but what
am I wearing today sauce and goat I've
got those two in my crease
I've got foam oh this really light
peachy shimmer all over my lid I've got
a little bit of TBT blended out in just
the outermost corner also and my liner
by the way I went for another colored
liner this is the infallible paints in
wild green this actually looks greener
by quite a bit than the Too Faced sketch
marker that appears to be dark green so
just FYI I am very pleased with the
textures I was really impressed with how
I was picking up what I felt like was a
nice amount of color from the mattes up
top but they weren't kicking up hardly
any fallout at all obviously loads of
possibilities here way more than what
I've even you know dipped into I'm
attracted to the peaches the Purple's
the bronze II kind of shade so I think
this is gonna be a fun one so that is it
thank you guys so much for your time I
feel like this went on forever and ever
so if you're still here with me I love
you thank you so much I hope you're
having a great day staying warm I have
heard so much from those of you also who
are using me as your workout companion
like putting on a video while you're on
the treadmill or the elliptical or
whatever so thank you for letting me
join you in that way so can't thank you
enough love you guys and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
