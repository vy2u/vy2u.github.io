little chat about mascara once and for
all here I know I dropped a little
tidbit in a video a while back saying
how I feel like I've come across a
mascara that I might like even better
than covergirl super sizer witch for a
little bit over a year now I think has
been a solid favorite repurchase mascara
of mine now between mentioning that in
that video and now I've also
experimented with a few others and I was
kind of reminded of a couple of
rediscovered favorites too that really
were favorites in the past for a reason
and I've tried them again and been like
oh yeah I love those too but I've still
got a number one in this video that I'll
lead up to that I think is just
absolutely fantastic and let me give you
a little backstory in case you're
unfamiliar with my lashes because we all
have different lash types and that's
another reason why I wanted to mention
more than just one mascara in this video
because eyelashes can be like the hair
on our heads you know it responds
differently to different products we all
have different kinds my lashes tend to
be not super full and I have very very
straight lashes I find that my lashes
can get weighed down very easily any
curl that I try to put in them prior to
applying mascara can get just sort of
wiped right out of the lashes very
easily with certain formulas and to top
it all off my lashes aren't particularly
long either so I feel like they can
always benefit from a mascara that will
add some length as well so I like length
I like thickness I like the ability to
hold curl I like it to wear without
flaking off on my cheeks throughout the
day and ultimately as one who does wear
false lashes a lot it's like the mascara
really has to do a lot to impress me and
wow me and satisfy me so I want the
biggest lashes I can get from my mascara
so I'm going to start off just give you
a little refresher here on the super
sizer this is still in my eyes a
fantastic mascara it's not really your
typical mascara wand it is somewhat flat
on two sides and those sides can tend to
hold a little bit of product
there and then you can sort of rotate
the brush as you apply it and sweep that
product through this is a concept that
if we were just talking about this
product and I hadn't tried it yet I
probably tell you oh that will probably
overload my lashes or gunk them up way
too much but honestly this has been a
great mascara for creating length I do
find it builds on itself nicely it wears
all day on me without flaking and I can
use it on my lower lashes pretty well
too and one of the most important
factors being it does hold a curl for my
lashes so I curl my lashes first I will
hold that curler on there for a good you
know 15 seconds and maybe a couple times
throughout I will slightly change the
position of the lash curler just so I
don't get one solid crimp you know what
I'm saying and the separation is good
with this mascara too so it's got many
many things going for it there's a lot
of reasons why I've continued to
repurchase that and then another just
great mascara for a very specific reason
is my covergirl clump crusher water
resistant I use this a lot on the lower
lashes it's kind of become a go-to when
I'm trying out different mascaras and
I'm not sure what they're going to do on
my lower lash line
and that's a risk that I don't want to
take on a certain day you know you know
you're going somewhere something
important is going on and you don't want
to risk having the lower lash line
smudge that happens to me all the time
with mascaras some people like their
lashes will hit them up above and
there'll be transfer up here I've never
really had that issue for me it'll
always be down below I've got some
fairly long lower lashes and so this has
always been great for not going anywhere
it doesn't overload the lashes the brush
is very manageable not too big and this
like the super sizer is another one of
those rubber bristle brushes which you
know when these first started coming out
I wasn't in love with them but there
have been several mascaras that have put
out a really good formula with that
rubber brush and it's worked well for me
this can also be a fine mascara to wear
like on your upper lashes too I'm not
saying like this has to be strictly
lower lashes because it can wear okay on
the uppers as well it doesn't provide as
much volume or length as any of the
others that I'm going to mention in this
video for me it's just worked well for a
specific purpose that being you know
the lower lashes and if you also have
that problem with a lot of mascaras
wanting to smudge on the lower lash line
this could be a good one just to have on
hand now just in the past couple weeks
I have tried out this puppy again yes
this was like an Emily award-winning
essence mascara I love extreme crazy
volume mascara and I came back to this
because I had tried those lash princess
mascaras from essence and honestly while
those those were good those did get a
little better with time for me I don't
think either of those do for my lashes
what this one does and this is another
one of those crazy rubber bristle
brushes it's a lot of really really
short bristles with this one and you do
kind of have to clean off the tip and
make a point to do that but you will
notice that there are bristles at the
very end of the wand as well and in
years past I had sung the praises of
this mascara for building thickness
building length just being a really good
volumizing big lash mascara and I was
reminded of that recently and so I
thought if I do a video on my new
favorite mascara I kind of feel the need
to bring up the fact that yeah this is
really good too and I don't know that it
lengthens me out quite as much a super
sizer but you know it's certainly in the
ballpark and it's a very affordable
mascara so I do want to make sure I
mention that another rediscovered
mascara another former Emily
award-winning mascara of years passed
Too Faced better than sex I went a long
time just not using this it was one of
those products where it's like okay I've
determined I like it I think it's a good
product now I've got a million other
things to dry this is going to take a
back seat and it took a back seat for
the longest time and then you know I got
one as part of a little kit recently and
I used it again and I thought yes I was
completely reminded of how much I love
this mascara for creating the look of a
lot of lashes a lot of fluttery soft
lashes it's a traditional bristle brush
with just the slightest bit of a pinch
in in the center a little bit of an
hourglass shape I don't like extreme
hourglass shapes in mascara brushes
because I think a lot of times then you
are not able to hit that middle part
with your lashes but here it's such a
shallow little dip in there that you can
totally still reach all of your lashes
with this brush it really just feathers
amount fans them out I mean it can give
me a very dramatic look one thing I was
also reminded of though is that this
will have a tendency to smudge on me on
my lower lash line so this is certainly
one of those situations where I would
put covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant on the lower lashes but
assuming I hit the sweet spot with this
mascara where I've applied just enough
on the upper lashes to lengthen them out
thicken them up but not applied too much
to where I've overloaded them and
weighed them down this can be a really
really beautiful just stunning mascara
and so I was really reminded of that
recently too still the one mascara that
I was referring to that I thought hmmm
this is really changing my game this
remains on top for me I'm talking about
the it cosmetics superhero mascara I
have it here in a sample I'm working
through like a couple of samples of this
stuff before I go ahead and buy the full
size but this has been just everything
in the littlest nutshell possible this
is how I can just describe this mascara
this does everything for me that
covergirl super sizer does but it does
it more quickly and I feel like I end up
with even more like drama thickness to
the lashes like bigger looking lashes I
really love the brush its traditional
bristles they get a little bit shorter
as you get out toward the end I find it
very very easy to get right in close to
the base of my lashes get into my inner
corner and I took some video of me
applying this earlier just so you could
see like how quickly it actually builds
up my lashes and my lashes look like
there's nothing there at first and then
it's like boom there is one coat and it
is totally awesome and then I just wait
a little bit I don't let it get 100% dry
before I apply my next coat but I just
go on with the next if you want to build
up even more length and thickness it
just really goes there for me and
doesn't flake off I feel like I can wear
this with confidence on the lower lashes
- it does hold the curl - and that's the
really fine line that most mascaras
cannot walk is being able to thicken my
lashes up this much you know add this
much product to my lashes but still be
really super light and I feel like I can
really go to town applying it not hold
back and feel like yes I love the result
the Too Faced better than sex I kind of
have to watch myself just a little bit
more it's like this mascara has its
limits for my lashes if I really want to
maintain that curl this one it's like
you know you just go you just put it on
and it really really delivers and I just
I'm very excited about it I'm not
excited that my new like favorite
mascara is not at a drugstore price but
at the same time I feel like an
impressive mascara is an impressive
mascara it's worth talking about it's
worth sharing
I still think covergirl super sizer is
great you know if this is a little
basketball team like this is my starting
lineup but this one is kind of like the
star who scored the most points right
now so if you guys have tried this
mascara tried any of the ones I've
mentioned would like to share your
feedback basically on all things mascara

section what you've been enjoying this
one certainly is changing the game for
me I love the superhero mascara thank
