in today we're gonna be talking about
fenty beauty I have had so many requests
to talk about this line and ever since I
showed my will haul on snapchat and
Instagram you guys were like you got to
tell me how is this working for you so
I'm here to explain how these different
face products worked for me it's a
definite like complexion heavy line
right now so we're talking about
foundations and different contouring
concealing blush highlight type products
don't have any sort of eye shadow or lip
product from this line they do sell a
lip product but I don't have that but
yeah this video is not my first rodeo
trying new products on not a first
impression I've been playing with these
on and off for the past week or so but
as I go in this video I'll explain the
formulas we're dealing with and the
different colors and this and that and
yeah I welcome your feedback in the
comments section as well if there's
anything you've used from this line and
I do feel like I'm just adding my review
to the pile of reviews of this brand on
YouTube but I do think what makes
reviews valuable is having a lot of them
to see so many different people so many
different preferences different skin
types different skin tones the key is
just finding you know I think a group of
people that you know will give it to you
straight and honest and take those
reviews lump them together and help
yourself figure out your buying
decisions but anyway I'm just rambling
now here's my video I'm going to show
you applications along with my reviews
as we go so take a look
alright guys first things first we've
got the foundation here and this is
called the pro filter soft matte long
wear foundation and it's in this I think
really pretty and kind of an usually
shaped bottle frosted matte type of
container it does have a pump which I
appreciate I am very Pro pump with
foundations and I wear this in the shade
190 and there are forty shades total in
this line which makes it really
outstanding I think in terms of giving
hard to match skin tones likely
something that will match them all so
people on the very light or dark ends of
the spectrum who struggle to find like a
really good shade match so I think
that's awesome and I also found the
descriptions to be pretty helpful as I
was trying to find which shade I would
be so I have 190 and that's described as
for light to medium skin with neutral
undertones
that's the one that works for me and I
do find that it is a pretty accurate
shave match to where my skin is at right
now and the short story they say about
this foundation is that it is a soft
matte long wear foundation with
buildable medium to full coverage in a
boundary breaking range of shades so
this said to shake well and then I will
pump out one full pump and a little
extra and it's very very liquidy a very
runny foundation not as runny and
liquidy as that latest Double Wear one
the water fresh and I recently talked
about as far as liquid foundations go
this just feels very very liquidy and
not too you know terribly different from
a lot of liquid foundations out there so
once I've gotten that patched all over
my skin I like to use my Sigma f80 brush
with this and something that I've
noticed with this foundation is it does
have this nice ability where it seems
like it's almost hanging together as you
blend it across the skin like it blends
very easily and very nicely on my skin
you know it's practically like it's
creating this veil you know instead of
ever looking streaky or anything like
that it's an extremely even application
with this stuff
I do find it to be mattifying um you
know I feel like I just went over my
nose there I'm seeing a real absence of
shine in that area and so I think you
know while this brand may be succeeding
in terms of catering to lots and lots of
skin tones odds are foundation of this
type is not going to cater universally
to all the skin types that are out there
so if you are super super dry and you
benefit from a foundation that gives you
a lot of extra moisture or you don't
love you know the all matte finish this
might not be for you still but I
wouldn't be surprised if the line you
know continue to expand after this this
is really just an initial launch that
happened and while it was a lot of
products I think there's still more that
can be done so as I look at my skin up
close right now I am seeing a very even
medium coverage it's super consistent
all over my face like I said it blends
out really easily as liquidy
Foundation's tend to do but still I mean
it's it's super even coverage it does
not feel tacky on my skin it feels
pretty smooth I don't feel a total
absence of moisture but I can already
tell areas of my skin that do tend to be
dry certainly don't look moisturized
right now like there is a little look of
a dryness in some spots they claim that
this is gonna be light as air on your
skin I feel like I agree with that they
say it's resistant to sweat and humidity
these last few days that I've been
testing it actually we have gone from
like a perfect little fall feeling
climate in this area - very very humid
once again so I have put it through some
sweat and humidity and I really not
feeling the staying power so much with
this foundation I feel like I've tried a
lot of things that have lasted better on
me than this because I don't really have
a super challenging skin type for
staying power my trouble area tends to
be around my nose you know but I felt
like I was having a staying power issue
pretty much everywhere is I've checked
this stuff in the afternoons that I've
been wearing it I felt like it looked
pretty non-existent on my face you know
just looking at the sides of my face and
stuff like that and I am normal not
terribly oily skin at all usually my
only issue problem areas around my nose
or my t-zone so while this found
really excels in terms of being able to
give you a shade match and blend ability
and just ease an application and all
those things and also if you like a
matte foundation it does look matte you
know at the start and while I didn't
look terribly greasy by the end of the
day that wasn't the issue it was just
like the the look had faded from my skin
so much next up from this line I got the
trio of match sticks this is a very cool
packaging design because we've got some
sticks here but check it out they
magnetized so you could have a whole big
army of these things and like them
together I mean I totally just got into
my child's magformers last week and
really enjoyed that so yeah I'm loving
the magnetic element to this line but
you can get a little trio of these to
sort of get a flavour of what they're
meant to do I got the trio in light and
this is the lightest trio of shades
available I was going back and forth
like in my medium and my light but from
what I could tell from swatches a
contour would be as dark as I'd need and
the lightest shade might be able to
conceal for me I thought anything darker
with that I might not be able to use it
as concealer and that is the claim with
these it says each set comes with two
match sticks matte skin sticks for
concealing and contouring and one match
sticks shimmer for highlighting they say
they're weightless easy to blend and
stay put it's a cream to powder formula
that's how it's described and they say
it's impossible to tell where skin ends
and makeup begins the shade that is
going to be my concealer is called linen
so I've got that and it does twist up
this way so it's just looking like you
know a jumbo lip balm with this cool
little hexagon shape amber is the color
that I would use to contour with and
it's definitely a good contour tone and
then the shimmer skin stick that's part
of this trio is in the shade starstruck
and we will talk about that more in a
second far as the shade and then I
ordered one just individually because I
wanted a shade that could act as a blush
so if you look under the line of shimmer
skin sticks you'll find one called
yacht life and this is a pretty peachy
shade with a golden shimmer so it's my
first step with these I'm going to take
linen
I am going to truly use this as directed
as concealer so I'm going to take this
and patch it over like this top area of
my skin here hoping to add some coverage
and as you can see it's a little you
know lighter than my skin so it's not a
total skin tone match but I'm getting
added brightness out of a color like
this it feels creamy going on but there
is some stiffness to these sticks and I
don't find them to be the easiest things
to blend there's a little more dryness
in these than I would like to see and
definitely much more dryness than I want
to be putting on my under eye area
and again I feel like you know that
foundation was really geared toward
people with oily skin and then these
matchsticks are none too moisturizing
either and they claim that cream to
powder formula I don't think they truly
feel cream to powder because things that
really do that just get this silky slip
to them like immediately this just feels
like a really stiff cream you know a
kind of stiff dry cream but it's not
setting too quickly on my skin as you
can see I was able to get everywhere I
used my Sephora Pro airbrush concealer
brush which tends to apply a good amount
of pressure to areas where I need it and
it's able to blend out most anything I'd
certainly achieved madness brightness up
in here but um this isn't gonna be the
kind of tone that eradicate syou're
under-eye circle I mean I can still see
that through there because that's the
thing that takes either just you know
the ideal concealer to shade for me or
some sort of a peachy corrector like
that's just what my skin demands in that
area so that under-eye area is I'd say
looking kind of dry on me now and as I
wear these it tends to look even more
dry and also dry like right up and here
this area between my eyebrows where I
just tend to have more dry skin next up
I'm going to use the amber contour shade
and this like I said is a really really
good color to contour with kind of cool
and tone it really mimics the natural
shadows you know that develop on your
skin I am using my Real Techniques
contour brush and this is again kind of
good for applying that pinpointed
pressure blending that contour exactly
where I want it blended and not pulling
it too high or too low
I said about the formula of the last one
you know it's the same story here it's a
stiff kind of feeling as it grazes
across the skin it's not super creamy
maybe the thing that holds up staying
power wise really well on oily skin but
on dry skin it kind of just exaggerated
Strine us the color tone of this guy's I
really enjoy I think that's such a
natural contour and I may continue to
use this from time to time because I
think that's just really a dynamite
shade there what you may not be able to
pick up on as well just watching me on
camera is the amount of pressure that I
have to apply to get this blended out
it's certainly not going to be one of
those things that leaves any annoying
tackiness on your skin but I think it
lacks some creaminess so I've used both
of the matte match sticks now I'm going
to break out of that trio that I got and
use the one the individual one that I
got for blush called yacht life and I'm
gonna just kind of draw some of this on
the outer part of the cheek here again
this is a peachy shade that has a kind
of golden sheen to it I'm just gonna
blend that out with an elf small stipple
brush and while this shade does contain
shimmer it's not an entirely different
formula like it's got a similar feel to
the others it leaves zero moisture on
the skin you know you've gotta apply a
good amount of pressure as you as you
get that blended pretty shade though I
feel like what I'm finding over and over
again with this stuff I've tried in this
line is like the formula may not be
everything for me but the shades are
really good like I like the colors of
the matchsticks I like the color of the
foundation I like the color of this
blush in fact I might add just a little
bit more of that I think if your skin
tone is on the deeper side or on the tan
side this the shade may not be quite
enough to show up super well but for my
skin tone or anyone lighter than me I
think you might have really nice luck
with this I think that's supernatural
super radiant even though it contains
shimmer it's not like an ungodly amount
of shimmer and let me tell you we are
about to the point in the video where
we'll bring in the shimmer because there
is one of these matchsticks the one that
came in the original
tria that I bought and this one is
called starstruck very very shimmery are
we seeing this we're talking super light
very reflective has a hint of like a
pinkish undertone to this shade and so
if you consider that a person with the
lightest skin tone is gonna buy that
trio they're gonna need a highlight
that's gonna really bounce off their
skin and I think this will definitely do
that as I look really close and kind of
blend it out on my skin I'm seeing
ultrafine flecks of shimmer here this is
not one of those liquid or creamy
highlights that ends up just looking
like undetectable really sneaky sheen on
your skin it's not sneaky at all there
is identifiable bits of shimmer that I
would call like micro fine glitter is
what it looks like when you look up
really close so I'm gonna put some of
this on for you so you can see what I'm
talking about and again just like with
the other formulas this is kind of dry
it's kind of tugging across my skin but
it's gonna give me just an absolutely
luminous dewy glow I'm gonna go down the
nose with the spine I'm gonna put a
little bit on the Cupid's bow I'm just
gonna start blending I'm gonna try a bit
blend really carefully and lightly with
my finger here
what I'm trying to do here is just sort
of press the product into the skin and
hope the the heat from my finger can
just work it in a little bit better
because it is kind of a dry stick but a
beautiful color I really I could do
without the actual like identifiable
specs of of shimmer there it doesn't
look particularly pretty as I look up
close at my skin just because these
sticks are a little bit dry and I'm
seeing you know a lot of dryness up in
here between the brows it's not
specially pretty but you will find the
very satisfying thing about the
matchsticks is that they all hang
together in a little chunk and so now
I've got blush contour concealer
highlight all together and the trio of
the match sticks was $54 but to get one
match stick so like the one blush that I
got that's $25 just to get the one I
also got one of the powder highlighters
it's one of the kilowatt highlights
freestyle highlighter duo in lightning
dust and fire crystal so here is
lightning dust right here here's fire
crystal one is more like subtle sheen
more of a pearlescent softer shimmer and
then the other side is absolutely like
wild shine right here so I'm going to
start with a little bit of this shade
you see see and again I'm going on top
of other highlighter that's been applied
to my skin and we're definitely trying
to create the illusion of some moisture
and glow on this skin because it's been
very dry products thus far but I'm just
dabbing some of this shade everywhere
it's definitely bright enough to like
show up on my skin that's for sure I'll
give you a little splash of this shade
to give you a little bit of that right
over here it really shows and that's
what's hardly any product on the brush
like these are really serious highlights
this is a very bright highlight I think
if you were the fairest of the fair skin
you would find that this stood out on
you because it's just next-level
brightening and there's a really yellowy
shade in this line there our pinky
looking highlights I think they've got a
lot of variety here so I did my eyes and
my lips there's no like eyeshadow
palette from this line and I think
there's one lip color but I didn't order
that maybe I should have but I'm sure
it'll show up in one of the million
other finding Beauty
views on YouTube but yes far as these
face products go I mean I feel like I'm
radiating glow right now but it's so
funny because to feel the texture of my
skin it's really very very dry like I
couldn't wait to give myself some
spritzes of setting spray after I had
gotten everything on here my skin just
really seemed like it was lacking
moisture and you might think that it
should have better staying power
therefore because it's not like dewy
tacky
you're like prone to transferring off
like onto my hand or something else
throughout the day but oddly enough I
had a lot of fade from this foundation
as the day went on and it wasn't in a
like my oils are breaking it down type
of way it just seemed too like evenly
seem more and more non-existent on my
skin the match sticks you know really on
point shades I was very happy with
everything in the set and I also liked
the individual one that I got but it's a
kind of hard to blend formula the shades
worked really well but it's a stiff
stick that does kind of pull across the
skin now as far as this particular
highlight that I got this one in
lightening dust and Fire crystal like if
you're a really light skin tone and you
struggle to find something that's gonna
pop off your skin I'm definitely not the
lightest of the light but if you are
there I'd still like this would be a
really poppin highlight for you one is
no doubt more frosty than the other side
but it's not in a thick chunky glittery
way my overall impression is just that
we've got a line here that's really
mastering shades I think there are still
things that this line needs in terms of
different formulas to make it really
workable for a wide range of people
because having all this on my skin now
you know it's just it's not really
meshing for me it's not a texture that I
look up close that and think yeah that
looks awesome you know the closer I get
the more I want to back away because I
can see dryness up in here I can see
more dryness around my eyes I'm normal
skin just not absolutely loving this for
my skin type and I think drier skin it
could be even worse for you but thank
you guys so much for watching this video
I don't want to come across as to like
negative on the line because I think
there's a lot of wonderful things
happening with the line I think it's
just something that formula wise could
stand to have a few new additions and if
you struggle to find that proper found
in shade I think you've got a really
good shot of doing it here and I was
honestly surprised that I was able to by
just shopping online actually find my
shade sometimes a wide range of
foundation shades can do one of two
things you can make you feel like oh
they're gonna have my shade but then you
can also feel super intimidated by the
fact that there are so many shades to
choose from how do you hone in on your
one color that was definitely possible
for me to find a good shade match in
this line and hopefully those who are on
the lighter and darker end of the
spectrum felt like they were represented
in this line as well but again guys
thank you for your time I'd love to hear
your feedback if there's anything you've
tried let me know how it worked for you
in the comments section and I will talk
to you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
