joining me I am back home now from
Destin our vacation to Florida was just
amazing it was exactly what I needed I
think was what everybody needed we had
the best time the hype about Destin is
real like the beaches the white sand the
beautiful waters the location everything
was perfect it was seriously the best
time ever so I'm excited to go back but
for this video I thought it would be fun
to share some of my most used products
because it's kind of interesting how
much you can actually trim down the
makeup routine when you've got like all
sorts of fun outdoorsy things on your
agenda you know you can really get it
done in a flash but still have an
effective look I guess you'd say
and truly I love my vacation makeup
because it was so minimal I wasn't
caring about being scrutinized on
Instagram or you know whatever the case
may be which I'm not really anyway you
know what I'm saying was just less about
perfection and more about ease and
function and just kind of getting out
the door with something that you felt
good about now I swam a lot on vacation
there was a lot of time spent like at
the beach so then our condo area was
sort of surrounded by a pool so I was
swimming a lot and I'm not really the
type that just like goes to a pool and
sticks my toes in it or lays out the
whole time like I get in and I swim I
you know I don't want makeup to be
running down my face and I don't want to
have to go through you know removing it
really I just want to be able to
transition from one part of my day to
the next basically and have my makeup
work for whatever so sometimes that
meant like zero eye makeup so I'm going
to share my little four product looks
that I did talk about on snapchat my
Instagram story I'll reiterate that year
for you at the start because that really
worked for me for pretty much anything I
needed to do I use this it cosmetics CC
cream and I use the illumination I
brought my other one but I'm running
kind of low on that just a regular and I
thought I've got more of the elimination
whoops
might as well use it and I do wear this
in medium it was so good like this was
my primary Sun Protection all over my
face and it was so perfect and if I
spend a lot of time in the Sun it is
very common for me to get a little bit
rosy right on my nose that
my problem zone I think it's harder to
keep sunscreen hanging on right there
plus is just like poking out so you know
you get read there but I didn't get
burnt at all on my face and I used this
SPF 50 plus the CC cream all over my
face every day I'm wearing the
illumination version again right now I
mean it is pretty glowy but it just felt
right I didn't feel like I wanted a
bunch of heavy matte coverage while this
still did offer some coverage and really
even out my skin tone just the texture
of it the look on your skin is very real
and skin like and the added glow I think
is really pretty so quick for product
look that was definitely the first thing
going on and then this Urban Decay
lipstick I have the naked heat palette
it was sent by Urban Decay PR along with
it they sent a couple of liners and
several lipsticks one of the lipsticks
called heat I just tossed the lipsticks
in my travel bag just I thought maybe I
can experiment with these while I'm on
vaycay and this shade and heat is kind
of like a rest with some shimmer it's a
really interesting shade I found myself
just reaching for this for a really
light look on the lips like I'm wearing
this now over lip balm just kind of
sheared out and spread out with my
finger and then I would also dab a
little bit of this on my cheeks just
spread it out like that and it looks
great it looks so good especially with a
hint of pan on the skin like that color
is awesome and I went over my brows but
with nothing super precise or difficult
and I'm wearing this in my brows today
it's the hard-candy brow ink in medium
dark it's a super fine little brush here
and it's almost to the point where it's
so fine you could use it if you had like
a little pinpointed area you needed to
fill in but just for going through the
brows giving them attentive color also
offering a lot of hold this is fantastic
so this is a great one-step brow look I
left out of step after this I just put
out a little concealer and i used this
infallible pro glow in the classic ivory
shade a lot and i'm normally one who
appreciates a lot of coverage in a
concealer like i'm not here to mess
around wear concealer is concerned i
want it to cover stuff i want it to be
long wearing however when you're going
for this really kind of light skin like
natural
make up look you don't want a super
heavy concealer paired with something
like this that's very luminous and light
and glowy all over the skin you hear me
on that like heart-shaped tape would
have probably out worn this product a
little bit look too heavy too matte and
this concealer well I don't get a huge
glow aspect from it it's just a lighter
concealer and it was a little bit
brightening for me it's just a typical
wand applicator here I'm wearing it
again today I mean I don't feel like I'm
especially glowing on my under eye it's
just a lighter concealer is the way I
would put it and it just worked so well
alongside this product this reminds me a
lot of that concealer from Becca the
name is escaping me right now there's
just a more lightweight very liquidy
concealer and that's kind of what this
is so I do think this kind of a
concealer does have its place and was it
covering absolutely everything was i
caring to cover absolutely every little
imperfection on my skin no I just wanted
something that maybe made me look a
little more wide awake and could
transition from part one of the day
which might have involved shopping or
going out and doing something and then
straight into some afternoon beach or
pool time so these four products were
very good the CC cream the concealer the
lipstick which can be lip and cheek very
easily and then the browing now other
things that I brought and I did get use
of you know for other days or if I was
going out at night Tyler and I were able
to have a couple dates on this vacation
so I did glam it up a bit more and I
took my tweezer Minh lash curler love
this thing even if I don't do any
mascara or any eye makeup eyelash curler
is great to have and this one is the pro
curl and it's actually marketed as
something that's good for round eyes I
don't feel like I have the roundest dies
ever but this really does fit my lash
line super well and it catches every
lash in there so I love that and the
mascara that I would use if I put some
on with the lash paradise from L'Oreal
this stuff is so good I'm wearing it
today
like it's so lengthening so thickening
and it actually does a decent job of
holding a curl for most of the day as I
said my last video so there's the brush
on that
kind of a Too Faced better than sex dupe
type product really didn't use powder
hardly at all on this trip and I'm kind
of proud of myself you know I just I
didn't want to it just seemed wrong you
know to walk around his sunny Destin
Florida in the heat humidity with a big
powdery face I did take this little
Besame it's kind of a mini size of their
brightening vanilla powder
it says translucent it's got a little
bit of a yellowish tint to it kind of
like a banana powder and I would set the
under eyes sometimes with this or maybe
set the t-zone just a little bit but I
only reached for it a couple of times
it's a great powder I'm not taking
anything away from it but just for this
trip I didn't use a lot of powder if I
used an actual blush it was the
Maybelline fit me in wine I've got a
little bit of that on today I just love
this color if you watch my get ready
with me video like I said this is Snow
White's blush here this is that kind of
a rosy beautiful flush and this is going
to be a great all-around summer blush
the bronzer I took with me and did use
occasionally because I thought it just
looked great on top of tanned skin is
this sweethearts baked luminous glow
bronzer from Too Faced the sweet tea
this is so beautiful I love the amount
of Sheen in this product great on the
face you know but also the neck and
chest and shoulders all over the body
basically this is such a great bronzer
and the one area actually of my face
that I got the most sums like right here
on the top top part of my forehead I
don't know if I got as much of the CC
cream up there or you know the Sun was
just really getting down on that area so
it kind of gave me JLo forehead
you know J Lo's got like the glorious
bronzy his most beautiful forehead ever
and this looks really pretty is kind of
skimmed across there to help it blend in
with the rest of the face I did take a
highlight I took my Physicians Formula
Riviera stripped shimmer strips I've got
a little bit of this on my eyes today
some of that in the crease and some of
this general area on the lid and it
works great although I didn't feel the
need like after the illumination CC
cream after that blush and bronzer I
didn't find myself wanting to throw on a
whole lot of highlighter on top of that
look because it was already very glowy
but if you're looking for kind of a
multitasking highlight low-maintenance
eyes shadow this is really great for
that afraid my look often with this
Mario Badescu facial spray with aloe
cucumber and green tea I feel like I
wore that so much during the vacation
that I'm beginning to associate this
scent of this product with vacation so
that's kind of cool I love this this is
very refreshing if you've been out in
the Sun and you just want to miss some
more hydration onto your skin this is a
nice little quick way to do it right
grants that I took with me which was
very you know space-saving and nice was
this go naked from Urban Decay it's
there they just call it their go naked
100% perfume oil something I love so
much about this in addition to the scent
the scent is nice but it lasts a really
long time I think the fact that it is
not just a rollerball fragrance but it's
a fragrance oil it lasts so well on me
and the scent of it is kind of beachy
kind of outdoorsy with a little bit of
spice it's not really one of those
sugary fruity sweet things that I might
more often reach for it's maybe a little
more mature seeming than that I don't
know that beachy and outdoorsy is kind
of the first thought that comes to my
mind with this so I thought it was very
appropriate
I didn't load myself down with a bunch
of pallets on this trip but I did take
my Urban Decay Naked heat a couple of
nights when we went out I redid my
makeup I did use this certainly wouldn't
call it like one of my most used
products on vacation because I just wore
it a couple of times and I did do two I
think pretty different looks with it one
that was just very like basic neutral
and then one working
a little bit more of the rest did I wear
false lashes ever on vacation I wore
them one night when we went out and I
kind of regret it because they were
brand-new wispies I just threw them on I
didn't do a very good job of applying
them you can't really tell from the
pictures but when I looked in the
rearview mirror after meeting a viewer a
lovely viewer named Melissa at Lulu's I
got back in the car and I looked at my
makeup I was like oh my lashes are
looking wonky isn't that always the case
there's something going on weird with
your appearance whenever you like meet
someone that you want to see I'm sure
there are plenty of videos out already
on this naked heat palette and I'm going
to kind of be focusing in a little bit
more on this like just with my own
makeup use and if you want some thoughts
on this you'd like to see a review let
me know I'd like to kind of gauge your
interest level in that but yeah Beach
makeup pool makeup I mean it was pretty
minimal and I got very comfortable not
wearing any eye makeup and just having
something that could easily transition
through outdoorsy stuff and not be
worried about anything smearing below my
eyes and yet still feeling like my skin
was nicely evened out and I had the sun
protection just boom ready to go and
over everything I felt good in my skin
you know I felt good with lighter makeup
less makeup and I still felt beautiful
and we're some imperfections showing are
there imperfections showing on my face
right now I'm sure there are but I
really don't mind what does anyone else
kind of find themselves wanting to get
out of this place where it's like the
face has to be a mask and everything has
to be just 100% like even perfect don't
really love living in that place I just
want to do makeup that I enjoy doing and
whether it's a full face of glam or a
for product makeup routine I just want
to do what I like to do and you know
what I'm just realizing as I'm looking
around my freaking room here I haven't
even done my updated room tour yeah I've
got to get that video shot like by this
weekend okay can you tell I haven't shot
a video in a while all over the place
people but thank you for watching so
happy to have you here on my channel if
you're new I appreciate your time and I
will see you next time bye oh dang it I
forgot one guys I forgot one more little
thing that I wanted to mention I did
take all of the neutral
revitalizing lip balms that I own the
one I've got here is called healthy
blush and it's kind of a peachy pink in
my purse I have the summer berry shade
and also the soft caramel like any or
all of those were really good like quick
easy lip options so done now thank you
again but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
