from a different room with glasses on
with a big old zit by my nose here's a
deal I lost a contact lens in my eye
last night it got all folded up and back
behind my eyelid I couldn't find it for
the life of me was doubting whether it
was even there and then this morning it
came out but my eye was so irritated I
have to wear glasses and I was sitting
in front of my old setup and the glare
on these glasses new glasses by the way
was so extreme with the ring light and
everything and there still I realized a
little glare in here but it was way
worse in there because I have two lights
coming at me from the sides and then the
ring light and I just look like some
sort of cartoon character actually like
I didn't really have eyes and this video
is fairly quick and clean-cut and just
talking about a few products so I
thought I'm going to go in the guest
bedroom and just plop down here I'm
sitting on the floor I've just got the
camera on this little table and
hopefully this works for you some of
y'all probably be like this is way
better setup but you have before I do
kind of like it because I've got all
this natural light coming through the
window problem is I do a lot of my work
before the Sun ever comes up I'm
shooting this on the weekend so I've got
a little help downstairs by the name of
bub but most days I would need to be
shooting these videos like really really
early but who knows if you guys like it
maybe I'll work it in a little more
often but what we're talking about today
where's my song what I'm talking about
today is the 21 days of beauty at Ulta
and I didn't even know this was
happening like I was starting to get
tweets from people saying what are your
recommendations for 21 days of beauty
and I'm like where did this sneak up
from because I didn't see any emails
about it I wasn't seeing it on their
website but then you do a Google search
and you can get to the special 21 days
of beauty site and you can see
everything on there and what this video
is up it will be actively happening and
you'll I think easily be able to access
what's going on but I didn't even know
like what world am i living in I get I
missed it but basically when they do
this they have like three deals every
day and one or two of those deals or
discounts maybe like an online only deal
so just check for that as you're
browsing through what they're offering
that it runs March 19th through April
8th and some of the things are really
super good deals
surely that was kind of why I was like I
really need to shoot down and shoot man
I really need to sit down and do this
video so I went through on my cell and I
took a few notes on like the things that
I thought I would recommend and then
also some notes to myself on the things
that I think I'm going to try so
Wednesday March 22nd the buxom full-on
lip creams are going to be $10 each I've
got a couple of minis here but the ones
that are actually being discounted are
the full sizes for $10 and I've gotten
these in sets here and there and they're
in like the frosted type containers as
opposed to clear I think what's special
about the lip creams they don't have any
sparkle or shimmer they're just
straight-up creamy colors as far as the
buxom line goes I think they're more
opaque than a lot of the ones that have
some sparkle to them the lip polishes I
guess you'd say but these are seen as
being like lip plumpers and they're not
going to like take your lip size and
amplify it hugely you know what I'm
saying but I really do think they work
to kind of like smooth out some lines
I'm wearing one of these today and I
think it looks pretty dang good if I do
say so myself but another thing I like
about them is there's kind of like a
cooling almost tingle or cooling
sensation when you put these on I even
liked wearing one of these when my lips
were borderline chat because I thought
it felt kind of soothing on my list it's
not one of those like cinnamony prickly
hot type of lip plumpers so if you don't
like that minty cooling feel on your
lips you may not like these at all I
really am kind of having trouble talking
in this room because I just don't I
don't even understand where I am right
now isn't that weird it's like you get
in a safe comfortable environment shoot
videos and then you get out of it it's
like well a couple of shades that I
really like one is White Russian I know
I've talked about this one before
really beautiful nude gloss it's nice
worn on top of a nude lip look or even
on its own it really does have a pretty
look and it's not just like seeing
through to your natural lip color and
then I am wearing a shade that I think
everybody needs for summertime
springtime it's called cherry flip isn't
this beautiful I love the brightness in
this shade it's showing up like on
camera I think just a hair cooler than
it actually is it's kind of like a warm
red gloss and I think it's just
beautiful so again no shimmer in these I
think they are something you might want
to look into and it's full sizes that
are part of this sale the other deal
that's happening that day that's online
only is the laura geller filter finish
setting powder this is the other thing
that I would recommend anyway I can see
people using this like kind of lightly
all over their face to sort of amp up
the glow but I've got this as just sort
of a subtle highlighter it's really soft
it's a nice product I think the mix of
tones makes it very very brightening if
you're extremely fair-skinned I think
especially and you feel like a lot of
highlights don't show up on you this
kind of goes next level with all those
different tones mixing I know this might
not be like a total necessity for
everyone because highlights are
everywhere these days but it is one that
I really like no bits of sparkle in it
no like identifiable pieces of glitter
happening and that also I just wanted to
give that a shout out because it is a
very good discount on that product if
you're thinking about trying it and then
the next deal I would recommend is
Wednesday March 29th and it's an
online-only deal $21 for the it
cosmetics naturally pretty Volume one
whoa this is for my matte eye shadow
lovers out there you've heard me talk
about this what we're working with here
is a beautiful selection of matte
shadows I kind of think of this as matte
shadows for the person who wants to go a
little bit outside the box this palette
isn't strictly full of Browns as you can
see you've got some plums even bluish
tones a little bit of warmth happening
down here and they give you this one
shade with shimmer called transforming
pearl which I do think is nice to have
because you might want that little bit
of glow maybe around the inner corner up
under the brow so it's a really
beautiful selection of eyeshadow if you
ever have the shadows where it's like
you can work with them so quickly
because you know exactly what they're
going to do just get very comfortable
working with certain shades and like for
example I'm not quite there yet with my
visor pallas let's say those I'm still
you know just getting used to the way
they behave on my eyes they're very
pigmented and you kind of start to learn
how much you need of certain shades and
this and that and this is a palette that
I think I very quickly got super
comfortable with because I have the
shades blend
really well nice pigmentation yet the
colors they chose to put in here
the mid-tones there's a lot of nice
mid-tones that help a look just work
warmth it's an example of one of those
shades where you know if you got
something dark for example I have
something dark on the outer part of my
lower lashline and you just want to make
that a little bit softer warmth is like
the ultimate softening shade I think you
can just take it with a smudge brush or
a pencil brush on your lower lash line
help it make those darker shades look a
little more natural or you know on the
border of darker shades you might put in
your crease I think it's so handy and
soulful could be a shade like that
sunrise soft light even you know all of
these tones here are very very workable
and you might find them working into
other shadows in your collection as well
and being useful transition transition
type color but bottom line $21 is a
great deal for that also on that same
day there's a deal on the dr. Brandt
pores no more I've never tried that but
I've heard good things about it so I'm
considering picking that another thing
like that is Saturday April 1st the Too
Faced mascara melt off is going to be
$10 never tried this product and I'm
kind of curious as to how well it works
maybe let me know in the comments
section if you've tried any of these
things that I'm considering and you can
warn me maybe I shouldn't dry them or if
you think they're great let me know but
I just thought that would be interesting
to test out because every now and then
you try that mascara that just really
does not want to come off ok turn on the
siren rule Sunday April 2nd unzipped
palette or the gold palette $21 and it's
a platinum perk so I think you have to
be a platinum Rewards member to be able
to get this deal am i right but the
unzipped palette from lorac 21 bucks
this is just like Holy Grail I shadow
palette status here for those of you who
like rose freaking gold you get your
Rose goldish type shades and then every
complement type color that you would
want to pair with it I think statement
shades like unbelievable unattainable
unreal you know these are the pretty
kind of pop and shimmers and then these
Matt's like this deep dark burgundy here
they
place so well with one another if you
are a burgundy or Rose goldish neutral
lover this is amazing I have the gold
palette as well the gold one it's not a
bad palette by any means but it never
lived up to what this is doing for me
just because I love these tones so much
and I felt like you were getting kind of
gold any shades here like with this
color called undiscovered you know I
felt like I was getting hints of gold
anyway and dark bronze and then of
course the rose gold as I can't stop
saying so this is just perfect it's a
really really amazing neutral palette I
remember the person first exposed me to
this was Kristin game and it was when I
first met her in person and we were in
Minneapolis and I remember seeing her
palette that she had and I thought at
that time I need that in my world and I
did it and I'm so glad I did and it's
forever changed like the landscape of
eyeshadow palettes for me because this
is truly one of the best big reason why
I'm shooting this video by the way so I
can like get the word out on that and
then looking ahead to Monday April 3rd
malee effortless airbrush blush and
highlight set it has off for 1750 this
is something I'm going to try because I
have the old effortless airbrush that
was like two products contained in a
compact and it's a really pretty
highlight and a blush I remember loving
that so I kind of want to see what
they've done to revamp it and you can
choose it looks like from either a pink
or peach blush and from what I can see
online it looks like the highlight is
the same with both so I'm not sure which
shade I'm going to pick I'm thinking I
might go for the peach Saturday April
8th brow is is half off for 10:50 and I
do wear this in the shade medium brown I
used it in my brows today just so you
can get a real good look at it I really
like this product I don't know that it's
the most like everybody needs to
hands-down have this product because
there's so many things that are similar
to it you know L'Oreal got some skinny
brow pencils I talked about the NYX
micro brow a lot there are just a lot of
things out there that do what this does
and have you know the spoolie tip and
the fine little tippy tip here but
sometimes when I talk about those other
things I do see comments
from people saying but Anastacio makes
like my exact color and i understand
that there's a really good shade range
here so if you're a die-hard brow wiz
user I thought I'd talk about this
because you may want to you know pick
one of these up for half the price and I
do kind of like this medium brown
actually in my brows as I look at it
it's a softer look for my brows it's
probably the softest brow pencil color
that I end up working into my brows see
how it's like a really cool deep topi
shade is what that makes me think of and
I don't need a ton of fill-in on my
brows because they're pretty sick but I
do find this to be a very natural
looking shade in my brows so if you're
wanting to try this out your about my
coloring you might look into the medium
brown and that is really all I have to
talk about for the Ulta 21 days of
beauty this time around I don't feel
like it was a ton of stuff but
definitely some good things worth
knowing about those eyeshadow palettes
are great love the buxom lip products
good browsing and then if you're wanting
a soft highlight that I think again
would look really good on fair skin if
you struggle for things to be bright
enough for you you might look into the
laura geller there so thank you guys so
much for taking time to watch and I will
talk to you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
