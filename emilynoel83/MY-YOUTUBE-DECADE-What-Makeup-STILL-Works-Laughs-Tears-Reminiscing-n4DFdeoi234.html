joining me today I hope y'all having a
great day today baby holding makeup
tutorial hi guys and I join you today
with new hair I am celebrating on this
day November 13th as I sit here and
shoot this 10 years on YouTube in a way
it seems like it was not that long ago
that I started my channel and have been
doing this but then I think about all
the massive life changes that I've gone
through and this time moving from
apartment to house to new house being on
the news not being on the news anymore
job changes for Tyler to babies he's
like 10 years after getting out of
college have just been massive years in
our lives and I really did not think I
was gonna get emotional here in this
video but like when I think about myself
at that time and I mean I like yesterday
I went and I watched some of these first
videos that I did and my god like um
they're so like they're so raw I guess
is the way I would explain them like
there's no lighting
there's no good lighting at all I mean
and it was coming from a place where
there basically was no standard set yet
like people didn't expect all this you
know like lighting and backgrounds it
was just such a new thing and I think
about the you know the couple dozen
people who might have tuned in and
watched that first video and and liked
it and I remember at one point in my
really early days on YouTube I had a
little gap like maybe a month or so gap
and posting is probably the longest I've
ever not posted on YouTube and the
reason why I came back was because of
you like the viewers who said please
you know keep doing videos I kind of
like this stuff like it was just new to
everyone right and I guess what makes me
emotional about it is when I look back
and I see that girl sitting there and I
think of all the stuff that's changed in
my life since that time but I just
listen and I think that's the same heart
you know that's the same sorry it's the
very same passion for this stuff that
I've had all along like what drove me to
start my channel is what keeps me
excited about my channel I just love
makeup I love connecting with you all
and not sure why I'm so emotional about
it but this is just a huge I don't know
milestone for me I'm proud I'm proud of
myself I'm proud of the people in my
life who have supported and encouraged
me and I'm really really thankful to you
guys for receiving what I do so
positively and encouraging and inspiring
me because like I said there was a time
very early on where I thought oh my gosh
you know why am I doing this this is not
going anywhere whatever and it was
because of your comments like where'd
you go what do you are you gonna come
back and do any more videos like that's
what brought me back and I stayed so
anyway I just can't thank you enough
because these are connections
personal connections with you all that
I've been able to make over these 10
years that if I hadn't been doing this
like what would I have what would have
happened and didn't I say I love you I
truly love you um so many of you have
poured your heart out to me in different
ways in letters and emails in messages
on social media and I'm just glad to be
here for you and whatever way I benefit
you if it's the hard core information on
a product that you're here for if it's
the companionship if it's just the sense
of like regularity and normalcy and a
crazy world and a crazy life that's what
I'm here to do and honesty as well I
will always be that for you I mean I
don't do sponsored videos and I'm not
about to lunge into a big monologue
about sponsored videos and whether
they're right or wrong I just don't feel
like they're right for my channel
because what I do you know it's always
been very
you focus my first video I ever did was
a review everything I love to do is you
know comes back to a review in some way
and there are some people who get on
YouTube and they look like freaking
models and there are some people who get
on YouTube and they're doing the most
like creative and amazing makeup and it
might be said this is the state of
affairs we're in these days but I feel
like one of the things I can get on
YouTube and uniquely offer not saying
I'm the only honest person on YouTube
because there are many but that is one
thing that I feel like people can come
to my channel and you can let your guard
down and you could not be wondering if
I'm telling you the truth my videos are
always coming from the heart and the
things that I really think and nobody's
pushing me to say anything even though I
joked about getting in cahoots with
Oprah I wouldn't even you know let oprah
sponsor a video it's just not the way
this channel is gonna roll it's what
I've committed to anyway I love you guys
here's what I want to do with this video
I'm glad I got the tears out of the way
first before the makeup application
that's a good thing but as I was going
back and watching some of those early
videos some of those early very humble
humble videos I was listening to the
products I said I really liked and I
thought you know some of these are
really standing the test of time there
are certainly many things that over ten
years like there are certain brands I
talked about that aren't even in
existence anymore there are products
absolutely that have been discontinued
but some things have stood the test of
time and there are some things that I
would look at today and say yeah I like
those things still and before you get
panicked none of these products that
I'll be using today are things that I
actually had ten years ago I have since
you know repurchase them in some cases
several times over
over the last decade decade did I just
say decade but yeah I just want to go
through and do my makeup with I guess do
I have ten one two three four five six
seven eight nine you could say ten if I
wanted to go with two different
foundations that I really like but I've
got you know a handful of things and
I'll fill in the blanks with some other
products as necessary but guys I was
going back to not just like my midway
through my youtube channel videos I was
going back to like the earliest ones I
could find to come up with some of these
items so one of the things that I swore
by was the Smashbox photo finish primer
and I used so much drugstore stuff like
the vast majority of everything I used
was
drug store but I remember my sister
would give me
Christmastime some sets of higher-end
makeup and usually it was Smashbox I've
already got moisturizer on by the way
she gave me some great Smashbox kits and
one of them contained the photo finish
primer it was my first time ever knowing
what a primer was I thought it was like
the silkiest best feeling thing on my
skin and it still feels the same way to
this day this is the original photo
finish and of course they've come out
with different versions
oops after ten years I will never stop
dropping stuff but yeah I think it's
still a fantastic primer to this day and
I think it's cool that it's still around
and it's just an iconic product it's
probably one of the most iconic things
that Smashbox makes here's another one
Revlon Colorstay liquid makeup the other
thing that I could mention here would be
Rimmel lasting finish because I watched
myself just yesterday introducing Rimmel
lasting finish like I just brought it
home and by the way my halls my first
haul was not called a haul it was called
a new product update I was like showing
you all that I just found this lasting
finish 16 hour makeup at the store and
you know I turned out to really love
that stuff and I still love it today and
I love Revlon Colorstay too although
back in that time I used the combo doily
and now my skin benefits more from the
normal to dry formula but I have this in
the shade fresh beige which was the
shade that I still used back in that
time and so I'm just gonna patch some of
this color stay all over my skin
this is so fun guys
reminiscing I love thinking back to the
good old days and the old-school stuff
that I was using and like talking about
what I was using for the news and stuff
look at this little guy
this is new I saw this at Walmart sorry
I broke this one nail but this is a real
Techniques expert face brush and it's
one of their little like stocking
stuffers full sized head travel sized
handle he hadn't used one of these in a
while I wanted to see like if this was
any good or if I would be totally thrown
off by the shorter handle but no I think
it's fine I feel like I'm just using a
little kabuki brush or something
yep obviously Real Techniques was not
around when I started my channel I do
have an iconic brush still that I use so
much from when my channel started think
about what that brush might be it's an
eye brush if you can come up with that
in your head right now you are an OG
Beauty broadcast follower my first video
was actually an elf brush review but
y'all there's nothing wrong with Revlon
Colorstay you know I'm gonna say it's
medium coverage foundation but it feels
really nice on my skin it doesn't feel
too drying it's gonna last well I know
that in those earliest videos I wasn't
honing in on a real great concealer that
I loved so I'm gonna use my shape tape
today and I'm just going to use a little
bit of it again I wear light/medium
doesn't take a lot of this product and I
love pulling in a flat brush because I
just feel like it spreads so well
while there were some product
recommendations that I gave back in the
day where I was like yes I still love
that I still have that you know ivory
purchased that there are definitely some
other things that I saw myself talking
about like what you like that man like
I've tried such you know better things
than that that's great that I don't know
the makeup landscape and my taste maybe
has evolved but yeah well there were
some things I really liked and or
continue to like there are some things
that I rolled my eyes at big time as you
can see in some cases I'm gonna be
throwing my own new little spin onto
this look and one thing I'm going to do
is bake and I'm gonna use my Maybelline
fit me in fair here because I am kind of
in the midst of just testing some
different loose powders right now so I'm
gonna try to do a little baking coming
on strong hang out off the baked eve has
her first little tooth poking through
and I think the one right next to it is
not far behind she was up at 3 in the
morning it was not a very restful night
and then you know sleeping with this
boot on from my broken foot my broken
navicular bone it's hard to get
comfortable with that big ol thing on
and I am such a barefoot person like I
go around in the house barefoot all the
time like I don't want to be bothered
with shoes so this is a big deal have
this dang boot on all the time another
thing that I didn't pick up on much in
my earliest videos was brow stuff I
think I would have probably been into
this if it were around this elf instant
lift brow pencil in neutral natural
neutral Brown so I'm just gonna go ahead
and do that this is normally where I
really go into my my huge monologues and
my videos while I'm doing my brows but I
got that out of the way at the start
seriously though if any of y'all have
been around since my appartement days
god bless you you know God bless you for
having some faith in the fact that maybe
things were gonna get better on me know
that I was eventually gonna get a decent
camera and some lighting maybe but like
I said nobody really expected it back in
that day because everybody was kind of
doing crummy videos everybody was using
cheap cameras and webcams
you know stuff like that I remember the
first camera I bought from Best Buy it
was the cheapest one they had was
working part-time as a associate
producer and like the lowest on the rung
reporter at the TV station at the time
Tyler was in law school I couldn't
afford some great camera but I think the
thing that might make me want to hug my
former self the most is the backdrop
like you see a half-open closet you see
like the last three things and I wore
like hanging on the outside you see my
sorority had old hanging on the wall
back there it's just all kind of a bless
or Hart sort of thing happening videos
but I will never take him down never
ever it's part of the journey it's part
of where it all began and done this a
little covergirl queer gel because I I'm
not using this because this stood the
test of time and I loved it so much but
this was something I used back in the
day I think there are better kinds out
there today gonna dust away my baking
here something was right never would
have really thought to do back then but
I'm gonna apply a little powder
elsewhere on my face L'Oreal True Match
so good still to this day so good and
I've got it in buff beige and I'm just
gonna work a little bit of this on my
skin to set everything I love this
powder then and I always talked about it
being the best textured drugstore powder
and I really love it to this day isn't
that a long time and I've tried a lot
and I still love it I think that's great
speaking of injuries did you guys hear
that Carrie Underwood fell on the steps
at her home like you know week and a
half after I fell at my home not saying
we're soul sisters or anything but you
know maybe can I ask you guys this what
happened to NYC
because if NYC were still around I would
be pulling out my sunny bronzer and I
would be pulling out my sheer red
lipstick I can't say that brand stood
the test of time because it's sold
nowhere where I live but maybe it's sold
where you live if I'm gonna pull out my
Too Faced chocolate Soleil because I
recall that being one of
mein bronzers that I came to love it's
definitely I think a little bit deeper
than NYC sunny was but now chocolate
Soleil is in a milk chocolate and a dark
chocolate and this is just the like the
original shade that came in so I'm going
to contour a bit with this and this is
Matt and I'm just using one of these
brushes from the the Tarte holiday set
by the way I'm getting a lot of use out
of those the scent of this bronzer
itself actually reminds me of the news
and how much bronzer it took to look
good or halfway decent in that lighting
that just washed you out to pieces and I
think I come home and I there was that
time especially when I was in the other
house you know with the bright pink room
and I would come home from work and
start shooting a video and god knows how
much bronzer I had but like I kind of
needed it for my job and then that
became like the only time I could really
shoot videos most of the time in that
house was kind of like My Morning Show
era although there were some apartment
days with that as well but I would wake
up at like 1:00 in the morning sit down
do my makeup you guys think I'm up early
now cuz it's kind of like dark ish
outside but crack-of-dawn --is-- outside
but if you've ever spent any amount of
time working that kind of early shift
it's like it's hard to ever make 5 a.m.
seemed that early anymore when at one
time you were getting up at 1:00
routinely another thing that I noted as
being a stands the test of time favorite
covergirl cheekers blush is like if you
are in a drugstore or situation or like
let's say a Dollar General where maybe
it's a really limited selection of
makeup and you just need to grab
something like the cheekers blush is are
no joke they're really good too that I
happen to be holding here are plush plum
and soft sable gosh I remember using
soft sable like in high school not this
particular one but you know it's since
been repurchased but it's got a little
Sheen to a little satin finish neutral
blush
now I love these flushes they're so good
and I think golden pink was one that I
used a lot back in the day but this soft
sable could work with darn near any
makeup look like lip look that I want to
do and I put on a little bit of the
plush plum as well and the instant
cheekbones also they do still sell those
guys you'd be surprised at how many
things like I used to talk about that
aren't even on the market anymore
well you'd believe that I mean stuff
turns over all the time especially in
the drugstore here's something I loved
and one of the only I think existing elf
products that is still just a dollar
it's the shimmering facial whip and this
one what shade is this the lightest one
it doesn't have the sticker
oops dropping stuff just for old times
sake if you're looking for something
that gives you kind of a similar effect
to a Becca shimmering skin perfecter
liquid check out one of these I like
just spread it out a little bit on my
hand and then get one of these brushes
elf small stipple brush you know it's
great too
for this but mine is kind of stained
right now like I need to clean it
because whatever liquid blush I was
using with it recently it really got
discolored then that a nice little glow
and highlighting wasn't huge and you
know back when my channel was starting
like it was not near the factor in
makeup then that it is now but I still
liked this stuff and I continued to have
it in multiple shades see just a little
soft glow there on top of the cheeks
nothing too major but beautiful and I
never had really gotten big into setting
sprays in the earliest days of my
channel but I'm gonna use one here today
that I've been playing with and really
liking actually it's the makeup
revolution Pro base aqua priming base
and but I kind of like it as sort of a
after face makeup step I'm saying you
couldn't use it like a primer but it
gives me a real do eNOS I know it was a
few years in before I discovered this
bad boy but my Milani eyeshadow primer I
must put that on right or the majority
of my channel I feel like this has been
a must-have for me I know not everybody
finds that it works for them
nothing does right nothing is 100%
success rate across the board for me
this has been nothing but consistent and
wonderful now for eyeshadows there are a
few things I wanted to pull out one of
them would be shimmering sands from
covergirl because this goes back even
like pre channel days this goes back to
college days even high school days this
trio has been around so long and then
another one that comes to mind is the
one called drama eyes the the quad that
has the white the silver the burgundy
and the black but I could not find that
any more in my collection although I'm
pretty sure they still sell it because
recently I had glanced over the
covergirl selection I saw that that was
still there so if I had that would
probably be pulling that out but another
thing that I really liked and talked
about in the earliest days on my channel
with Smashbox eyeshadows they have a
photo op formula that I think is really
really good and I had several different
like duo's and trios that were part of
gift sets or the master class sets I
love those and I use those so so much so
I don't still have those but I found
something that was sold more recently
it's a photo op mega palette not the
hugest one that they've ever sold but it
just says photo op eyeshadow it's like
this I think I got this was it a
Nordstrom type deal but I pulled this
one out because this was the format of
those different trios that's exactly
what they look like in the exact size
that they were so I think what I'm first
gonna do is I'm gonna grab my sponge tip
I'm gonna go into this pearly shade and
shimmering sands and I'm gonna put that
around my inner corner just get this
party started here so brightening
nothing feels more to style trick than
applying shimmering sands with your
sponge tip applicator I know you all had
it
if you don't still have it you probably
did have it when you were in about 8th
grade I mean I use this thing till I hit
pan twice the reason why it's so good
and so good for newer makeup users is
because you can't go too far wrong with
this like I'm gonna use this deepest
shade here in my crease a little bit and
it's just it's not too dark it's not a
problem you're not gonna screw this up
probably I probably found a way to screw
it up back then but see just a nice
little soft kind of bronzy brown
there's nothing wrong with this I know
people feel like they outgrow stuff they
get too good for stuff you know whatever
but no it's fine
this is still around when Bella ever
learning makeup yeah my kids will be
starting on shimmering sands you can bet
middle shade I always used the middle
shade to highlight with more because for
whatever reason I was kind of scared
about putting super light shades up
under the brow not sure what my deal was
I'm going to do a little bit at the
lightest shade so I've kind of like laid
the groundwork for the look I guess with
shimmering sands but I'm gonna pull in a
little bit of Smashbox
I'm thinking I want to go with a little
bit of this purpley shade that has the
gold and shimmer in it that's kind of
cool dusty lilac with golden shimmer
matchbox really has maintained a really
good solid formula over the years they
do really nice soft pigmented eyeshadows
good maths good shimmers just a whole
lot of consistency I think in their
products in their eyeshadows
specifically I think I want to bounce
over to this burgundy and maybe we work
a little bit of that on here too on the
outside
so we're now to the point where I want
to work on my outer corner a little bit
remember earlier when I was like what is
the brush that has been around since the
beginning of the channel this essence of
beauty fine crease brush part of a duo
this is the smaller of the two and this
is the same brush I held in my hand in
that little department doing my makeup
it is the perfect little outer corner
thing I was able to get it at CVS and
right now you probably only find some
kind of thing I'm like eBay these
brushes are so good and what nice
quality like this has been washed so
many times and it's been taken care of
there's no shedding on the bristles at
all like this can totally still be used
and the only reason why it doesn't crop
up in my videos just because I wouldn't
want to really be raving on something
that I didn't think anybody could easily
get their hands on anymore and I've
always thought that you have the
ultimate amount of control when you're
using a small brush like this to kind of
create that outer V working with darker
shadows getting in place exactly where
you want them you know small brush helps
I'm also going to bring in my new friend
my little Real Techniques IPOP brush
into that burgundy too and get some of
that going on the lower lash line
well smokey I never hurt anybody
do you guys remember what my first
favorites videos were called before they
were favorites or best in beauty I
called those um shopping list ideas yep
they were shopping list ideas for a long
time on my channel do you also remember
when I did something called question of
the week I remember like surveying
people and then I would give the results
the following week or something like I
really had it going on there in the
early days I may not have had good
lighting cameras sound or like anything
really working for me but I did have
concepts I need to brighten up the lower
inner rim or I'm gonna look like I'm
about to fall asleep the eye look is
giving me that kind of feeling right now
sometimes when it just gets a little too
smoky and a little too purpley and
you're a little too tired do you need
that little pick-me-up there but liquid
liner I'm gonna pull out what I have
here this NYX matte liquid liner I know
I probably used to use the NYC liquid
liner also like Revlon Colorstay pencil
there's an example of a thing that
either it's gotten worse I know I used
that Revlon Colorstay pencil a lot back
then and I had tried it more recently
and I just could barely even get it
across my lash line
not winging it out at all today just
kind of following the natural lash line
another thing looking back on my channel
I couldn't believe how skinny my
eyebrows were and then I also had a
really hard line going on my lower
lashline - it seemed like or maybe just
you know the poor video quality made
that show up more like the contrast of
it it would appear in my videos that
lining my lower lashline was very
important to me two mascaras I heard
myself talking about in one of my
earliest videos were on the covergirl
fantastic lash does anybody remember
that was in a red tube it was kind of
like a little bit of an hourglass shaped
tube and I remember really liking that
and I really loved the L'Oreal hip
mascara but neither of those are around
anymore so I'm gonna pull in what I
currently like I'm gonna use my
voluminous last period ice also I used
to adore my ELF
eyelash curler but I have moved on to my
tweezer man Pro curl which is the
absolute perfect shape for my eye I
think the elf was really good at
actually creating a curl you know like
the way the pad was it would really sink
in there and curl the lashes nicely but
this actually gets in touch with every
lash I think I'm gonna pop some lashes
on this look I kind of want it to be
like old meets new it was a little while
on my channel before I got comfortable
using false lashes I didn't just enter
the YouTube scene knowing how to do
false lashes I remember really
struggling with it at first then when I
got it I was like wow my eyes have never
looked more wound
videos like this make you think am I
still going to be doing this in another
10 years and will I be looking back at
like this benchmark and then analyzing
myself and my makeup choices here and be
like oh yeah but that covergirl clump
crusher water-resistant I really love
that stuff
let's hope that I'm not talking in that
voice at 43 but whatever
but speaking of voices like it's so
funny and part of it's like really poor
camera and audio quality that makes my
voice sound so like faint in my earliest
videos but I also was just talking
quietly because I didn't want to be
heard you know you'll notice the door in
the background was
I did not want like anybody listening
and I didn't want Tyler like really
paying attention to what I was doing
although he knew I was in you know the
spare bedroom talking to a camera about
makeup before it was ever really a thing
I just you know didn't want to be
overheard I was still pretty self
conscious about it now the only reason
why I keep my door shows so I don't wake
people up around here okay these are the
lashes I'm gonna use these seem a lot
like the Coco lashes in Misha although
I'm not certain that that's what they
are I got to use this duo lash glue
because Revlon precision lash glue rest
in peace I don't know what's going on I
hope you come back to stores but I
haven't seen you in a while
I noticed in my first collection like
makeup collection storage video that I
did I noticed quite a few of these these
wet and wild lip glosses I know the
bronze berry shade was a favorite I
purchased this more recently and it's
kind of like a metallic shiny gloss if I
could think of one really iconic lip
product that I loved so so much and used
so frequently in the early years of my
channel it would be the Jordana
lip gloss and lovely although they
definitely don't make that what they do
make from Jordana that I also like
though are the easy liner lip liners I
got these in Walgreens just the other
day a couple shades I remember using all
the time baby berry and tawny so I think
I'm gonna put on some tawny right now
and maybe top it off with a little wet
and wild lip gloss still though to this
day good lip liners
this taani you know it's a perfect shade
it's retractable you know it's kind of
like a your lips but better lip liner
kind of verging on a spice type color
like I think of Milani spice or the Too
Faced perfect lips and spice kind of
like that
guys I feel like everybody's already
decorating for Christmas it's not even
Thanksgiving yet and I feel late having
not decorated for Christmas I mean I got
a few little like things here in the
makeup room but I've still got like fall
stuff around my house am i late like
what happened everybody got like a
really quick on the Christmas Day
quarter this year it's kind of like a
weekend type project for me because I
definitely definitely need a lot of
Tyler's help especially what with the
broken foot and all really need his help
lugging some of that stuff out of the
basement to upstairs but maybe next
weekend and then I'm gonna do the bronze
Barre gloss over top which could be just
right here in the center of the lip if
you want it to be it's so shiny but yet
it's neutral and not super light I don't
think I'm gonna take my hair down but I
will like spruce up my ponytail a little
bit
oh I remember watching a video and
seeing myself pull out something other
than Tresemme trade - and I was like
you know what guys I am pretty happy
with this look I think a lot of these
products that I loved back in the day
are still so so good right now not every
covergirl eyeshadow is a homerun these
days but certain ones are still great
the Smashbox photo op shadows are great
my cheekers blush is that Too Faced
bronzer Revlon freaking Colorstay
foundation I mean everybody was talking
about that back at that time still on
the market

forget about my Rimmel lasting finish
