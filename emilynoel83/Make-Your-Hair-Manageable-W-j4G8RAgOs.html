this video this is going to be all about
how to combat staticky hair nothing can
pose more of a challenge when you're
going to straighten your hair curl your
hair tease it style it do whatever you
do and your hair is just kind of fly
away out of control hair and maybe even
if your hair isn't staticky but maybe if
you have frizz or other issues the tips
that I give in this video may still be
helpful for you in terms of just getting
your hair manageable my hair is really
naturally straight and pretty fine so
when my hair is clean out of the shower
and I've just blow dried it I mean I
will have static issues but um lately
I've been really trying to work on what
a good remedy for that is and because
I've gotten questions you know how do I
keep my hair from being so static and I
thought well I'm having that problem too
so I need to work on something here so
one thing that I did was I started using
a little more conditioner just as I wash
my hair and really I tend to keep my
conditioner on just mainly the length of
my hair I don't really get it in my
scalp a whole lot just you know the
length of my hair and I find that that
helps a lot and you know just giving
your hair a little more moisture a
little more conditioner is going to keep
it more manageable once you get out of
the shower dry it and start styling it
another thing that works well maybe you
know you're not real happy with your
current conditioner or you feel like
every now and then your hair needs a
little boost maybe the ends are just
getting kind of dry and not really you
know if you wear your hair just kind of
natural maybe they're just not hanging
you know the way you want they're just
looking kind of dry and dead at the end
and a nice way to kind of be able to
save your hair and really keep it in
good condition is using some sort of a
deep conditioner every so often I've
reviewed this product before and
recommended recommended recommended it
to a lot of people and it's the Aussie
three minute miracle I hair
reconstructor it's something you can
just put in put in your hair when you're
in the shower leave it on there for
three minutes rinse it off it's no comp
it's nothing more complicated than that
and it has a really great sent to and
you
wash it off and you're going to have
some really smooth feeling hair
afterward and it's once again going to
be manageable do something like that a
few times a week maybe you know it
depends on the amount of problems you're
having if you feel like your hair is
really dry feeling very damaged and
really unmanageable then maybe do that
you know several times a week or just as
a once a week thing which is kind of
what I'm down to right now another thing
that you should think about is maybe
after you get out of the shower I used a
leave-in conditioner leave-in treatments
are going to really just once again give
your hair a little more a little more
moisture a little more hydration and
it's going to leave it feeling very
silky once your hair dries and and I'm
sure there are more and I know there are
way more high-end you know products that
I could talk about for this but one
that's really worked well for me and I
think cut down on static a lot for my
hair is the Garnier Fructis leave in
Conditioning cream sleek and shine this
is only a few dollars you can find it
just about anywhere and put that after
you get out of the shower comb through
your hair put that on the you know the
lower parts the length of your hair and
then I'll like wrap my hair up in and
one of those turbhe twists the little
towels that are really easy to just wrap
your hair up and you know secure it in
the back and I mean you can really get
your hair nice and moisturize really
lock that moisture in then you go to
combing out and you dry it or let it
naturally dry and you're gonna have
really good luck with that another thing
is just letting your hair naturally dry
more often is going to cut down on the
damage that your hair indoors and it's
going to give you less static too um
when it comes to styling there are a
couple tips I have their one may be
using sort of a heat protectant spray
like tresemme I know has something
called thermal creations that sort of a
thing spraying it on your hair first you
know as you're running it through
curling irons and straighteners that can
help it and protect it keep it more
manageable too and also some sort of a
gloss or a shine cream or something like
that I really like this it's for fine
thin color treated hair it comes from
Sally's it's the color s brand and it's
called a fade protection system but it's
called lustre cream and this is for it
says smooth away frison an amazing shine
with those lightweight cream protects
color treated hair helps prevent fading
it also just boosts up the shine it's
good for volume as well and if you slick
some of that on your hair you're going
to be really you know in good lastly you
know if you've gone through these steps
and for some reason you are still having
static something that is just a no-fail
quick tip if you got lotion nearby put
something on your hands rub it totally
into your hands like you're just going
to moisturize your hands with hand
lotion and then just kind of tap your
hands over your hair and you're probably
going to cut down on any amount of
static that you have there so I hope
these tips just give you more manageable
hair whether your heat styling whether
you're just wearing your hair as is and
you feel like gosh I'm dealing with
static a lot maybe if you implement you
know one or several of these things I'm
not saying you have to do each and every
one but if you change your routine just
a little bit I think you're going to
tell the difference in your hair and
it's going to do what you want it to do
more often so thanks for tuning in guys
and have a great day huh goodbye what
whatever see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
