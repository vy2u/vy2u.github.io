can't take their eyes alpha make them
look twice because well there are two of
you I know we always want to show our
best side but what about our not-so-good
side
learn how makeup can make you look your
best and your worst everyone you're
seeing two sides of me right now one
extremely glammed up to the max the
other not only without makeup but with
almost like anti makeup I mean I used
makeup on my this side of my face in a
way I've never done it before I did it
to make myself look borderline sickly to
add dark circles blemishes enhance any
flaw I have we're on this side I'm
trying to take it you know over the top
to the max with the dark eye the red lip
the jewels everything on that sometimes
the Halloween season gets into a lot of
just kind of being a copycat really and
you know lots of people going for the
same look to look just like this or just
like that this one is all based on you
what are your strong points and what are
your weak points and how can you enhance
them both at the same time on the same
thing that's the challenge for this look
I hope you enjoy it it was definitely a
lot of fun to do your makeup in this
different way and you could do it for
Halloween or if somebody says makeup
doesn't do that much it doesn't matter
well it can so thank you so much for
tuning in and I hope you enjoy this look
and start out with what for me is a
pretty full coverage foundation I'm
using maybelline superstay we're
basically going to take a line right
down the center of our face so starting
right there at our hairline right down
the middle center of the nose from there
we're gonna just really apply more
foundation blend it out all over the
right side of my face I'm using my
benefit erase paste this is kind of a
salmony toned concealer and I'm just
gonna really target any under-eye
circles we're also gonna go over my
concealer for my full coverage concealer
trick that I've talked about with my
bare minerals summer bisque it's just
kind of like a really concentrated
pigmented mineral powder product so I
just put a little in the can just kind
of go over any eye concealer with that
I'm gonna use one of the most full
coverage powders that I have technically
a powder foundation and it's the Milani
multitasker so I have that here and I'm
just gonna use the sponge that comes
with it cuz I think I can get a more
controlled application again we're
trying to keep it half and half so I'm
just gonna be patting this on over all
my makeup and it should give just a
really evened out matte appearance it's
a matte bronzer from NYC it's called
sunny I'm just gonna lightly dust over
my face here to just really boost the
skin tone just a little bit more we're
gonna start to see even more of a skin
tone contrast except I'm wanting to do a
very pronounced contour on this side of
my face so I'm going to be using my it
cosmetics my sculpted face palette and a
great contour for me is this shade right
here and I really be overdoing it a
little I always like pull my lips to the
other side so it really reveals the
cheekbone I think this might be the most
I've ever contoured and then I'm also
gonna take it under the jaw as well so
if there's any way you know you can kind
of reshape your face that's what we want
to do just on the one side
I really want to have a bright cheek as
well I'm gonna be using my Mac blush in
dolly mix which is you know it's kind of
a sheer blush I mean when worn in like
an everyday way but I'm definitely going
to be piling on a little bit and the
idea here this is the furthest from no
makeup made now that we've got kind of
that matte flawless base to our skin I
do want to add a little bit of a glow
using a product from Smashbox called
flash powder kind this for a long time
but it just has a really gold any
shimmery appearance to it and I'm gonna
take that actually right on along my
cheekbone so one side is flawless and
glowing the other side is not doing any
of that and take a little bit over my
brow on my brow bone on the cheekbone
and maybe just a little bit on the prime
minister HD eye primer I'm going to be
using this L'Oreal hip duo I believe
this is a matte duo yes in dashing so
once the one side is like a matte peach
skin tone type shade and one is a matte
black it's very simple but I'm going to
just start out by taking that peach
shade and just going on the inner part
of the lid with them and with a really
flat brush so I've got lots of control
and I take that matte black and I'm
gonna Pat that all over the outer part
of the lid I'm really laying down this
product in a little different shape as
well in addition to putting it here I've
pulled it up through the crease and also
I'm taking my brush and kind of going up
like this because we're gonna do kind of
like a little different looking eye
that's very kind of old glam but we're
taking it up and then we're gonna
actually come downward just a little bit
of taking just a bare crease brush just
going over the edge of that black then
I'm going to take a shroom from Mac it's
a very highly shimmery white shade so
really any white shimmer would do this
was just handy and I'm taking kind of an
angled brush just for Precision's sake
and I'm just getting this just under the
brow next
I'm gonna start shaping my upper liner
with some Maybelline line stiletto then
I'm going to apply this all across the
lash line here I'm going for a pretty
pronounced cat eye here so just kind of
drawing it up with that little bit of a
wing actually a lot bit of a wing my
Mally ever color automatic waterproof
liner in onyx and I'm first gonna put
that on my waterline and you can do your
upper inner rim as well apply it kind of
going right off the edge of that wing
and I'm just gonna take it kind of right
in between the lashes I'm just gonna go
over that with a little bit of the black
shadow just I'm gonna just curl my
lashes and apply some mascara so I not
only applied mascara to my upper and
lower lashes but I put on a pretty
extreme set of false eyelashes from
Eylure they're a dramatic set nothing's
going to transform your eye like false
eyelashes I would highly recommend them
for this kind of a look I'm using a red
lip liner this is from Coastal Scents in
cabaret and this is just what I'm going
to use to start out to make sure I don't
cut into the other side of my look and
it lay on some real color here this is
NYX round lip gloss in chaos whoo
big-time red going on so I'm just gonna
go over what I did was some really
saturated red now follow it up with a
reddish tone gloss this is bare minerals
in pomegranate and it's just really
glossy gonna give us a great kind of wet
looking finishing touch here we want as
much contrast as possible so the other
side of the lip is dry we want this side
looking wet
the other side of our face I mean it's
looking totally natural right now and we
want to kind of play up any flaws that
we have or even create a Sun if you
don't see them there but one thing that
I first noticed is I have some broken
capillaries and redness around my nose
so I am going to just kind of add to
that I'm gonna add to my redness around
here by just blotting some red lip liner
the very lip liner that I used on my
lips and I'm just gonna dot that around
there see how it looks just even more
red it looks almost cracked as if I had
it cold or something you know so I'm
gonna get some of that on the nostril
there as well and some blemishes or
whatever you want if you see kind of a
mark you know where you had one you know
you can kind of add to that there just
general general redness and you know
facial irritation if you got anything
you can kind of capitalize on red lip
liner is a great way to do that I'm
gonna get so this red liner just on my
finger just kind of kind of draw it on
there use the warmth of my finger to
warm that up and I'm just going to blot
this on my eyelid nothing says tired
like a red eye ever you think looks bad
do the house is going to be utilizing
this kind of really light brown shadow
it's a satin shadow in cork from Mac I'm
just gonna get a little bit of that on
my finger and use that to accentuate
just kind of my bone structure here my
face kind of goes in a little bit right
in this area under my eye so I'm just
gonna kind of give myself a little more
of a bag with that as you can see just
blot it and I'm gonna take a blue tone
shadow this is Sally girl in Navy again
I like using fingers for this because we
don't want anything to look like it was
carefully applied and I'm just gonna dab
this right here in the innermost corner
that's always where I get the darkest
and to lighten up on anything you know
just
take a translucent powder and kind of go
over it and then you'll probably end up
with the sort of luckier b1 you put it
all together and you take the hair out
which is totally curly and glamorous and
then I added like some argan oil stuff
to just really get it stringy looking
around my bangs and just kind of sort of
straightened it put a little kink in it
you know it's just really laying flat to
the side of my head there
I think the redness around the eye is
huge I think creating any sort of skin
blotch or under eye circles is going to
be good for you know just really showing
you know you know you can look so bad
there really amp it up on one side on
you know a Pearl Earring a scarf a
really blingy bracelet you know yeah I
think accessories can help you do that
one side or the other I'm just wearing a
black top right now but I could picture
this was just a really simple black
dress and then you've got just this one
side nothing's going on you brought like
some big cocktail rings or something
like that could be fun or you could
actually you know get really crafty and
do some sort of a half and a half total
outfit even switch up your shoes you
know you can have a super glam heel on
one side and something just really
slouchy and sloppy on the other side you
could even shave one leg and not the
other but thank you so much for joining
me for this video I just I love this
half and half kind of creating two faces
on one face and this is something that's
going to turn out totally individual to
you how you want to blame yourself up
and how you want to sort of bring
yourself down on the other side so
you're not gonna look just like any
other person out there because the aim
could be different depending on what you
want to try to do but I hope everybody
has a safe and happy Halloween and maybe
this is a costume you could enjoy for
really any time of year when you just
want to freak some people out so thanks
again bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
