joining me for this video on this is a
bridal tutorial so for all of you who
have a wedding coming up whether you're
a bride a bridesmaid or I don't know a
mother of the bride anyone involved with
the wedding I think you're going to
enjoy this look because I'm going to
offer not only some really long wearing
makeup suggestions but also just some
ways to sort of maintain your natural
look within you know this very special
day where you want to look so polished
and you know it's a look you'll look
back on for years to come how can you
keep maintained looking like yourself
still with that look so hopefully this
gives you some tips and of course this
look is based on Jessica one of my
contest winners from my 50k makeover
giving chosen three winners so this is
the second look I've done I still have
one look to come this look yeah it's
based on Jessica and her personal I
think makeup needs and the things that
would be great for a wedding so let's
take a look at some a Jessica spick
choose and sort of talk about why I
ended up with the look I have here is
Jessica on my computer she sent me
several pictures as many of you did who
entered the contest and you can see
she's got a great kind of like a little
bit deeper tan skin tone
and I think that's sort of what inspired
me and made me think I think a berry
look would be nice and a little hint of
some purple warm tones on the eye so I
was very excited to do that kind of
based on this picture I'm gonna cater to
some under-eye needs and different
things that I think her skin tone sort
of tends toward more I feel like what
the darker skin you may notice or the
olive tone skin you might see a little
more of that dark darkness around the
eyes so we're gonna do our best to use
some products that will sort of correct
that here she is actually wearing her
wedding dress so that's great and then
here's a picture of her and her fiance
she is getting married later this month
and I just really think that the look
that I've put together will be something
hopefully she can use for her wedding
and maybe even her honeymoon
you know something she could take and
just amp up the color just a little bit
more and make it a really fun almost
party type look so Jessica I hope you
enjoy this look and
take you step-by-step through step was
to apply a moisturizer all over my skin
use whatever it really works for your
skin and it's good for your skin type
Jessica said hers wasn't particularly
acne prone but she'll have to break out
every now and then and then I'm going to
use the maybelline superstay makeup
24-hour formula my shade is where is my
shade on this classic base sorry about
that but this is a really really long
wearing makeup and I find that it holds
up really well it seems to be good for
most skin types from the feedback I've
gotten from others as well that I've
recommended this to so you can apply
this with your fingers or use a brush
but just kind of dot that all over your
skin and start blending it in the more
Jessica is gonna want to pay particular
attention to even from the point that
she starts applying foundation is the
under eye area
I can tell with her skin tone that's an
area that may be prone to getting a
little bit darker there so just keep
that in mind that you want to start with
that even in your foundation stage and
see how much that can cover and then
that will determine how much concealer
we want to put on that foundation covers
really evil evenly it lasts a really
long time I think that's gonna be great
for a wedding look but another thing
that is important is concealing that
under-eye area
I think Jessica's gonna want to
concentrate this all the way from right
in here to down in this area and really
cover that whole that whole region there
and also a little bit on the outer
corner and yeah other than that I mean
her skin looks very clear but the under
eye area is something to pay attention
to so I'm gonna be using dream most
concealer I think this is really great
for coverage it's been something I've
been relying on on a daily basis for
under-eye coverage my shade is cream and
that's light 4-5 but basically what I'm
going to do is just apply this with my
fingers I really like applying the
mousse products with
fingers because because of that texture
I feel like your fingertips and the
warmth of your skin helps that convert
to you know a creamy product you can
blend in as opposed to a brush just
leaving that light and kind of you know
not all the way really pressed and
blended into your skin so I'm gonna get
this going right here under my eye and
you know you don't have to blend it in
too much I'm kind of like pressing it
into certain points and then kind of
blending around the border that you can
see almost an instant difference so I
recommend getting right up under here if
you're if you're struggling with
under-eye issues you know get right up
underneath your eye like almost on your
lash line that is the way I saw I
learned about that when I was watching
QVC one day and Bobby Brown was on there
and she was talking about her concealers
and how you know you can really do a
world of difference just by getting
really close to your eye because it's
all about your eye you know you have
dark under-eye circles but you want your
eyes to stand out so I know I battle
with that a lot so I son a moyes
thinking about and regardless of the
concealer you use I encourage you to try
putting it on that way because you're
going to get fun you get a lot more out
of it so now I've done the other eye and
feel free to go ahead and go over any
other problem areas for me I sometimes
have a little redness around my nose
area and this is a great concealer to
really use all over the face because you
don't want it to come off shiny you want
to keep a matte finish wherever you're
putting it so that's good for that so
next off we're going to kind of set what
we've done and for that I'm going to use
another powder that's gonna keep us
matte and that you will be able to carry
with you throughout your wedding day and
a purse or whatever it's the dream matte
powder my shade is beige that's medium
two to two and a half and so it comes in
a pressed form like this and it really
is a good matte powder and I'm not
trying to take all the glow you know out
of your way you want to have glowing
radiant skin but you also want it to
last and you know you've got you've kind
of thank God
think about the practical angle of
weddings as well you know I've been
through one and I know that you know
it's very important to you know you're
going to be taking a lot of pictures and
you're not necessarily gonna have
someone running up to you all the
fencing you look a little shiny can I
put this on here so you want long
wearing high-performance makeup and so
I'm choosing some things that I really
think will work for that and then we'll
have some other finishing touches at the
end of the space segment they're really
gonna help your skin go I'm gonna take
my fluffy Sigma SS 150 brush I'm gonna
get that there in the powder and kind of
concentrated on my t-zone area for me
that's where I get a little shine and
that's where a lot of people tend to get
the oil on their face but just pay
attention to those key areas for
yourself and also I like to put a little
powder under my eyes I think it kind of
works to set whatever concealing you've
done there and just kind of if you want
to dust it all over your face I mean
this is not gonna look cakey it's just
gonna give you a nice matte coverage and
give you that flawless face look that I
think we all want as we look back on
those wedding pictures so just you know
you can build it up a little bit but I
go for just kind of a more concentrated
layer over the oily parts and then just
kind of a dusting over the rest of the
face so we want to give our skin just a
little bit of a golden glow we don't
want to change her skin Joanne entirely
we want to look like ourselves on our
wedding day
but um for Jessica she has a little bit
deeper skin already but I think you know
it's nice what you've gone through these
steps of foundation concealer etc you
want to sort of give some contrast to
certain areas with some bronzer NYC
sunny I can't recommend it enough if I
might sound like a little bit of a
broken record the way I mentioned this
but it is really good and so many of you
like know like it so again with the SS
150 brush I'm going to
cent rate on the temples here and we're
going to basically give a little bit of
a contour to our face with this so I'm
going temples I'm going right around the
upper hairline here
and I'm going to go down the side of the
face as well and I'm going to kind of
come in I'm going to do that 3 motion
coming under the cheekbone and under the
jaw I think this will work really well
for Jessie because she's got great
cheeks here so I think this is going to
be nice to highlight those come under
and coming below and I mean this is not
a super dark bronzer I think it's kind
of easy to use in that respect so if you
want to sort of amp up your skin all
over you know you can give a light
dusting just across your forehead the
area's the Sun would hit but you want to
concentrate it on those areas that you
want to maybe contour in a bit now it's
time for blush we've all heard the
phrase blushing bride so yeah you really
don't want to skip this phase it's gonna
help the glow of your skin tremendously
one that as soon as I saw Jessica's
first picture I was thinking about the
covergirl cheekers blush in golden pink
one of my favorite daily views contours
and I think would be good for her skin
tone as well it looks like this it's
kind of like a deep bronzer but with
some more warmth to it so it kind of
doubles as that blush I'm going to be
using my SS 168 the angled blush brush
here just get a little bit of that on
there little goes a long way with this
color and kind of second the cheeks and
get that contour going right where you
see the natural shadow just gonna
enhance it and really give you that you
know great looking on your cheeks and I
think a sort of plum colored pinky blush
would look really pretty on Jessica's
skin and the one I'm choosing is from
covergirl it's called plum berry glow
it's a really pretty blush and if you
look at it closely you can see there's a
little bit of a sheen to it as well so
we don't want to over use this but I
think it's gonna bring that glow back to
her skin even on top of some of these
matte products so I'm gonna take my
angled brush again get a little bit of
that on there and we're going to go on
outer part of the apple of our cheeks so
if we're smiling it's gonna go right out
here we don't want to get in too close
to the nose we don't want to console
with a redness close to our nose but we
do want to get that pretty pink glow
right here on our cheeks dust it on
lightly and do a little bit of a
swirling motion just to make sure it's
all blended in next I definitely want to
do some highlighting I'm going to use my
Physicians Formula shimmer strips in
Waikiki strip so this is a peachy glow
bronzer you get a lot of different
things going on here but we're going to
use it like a highlighter using the
lightest shades so right up here towards
the top where you see like a light peach
and a gold shade I'm gonna go with my
same brush here that I've been using for
blush just gonna dip it in there lightly
and then I'm going to run that right
along the top of the cheekbone where the
light would naturally hit so we're gonna
create a nice contrast and a really
glowing look here from where we've
contoured below that so just going right
on here don't overdo it just a little
bit well it will work and I'm also going
to take my finger and this is a great
trick to really make your lips pop and
this will apply a little bit later on
but I'm gonna kind of swirl my finger
here in the top two shades so what I
have on my hand is something like that
and then I'm gonna run this right along
the Cupid's bow area see how that's kind
of lighting up now this is going to
really make the lips look like they're
popping from the face a little bit so it
may not make sense to you right at this
moment but once I do the lips it's going
to I think sort of come together for you
so now we're gonna get ready for the
eyes it started on the eyes I'm gonna
take my wet and wild palate in lust so
this is going to give us it really can
give you just an all-around smoky look
I'm going for a hint of a berry tone in
this because I think it would look
gorgeous with Jessica's skin so I'm
gonna go with the lightest shade here
it's a white and it's got just a bit of
shimmer to it I'm using my cig
ss 239 brush so kind of a typical
eyeshadow brush I'm going to take a
little bit of that on there and get that
right on the inner part of the lid here
so just patting that on just like so
okay really keep it confined to that one
area then I'm going to kind of dust off
my brush or flip it over use the other
side and I'm gonna go to this charcoal
shade that I really don't use too often
but I think it's going to be pretty for
this look it's down here at the bottom
it kind of is like a metallic charcoal
so I'm going to get my brush into that
and put that on the outer half of the of
the lid kind of overlapping okay
overlapping with that light shade so as
you can see here we're getting a nice
little bit of depth there and as you Pat
that on kind of think about padding it
up and also wedging that part of your
brush right there into your crease so
you're getting a little bit of
continuity with that shade not only on
your lid but also up to the crease and
that will help in blending our next
color in this palette your supplied with
the most beautiful berry shade and it's
right here it's matte and and we're
going to use just a small amount of that
to give us this warmth around the eyes
so I'm going to take my SS 224 brush
it's nice and fluffy I'm going to
basically put it tip down right into the
product there and then I'm gonna lightly
dust that along the outside of what
we've just done here
this is gonna be give you a really
really soft look it's gonna warm up the
face a lot and i choosing these colors
because i think jessica has a slightly
tan complexion and I feel like these
shades are so complementary to that so
I'm just dusting that on like that and
then I'm going to take the light shade
that we used already on the inner part
of the lid get a little bit of that on
the same
and we're going to go up under the brow
with that and kind of just top over you
know that more berry shade so it's not
too loud just like so before I move on
to the darker shades here I'm going to
go ahead and do some liner and I'm going
to be using my L'Oreal carbon black
liner intense it's a good liner it gives
you a very thin line which is what I'm
going for here
and we're not gonna do a big winged
outlook and we're also as you can see
kind of from this side we're not doing a
major outer V here either I'm trying to
work with the natural shape of Jessica's
eye and just playing off of that a
little bit by giving us you know a
little bit of color that edges its way
up onto the brow bone so that's the
basic idea behind this look I'm gonna
look down into a mirror but that really
helps me getting my liner right up next
to my eyelashes and we're go from the
inner inner corner here and just go as
slow as you feel comfortable with this
step liquid liner it can take some
adjusting too but I mean if you've got
some time to practice this before your
wedding and to anyone else who's it has
a wedding out there this works pretty
well so keeping it close to the lash
line as I said I'm not doing a major
winged look here but I am extending that
as you can see they're extended it just
a little bit past the natural eyelid
there so I can have a little point to
blend to with the lower part I'm gonna
use the liner that I really enjoy
whenever I'm doing Barry looks and it's
Revlon Colorstay eyeliner in black berry
so this is a really deep plum and it's
gonna look nice with this look it's not
going to be any out there you know
majorly bold purple shade but it is
going the the plum aspect here I think
is going to make brown eyes really pop
so as you can see we're catering to that
outer edge by blending up kind of
flicking up and giving us a nice
finished edge to the eye and then we're
going to lightly with a light touch just
kind of basically smudge this into our
lower lash line
I'm not going for a thick line you can
see over here there's no real thick line
on the lower lashes but the liner is to
the next I'm going to take my SS 219
brush this is a small pencil brush and
I'm going to use this for basically all
the finishing touches in this look and
I'm going to be using the plum shade
here as well it's a matte plum and it's
just going to be great for getting a
little more contour in here and also set
the lower liner so first off with the
lower liner make sure you're taking the
brush only using the tip to get the
product on and dipping it right in there
it won't take much and then I'm going to
just kind of buff that run that over the
liner here so we're going to get a
little bit of a I don't want to say
smoky but we're going to sort of get a
smudge a more smudged out appearance
here and it's going to appear darker at
the outer edge because that's where we
applied our liner thicker and lighter
right in there and then we're going to
take this same shade get a little more
on your brush and get that right there
in the crease play off of the outer
corner of where we drew our liner out to
and just kind of you know blend that in
here we're not doing a big outer V we're
sticking with the you know the natural
shape of our I wanting to look like
ourselves for the wedding but look just
a little more glamorous and as Jessica
put it you know really make her if you
make her husband to be just kind of
speechless I guess for how she looks on
the wedding day so that's what we're
going for here so I'm getting it right
in here we're going way in right in here
looking at Jessica's natural eye shape
that's kind of what I thought might be
pretty for this look to give her a
little more definition on the inner part
and just take that up about that far if
you want to go on top of this and add
more of that berry shade you can this is
just a bare brush here I'm just using to
buff that out a little bit but kind of
look you know from side to side see if
your
magical I personally want to use a
little bit more that very shade right
here I think it's beautiful
I really think no matter what you know
your going for with your the coloring of
your dress or anything else or flowers I
still feel like having a warm shade
around your I just really pulls the look
together you want the eyes to really pop
I suggest especially for pictures and
things like that
taking a white liner putting it on the
inner rim of your eyes I'm going to use
my Rimmel soft Kohl liner in pure white
and just gonna very gently pull down
right here and just run that along the
waterline I would recommend on a wedding
day to opt for a waterproof mascara I'm
going to be using the covergirl
LashBlast length and I'm going to apply
probably three coats of this on the
upper lashes apply them do not let them
dry between coats so like get a good
solid first coat don't let it dry go
ahead with number two and number three
you're going to get nice length there
and it's gonna be its it I just feel
like it's a semi natural but long lashes
mascara and this doesn't tend to smudge
at all and I think if you get waterproof
you're also gonna be extra locked in
there with your mascara look alright I
wanted to go for kind of a berry lip
look and I think Jessica can pull it off
I think she's just
I think her skin's gonna be glowing
she's already got just a hint of a berry
look on the eye and so I think the lips
will really pull it all together lately
myself have been doing a lot of this
with lip stains just kind of taking a
lip stain putting it all over and then
it's kind of like your safety blanket it
doesn't feel thick it doesn't feel like
anything on your lips but sometimes once
whatever you put on top of that wears
off then your lip stain has kind of
outlasted the whole thing so I'm using
the covergirl outlast lip stain in
number 400 I don't know why I went ahead
and did this and forgot to kind of
record on it but I just kind of drew
that on all over the lips what that is
is just a sheer blanket of color and
it's gonna stay on there really well so
you could just draw it on like a more
you don't even need to use a lip liner
it just kind of draws right on and then
I'm gonna use a really long wearing
gloss that I'm liking it's the
infallible plumping six hour
excuse me thought it says sneeze
plumping lip gloss it's number 506
excuse me sorry about that 506 plumped
mom is the shade it's gorgeous
alright guys here is the finished look
um just kind of threw my hair into a
little low bun here I know that's kind
of a popular look for weddings lately
basically what I did is I just used my
goody spin pins which I have a video on
those if you have more questions but
yeah I kind of teased the hair up here
in the crown just a little bit when I
went back you know before I pull the you
know back to the side nice secured it
with a couple of bobby pins so think of
like doing a half up half down you tease
it a little bit put your bobby pins in
and then just pull it all to the side
for the bun which like I said you can
see the video on that but I think it
dresses it up a little bit and it kind
of gives you the feel of a wedding look
sometimes you know just doing your
makeup and saying this is my wedding
look you know it doesn't necessarily
come together unless you do something
with your hair that makes you feel like
that's what you're working on I hope you
enjoy this look Jessica and I hope those
who are also thinking about their
weddings this summer can have a little
direction maybe with from this tutorial
the products that I used are overall
very affordable but they're all things
that I really like so I hope this works
out for you and I hope Jessica that you
will keep us posted with pictures a
couple pictures from your wedding so we
can see how the look turned out and how
the day went for you so thanks so much
to all who tuned in for this video there
is one more contest video left and I
think those who are oh and the high
school age range are really going to
like that one so thanks again for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
