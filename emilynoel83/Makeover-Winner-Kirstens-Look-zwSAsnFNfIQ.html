tuning in for the first of three contest
winner videos now I had this contest for
my 50k makeover giveaway and it's
basically I reached fifty thousand
subscribers recently and I wanted to do
something that could sort of give back
to those people who have been loyally
watching my videos for so long so I had
a contest had people enter their
pictures and also sort of the reasons
why they believe they need a makeover
and so it for some people it was a
specific occasion for other people you
know they just wanted a new look overall
and that i have three winners so this is
the first of three videos and this
winter is Kirsten she's 26 years old and
kind of the premise behind her contest
entry was that her husband is a marine
and he is very soon going to be coming
home from Afghanistan and for when they
are reunited for the first time in a
long time she wants a look that's really
going to WoW him and really look great
she says she typically has her makeup
pretty natural but she wanted to spice
it up for this look her skin is normal
but can be breakout prone she usually
has fair skin but she does live in
Hawaii so I don't know maybe that
changes from time to time being out in
the sunshine and stuff but for this look
a couple of keys that you're going to
notice is that this look is going to go
from start to finish so from foundation
all the way through the eye makeup and
everything of the products that I use
are going to be sent to Kirsten in a
prize package and that includes the
brushes that I used as well so it's
going to be really awesome she's going
to be able to recreate this look I
really wanted to put some emphasis on
the eyes so we've got a look that you
know is a semi I don't know it made me a
little more dramatic than she's used to
I think it's really going to be you know
emphasis on the eyes but these lips
really brighten up the faces well so I'm
going to take you through all the steps
to get this look Kirsten I hope it works
out for you and I hope you like it
recommend just a light moisturizer and
then I'm going to be using a Revlon
Photoready makeup I really want to
create a radiant look for her I think
her face will pull off that glow very
nicely so
just going to use a couple of pumps of
this and with my fingertips just kind of
dotted around on my face and blend it
all in this foundation does give you a
slightly luminous look but something I
like to do with this which I'll show you
in a second is sort of apply a matte
powder over the t-zone area it really
keeps you looking shine free but you
still get the benefits of you know this
foundation making you look really
radiant I'm paying special attention to
my under eye area though Kirsten doesn't
seem to have a big issue with dark
circles or anything like that this
foundation blends really easily so I
don't think you're going to have a hard
time really making this work and getting
that even smooth even finish now I don't
see under eye circles as I said is a
very big issue for Kirsten but you know
it sometimes you do have the need for a
concealer elsewhere on your face i'm
using the maybelline dream mousse
concealer i think it's really good for
Matt coverage and it's rather pigmented
it's a little more pigmented than say
you know the regular maybelline dream
mousse foundation so it's very good just
to target the certain areas maybe it's
around your nose you know or just any
problem spots this is a really good
concealer for that now we do want to
make sure that certain areas of our face
don't start to get too shiny because as
I said this is a somewhat luminous
foundation it looks good on clear skin
which Kirsten has really good clear skin
so I think this is going to work well
but still I think we want to make sure
certain areas remain match and a really
good powder for that is the elf
translucent mattifying powder it's from
the studio line um so it's really
affordable but it works really really
well and so this basically is a powder
that's going to work on any skin tone
it's just one color I'm going to use my
Sigma SS 150 brush for this and just
sweep this down on my nose my chin and
my forehead area
also a little bit under my eyes this is
a really light powder but you know it's
going to also keep any fine lines from
being highlighted as your foundation
wears on if it settles into any
particular areas so yeah just to
basically grab your brush and put that
on generously wherever you need it it's
not going to show up cakey at all a
couple of the pictures Kirsten appears
to have very fair skin so while i do
want to recommend a bronzer I don't want
it to be anything that's going to make
her complexion look dirty or dingy or
anything like that so one of my
favorites and one of your many of your
favorites as well as the NYC smooth skin
bronzer here in sunny really works well
to maintain and you know a matt finish
in certain areas but also it's just I
mean it's just the perfect shade
especially if you do have fair skin so
again with my big brush from Sigma here
the SS 150 I'm just getting some of that
on there and concentrate it kind of on
on your temples here think about where
the Sun would naturally hit you and
that's going to be your cue for where to
put it so I'm really trying to get it in
on the hairline here for a good blend
come around the face and we're going to
work it into the just under the
cheekbone I like to turn my head go like
that and then you can see where that
area is and then go just under the jaw
line it's going to give you a slimmed
look to the face as well so right in
here and right in under the jaw you hear
a lot of people talk about that making
that three like that starting here here
and here so that really is a good rule
of thumb when you're thinking about
where do I contour what does that mean
so this is a really good way to learn
about that and to try that on yourself
now on to another classic product that I
love so much for contouring and for
blush I really love that I'm getting to
not only you know recommencement
products for particular people but they
do turn out to be products that are some
of my ultimate favorites and it's the
contouring blush and bronzing powder
from ELF another studio line product
you can see I've used it a lot
especially the bronzer and this is
something that I'm going to recommend
that Kirsten uses in a very very light
way she doesn't want this is a somewhat
darker bronzer than the NYC sunny is but
it really is perfect for contouring so
use your SS 168 brush an angled blush
brush here and just tap it into that
color just like that and then we're
going to once again suck in our cheeks
and we're really going to get some
defined cheekbones she's got a really
good you know facial structure and I
think this is going to really play up
her natural features so go like this and
kind of start right back up in here and
go down here and buff out in some
circular motions around that and you are
going to get a perfect blend there and
then we want to bring back that glow to
the cheeks a really great product to do
that with is this blush that's right
alongside the bronzer here it's peachy
it has a little bit of gold and sparkle
I think it's going to look great on her
skin tone especially because this blush
is not too dark it's really just a great
tone so I'm going to use the same brush
that I use for the contour I'm going to
tap it into that blush smile and we're
going for a placement that is not too
close to our nose think of what we don't
want around our nose that's redness so
we want to keep it kind of right out
here and it's going to give you just a
gorgeous glow and this blood is so
neutral and so fresh I wouldn't
necessarily want to put a highlighter
over this just because as you can see
here it does have quite a bit of sparkle
to it so we're going to go with that as
is and this is our nice flawless
complexion for the eyes the first thing
I did is I took my palladio herbal I
shadow primer this is a really really
good eye shadow primer and I put it all
over my lid kind of up into the crease
and then just faded whatever else was
left right up to the brow but I'm going
to take perhaps one of my favorite
all-time eyeshadow sets which is the
cover girl drama eyes kit I thought this
was something that Kirsten could wear in
a variety of different ways but for this
special night I wanted to give it a sort
a dramatic flair maybe something that
maybe she's not quite used to doing all
the time so first things first I'm going
to take my Sigma SS 239 brush just kind
of a traditional eyeshadow brush and I'm
going to go to the silver in this kit
pick up some of that color on your brush
and then kind of look down into a mirror
and Pat that shade that pretty silver
all over your like the angle brush in
the sigma sets the SS 275 looks like
this and going to get some of the
charcoal black color in this kit get
some on there tap off the excess and
sort of use this smallish brush to just
dust a little bit of that over the outer
part of the lid there just to get a
little bit darker color and then you can
run that right into the crease and kind
of use the brush see how I'm putting the
angled part right in there and you can
kind of start to blend that in so get a
little more on the brush and then kind
of go right here and you're going to get
the perfect placement of that color
there in the crease now to add just a
little more intensity with that black
i'm taking my pencil brush as Sigma SS
219 it's very small and skinny there and
kind of a stiff brush so it's really
going to pack on the color and i want to
write on this outer corner get even more
color even more dark color and with
kirstens eyes she's got gorgeous eyes
and they kind of have this shape where
their they kind of go flat across the
bottom and then the eye goes like this
so towards the outside instead of being
an eye that kind of slants up and gives
kind of a lifted look it comes back down
so what we're trying to do is create
sort of that lifted effect just by
bringing our shadow up and I'm creating
a classic outer V with this look if
you've wondered about the outer V and
kind of been confused by that that's
what I'm doing here I'm playing off the
outer corner of the eye and see how my
eye does that as well it's going from
here to here and so we want to make that
look a little more lifted so I'm
bringing it up just like that then I'm
going to take a fluffier brush in the
Sigma kit SS 224 and run right over the
outer edge of
that to soften it up okay looks great
and then we're going to take just a
really gorgeous unique shade in this kit
it's like a shimmery burgundy use that
SS 224 brush again get a little bit of
that color on there and run it along the
border of that black look and look what
you've got there you've warmed it up
you've made it seem a little more unique
it's not like in-your-face read by any
means but just warms it up okay and then
for our highlight here we're going to
use this same fluffy brush go to the
white in this kit get a little bit on
there and go right under the eyebrow I
really think that Kirsten has looking
back at her picture I think she does
have the space in her eye area to pull
off you know this kind of range of
shades and this sort of layering here
but even you know if you do this to a
lesser extent on yourself it's going to
really give you a lifted look to the eye
area and I think it's kind of a more
exotic look it's just really going to be
eye-catching i believe so now that we've
finished the shadow part there on the
lids we're going to do some a liner i'm
going to use a pin form liquid liner the
LA girl fine line revlon colorstay
liquid liner pen would be great here as
well because you have a lot of control
with this product so I'm going to look
down into a mirror and I'm going to
start at the very very inner corner
right here I'm just going to draw that
all the way across my lashline staying
very very close to my eyelashes as we
get to the outside we're not going to do
a huge winged out cat cat eye look but
we are going to thicken the line a
little bit and instead of following
where our I goes down we're going to go
kind of a little more straight out and
then connect it just go as far out as
you're comfortable with if you want to
take this further you can but that's all
the further I'm going out with this
and just then it's just a matter of
filling it right in now that you've done
that upper liner it never looked hurts
to go back and kind of reevaluate where
the placement of that is and if you want
to play off of that to go a little bit
darker up here you can you don't have to
but it just kind of just to keep
everything in line you know you may want
to readjust that outer V a little bit
and then for the lower lash line i'm
just going to use a really really
pigmented rich pencil it's the l'oreal
extra intense liquid pencil eyeliner so
it's really really soft and creamy and
i'm going to just connect that to the
outer edge of the what we did on the
upper lash line and just pull it in here
just slightly on the lower lash line
then just take a q-tip or any other
smudging tool and you can soften that up
a little bit there and then i'm going to
take my angled liner brush from the
sigma set at CSS 266 fantastic liner
brush going into my dark shadow shade
and topping that off right there and
then just using basically the eyeshadow
powder to go in the rest of the way here
just getting right up in that lash line
and this is a great way if you don't you
know typically go all the way around
your eye with liner this is a softer way
to do it it doesn't come off as looking
you know very harsh but it does really
draw the attention to the eyes and
that's kind of what i want to do with
this look they don't want to go over
what i just did there with the 219 brush
just to kind of smudge out that powder
powder smudges very very easily so we
just run over that and make it look even
just a little more smoking next I'm
going to curl my lashes and apply a
couple coats of the covergirl LashBlast
mascara I'm not quite sure it's hard for
me to tell by the picture just how thick
her lashes are I have the feeling that
they're decently thick and this is going
to really define them and also even if
you don't get the waterproof version of
this I find that it really does not
smudge
and there may be some tears you know she
hasn't seen her husband in a long time
so I want to make sure that this mascara
will wear well for her so that's kind of
came into my choice for using a lash
blast for this
all right guys here is the finished look
as you can see i got that cover girl
LashBlast there on my top and bottom
lashes just a light coat on the bottom
lashes it's not really a mascara that's
prone to smudging but just to be safe I
only put a little bit on there then on
the lips I'm trying to keep in mind that
okay Kirsten is seeing her husband for
the first time in a long time there's
likely going to be lots of hugs and
kisses when they are reunited so you
want a long-lasting lip color so what I
did I chose to use the covergirl outlast
number 415 it's sort of a pinky berry
lip stain and so lip stains last a
really long time and they feel
completely weightless on your lips so
you put them on there it's like a marker
and you just draw it on and so you can
be very precise with that as well but
you it's like the natural texture of
your lips shows through it so it looks
very natural but I did want to kind of
top that off with something and if this
gloss wears off you know that's okay
this is still going to show through
underneath but I really wanted to give
it kind of a little bit of pop a little
shine at least at the onset of this look
so it's the elf super glossy lip shine
SPF 15 in mauve Lux one of my favorites
of shades of the lip shine because it is
kind of a reddish mob it has a little
bit of sparkle and it just looks
gorgeous over this particular lip stain
there so I think it really makes your
teeth look whiter and it just makes the
whole face pops so Kirsten I hope you
have a wonderful homecoming with your
husband who is coming home from
afghanistan soon I wish you both the
best and I hope that this look works out
for you and I will get the products I
used including the brushes out to you in
a gift package very very soon thank you
so much for entering this contest and
thanks to everyone who tuned in bye guys
