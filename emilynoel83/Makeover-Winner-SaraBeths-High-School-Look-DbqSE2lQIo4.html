for this video this is the third and
final video tutorial for the 50k
makeover giveaway when I reached fifty
thousand subscribers I got sent out kind
of a call out to all of you asking for
you to send me your pictures if you
wanted a makeover if you wanted some new
ideas for a new look and in return I
will give you a personalized video
tutorial and also send all the products
and brushes that I used so that's kind
of the deal here for this and I've
gotten down to the third one now that
I'm doing and I may do a contest like
this in the future but this is the third
and final one for the 50k makeover
things so I've had a lot of fun with
these kind of personalizing looks for
the people that have entered and won and
this look is all about girl by the name
of Sarah Beth and she has been
homeschooled all her life in this fall
she will be starting high school so
she'll be going to a traditional school
for the first time and she wanted to
look that would be good for school
something that would really give her I
think a clean like maybe a more mature
look and so what I tried to do with this
look was keep it natural keep that
products that can be used for a quick
look I get so many requests from people
for a quick look for a high school
junior high age-appropriate makeup and
so that was why I really one of the main
reasons why I chose Sara Beth was
because I thought so many people
including her will hopefully benefit
from this so I hope you enjoyed this
video we're going to take a closer look
real quickly at summa sarabeth's picture
is Sarah Beth she has no makeup on in
this picture but she still looks great
she's so cute she told me she's like I
have a round face I've blond hair blue
eyes and so she has a little different
coloring than Jessica who was in the
last tutorial so I took that into
consideration here she is with some
makeup on she's got really round eyes
just a really youthful look in general
so I tried to play off of that a little
bit and give her some eye colors in the
palette that I used that I thought could
you be used in several different ways
and really look good on her eyes here's
another show
she just got her hair a little
differently there but I'm really excited
to do this look I think she's got she's
got such beautiful eyes and I hope that
this look will give her something to
work with and an eyeliner technique that
I think will be really quick and easy
way out on the face I would advise
Sarabeth to apply a moisturizer that
works for her skin and she says she has
combination skin so she's a little drier
on her cheeks a little more oily around
her nose and t-zone I imagined so just
just go with what works for you right
now moisturizer wise and then for a
foundation i'm going to use something
that I think is going to be gentle for
your skin it contains an SPF it's very
easy to blend and quick too because I
know Sarah Beth is going for a look that
would be good for school so I'm trying
to think of a quick easy solutions
basically that can you know get her
through that morning routine so i'm
using the almay smart shade make up my
shade here is light medium and so I just
shook it up first and it's a very
liquidy formula but if that means it's
also pretty easy to blend on your skin
and so it comes off looking this kind of
like whitish gray but then you know it
kind of blends right in with your skin
as it as it heats up so I would really
advise applying this with your hands
because that way I mean you get that
heat kind of working between your hand
and your skin and you start to get the
coverage and the color out of that so as
you can see it's super easy to blend all
over your face you can see that color
start to show up it's like a reg I don't
and Sarah Beth is you know 13 going on
14 years old I just don't and and by
looks of her skin as well she doesn't
need a whole lot of coverage but this I
don't know it just feels good on the
skin it blends well and I just think
it's the perfect product for that age
for someone who maybe wants to ease into
a found
patient type product so I just continue
to blend this in on my skin almost as if
I was just applying a moisturizer it's
pretty much that easy to put on I'm just
putting a little special attention
around the under eye area kind of around
my eyebrows just making sure everything
gets blended in and really blend it in
around your jaw and right up into your
hairline there that's really the only
way to do it you want to get that whole
area covered and make it look seamless
with the rest of your face now you'll
want to go over any problem areas on
your face with a concealer for me I have
a little blemish down here i'm using the
elm a smart shade concealer in light so
the foundation was in light/medium the
concealer in light again it really
blends easily into the skin it's kind of
a no-brainer product here so just kind
of blend that over any areas where you
want a little extra coverage I noticed
that sarahbeth doesn't have any major
like under eye problems but you may find
those days where you do and you just
want a little extra right at a
brightness underneath the eye and it's
just going to give you a more finished
look it's going to make your eye makeup
look that much better if you get rid of
any darkness there so I advise you to
get right up under the eye all the way
up to the lower lash line with your
concealer and you're good next we're
going to apply some of the maybelline
dream matte powder i'm just going to use
a big fluffy brush my sigma SS 150 just
get a lot of that powder on there and
we're going to dust that all over the
entire face to kind of set the makeup
it's also going to give us a nice fresh
matt appearance to the skin pay special
attention to those areas sarahbeth where
you feel oily so that maybe your
forehead your nose chin area and then I
kind of like to go under my eyes to make
sure i'm setting that area as well so
just go all over with that and it'll
really even out your skin too next we're
going to go in with some bronzer
Sarabeth i think that the NYC Sonny
would be perfect for your skin and
especially make sure you use a fluffy
brush with this that way
it's not going to get too concentrated
on certain areas we want to keep it
light so I'm just going to take my brush
into mine here and dust that across the
forehead okay so that's kind of where
the Sun would naturally hit and then
we're going to kind of go just below the
cheekbone and kind of just contour
around the face here keeping it really
light it's not going to look like too
much makeup the idea here is we just
want to get that flawless skin look and
get really quick so there's your bronzer
all over one quick easy step next I'm
going to use a product that i really
enjoy because it's kind of like a
combination blush highlighter little bit
of bronzer in there as well and it's the
palladio herbal mosaic powder in Desert
Rose this is available at sally beauty
supply and as you can see you can see
how the light catches a couple of those
parts here some parts are Matt some
parts or shimmery but it gives the face
a really nice below and I think this
color in particular is going to be good
for a lot of skin tones including
sarabeth's I think the peachy kind of
mauve tones and this are going to be
good so again I'm going to suggest using
the large brush for this gather up some
of the product on there just kind of
swirl it on that's why it's nice to use
that large brush there and then smile
and get it right there on your cheeks so
super easy and yet your skin comes off
really glowing and pretty and now you
could use this a little bit lightly over
the rest of your face if you want to
kind of put the brush like up in the
highlighter part there and go with a
little more of that may be right up up
your brows or something like that it's
up to you but I would primarily use this
as a blush remember if you want more met
just kind of stay down there towards the
bottom and you can get a little more
matte coverage there one last product
since we have been using some at things
and things to keep down the shine but we
still want to have that glow a really
fun product is the Maybelline Dream
mousse blush in peach satin I like peach
satin because it's on the verge of being
a highlighter it's a really nice shade
and so just dip your finger into there
and what we're going to do is sort of
apply this a little bit like from the
apple of art
cheeks up and we're going to get a
really pretty light peachy shame there
think you're going to like it and also
sarah beth has a really round face which
is really nice and youthful but you
mentioned wanting a little more
sophisticated look for when she when she
starts school and if you don't want to
do like heavy-duty contouring one more
subtle way you can create contrast with
your face is just by using a little
highlight because you can see even
though I didn't really do a lot of
contouring with my face it still it's
like it has some dimension because I
applied some highlights so there we go
that's the face first on the eyes I'm
going to take my palladio herbal I
shadow primer so no one of my most used
I shadow primers at the moment and I'm
just going to apply that all over my lid
next I'm going to take my Revlon
Colorstay I shadow quad this is in wild
flower and then take the very light
lilac shade here and I'm going to use my
Sigma SS 239 brush so just kind of a
flat eyeshadow brush pick up some of
that purple and just place that all over
the lid it's not going to come off like
a bold purple but rather like a really
soft lilac and just a nice light shade I
chose this palette for this because
there are a couple of other colors
there's a yellow and there's a green in
here as well that can also be used just
to give it a different look on a
different day so going all over with
that then I'm going to take on the one
of the sponge tip applicator that comes
with this and go to the yellow which
actually has a little satin finish these
all kind of a little bit of a satiny you
know not completely matte finish and I'm
going to take that and put that right
around the corner here these little
applicators are a great way to use to
get like the detail around the tear duct
and stuff like that so instantly we've
really brightened up the I there next
we're going to go to the taupe shade
it's clearly the darkest shade in this
palette it's kind of like a softer
version of
max satin taupe I think and just getting
a little less metallic seeming as well
I'm going to take my Sigma SS 219 which
is a small pencil type brush so we'll
really be able to control where we put
this and we're just going to put this in
our really lightly in our crease we're
going for really soft definition
remember this is a school look you know
we don't want to want to get too crazy
here but we can give our eyes just a
little more depth than definition by
putting this in there and I think using
this small brush is a really easy way to
do that so we're just placing it exactly
where we want it just keep it light and
then use the SS 224 or any fluffy crease
brush to buff that out a little more
then go back with that same fluffy brush
to the yellow and that'll kind of be our
highlight here too so we're kind of
sandwiching that taupe shade between the
lilac and then the light yellow which it
really just comes off it's like just a
light shimmer on top because we're
applying it was such a big brush the
next step is optional but it's going to
be an option Sarah Beth has she has
really round eyes and if she ever wants
to sort of make them look just a little
more like the almond-shaped eyes i would
suggest having a dark shade to kind of
mix in with this really light palette
and for that i'm going to say Brown
smolder from covergirl typically I might
go in with like a black or a gray shade
but I want to keep it a little bit
softer since this I it's going to be
kind of a school look so I'm going to
take my 219 brush to the pencil brush
you get a little bit of that brown
smolder on here I swear the shades going
to last you forever because it takes so
little and it's very pigmented and I'm
just taking that right to the corner
here and so I'm making a very subtle out
outer V just by going in the outer
corner of the crease and then just
blending up ever so slightly so see how
we've got just a little darker in the
outer corner totally an optional thing
it will dress up the look and it'll also
a slightly transform the shape of your
eye next for liner we're going to use
that I think is so simple to use and
it's honestly one of the best values in
a pencil liner I think you're going to
find it's from wet and wild and it is
the coal brow or online system used for
brows as well and it's in what's the
shade exactly dark brown number 6 52 so
it's a long pencil you get a lot of
product and it's so smooth and easy and
it's a terrific smudge able eyeliner so
we're going to apply this on the outer
half of the eyelid here so I didn't
actually draw that on there I'm just
trying to let you know where it's going
so it draws on really easy and I'm just
using like little short strokes and
Sarah Beth said she didn't want any
winged liner which is understandable we
want to keep this somewhat natural for
school so I've applied that there then
I'm going to take my pinky finger and
just the warmth of your finger Plus this
softer eyeliner is just going to really
smudge that in next we're going to go
underneath just a little bit this step
is optional are just going to connect to
the outer corner you know you sometimes
you just don't feel like having any any
lower liner sometimes you do but either
way I'm along and take this in a little
ways so I'm going to take it in like
half half way right there on the bottom
and then use the same step just use your
finger your pinky finger and just smudge
that a little bit next going back to
brown smolder and our pencil brush get a
little bit of the brown smolder on there
and just top that off down there in the
bottom if you choose to do your line
this way maybe you're doing a more
formal event or you know something where
you want your eyes to really pop a
little more this is a great option and
again leave it out if you don't if you
don't feel like it or if you just want
to keep it super natural for for daytime
then I'm going to curl my lashes and I'm
going to apply a coat of the Maybelline
the falsies volume Express mascara is a
great leg
mascara and I've been using it pretty
consistently over the past couple weeks
and I really really like it and another
thing about it is it holds up really
well it's not going to smudge and flake
and that kind of thing so I think that's
going to be great to get Sarah Beth
through the school day
alright everyone joining me now with the
finished look I really enjoy this look
it's just a daily look for maybe high
school or even college if you're an
adult anyone who wants just a quick
polished go to look this is really great
also I feel like it's a foundation that
doesn't really cover up your skin for
example you may have been able to see in
the video with me you know my some of my
freckles are showing through its it's
natural enough it doesn't look cakey and
like it's you know too overdone or way
too much so I really hope that Sara Beth
gets some good out of this look for
school as she will be receiving
everything I used in this tutorial
including the brushes so I hope this
gets you off to a great start and I hope
hopefully some of these products that
given you will allow you some different
ways to use them as well and so you can
kind of adapt them to how exactly they
work for you but I hope this tutorial
point you in the right direction thank
you so much for entering this contest

any way you know shape or form to the
50k makeover giveaway it was a lot of
fun to look through all your entries and
