another video as you probably remember
this is Tyler and we wanted to do a
couple things in this video first we
wanted to tell you guys thank you so
much for the huge response we got on the
last video Tyler appeared in his cry for
help for his cocoa butter lip balm that
were scared with getting this continue
but what what are your plans but I'm
sure everybody's eager to know what
you're going to do well we got a lot of
suggestions of places where we can buy
it online so it looks like we'll be able
to get it whenever we want just order it
online I don't think that was but I also
picked up this Palmer's cocoa butter
stick it's kind of one of those wide
sticks like you could actually use it on
like rough elbows or any extremely dry
skin you had but it also says soothes
chapped lips and this was recommended it
would otherwise this was probably the
second most recommended thing so I
bought it from Walmart Tyler just put it
on how does it feel
seems to feel pretty good haven't tried
it overnight yet but feels good on
because if you didn't see the last video
what he used to use the cocoa care stuff
he could like put on right before bed
and he never put it on again throughout
the whole day but this stuff smells
really good yeah
hmm so thank you very much for
recommending that that will be an
experiment to come and I'm sure another
video because this is like the only
beauty product Tyler uses so until we
come up with some better ideas yeah
it'll be cocoa butter chapstick all the
way so um the main purpose for this
video was to talk about some gifts we
got each other for our anniversary
because my gift involves some makeup
stuff and I knew you guys would be
interested in that so I wanted to share
it with you but our anniversary was
August 5th so those of you that give us
congratulations
Sarat comment or something on that thank
you very much for that and I what I gave
Tyler was two Cardinals tickets to a
baseball game in a couple weeks his we
haven't really been able to go out and
really celebrate it yet because of my
work schedule yeah wedding to go to and
a lot of other busy stuff so that should
be fun are you excited about we haven't
gotten to the game yet this year so it
should be a lot of fun
yeah we try to go to a game like every
seven least once a year at least
but what Tyler got me was the makeup and
it's from Bobby Brown and I'm gonna let
him explain in a second why you need to
get me that but um I have to say your
props out of your jaws are probably
dropping right now because you're
thinking that can't be found at a
drugstore but if you'll think back to my
Beauty bargain video I said that for
things like birthdays and Christmas and
special things that is when I asked
for the pricey stuff and I didn't even
blatantly ask for this but Tyler picked
up on something very subtle and thought
to get it so that's kind of what I've
reserved this stuff for I don't just go
up by like expensive stuff all the time
but if there's a special occasion or
something I asked for it as a gift so
anyways what he got me was the Bobbi
Brown foundation stick and it has really
doesn't have any annoying scent to it or
anything it's very creamy my color is
natural and is I mean that color does
work for me so if your skin tone is
similar to mine that I tried this out
step out first today so this is just a
really creamy thing it works nice as a
concealer but I ended up using it all
over my face as the foundation and the
other thing was really cool it was a
creamy concealer kit and it came in a
little box it looked like this and what
you got was actually two different
things you got something called a
corrector and the color is bisque and if
you guys have heard about how a salmon
colored concealer is good for your under
eye area that's basically what this is
you can see that adorable little compact
how is loving this I'm gonna close it
quickly it has a little mirror in it so
that's really cool and anyway this is
like heavy duty concealer for when you
have really bad circles and then the
other thing you guys are going to love
this packaging it's a concealer on top
here and then a little powder on the
bottom so this is just an actual
concealer what you would probably use
about every day is a little bit of a
yellow tone a lot similar texture to the
corrector and if you are in really bad
shape you can use the corrector there
the
and then you said it with this yellow
toned which Bobby Brown if you've read
her book Bobby Brown beauty which I have
read and wrote about in my blog she's
all about yellow toned powder so this
gives you the full thing of loose powder
to set your concealer with so that is
awesome
you also get an adorable little puff too
so all this stuff Tyler go now Tyler why
did you know to get me that oh well
there was one afternoon where you were
watching QVC and I really didn't want to
be watching QVC at all there's probably
a baseball game or something like that
on and I just remember listening hearing
you talk about the different things you
wanted and so when we came to any time
to get you something for your
anniversary that's what popped into my
head and somehow I got all the colors
right wait so you were actually
listening then when I was saying oh my
gosh if there's anything I could get
like I said like one day when you know
what I make it big I'm gonna get this
makeup and use it did I not say that I
think I said it I think I was talking
mainly about the concealer in the
foundation so he was apparently
listening to what I was going the most
nuts for but I don't know how you
remembered what color I was talking
about did I say that out loud oh yeah I
think actually I pointed it out because
they brought up on the screen
I guess he said I was right so I
remembered that is amazing I think
that's really cool and I'm obviously
really happy to get this since I don't
get this kind of makeup all the time and
it was really easy to use and really
high-quality so it's nice to be able to
get that every now and then but like I
said I'm living like tips here by you
know saying hey you don't fight all the
time but if somebody's willing to buy it
for you then good deal so I will use
that some more and you can probably
expect a more in-depth review of
elegance that I just used it first today
it went on well it lasted well don't
judge too much by how my face looks now
because it's been going on like 12 hours
now and I've been under some really
bright light so what I do which is
anchoring if you're seeing this for the
first time you haven't watched any of my
other videos but anyway I think we're
kind of getting close on time here so
Tyler is there anything else
what do you been up to lately I'm just
bought the new madden 2009 video game
starting to play that one Dan Emma
summer start school next week okay
watching the Olympics I have been
watching the Olympics what's your
favorite Olympic that's pretty cool
in the gymnastics he watches it I think
I watched some water polo
all right I think we're gonna have to
say goodbye because I think we're
running out of time anyway thank you so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this video and let us know if you have
any special requests for Tyler because
we are looking for some more ways my
game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
