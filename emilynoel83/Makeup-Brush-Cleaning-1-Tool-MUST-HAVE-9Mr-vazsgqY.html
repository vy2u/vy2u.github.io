this video I wanted to cover my brush
cleaning routine and this is for when I
deep clean my brushes if I'm just doing
something quick here like in my makeup
area and I know there's a brush I want
to immediately use after I've done
something else I just need a really
quick like quick drying just like clean
on the brush I have this elf daily brush
cleaner and you can just spray that on
too like a Kleenex or a paper towel is
even better and just rub your brush back
and forth and it's just a great quick
clean on a brush but I do think it's
important to periodically deep clean
your brushes like maybe at least once
every couple of weeks the products I'm
going to tell you about in this video
definitely do I think speed up the whole
process of brush cleaning it's not
something all of us are always looking
forward to doing you know it for me I'm
like I gotta clean my brushes it doesn't
seem like the funnest makeup related
tasks but there are little tools and
tricks that can make it simpler and I
think a lot faster now I'm pretty sure
the last video I did on brush cleaning
was when I was talking about my Sigma
glove and I love that thing I
legitimately love that thing I took some
heat in that video because at the same
time other people were saying oh it's a
gimmick it's not worth it blah blah well
I use that glove religiously to clean my
brushes like for this whole span of time
between that video years back and now I
just loved all of the different like
cleaning surfaces on that thing I felt
like it took the met that I was using
before which was just kind of scrubbing
them in the palm of my hand and it just
made things more efficient more
effective in terms of getting them
really really clean and I just love that
and I really think that particular
product love it hate it
see it as a gimmick whatever you want to
say I think it prompted people to either
look to alternative methods and it
prompted other brands to kind of step up
their game and come up with a lot of
different ways to help us clean our
brushes so I do think it was kind of a
game changer in the whole brush cleaning
world so I have done a little
experimenting over the past few months
Sigma has different brush cleaning
things that they've come out with
different formats like a little mat that
sits in the bottom of your saying Real
Techniques is cut out with like a neat
little brush cleaning thing that I
really like
one thing that I find to be a bit of a
problem with certain little brush
cleaning rubber silicone type tools is
that residue from the brush will develop
on whatever you're using to clean the
brushes and that can be kind of hard to
remove so the little thing I've got for
whatever reason part of it might be the
soap I'm using part of it might just be
the surface of this product but I don't
have any weird residue developing on
this but this is a dollar this is a
super super cheap little tool that I
have just loved for cleaning my brushes
lately and it's from a oay studio this
is a brand that I found on shop miss
a.com so that's that website where
everything's a dollar I will link to it
below and if I can find this anywhere
else being sold online I'll link to it
there also but basically this is a
little brush cleaning egg I think is
what they called it and it's open in the
bottom so you can put a couple of
fingers in there and you can clean your
brushes right on here very easily and
you've got this kind of Ridge type
surface and then this part here that
looks like a bitty dots honestly it kind
of looks like the bottom of an athletic
shoe or something like that and I find
it so quick and handy for cleaning my
brushes and there are a couple of
reasons why it incorporates different
textures which i think is really good
for kind of agitating the product out of
your brush but also I think the biggest
factor that makes me like this so much
is the thumb freedom okay because when
you're rubbing back and forth and your
whole hand is in say a brush cleaning
glove you do have a little flexibility
but your thumb is enclosed in something
and there's something about the control
you have when I am totally rinsing out a
brush on here and I can use my thumb to
kind of press it against those ridges
and really you know make sure the water
is running clean and every bit of suds
and residue is rinsing from the brush
I'm using my thumb in that process
really makes things happen really fast
and you feel like you've got just so
much control and this is made of
silicone and you know very travel
friendly also but what I use hand in
hand with this and I mentioned this in
my last favorites video is the Ben jebel
organic brush
Shampoo so here you're getting eight
fluid ounces and I think this works so
well to effectively get the brushes
super clean and it does so really
quickly so I'm talking even my really
dense foundation type brushes like a
sigma f80 or an F 84 or whatever you
know style you have of this kind of
brush I had almost gotten accustomed to
those brushes looking just you know a
little bit baishi even after I got
totally clean I was using them with long
wearing foundations that stuff is really
hard to you know fully get clean from
the bristles and I thought maybe I just
stained the bristles over time but I
find when I used the Ben jebel cleanser
I am able to get these bristles looking
just like they were when they were new
and that's almost like a grayish tinge
especially when they're wet you can just
tell when every bit of product is out
and this totally just opened my eyes to
a new level of cleanliness for the
brushes so I want to walk you through
exactly how I do this if it's a really
dense brush I will get like a full pump
of this gel and I get my brush hairs
totally wet and that's what allows you
know that soap to really sets up and go
a little bit further for you and I will
pretty much take up that entire surface
area of the egg scrubbing that brush
clean if it's a situation where it's one
of those brushes that I have used for
foundation I may need to repeat that
process one time with one more pump of
the gel but I swear after I'm done with
that
I end up with a really really clean
result I like to use my thumb to really
press those bristles up against the
lines or the grooves on this egg and I
can see any excess running from the
brush if it's running clean and clear I
know okay I'm pretty much done rinsing
this thing you're also wringing out some
excess water in that way take a towel or
a paper towel squeeze over your brush
and then I like to hang mine in my Ben G
Bell brush tree which I use the
sunflower style which has all sorts of
different sizes I like to do this kind
of brush cleaning you know in an
afternoon and then by the next morning
everything will be ready to use not that
they couldn't potentially be dried
sooner than that but this is just the
way I like to go about it now here's
where I really feel like I'm saving on
this brush gel is with the brush
that I use exclusively for powder
products maybe it's a powder brush a
blush brush a contour brush or any
smaller size brush that I might use for
eye products I feel like I can get away
with using only a quarter pump so I'm
not even taking the pump halfway down
and that amount seems to get my brushes
totally clean so if it's a smaller brush
here's a great little tip put some of
your soap right in the end of the egg
get your brush hairs damp pick up a
little bit of that soap and then mainly
use the grooves to go back and forth to
get that brush clean and then when you
rinse you can actually confine that
stream of water to just the groups and
if you've got any leftover soap on that
one side you can use that for your next
pressure add a little bit more soap
whatever you need to do but that's
something that really can work for your
smaller size brushes for your bigger
dense fluffier brushes that's a little
bit harder to do because this isn't a
huge egg to begin with and you might
need that surface area so again when I'm
done with my brushes I hang them up to
dry and you might be wondering what's
the point of that can I just lay them
flat but the theory is that this method
is going to preserve your brushes longer
because there's no water sitting in this
ferrule area where your bristles are
hooking into your brush as water gets in
there and sits there it can loosen the
glue and you can start losing brush
hairs but if you're hanging vertically
water is being pulled this direction
from the brush it's less likely to
settle back into the ferrule and I find
that the brushes do overall dry more
quickly because they're open to the air
on all sides instead of sitting just
flat on one side but that would be my
brush cleaning preference right now the
way I feel like my brushes get the
cleanest and they do it the fastest so
thank you guys so much for watching and
requesting this video and I'll see you
soon
bye oh did you find a brush I'm talking
about cleaning brushes in this video oh
good good jawline contour there because
it's all
I really love you thank you for the
hammam you say hi everybody
hey happy what's this thing you look
like a nose or an eye patch or like a
big tongue
