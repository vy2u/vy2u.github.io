of a random haul video
I've got a few clothing items some stuff
from Ulta a few drugstore items some
high-end items also some Bobby Brown
recently reviewed a YSL mascara over on
the Express channel and I had asked you
know are there any other high-end items
that you're really interested in seeing
reviewed and Bobby Brown was coming up a
few times in the requests and so I am
actually revisiting a few products that
I had tried years and years ago like
toward the start of my youtube channel
and kind of giving them another go and
some of them have been repackaged
reformulated so I'm excited to try those
again get started with clothes and
clothing is not something I've been
buying a lot of lately I've been really
sticking to just you know the
comfortable pieces that I have you know
some maternity stuff some stuff that was
like part of my regular wardrobe that I
was kind of making it work as a
maternity type glue now at 32 weeks
pregnant the bump is really getting
bigger and I'm feeling the need to just
get a few more like tops and outfits to
have in the rotation so one of those
things I got from Ross I thought this
shirt was really cute it has a neat
little like pink detail on the sleeves
and the collar little pocket here me
this comes down like just over my butt
there's the bump but it's just very
comfortable I know the horizontal
stripes just work wonders you're the big
belt here I feel like I have some kind
of radar for stuff that can work
alongside black leggings because I think
you know leggings the capri leggings are
what I'm wearing now just so so
comfortable and when I find something
that works with those which is a lot of
things it's like yeah that'll be good I
think this was like less than $10 I also
found this cute little tank top here
this was also in the maternity section
and I got this for $6.99 flowy of me
with my short torso it will come down
nice and long on me as well
then through t.j.maxx I got a couple of
maxi dresses just bought these in my
normal size and they kind of accommodate
the bump are very very comfortable now
but I think I'll be able to wear them
later as well so this is a small Cynthia
Rowley and just all-black very classic I
actually didn't have just a plain black
maxi dress a lot of people have asked me
because I'm 5 feet tall so sometimes we
run into length issues on the long
dresses but both of these that I'm gonna
mention here seem to work OK for me and
I don't know if the bump is like pulling
up some of that length so maybe it'll be
a different story once the bump is no
longer there this one has the cutest
little back on it in that knee and then
this other one I actually had posted a
picture on Instagram
this is such a cool little like shirt
dress but it's like a long maxi dress
style of it and it's got a little slit
which makes getting around so easy I
have a couple of maxi dresses that are
kind of close all the way to the ground
and they're not that easy to get around
in but this one is and it's got the
little black pocket they're just so
comfortable lightweight really soft the
brand on this is monto Los Angeles and I
got for around $16 as far as drugstores
type stuff I can't remember if I got
these at Ulta or Target I think it was
target actually
but Revlon now has these gel and v nail
polishes out it says color stay gel and
the color plus base long wear nail
enamel so I got this pretty kind of
purply shade that says up the ante is
the name this will be the next thing
going on my nails they are in major need
of some help
and then I also got the diamond topcoat
it's supposed to give that really like
shiny solid gel nail type look but we'll
see how long it lasts as well so once
I've worn it for some time I'll
definitely be reviewing that but I got
that I actually already have a review
out on girl give a little mention in
case you missed it it's the new L'Oreal
pop bombs these I got from Ulta I
ordered them off of ulties website
because I haven't seen them in stores
yet but I got wild Lily which is a very
bright bubblegum pink and then I got
this fiery red so yeah fiery red
is a beautiful true red type color and
these are lightweight lipsticks they
remind me a lot of some of the color
whispers that I have I've really been
enjoying these particularly this red
shade I think it's just one of those
true all-american like really fun
summery red colors so glad I got that
and definitely check out the review for
some more details
another little tinted lip balm thing
that I'm trying out are the new Baby
Lips Krystal
this was another Ulta find I have them
in Beam of blush and mirrored mauve so
think regular baby lips but with a
little bit of shimmer so I've really
barely tried these out I just used this
mirrored mauve one a couple of times and
they definitely have like their own
distinct scent and it kind of reminds me
exactly of big league chew the gum that
I would like take down by the pouch
fullback is a little kid that's what
these remind me of know that that beam
of blush totally makes me think of the
Bubblegum scent that's even stronger
there's the mirrored mob down below and
there's beam of blush very light like
soft pinky type colors and I think you
can see that there is a lot of shimmer
in these so I'm gonna have to wear those
some more and give you the verdict in an
upcoming review so a couple of new NYX
things I've had a lot of questions about
the new NYX eyebrow gels they come in
little tubes like this and I have it in
0-3 brunette and you can just apply this
with like an angled brow brow a little
bit out here to show you that it is a
very neutral type Brown like I don't
feel like it's too warm or anything and
I think the staying power seems to be
really good when I put it in my brows
but it just gives me such like thick
full on color and I think mning used the
Too Faced brow Envy kit for so long now
which is what I used in my brows today
that gives me I think a little bit
softer look on the brow instead of my
brows seeming like real hairs are in
there this kind of made me think of like
blocks of color on my face so I mean I
will work with it some more I've only
used it a couple times but as you can
see like really
good staying power with that another new
Knicks thing that I totally need to do a
real life test on is the proof it
waterproof eye shadow primer
I'm totally gonna test this in the pool
you guys let's see if it really does
what it says it has the look of a lot of
other eye primers but once you feel the
consistency it's very very thin so I do
need to test that out and see how that's
gonna work and see if it's really
waterproof lastly from Ulta this is
something I ordered online and you guys
know like I waited a long time too long
to get that romantic eye palette because
I think that's just one of the most
beautiful pallets Too Faced has ever
made and it's just gorgeous
and that kind of got me wondering what
else am I missing out on like I haven't
tried the matte eye palette yet and a
lot of you have recommended that too I
was scoping out ulties website they have
the matte eye palette but they're also
selling it like I think it's an
online-only deal with like three other
full-size products and so I thought well
I'll go with that you know it just cost
a little more than the palette did to
get all those bonus things so if you're
new to this palette like I am it's got
like a very neutral row across the top I
love some of these shade names too
chinchilla Velveteen bunny then I love
this vintage violet shade right there in
the bottom and that is most of what my
look is today I've got the vintage
violet like on the lid I've got it
really blended up I've got it smoked out
under the eye and some of this midnight
shade like in the crease and some of the
darker areas but I really like the way
it's performed so far some quick
swatches to show you the textures and
kind of what shades were working with
here in this palette and if you'd like
to see a review let me know how
interested you are because I'm sure
there are a lot of other reviews maybe
they've already seen on this palette but
if you'd like to know my take on it I'd
be happy to do something like that once
I try it a little and the other stuff
that came with this by the way and
there's a shadow insurance full size I
haven't busted into that because I've
already got some also a mascara this
says size Queen I've never even heard of
this one from Too Faced it says a
mascara that measures up
you get a perfect eyes eyeliner in
perfect black these are very very smooth
eyeliners I don't find them to we're
completely smudge free on me but they're
very very pigmented they can be nice for
an intense black in the waterline but
that's what that looks like oh and check
this out this is so adorable because I
had a two-faced thing in my order at the
time I ordered this there was some
little promotion going on and they give
you a mini two-faced la creme lipstick
how cute is the shade is called naked
dolly and it's just a creamy like kind
of peachy peachy nude color and finally
the Bobbi Brown stuff a couple things
that kind of spurred on this haul first
one like I said earlier were some
requests for reviews on Bobby Brown
products and also Jesse James Decker
followed her from her show with her
husband Eric Decker he's an NFL football
player and they had a show on was AE or
Bravo I think it was easy anyway I
really enjoy her style her look and she
had done on her YouTube channel actually
years ago a couple of beauty related
tutorials just in the past week she
posted another like full face tutorial
like a half hour long ish video I'm just
doing her full face of makeup I found
that very entertaining I would love to
see imports elaborate ease just sit down
and do that but she was using a few
Bobby Brown products and so that paired
with the request so it's not like we
went to Bobby Brown order and one of the
things that I picked up is actually an
item that I had tried years back and
kind of wanted to retry again because on
the website it said that it had been
reformulated and it's called now the
skin foundation stick and I have it in
natural tan I think the shade I had it
in before was just natural but a lot of
my foundations are seeming a little
light for me these days so this one
worked really well it is a very natural
look on the skin coverage was really
good I noticed it was like evening out
my skin tone overall but for example I
was still seeing my freckles through
also the finish on the skin you know not
too dry or cakey looking and so this is
this stuff just came in like yesterday
evening and so
Ehlers Joseph will definitely keep using
this pay attention to the staying power
eventually you know work on a review for
you but that's the skin foundation stick
and then something I loved in the past
completely use this thing up a long time
ago is the corrector in bisque and I've
mentioned this on and off as being a
really great salmony toned concealer the
camera might actually there the lighting
might be washing out just how salmony
this shade really is but it is a great
color correcting shade I used it today
on my melasma AKA mask of pregnancy
lovely hormonal thing that comes with
pregnancy and some people and it's kind
of like some darkness and it sort of has
the appearance of like a sunspot type of
thing right here on the tops of my
cheeks and this had really good coverage
in that era it just reminded me how much
I love the texture of this it's creamy
but not too creamy a nice tone to
consider for dark spots also around like
your dark inner corners of the eye and
stuff like that so loving trying that
again and then the other thing is this
creamy concealer kit back when I
initially tried this it was like the
creamy concealer on top with a loose
yellow finishing powder on the bottom
and it was like one little chunky
product and now the powder is pressed
and they're just side by side there and
I got this in natural and then that
automatically comes with the powder in
the pale yellow so the corrector is what
I'm using first to deal with you know
the biggest color correction needs and
then kind of patting over everything
with this more skin tone concealer and
topping it off with the setting powder I
love the little system like that I love
that it comes with the setting powder
and that pale yellow really a nice kind
of lightweight texture but still adds a
little mattifying to the concealer so it
gives a really nice finished look so my
past experiences particularly with these
Bobbi Brown products have been great and
so I'm happy to try them again and kind
give you a refreshed take on that
another thing that I've heard very good
things about from Bobby Brown but had
never tried before is the lip gloss so I
went for one of the high shear lip
glosses and I have it in Bellini and you
can see it is well maybe you can't see
because it ain't gonna focus there we go
um it's kind of a peachy piece pretty
sheer though like when I first put this
on today I thought oh I'll just wear
that on its own and I see so much of my
natural lip color through it I instead
chose to put this on top of a nude
lipstick this is nude creme or nude
creme from Milani so that's what the
main color is on my lips but then the
shine and that little bit of shimmer is
coming from this gloss it's kind of like
got a golden sparkle in it though it's
really pretty it's a nice texture it's a
little bit thick but I don't feel like
it's too sticky for my liking so we'll
keep messing with that and last but not
least I wanted to try this fragrance I'd
heard so many good things about Beach
from Bobbi Brown and they have the
full-size fragrance on the website I
think it was like maybe around 75 bucks
and I'm like I don't know I'm a little
hesitant to buy a fragrance online that
I've never smelled before it never got a
width of so I thought I'll go with these
smaller rollerball sides which is like
25 bucks and I do I do like the scent
but it's very unexpected you know I was
predicting more of a tropical I don't
know sunscreen II type of smell out of
this but what I'm getting is something
very fresh clean outdoorsy almost
strikes me as a scent that could be very
unisex as well so I don't know if all
end up going for the full size in this
but I'll keep using this rollerball for
sure so thank you thank you so much for
watching this haul video my stomach is
growling I don't know if you've heard it
coming through this video but I feel
like it's been growling the entire time
trying to interrupt but I hope you guys
are having a great day and I'll see you
again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
