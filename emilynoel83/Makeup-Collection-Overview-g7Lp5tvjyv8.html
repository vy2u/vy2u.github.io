now is my makeup collection so I just
wanted to run through briefly how I have
it organized and then I may break it
down all right well I'll break it down
later into different categories because
I don't think there's any way I can get
through it all in the amount of time it
takes to do this video so first off I
guess I'll just walk you through what's
up here from top to bottom there's some
different eyeshadow palettes moving down
here this is in various lip gloss stuff
that I've got this top drawer is pots of
lip gloss this is basically at basically
different clear lip glosses and this one
here is my coral lip glosses now we're
getting to where I've got them pretty
much all broken down by shades so like I
said this is the different coral colored
glosses here are my light nude colored
glosses there's just a ton of different
brands in here just a whole lot of
different glosses they're the drawer
down from that is some sort of blonde a
little bit deeper earth tone lip gloss
the colors are pretty pretty neutral
overall but just kind of a little bit
deeper than the light color gloss there
you can kind of see the contrast and
what I'm talking about here and then
down below are any lipsticks and liners
that would fit into that category can't
really pull it all the way out here but
there we go
lipsticks and glosses they are that
brownish sort of variety and I also keep
my lip liners and items like that in
little drawers why I love these little
drawers to store stuff in and now so
that is this side and now we'll move
over here to the other side we're up top
I got the smaller little case that I'm
just trying to kind of work in if I can
get into it
that's my ELF lip glosses
and then the rest of this these are my
bare mineral like face colored face
powders and eyeshadows things like that
and then down here are the foundations
and that kind of thing all of its bare
minerals except for this one here and
it's Jane blush I've got my face brushes
I keep here blush brushes powder blushes
brushes and then getting into here these
are other different face color products
the top drawer is my cream blush drawer
so I've got elf
Smashbox Oh glow they're some of the
dream mousse blushes and then the next
drawer down is my blush drawer la
Stephanie names except from Sephora
Revlon covergirl Smashbox you name it a
lot of different kind of blushes in
there then the next drawer down here is
my bronzer highlighter drawer so I've
got some of my favorites from wet and
wild I know you probably heard me talk
about that quite a bit
some smashbox like cream highlighter a
lot of different brands they're moving
down we're getting into the over here i
told you about my nude color lip glosses
here's where I keep my lighter pink
color lip gloss down below is my deeper
berry and red color glosses and then
underneath that is my red or berry
colored lipsticks and liners and that
kind of thing so this is basically how I
keep it all divided up here between my
lip stuff because I've by far what I
have the most of and then I've got some
little containers here off to the side
where some of the things that I have a
lot of like for example I have a lot of
Revlon Super Lustrous lip color so I
lipgloss rather so I just kind of keep
that off to the side
I've got a lot of different shades from
neutrals to brighter shades but that's
where I keep that have also got it's not
really super organized right now but my
eye different eye brushes my bare bare
minerals brushes your some other
palettes which I'm sure I'll talk to you
about eventually but to face do your
different palettes and some Dior lip
palettes they're down below here this
big thing looks like a little laptop
pens a lot of Mary Kay shadows liners
blushes that kind of thing in there
there's another little thing I've kind
of divided up by brand I got some some
lip glosses from philosophy the co
Bigelow breath freshening type of lip
glosses and also these that you can find
that Bath and Body Works and the
Victoria's Secret one so hot stuff in a
little tube that's there one more those
little pink containers here I have quite
a bit of maybelline shiny Alicia's in
there and also glory out color juice so
I keep those they're down back behind is
where I keep some of my primers brush
cleaners q-tips cotton balls
Vaseline moisturizers I'm a few more
miscellaneous brushes for a new brush
that I got and around here just some
little random tools and stuff it's not
exactly the neatest thing ever and then
down here alright
I may have to turn my little light on
I'm not sure that helps a little bit
this cart here is a 1 2 3 4 door cart
this first drawer I'll pull it out here
this has my there's cream eyeshadow my
mask
as my liners both the colorful ones and
my more normal black ones some eyelashes
and also some Revlon cream liners so
cream related stuff whether it's
mascaras or liners is in that drawer
down here is where I keep a lot of my
shadows that aren't bigger size palettes
just different groups of them in here
here are just some of the more
individual ones I've got a lot of
Smashbox groups couple of recently
purchased hip for y'all hip shadows
Physicians Formula L you name it a lot
of singles right get it right here in
the front from various brands from all
may for almay whichever used a covergirl
Neutrogena Jane and that's a big drawer
down here that's where we get into my
foundations my cream to powder pressed
powders some random brands that are
putting out minerals now and then I got
a little tray right in here for some
concealers and primers and things of
that nature so and this bottom drawer is
basically just reserved for any packages
I want to keep or back up q-tips yeah
everybody's a backup q-tip joy but
anyway that is pretty much my collection
right now as it stands and I'm gonna
break that down for you later on tell
you more about the individual items and
what I like and what I don't
