guess what the time has come this is my
makeup collection video in this video
I'm going to take you through how I
store my makeup what kind of makeup is
actually in this whole pink room that I
have and yeah hopefully give you a few
ideas for how you can organize things or
you know just pass along some little
tips along the way I guess that may be
helpful to you and I have to say I have
a ton of makeup I am NOT going to begin
to deny that my my collection is massive
and I'm not bragging about that but and
I'm definitely not patting myself on the
back for that but I guess what I want to
say is that you've got to put my
collection in context of what I've been
doing for the past almost four years and
November it will be four years that I've
had my youtube channel I have well over
550 videos on my channel and I just have
accumulated a lot of makeup it's not all
the same makeup that I've had here and
there you know it gets tossed out it
gets you know maybe passed off to my mom
or something like that but what I'm
saying is I have a lot of makeup but I
have it because not just because makeup
is something I use every day but because
makeup has become a huge part of my life
this YouTube channel everything I do
with my blog and all that it has become
my passion and I love it and I wouldn't
have it any other way
I don't I'm not suggesting anyone needs
this much makeup but this is what I have
and this is what you've asked to see so
I'm gonna show it to you and I would not
be critical of anyone elses makeup
collection whether it is small or
whether it's twice as big as my
collection so I hope you have
consideration as you watch this video
and just realize that this is what I do
you know and I don't expect everyone to
have a collection this big
I know collection videos can get quite
long and what I thought I would do is
split mine up so this particular video
is going to be overall storage so if
you're just into
in basically you know what's here how is
it stored how is it organized I think
this video is going to answer a lot of
those questions for you and then in
future videos I'm going to be covering
eyes lips and face products and tools in
the whole bit everything else so this
video is not going to get too in-depth
on each individual product other videos
will be more detailed but so yeah just
stay tuned for that I wanted to make it
so people could watch what they were
interested in instead of feeling like
they had to watch me go through the
entire collection to finally get to what
are your favorite lip glosses are what
lip glosses do you have you know what I
mean so yeah this is the storage video
so stay tuned so as you walk down the
hall in my house the makeup room will
catch your eye because it is bright pink
so I once did a room tour here but it
didn't have a lot of the things in it
that it now has so I thought I would
just go over that real quickly this
gorgeous painting is by my sister Kelly
aka pup so she actually took a picture
of me here in my makeup room and painted
it which took so much detail and so much
time so that is gorgeous and I love
having that I've got this little white
shelf here that I had in my past
apartment it was really old we repainted
it and I really like it now I've got a
TV up here yes I've been watching all
about jewelry today on QVC I've got a
bookshelf with my makeup books some
random little knickknacks and pictures
and nail stuff in the bottom two areas
there zebra bench this little stool is
where cupcake looks out the window while
I'm doing makeup extra little chair
there and this little sort of like TV
tray type thing here with a few cupcake
things and my lamps so basically what
you've got here storage wise I've got an
l-shaped desk that I got from Staples
I've got a bookshelf that matches that
desk and then I've got all these little
drawers to store makeup in so basically
storage wise and things I found useful
are actually office supply items like
I've got pallets here in this container
that I got from TJ Maxx it's pink in
black it's really cute The Divide
can hold everything from smaller pallets
to some larger pallets so I've enjoyed
that got my calendar here some notepads
so I can jot down any products I want to
remember that I used or notes about
anything that I'm thinking about
reviewing brushes I've got this cool
storage container this actually was in
this house when we moved in it was left
in one of the closets and some folks on
here have told me that it came from
pampered ship
so this was I guess meant for you know
your spoons and made organize your
different kitchen stuff but is it not
perfect for brushes so I love that I've
got a lot of Sigma brushes a lot of
Coastal Scents stored in there Sigma
probably the best quality brushes I own
so I use those a lot got these little
things I got this at the dollar store
that cute little I think it's probably a
shot glass
but I'm storing some NYX slide-on liners
there I'm storing summoned by Mally
jumbo pencils and liners in another
little glass but this is my makeup
mirror and this is from vanity girl
Hollywood and this was a gift from Tyler
for Christmas and I absolutely love
having this larger mirror and then just
another smaller mirror to really get up
close for certain things so and this is
how its kind of laid out I've got some
space here to work but I've also got
more containers of stuff yay I store my
mascaras here and I have a specific
video on how I divide up my mascaras and
all that we'll get into specifically
what those mascaras are in a future
video
got my little kabuki brushes in this
little thing that looks like a and I'm
going to turn the light on here it looks
like a cupcake paper but it's actually a
little plastic container I believe it
came from a dollar store during Easter
time a year or so ago so got those
around I've got this container this is
from the one spot at Target and it's got
my moisturizers in it and this turntable
this came from Walmart it was five
dollars or less it is not the strongest
thing ever but as you can see it's
holding a lot of stuff and you can just
assemble it yourself and put whatever
you want on there so
I've got like my moisturizers and some
skincare stuff and some primers and a
lot of my tools up here and I've got
more of the same on the bottom as well
so moisturizers it just it's really cool
it turns all the way around and it can
store of course you know some relatively
tall things on the bottom but this might
be you know it's like a it was designed
to be a spice rack but it's a great
little makeup storage tool as well I've
also got my temptu airbrush which I'm
going to be reviewing the self-tanning
stuff for the face that you can use with
your temptu airbrush so gonna be kind of
also reviewing temptu as a whole kind of
my other like a second reaction to it
because I gave my initial reaction in an
old video but that's there I rely on the
area under my table so much for storage
as you can see I've got a lot of these
big Sterilite containers that I've had
and added to over the years and you're
gonna see you know a lot of drawers
throughout my collection and it's not
necessarily that all of these drawers
are filled but it's that I guess what
I'm trying to say is that it's nice to
be able to separate you stay organized
and you know more what you have when you
can split things up so if I can have
more drawers since I am blessed with
having a room to have my makeup in I can
split it up spread it out and do what I
want with it so that's been great I got
this little cart here that I've had
since college I keep up here actually
packaging from stuff that I'm planning
to refuse so I can really quickly like
there's a new liner from Maybelline it's
called master drama and I want to have
the claims and you know what the company
says it will do handy for me so once I
take stuff out of the packaging I do
keep the packaging so I can look at that
at least until I do the review um here
I've got some flowers and I'm going to
be making into little bobby pin flower
clips so I got those there
I've got like cotton pads and sponges
and different q-tips and tools and
smallish makeup bags I'm going to use my
foot is a pointer down there some
antibacterial why here at the storage
here and here these are i prod
so basically you know I'm using each
drawer to store something different I've
got little containers that I'd rely on a
lot of these little plastic skinny
containers that you can buy in packs of
like three or five or something so I use
those to divide up a lot of my products
you'll see there and I will explain in
my I video how I've got it all divided
but there's some more down there below
that you're looking at a lot of the
pigments and loose shadows and below
that or a lot more tools than just extra
items up here more storage more you know
I try to divide things up as many ways
as I can within one drawer so if it's a
skinny container a couple smaller
containers that's what I'm doing with
eyeliners I've got jumbo pencils and
cream shadows below that more drugstore
shadows divided in small plastic
containers that's the name of the game
for me here I've got in this little
heart container I've got the temptu air
pods so yeah I'll be talking about that
in the face products video but kind of
from bottom up what I've got going on
are more smaller plastic containers
holding everything from say loose
powders to foundations I've got actually
a big tub in here because this is a deep
drawer so storing foundations there I've
also got pressed powders and concealers
in one of these pink or white plastic
containers ah the Shelf I love this
shelf this has just been a wonderful
handy place to you know have my makeup
because obviously I'm sitting here I'm
surrounded by the stuff in the l-shaped
table but then I got this shelf right
here so up at the top I've gotten this
new lipstick lamp from Target there's a
ton of cute dorm room stuff at Target
right now and I just had to have that my
good friend Becky got me this cute
little mirror with the zebra print on it
that one's from sigma becky also got me
this lipstick pen how cool is that so
what I've got storing a lot of my
Coastal Scents palettes this is a big
office supply item so
would be to organize stay file folders
but it's great for palates so if you've
got larger palates that's probably the
ideal thing for them so I've got that up
top and then here more of these sorts
containers which I know you saw in the
video where I blinged them all out with
my hot glue gun oh yeah you know it so
here is a little 1 2 3 4 or 5
I'd probably stack 2 did I yeah okay
I've got I've stacked one on top of the
other there but this is face products
we're talking cream highlights cream
blushes and then I've divided up blushes
by color as well so from the bronzy
shades to the peachy to the pink over
here more face products matte bronzers
and shimmer bronzers are separated and
then I've got highlights they're kind of
surrounding it I've sort of turned this
whole thing into kind of a cute display
so the stuff that I have that has cute
packaging I don't want to hide it away
in a drawer so I've got my Too Faced
natural eye get a palette from lorac
there speaking of those handy little
things that can file your folders that's
a large one this is a smaller one so you
want the smaller size and I'm pretty
sure these came from either Walmart or
staples but if you've got smaller
palettes say like the smaller Coastal
Scents or from other brands to that I
have in here
you know they store wonderfully well in
there got my two-faced glamour
revolution palette here's more of those
cute little cupcake holders and I had to
put on display the cupcakes lip glosses
that once were sold at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
I've got some other lip glosses back
they're an adorable little cupcake bag
I'll put the link down below for where
you can get that I've stored some of my
little things that look like books so
like the elf beauty books and I've got a
NYX eyebrow kit some brush guards handy
back there these two containers are all
lip products and you will see it when I
do the video exactly what's in there but
I divide these by shade so here these
are lip glosses these are my lightest
new
so my Lite new kind of golden a lip
glosses my deeper neutrals these would
be my light pink glasses and my berries
and hot pinks down here I've got
lipsticks neutral lipsticks light pinks
and this side is like super long wearing
lip colors and then down here the lip
stuff continues I've got my coral
glosses there I've got my lip plumpers
I've got clear squeezy to the lip
glosses so you're kind of getting a feel
for that I divide stuff up as much as I
can because I have the space for it so
not everybody does so that's fine but
I'm just letting you know
I've got clear glosses of other kinds
tinted lip balms and regular lip balms
here just a bunch of little lip products
that are in the little pots you know
over here I've got lipsticks these would
be the pinks and berries Reds and lip
liners jumbo pencils and skinny lip
liners their lips we have an escapee
here I've got mineral makeup everyday
minerals in these two drawers one of my
favorite brands and mineral makeup I've
got miscellaneous over here from like
Avon Isadora mineral power and elf bare
minerals and then down here are just
kind of like random like I've got a
Coastal Scents thing I've got just
little containers and just stuff that's
not even technically maker just more
like little empty containers and storage
and stuff like that down below I've got
makeup bags I've got brush rolls here is
a good place that I'm storing my false
eyelashes and extra skins skin care
stuff I've got a little bag I take with
me for travel couple of those they're
the bag I take with me to work is right
there if you've heard the sounds of a
lot of lawnmowers in this video I
apologise because my neighbor on this
side of me and that side of me there
they're both mowing right now something
it's really
loud outside but anyway thanks for
watching this video this was just to
give you an idea of the overall storage
let you know what I'm putting my stuff
in and then my future videos in my
collection series will be exactly you
know a closer look at what's in all
those drawers so thanks a lot for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
