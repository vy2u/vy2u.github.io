series continues with a look at my face
products what I've got is pretty much a
big container that stores my foundations
my powders and my concealers so I'll
take you through that also the way I've
stored some skincare items and then
blushes and bronzers as well so let's
get started when you're talking about
face makeup my routine begins with
skincare so what I have here is a little
container that I got from Target I got
it from the one spot works great for me
and I've got some of my favorite
moisturizers here that I use the most I
love a vino positively radiant I love
you know ultra calming also have the
positively radiant tinted moisturizer
which is great I've got Mac strobe cream
which is fun for sort of a more luminous
dewy look couple here from clean and
clear that I enjoy and I've just got my
tweezers right on the outside of that
container got my kabuki brushes here as
well my temptu airbrush is nearby so
that's already plugged in and handy to
use whenever I need it and this is
really great I love this
double-decker spice rack that rotates
cheapest can be from Walmart and it
works great for storing my skincare
primers things like that so I love the
clean and clear person gel that is a
great zip fighter I've also got my
primers here like my smash must photo
finish light my hard candy sheer envy
primer Palladio and stuff like that got
one from laura geller here I also happen
to store my brow products right up here
not sure why they've just created their
own special little area there so I've
got a heated eyelash curler up there as
well that I don't especially like but
it's there a couple little containers
here that I filled with beads to stick
some smaller brushes down in and some
tools but more on that in my tools video
down here we're talking more
moisturizers more primers that's a great
primer from Malley I've got my mini
philosophy hope in a jar an old eczema
prescription treatment right there
um let's see what else my covergirl
smoothers tinted moisturizer that I love
and just a lot of other moisturizers
I've tried different ones from Lancome
and Clinique and Olay so down below I
have a lot of my face products for like
foundation powders concealers so like
your non color type face products I've
also got right here this is a little
cute as can be container that I got from
Target it's got colored hearts on it and
this has my temptu air pods here so I've
got like foundation blush bronzer and
then I've got a few different like
highlights and the whole self-tanning
system that I'll be reviewing soon with
them so up here at the top I've got my
concealers I've got kind of a wide range
of course I've got those thrilly kind of
rich creamy ones like Bobby Brown
Benefit erased paste I've got some quads
from Coastal Scents and a little set
down there from hard candy that I don't
enjoy so much I've got some stick
concealers here and some and some tubes
that I don't use so much like Mary Kay
but I do love Revlon Photoready so I
have that got one from boots here number
seven that's pretty good
a few stick concealers from like NYC and
wet-and-wild that I think are rather
drying over here some rich and creamy
kind of concealers again laura geller
the real deal concealer is fantastic
coverage a few from Malley here her
concealer system is nice and brightening
for under-eye and bare minerals summer
bisque
is a nice topper for any of these
concealers that I've said have been
subpar that's a nice way to make them
full coverage all right in the drawer
below about my powders these are powders
that are pressed some are powder
foundations that's what's in the pink
here and then behind that are just
normal light coverage pressed powders so
I've got my Laura Geller balancing
Brighton still working on that small
size I tell you it lasts forever but
I've got a big size waiting for me
love that Mac mineralize skinfinish in
terms of drugstore powder foundations
couple of my favorites are Milani
multitasker
and Maybelline pure stay really good got
one from Lancome one from Too Faced back
here we're looking at like Maybelline
Dream matte powder
I've got Revlon Colorstay one from
Clinique covergirl and in the back some
that I just don't use as much I've got a
Milani minerals one that I'm not too
terribly fond of and I've got like the
hard candy welcome mat which is not that
great either down here is the foundation
drawer so yeah I've got all kinds of
liquid foundations I really turn to
liquid foundations a lot as I get ready
for work in the morning because I find
the coverage is good and so is the
staying power so I've got my Rimmel
lasting finish by maybelline superstay
also a kind from Mac here the pro
longwear which I've enjoyed I got one
from Lancome some more Rimmel kinds
there Revlon Photoready a few Coastal
Scents HD foundations and some
Neutrogena and L'Oreal I've also got
down here like Maybelline Dream matte
mousse dreams smooth mousse and a couple
of light compact foundations from Maui
and Revlon and all the way at the bottom
we're looking at some of those hard to
store products like loose powders which
are generally pretty big and then some
of those mineral powders like the ones
from L'Oreal that come with the big
brush on top I've got some of the fair
and natural powders and they're just not
easy to store so fortunately I've got a
large drawer to put them in I've got
some other temptu products a couple of
the retouch things for temptu so that's
their top shelf of my bookshelf here is
pretty much devoted to blush and bronzer
so I've also got some highlight products
as well you might have noticed these
because these are the ones that got the
lovely Julie and prove it with the hot
glue gun in that video before gosh it's
going to be really hard to look in here
but these are cream highlighters I've
got a lot of those elf Stix and the elf
like shimmering facial whip and a little
palette from smash
they're right here cream blushes I've
got one matte cream blush one from laura
geller I love the New York color cream
sticks from NYC so those are really
great for an affordable cream blush that
lasts you a while
I've got a couple from Sonia Kashuk
there as well getting into the powder
blushes these are divided up by color so
at the top here these are my pinks so
anything pink and rosy I've got up here
so I've got my Mac what one is that
that's a dolly mix I like that one I
also really enjoy the elf studio blushes
I think they're nicely pigmented Milani
baked blush Azhar the balm also got
Physicians Formula they're covergirl
cheekers and hard candy and living doll
which is a great pink blush down below
that I've got my coral and peachy
blushes so one from Tarte that I think
is gorgeous one of those Amazonian clay
blushes I've been with the elf studio
you're gonna see a lot of that Milani
minerals Milani baked blush is one NYX
blush and more covergirl cheekers you're
going to see some recurring themes I
like covergirl cheekers I like Milani
minerals and I like elfs to do so I've
got here is more or less contouring
blushes or those that are a little more
bronzy in nature so like Milani baked
blush in Rose de Oro is a little you
know not quite your brighter pinky or
blush I've got some different covergirl
cheekers and I got my contouring blush
and bronzer from ELF that I love back in
the back
got a couple from Neutrogena got an
older thing from Smashbox to contour
with down below I've got some finishing
powders like my ELF HD powder my little
makeup forever go for the elf it's
cheaper and it's still really Molly has
a finishing face product and a poreless
face defender and then some more of
those maybelline dream mousse blushes in
the best container is all about bronzers
and highlights so up at the top so where
my highlights live so I've got a lot of
these physicians
things with strips so I've got one from
Physicians Formula and others that I got
on major discount when they were being
discontinued from Milani so the glimmer
stripes I've got quite a few of those
there that I got great deals on more
Physicians Formula here I love their
highlights I've got my little lorac spot
light powder a Laura Geller Neapolitan
style highlight there so and then below
that I've split my bronzers up into
shimmer and matte so in the shimmer
drawer I actually have a lot of them
I've got the Milani baked bronzers so
I've got those in the light and medium
and dark
I've got hard candy back there one from
Mac wet and wild make it glow so yeah
those are shimmery and then for the
matte drawer I don't have quite as many
but I do have still quite a few NYC
smooth skin laura geller
bronson Brighton Too Faced chocolate
Soleil I've talked about those so much
I've also got Rimmel down below there
and this cute one from Physicians
Formula looks like a little what's that
called like a little cashmere sweater
