through my makeup collection series I
think it's really fun to snoop around in
other people's collections so it's about
time you had a look at mine as well so
it's definitely big I have addressed
that in past videos so thanks for not
judging me I appreciate that but in this
video it's gonna be all about my eye
products so I've got a couple of pretty
much pretty large storage containers
that I've got my eye makeup and one a
closer look at all that keep on watching
I've got really a main area where my eye
products are stored but to sort of side
areas where things I guess could be seen
as a little out of place I've got some
brow products right up here I've got
this little holder it came some
covergirl products actually came in it a
long time ago
but I kept this plastic container and I
don't have a ton of brow stuff I just
have a few different pencils my all-time
favorite is the Maybelline definer brow
because it's such a fine tip but I've
got a couple other brow pencils as well
and I just keep those up there because
they're it's just the perfect size spot
for them and then down here I have my
mascaras and I know I've mentioned I do
have a video that kind of explains this
sort of one-two-three-four divided
container here I've basically got my
favorite ultimate favorite mascaras in
one end and that includes like my Mally
my elm a triple effect nourishing my
Tarte lights camera lashes L'Oreal
voluminous and I've got my Lancome
Hypnose in there as well then I've got
some that I feel like are kind of good
for thickening or volume and I've got my
Maybelline falsies with the flare that's
going to be reviewed soon I've got my
LashBlast fusion I think there's a
Maybelline full and soft back in here an
old classic that I think a lot of people
like and then I've got some lengthening
ones so that would include things like
L'Oreal telescopic I've also got the
Maybelline one by one and just some
other mascaras
in there that I think actually add
length more than anything else and at
the end I've got a couple mascaras that
have that double coat to them so like a
primer step and I've got a couple
individual primers also I like to store
my pin eyeliners or those you know those
felt-tip pens I like to store them down
like this so all the juice kind of comes
to the bottom I've also got my
Maybelline lash discovery so any
specialty little product like that I
have in there as well i shadow storage i
used to store my eyeshadows a lot by
brand and then i realized i was only
reaching for certain brands over and
over and I wasn't getting full use out
of other products that I did like but I
just kind of forgot about forgot that I
had basically so I want to tell you
about my storage method now and I can't
pull this drawer very far out or else it
will fall out but what I've done is
basically stored my eyeshadows according
to shade so in here I've got these
little skinny dividers and for example
in this drawer this is all neutrals so
I've got my light highlight type shades
I've got my medium topi browns and golds
and and kind of rust colors there and
then I've got my deep Browns right here
so it's really easy for me we have it
sliding um it's easy for me to kind of
reach in here and say you know I want a
highlight and in order to get through
there you know I might pick Mac I might
pick the next one I might go for
Victoria's Secret you know it just
depends so I feel like this causes me to
kind of look through the collection a
little bit more and not just pick up you
know the first brand I see so I've got
that there um in terms of brands I do
have some Mac I don't have a lot of Mac
I would say compared to a lot of
youtubers I have a minimal amount of Mac
but some shadows that I do really like I
have some Mac that I like I love like
these little wet and wild singles here
and there I have a few of these Revlon
individuals which I think are kind of
hit and miss and I love these older and
Milani singles Milani still has some
nice eye shadows but these older singles
if you've got any of these you know what
I'm talking about those
really nice shatter those men in the
front this is where I have some of those
harder to store like little duo's and
trios that come in these rounded
containers you know like smaller sizes
they're the size of a single but they're
more than one shade and so for that I've
just put them all up front then there
are still all neutrals if I pull them
out I've got quite a few of the L'Oreal
hip duo's so I mean I considered that in
neutral compared to you know other parts
of my collection these bronzy brownish
colors so yeah that's basically how that
works it's not the best storage right
here but it's where I have space and I
just feel like it works for right now in
my next door I've got it / blacks
purples and pinks and reds so I don't
have like a ton of pinks and reds but
it's nice to have them separated because
when I'm thinking color when I'm getting
my look together I go there and I'm
thinking hmm maybe I want to try this
Milani baked shade or maybe I want to
try this one from NYX so like I said a
lot of Milani a lot of NYX I've got
several of these Rimmel glam eyes
individual shadows that I like I don't
want this to turn into too much of a
review but I feel like that always end
up talking about what I like why I don't
like but this this has really helped me
a lot storing things this way and then
I've got again duo's and trios that are
kind of a small size that just seem to
fit here better than areas where I have
my other palettes and then in my next
drawer this one I just have blues and
greens and I don't have a lot
individually speaking so I just have
both the individual and the duo's and
trios all together so teals greens
things like that I've got them all in
here you know NYX LA Colors Milani in
here I've got more of that kind of theme
I've got a little more blue than I do
down below I've just stored all of my
loose shadows I have accumulated a lot
from everyday minerals I like their
mineral shadows I think they're just a
nice variety of super deep rich
saturated colors and really light frosty
shades so
have a lot of those I do have some from
glam couture and some from Coastal
Scents as well they have a lot of
pigments a lot of like mica colors that
give you a nice metallic look as well
here this is just a real hodgepodge not
really I related so much but I've got
sponges I've got empty Pat an empty Sela
pallet there I've just got extra tools
like nail files and little mascara wands
and maybe some other packaging i
mentioned i save packaging sometimes so
when i do a review i can refer to that
so that's basically all that's in there
no real day-to-day makeup products that
i use then over here this is all about
eyeliners and more eye shadow palettes
so I've got cream liners back here I've
got a bunch from Coastal Scents that
double as liners and like eyeshadow
bases so those are great and they really
wear a long time I've got over here just
miscellaneous kinds like my wet and wild
elf one from Mac a couple of Smashbox
like waterproof cream shadow liners
liquid liners right over here right now
and a review is coming on these Milani
infinite eyeliners talk about long
wearing those are crazy long wearing
I've also got some Revlon Colorstay that
I loved and what else is in there I've
got a couple from wet and wild too and a
Maybelline line stiletto and then here
is my pencils and this container I've
had this since high school I don't know
where it came from I think it might have
been like an old pencil case or
something that I just tore the top off
of but I've got my sharpeners here here
I've got more colorful eyeliners so I've
got some of the Milani liquify which I
was so pumped when they made them in
automatic pencils because these are
really long wearing and I've got a few
colors in those that I'm going to be
using and some tutorials you'll be
seeing soon I've got my white pencil
here I've got a lot of blacks Browns and
neutral colors so and it really runs the
gamut I love trying eyeliners because I
feel like we're all on a quest to find a
really good eyeliner so
I have tried so many drugstore liners I
have a lot of them here I've even got an
Urban Decay 24/7 liner that came
actually in a little set of some mini
urban decay liners that I have over here
got some physician formula cream liners
a few products I use for brows I've got
this elf brow kit that I'm testing out
and one from NYC and one from essence
here I've got a lot of cream eyeshadow
products so we're talking NYX Revlon and
elf would be the main brands I really
like if you're looking for a good cream
shadow these elf duos are actually
really nice my policy would remain the
same that apply a thin amount of these
and topped them with a shadow but they
can really help to enhance the look of
your shadow so like a light green like
that can be great with the green I look
for neutrals this butter pecan duo is
really nice too and these are just a
bucks so definitely recommend those I've
got some extra mascaras that might have
come in like duo packs or something like
that back there I've also got here
jumbo pencils a lot of people love the
NYX jumbo pencil and so do i I also like
the Coastal Scents jumbo pencils because
they are double ended and have a lot of
fun colors that they come in and of
course you know I love the Mallee ever
color shadow sticks because these are
truly long wearing these can be worn on
their own if you want and the colors are
shimmering and just gorgeous
so really unique kind of shimmery taupe
sand champagne colors I love those got
my primers over here one that I'm loving
right now is the NYX HD shadow base I've
got the others that I can compare it to
like the urban decay and the Too Faced
shadow insurance and all that over here
just straight up cream shadows like a
liquidy type cream so I've got a few
from Mary Kay that I had for a while and
then I've got one that I'm trying out
here this is a fairly new product from
covergirl intense shadow blast it's a
lot of my drugstore eyeshadow palettes
it's packed in here kind of like a
puzzle I don't have a lot of extra room
here
so this could change as time goes on
storage wise in this section I've got a
lot of wet-and-wild so you guys know I
have their big 8 color palettes so I
have those right here
I've also over time I've gone to the
store and picked up pretty much all of
the trio's because I love these I think
these are fantastic quality for a
drugstore so like what's this one
walking on our heart sweetest candy I'm
looking at it all through my little LCD
screen here so but these are fantastic
little trios so I would highly recommend
if you're looking for some good quality
shadows to pick up what you see in your
store from wet and why a lot of the elf
$1 quads which I've worked in two
tutorials here and there in the back
some lesser use products perhaps some
products that have been discontinued
that I don't want to use all over the
place because many people can't find
them but I do like the Milani runway
eyes those are awesome
here I've got some products from
Physicians Formula like these shimmer
strips these are a lot of fun if you're
in the color they have the top shimmer
strips that have a little more color to
them I've also got some Revlon Colorstay
quads that I think are pretty good if
you're looking for like high intensity
color you're not going to get a lot of
that but they're still good in here
covergirl a bunch of covergirl quads and
trios that you know I love such as drama
eyes and shimmering sands a few for
particular eye colors that really you
can wear on any eye color but they dub
them for like blue green or hazel eyes
or whatever and just a couple here from
L'Oreal down here kind of rounds out my
drugstore shadow collection with
Maybelline I've got a number of quads
here I've got pretty much I got most of
their stylish smokes collection so like
natural smokes one of my all-time
favorite drugstore palettes is in there
along with the purple tone and green
tones
I've got also a member of quads or trios
sorry from NYX so I've got a lot of
these off of cherry culture calm got
pretty good deals on them I find the NYX
shadows whether they're individual or in
these trio sets to be really nicely
pigmented got my little bronze smokey
looks set
over here some random little Lancome
quads that come as free gifts with
purchase and just things that I don't
have from a lot of different brands I've
got a new quad from Maybelline that I'll
have a tutorial coming on soon almay and
when I see back in here hard to store
things like the Physicians Formula baked
trios that are round and such a pain to
store you guys probably know what I'm
talking about there and a great quad
from Tarte down below we're talking more
pallets some of them that I honestly
have just kept because like I don't use
them early anymore but my sister got me
these as some of my first makeup related
gifts that really flung me into the
world of makeup so they're kind of
sentimental and they're also very cute
but a little two-faced palette and some
older palettes from Sela that she had
gotten me for Christmas for a couple
years and it just really got me
interested in in makeup and
experimenting and stuff like that I've
got a couple other things that I picked
off of cherry culture calm and like this
little Smashbox palette this was you
know discontinued but I've done a review
on some empty palettes like these elf
elements palettes some palettes from
Claire's that I think are pretty good a
couple of like older mary kay palettes
and things like that so nothing that i
reach for all that often but i have it
stored down there thanks so much for
taking the time to snoop through my eye
collection with me and stay tuned
because I still have more collection fun
to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
