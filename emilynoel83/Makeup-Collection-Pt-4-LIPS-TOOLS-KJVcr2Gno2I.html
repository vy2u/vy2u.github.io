the last installment of my collection
series I hope you've been enjoying it so
far this part of it is going to be all
about the lip products that I have so
glosses lipsticks and lip pencils and
also tools so brushes and just other
little random things that I have stored
within my makeup collection so in terms
of lips I like to divide things up by
shade and also by functions so you know
Mike losses are separate from my
lipsticks and my reds are separate from
my pinks so yeah I hope you enjoy this
video and get some great ideas this is
the lipstick that I get out and use
every day just kidding this is my big
lipstick lamp that I have in my room use
me if I sound a little nasal right now I
shot this video over the course of
several different days and today I feel
like I've got a cold coming on this area
right here is my lip collection these
drawers mainly and a few drawers down
here as well
I mentioned with my eye collection that
I like to split things up not so much by
brand but by shade because I feel like I
get better use of the things that I have
I'm not just always leaning toward the
same brand but I'm kind of opening up a
drawer and thinking okay I want
something in this color family what's it
gonna be today however I do have as you
can see in these little cupcake shaped
containers I mentioned this in another
video but these are plastic and I got
these a couple years ago I think at a
dollar store around Easter time they're
really cute I love them and I do have a
few little things put out by brand here
just some things that I think are
practically decorative items these lip
glosses came from Bath and Body Works
they're the cupcakes collection I've got
a few from philosophy and the little
squeezy tubes that I look in here I have
a few other kind of like favorite
groupings of products I've got the
Milani these are the lip flash jumbo lip
pencils so I have some of those that
I've actually blogged about and reviewed
recently with a bunch of swatches I have
some of the Milani HD lip colors in
there as well and a few of my favourite
Mally pinks container here is kind of
like my go-to area for
neutral lipsticks and lipglosses so at
the top I've got my lightest I would say
nude lip glosses and so these may be
Gold's peaches
like I said nude color different brands
I have really run the gamut in terms of
the cost spectrum I mean I have elfin
here side by side with NARS with Mac
Avon Victoria's Secret Palladio Milani I
mean you name it there's I probably have
at least one from that brand but I do
want to point out kind of some favorite
brands along the way
I love the Revlon Super Lustrous lip
glosses
I like the mineral lip glazes is what
also like these squeezy tubes from
Victoria's Secret beauty rush I have a
couple of Mac lip glosses but you will
find Mike's my collection of those is
not extensive I also love if you're
looking for a great buy than one dollar
elf super glossy lip shines you can find
those on the website target sells those
as well but I just have a real grab bag
of sort of champagne nude light colored
glasses down below that is where I have
more my neutral kind of think caramel e
colors things that are kind of still in
the neutral family some deeper bronzes
you know I think there's still
definitely neutrals but they're just a
little bit deeper so I again have some
of those elf super glossy lips I also
love this is an all-time favorite gloss
brand kind of across the board color
wise but it's the NYX mega shine lip
glosses you will see a lot of these
popping up also have one of my all-time
favorites from Jordana this shade is
called lovely and this is one of the
most universally beautiful lip colors
out there then in the bottom drawer this
is where I have the lipsticks that
coordinate with both of these color
families I talked about so your needs
and your deeper neutrals they're all in
here you can kind of tell what brands I
like just by what's standing out to you
here these are these are Rimmel Moisture
renew so this shade for example is
spotlight beige
I have dreamy I have sunset so I think
those are really great in terms of being
moisturizing and nicely pigmented I also
like Lori
color riche I have revlon colorburst
that's another favorite kind kind of
across-the-board lipstick brand a lot of
random ones back in here I have some
Revlon Super Lustrous I have some I have
a couple of Lancome I have a few Mac
which you saw in my dupes video so if
you want the low-cost alternatives to
say Viva Glam 5 and stuff like that I do
have a few of those one from Laura
Geller this other side is where I've got
pinks and berries and stuff like that so
these are my pink glosses I would say of
any lip product that I have accumulated
over the past year or so light pink
colored glosses have just been something
I've been getting more and more of I
think I really like it it's a fresh look
it's a young look so once again I've got
your you're gonna see some NYX mega
shine glosses I've got a lot of random
brands here you know one here and there
from Tarte there's essence elf elf hyper
shine lip gloss and fairy by the way
this just looks really light and kind of
pearlescent
and that is a great shade to have in
your collection nice to top off pretty
much anything and alone it's just a very
pretty look I do have some juicy tubes
that I've gotten is slight part of gift
with purchase and just some of these
minis and that kind of thing and why see
the reason why I have so many brands and
so many different items is that when I
review things I have so much more
ability to compare and so much more
knowledge across different brands these
are my berries and my Reds so I mean
from the deeper pinks and brighter pinks
to shades like I love this actually this
Lancome juicy tube in the shade is Beach
plum oops
loved it so much I just dropped it on
the floor no but that's that's a great
shade just for kind of to top off any
red lip
I've got against some Revlon Super
Lustrous down here I have sort of my
light pink lipsticks and my long wearing
lipsticks so I just happen to have room
and that's the way this the storage
worked out so I've got a couple of the
L'Oreal infallible I have a few of like
the covergirl outlast lip stain pens
maybelline super
stay other brands that I continue to
like i mean like the revlon colorburst
Revlon Super Lustrous in there I've got
a few of the elf mineral lipsticks which
I think are great in terms of feeling
practically like a lip balm when you put
them on so those are awesome so yeah
that's kind of my pink lip collection
down below
I've got corals and these are just the
coral glosses that I have a shade that I
recently picked up and this one kind of
beats a lot of the stuff in this drawer
and I want to tell you what shade it is
it is coral reef Revlon Super Lustrous
I don't believe this is limited edition
because it's been in the regular display
for some time but I finally picked it up
and I loved it
but um Jordana makes a nice coral you
can always find a number of sheer shades
from Beauty rush at Victoria's Secret
so I've got those there this is my
plumper drawer and I find that it's nice
to give plumpers their own section
because they're always so darn big lip
plumpers are in it seems like it seems
like the packaging it's always so big
like look at what hard candy put there's
and it's kind of like buxom you know
they they put in a big old containers so
I do have some buxom you guys recall for
Christmas I got a like a little pack of
different buxom glosses that I love I
love the staying power I love the feel
those are just some clear squeezy tubes
a few more from philosophy Co Bigelow
random brands that I've gotten off with
cherry culture down below there we're
talking just like your Rowland's
different kinds these are clear these
don't give off color a whole lot I've
got a couple lip smacker brands and NYC
that kind of thing one that I guess
can't bear to get rid of it I really do
I'll admit it I don't use this much
anymore but it has a light come on now
have my tinted lip balms
and this is tinted lip balms are great
for this time of year in particular I
love Palladio I also find that the
covergirl Nature Lux these are like the
gloss bombs and those are pretty good
well that these are just general
run-of-the-mill lip balms I tell you
what as a teenager
as a junior high girl high school age
girl I had so many so many lip smackers
and to this day I still do have a few
watermelon dr. pepper good favorites I
like the Nivea lip balms Aveeno has a
great lip balm and this chapstick one
and peppermint is quite nice as well
I've just been thinking well she showed
us her light pink lipsticks but what
about the brights and the berries well
the everything kind of trails down this
way I guess
and these are my pinks that are a little
more like your magentas and and just a
little bit brighter berry so again
thermal moisture renew I've got some
Revlon color sensational because I think
they are wonderfully pigmented as well a
few of these NYX round lip glosses that
I think are also great for for getting
you know a variety of different colors
below that this is pretty much Red's
some darker some brighter but all in all
these are Reds if you want a great one
from NYX it's chaos it's the round
lipstick and chaos it's a great read I
do have from Clinique this is the black
honey that's kind of a nice I feel like
it has a reddish tone to it
overall but I have that one I have a few
from ELF the mineral lipsticks in there
as well down below here we're looking at
liners I've got jumbo pencils on this
side that includes some of those buxom
big and healthy lipsticks that came with
the glosses I was talking about before
so I've got that I've got some NYX jumbo
pencil in there and then in terms of lip
liners I gotta say this is something you
don't have to put a lot of money into to
find good lip liners Jordana great color
selection great feel on the lips eyes
from Jordana I have some Coastal Scents
I have some NYX lip liners I mean NYC
it's just something I haven't put a
whole lot of money into but I feel like
you know I can then have a great color
selection so that's my liner drawer also
have some little lip glosses and balms
that come in the little pots and stuff
like that so
I have a couple from two-faced some of
these little elf candy shop tins that
are so cute
L'Oreal hip me makes those jelly bombs
that I think are great is nice to your
glosses and then some that are more like
practical like the Burt's Bees and
blistex and stuff like that it's all
just kind of in a tray it's it's
basically meant to be a like a drawer
divider tray and I just set it up in
that space you have a quick reference to
the tools that I have that includes
brushes and this little thing here I
mentioned it in the overall storage
video but this is from pampered chef it
was in this house in a closet when we
moved in and this turned out to be my
ideal brush storage so in terms of the
brushes I have I have Sigma I have both
the I guess you call it the the basic
set and the premium set and I love them
they are probably the best quality
brushes I own keep in mind I don't own
any Mac brushes but I find that these
are just wonderful you keep them clean
you take good care of them and they have
not given me any problems whatsoever so
that includes eye brushes face brushes I
do have random kind of like drugstore
brushes like those from Revlon that I've
collected that I may take you know just
toss them in my travel bag stuff like
that same goes for eye brushes I mean I
have some elf I have some Coastal Scents
tossed in there so I just have a big
variety I have this big Daddy that came
with my Tarte Amazonian clay foundation
so a couple fan brushes but it's great
to have it all at your fingertips and
have some sort of rotating method
whether or not you can find something
like this rotating pencil holders and
stuff like that is always out there and
office supply stores and it can be great
for your makeup brushes there's some
other tools
we've we've looked at this little
container a lot throughout my collection
series but I do just have a couple more
areas where I have tools and I've taken
little beads these can be found at the
craft section at Walmart they're just
little you know clear beads and you can
stick different tools brushes down in
them
I've got like a little smaller applique
I think are still really great to have
they're also great to pop in a bag for
travel but I have a little container
there for those I think that might have
been a votive candle holder and then
I've got a little glass here this whole
thing you know your tweezers and you
know spoolie wands for mascara to get
the clumps out lip brushes and that kind
of thing so that kind of wraps up my
tools thank you so much for tuning in
throughout my collection series it's
been highly requested I hope you enjoyed
seeing some different storage strategies
and just seeing what I have so thanks
again have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
