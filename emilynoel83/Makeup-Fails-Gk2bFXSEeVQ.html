this video this is going to be my makeup
fails bad products that I really don't
like and I wanted to tell you about him
because I have a lot of fun actually
reviewing products that I don't like I
don't know maybe it just lets out some
stress inside I don't know what it is
but I have done in the past five the
video 5 products I regret buying so
those are all different from what I'm
talking about here so you can check
those out and of course I've done many
negative individual reviews that you may
run across if you're browsing my videos
because I don't while some people say I
don't done you know I'm not gonna waste
your time posting a negative review
video I feel like products that are bad
are also things you need to know about
just like the products that are awesome
so I'm sitting at a different chair
today as well certain someone has taken
over my regular seat here in the makeup
room
she was also helping me decide which
products work makeup first off down to
business the first product I do not like
is from NYC it's the individualized
custom compact and it's one of those
like you know for brown eyes or you know
for different eye colors this one is
called Union Square says it's created
for brown eyes and the issue I've had is
that this actual this highlighter there
it went
doesn't stay in and it's because it is
so dry it cannot even adhere to its own
packaging I mean I put my finger on it
it's like you know why even bother
giving me these two cream products one
as a highlighter and one is a base and
they're both dry they both feel have a
weird consistency about them nothing I
would want on my eye and when I did wear
it on my eye I felt like it's almost
caked with the shadow instead of giving
it that smooth base it was like what did
I just put on here because it's not
reacting well with the shadow and the
shades themselves I've found to be
rather chalky
I like this darkest shade which is a
purple but I mean you're not gonna buy
that whole palette for the purple you
know it's fall the rest is so you know
ho-hum why do you want just that one
shade so I mean I just found this to be
a pretty disappointing product I think
it you know has the appearance of like
they're trying to come up with something
good here trying to give you all the
steps you need to create a good eye look
but I mean even if the packaging if the
product can't hold together in the
packaging and it's really that dry I'm
you know not worth buying it my step I'm
going to talk about the hard candy in
the shadows eyes shadow trio here um if
you've listened to my last review you
know that I do like these hard candy
duos these are the baked duos and they
work really well I feel like you know
they just they're nicely pigmented
they're kind of metallic they're really
nice but then this set this trio here I
just felt like you know it looks like it
could be good that these shades are so
disappointing I mean that's that Brown
that's your darkest shade you've got
there you've also got a taupe and I mean
they're just all very light and very
and pigmented that lightest shade is
probably the best out of the three and
they do give you a mini eyeliner but
it's like come on you know if you've got
something that works in this format just
go ahead and reap you know package it in
in some quads and trios with some
different colors because this this is
not a good formula and it's very very
cheap and very child next up a product
from Rimmel and you guys know how much I
love Rimmel lasting finish foundation it
comes in a sort of squeezy tube here
I'll pull it out just so we're on the
same page that's Rimmel lasting finish
foundation they make a powder version
and I knew going into this that I did
not like this format I do not like
powder coming out the top of the product
I actually have one from philosophy here
and the only reason why this hangs
around on my desk is because it has this
handy little mirror on one side but I
knew I really didn't enjoy powder that
comes out of this puff cuz I feel like I
can't see it doing anything I feel like
the coverage must be so frickin sheer
like I just I don't know it does nothing
for me but I thought somehow that
because the Rimmel lasting finish liquid
foundation has been so good to me over
the years I thought maybe I would like
this lasting natural glow skin loving
mineral foundation this lasting finish
stuff I really don't like it you know I
get that I could I could take this off
and and you know make it work on my own
just with the powder but this is just
it's the product itself that's not good
and people are going to buy it based on
the fact that you can use it this way
and it does not provide any coverage I
feel to me anyway so sorry about that a
product that has gotten an individual
negative review in the past but I felt
the need to bring it up again because it
is that bad in my book smoky shadow
blast this is like the idea is that you
can get a smoky eye with these two cream
shadows and I tell you what I did a
little experiment with this and it
creased in no time
you know you if you apply this extremely
extremely thin and then top it off with
powder products you might be okay but
these have a 10
see to crease and to do you know the
mindset is that you would do your whole
you know your outer V you go under your
eye you know you would get that whole
smokey effect with only cream products
like this I mean you better hope you're
just me being needed to take like one
picture after you do that and then be
done with it because this does not last
this is not a practical product at all
so um yeah don't don't like that LS from
covergirl called smoky shadow black
leather covergirl products i dislike are
these shine blast lip glosses unless you
like the feeling of as if you as if this
was just l in here and like vegetable
oil and you just put that on your lips
it needs more to more stickiness I think
it might pride itself on being a non
sticky lip gloss but it is just too
slippery and and also you buy different
colors but it's not really gonna show up
they're just so sheer and I just feel
like I'm just basically Yap put oil on
my lips and I don't even like the feel
of that and and I'm sorry guys yeah I
try to I'm gonna pride myself in making
certain cheap products work for me in
some way but a lot of these products are
just things that I think my goodness I
just do not like that that greasy feel
that these lip glosses have so I would
not recommend those there are better
drugstore lip glosses out there
absolutely two more products both for
eyes this first one is from Wet n Wild
and it is the mega Volume Mascara
actually just recently tried this and I
really don't like it okay first off to
call this a Volume Mascara is a lie to
stick the word mega in front of it I
mean like it does not do anything it's
it's like it's got a brush that looks
like it might be a good brush but I tell
you what you will put this on and even
with multiple coats you will not get any
in
any result with this I mean it's black
yeah that's about the only positive that
I have on this is that it's black and I
guess it's it's not giving you enough to
work what to even get clumpy I mean and
it's almost like I would rather have a
little more formula come out I don't
know if the brush is getting too cleaned
off you know as it comes it runs through
that little opening and there's not
enough on it to build anything up on
your eyelashes but it just really really
don't like mega volume mascara and but
mascaras are strange you know what what
doesn't work for me I mean might work
for you if your mind something like
extremely natural look but um in terms
of what I'm looking for which was mega
volume I didn't get it there final thing
is from Lancome and it is the art liner
not because of the product I don't
necessarily think this is a bad product
but I got it in the sparkling black
shade instead of just black and I found
it to be watery even with shaking it and
stuff I found this product to be really
like okay I don't feel like I'm wearing
eyeliner now and I just I mean I'm not
sure there's a few kind of streaks of it
there and it's just I don't prefer the
metallic stuff on my as an eyeliner and
I guess I didn't really realize that
until after I got this home and put it
on my own eye that I would rather have
black kind of wringing my eye some
people out there might like this and but
I just feel like the the eyeliners where
I want definition and this really like
if it catches the light in certain ways
it's almost as if it's not even there so
I would like to make me try art liner in
a black but I've heard it's very similar
to the liner intense which I thought was
just you is okay and pretty good
eyeliner but not quite as good as Revlon
Colorstay liquid liner but anyway I'm
getting off on it a little tangent there
but yeah that's not my best experience
there with Lancome product on the art
so anyway guys that's all I've got to
tell you about today in terms of makeup
fails for me I realized that these
things didn't work for me they may work
for you or there may be reasons why you
like these so don't be insulted by my
opinions just know that these are my
experiences that I am sharing with you
and many of you asked to hear about
products I don't like so thanks so much
for watching and have a great day
oh hi baby what do you think of that
