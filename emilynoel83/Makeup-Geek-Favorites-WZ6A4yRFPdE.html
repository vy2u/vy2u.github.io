video this is gonna be about all things
makeup geek now that is both a brand and
a person the makeup geek is Marlena
she's got videos here on YouTube that
I've been watching for years
she's a wonderful educator as far as all
things makeup are concerned I remember
learning how to deep pop my eyeshadows
from her all kinds of makeup trick on
her makeup geek website she sells a
number of different makeup brands along
with her own called makeup II and she
was kind enough to send me a lot of
products from her line to review I've
tried a lot of eye shadows pigments gel
liners lipsticks I thought I might just
kind of introduce what I have to you in
this makeup geek favorites video and
then down the line I'll probably do some
more specific reviews on beauty
broadcast Express and then probably some
other tutorials featuring these products
here on this channel and I really do
appreciate how budget-friendly these
prices are it's really all very
comparable to what you might pay at the
drugstore so the first thing I'm going
to talk about are the lipsticks and
these runs $6.99 apiece all of the
lipsticks that I've tried have been very
full color creamy not something with a
bunch of shimmer in it just very very
pigmented saturated color so I'm gonna
start off with the shade that I am
wearing now which is called luscious and
check it out yeah it looks like a really
deep kind of brick red here in the
packaging but on my lips I feel like a
little bit more of a berry red tone
takes over so definitely blue base its
creamy on the lips but not overly shiny
in terms of the finish so it does have
pretty good staying power I find that
this shade in particular really tends to
stain my lips a totally glamorous color
I really love it probably my top
favorite lipstick from the line another
shade that I love that I think is very
wearable across the board is called
delightful it's kind of like a classic
rose color it's very warm I think it
just really complements my complexion
very well and I think it would look good
on lots of other people too very creamy
again rich with color doesn't take a lot
of work to build it
to where you want it on the lips so I
love that and then finally something
that I think those who enjoy nude lips
would really really like and it's called
innocent and this is a great shade for
nude lips because it's kind of got a
peachy tone to it I feel like when you
put it on your lips don't look totally
like dead like the life has been sucked
out of them I mean it really does look
fresh I feel like there's a bit more
Sheerness in this shade than the others
as I mentioned which I think is
appropriate and I just really like the
look on the lips now these gel liners
might be my favorite thing from the line
there are so many shades to choose from
there's really rich deep shades that you
might traditionally think of using as a
liner and then there are some other
shades that I think double as a long
wearing cream shadow wonderfully the
staying power is awesome I mean they set
to a completely smudge free State I love
that about it so let's just jump into
the color so I've got for to share with
you the first one is called rave and I
feel like this is kind of a classic
taupe maybe bordering a little bit on a
gunmetal type look it's very pretty on
the lower lash line I love using it
there because I feel like it almost
illuminates the area behind your lashes
so if you like doing a little more
intense lower lash this and behind them
mix them kind of stand out a little bit
more it's very pretty but again it makes
a great base too if you just want to
take your finger in there and smudge it
across your lids it really lasts a long
time another gorgeous shade for the
purple lovers is amethyst a really true
purple sham this does kind of remind me
of my Avon super shock liner in velvet
plum only the Velvet plum is a little
bit deeper of a fun shade if you want to
do like a thick line of this maybe
across your upper lash line and then
take a really thin line of like a black
gel or liquid liner it's kind of fun as
a layering type line okay this is
probably one of the most gorgeous gel
liners ever it's called Fame and it is a
deep teal color I absolutely love this I
have worn this with a particular shadow
that I'm gonna mention layered on top of
it so I use just like a base and then
with the shadow on top it's so so pretty
I feel like a lot of people in the
summer
go for those like turquoise liners you
know they're a little bit brighter than
this say on the lower lash line or
something and this is like totally the
fall twist on that kind of trend because
it's just a little bit deeper but it
still got that gorgeous shimmer that
just makes the color look so vibrant I
really like it finally just a great
basic shade is mobster and this is just
a dark brown I really at the moment
didn't have a great dark brown gel liner
so this is what I've been using a lot I
am wearing that today and they just go
on so smooth and effortlessly my
favorite brushes by the way to apply gel
liners is from Real Techniques since the
fine liner brush I feel like it gives
the perfect like width of the line
across your upper lash line times gel
liners you feel like you're just
constantly dipping back into the product
trying to get some creaminess worked up
so you can really get across the lash
line I love how these are super creamy
yet like I said they set to a totally
totally long wearing finish let's talk
about the pigments I've tried a lot of
the makeup geek pigments I really
thought they were all super beautiful in
their own way but I kind of chose three
that I thought were just my ultimate
favorites really you need is one thing
that I don't so much like about the
pigments and I think makes it difficult
to use and very messy is that when you
open them up there is no like stopper in
there there's nothing preventing this
stuff from going everywhere and as a
result you do get it a lot like around
the you know that inner rim of your cap
so as you untwist and use them
repeatedly you get a lot of product
right there and so yeah it's kind of
coming out on my pants right now what's
on the inside I do have some shades that
I absolutely love this one's called
birthday wish and it's a really pretty
kind of peachy rose gold type vibe with
golden sparkle in it so definitely a
sparkly thing if you want to just have a
good time in your a total like true
makeup give you get any of these swatch
them like in broad daylight with light
coming through the window the shine of
the glitter and the
saturation of these colors is just so
intensely beautiful also love the shade
called enchanted and this is kind of
something that would work really nicely
alongside any sort of a berry burgundy
plum type look this is definitely a
shimmery mauve color I think it's
beautiful and I love the burgundy eye
looks so this plays into those are
really nice and finally a color that is
just so much fun it's called insomnia
this is the kind of shade that I have
seen in different eyeshadows I know Too
Faced has a shade called label whore
that looks just like this I think Mac
has something similar as well but it's
one of those shades that looks like kind
of a brownish maroon and then when it
hits the light it looks like a greenish
blue almost it's crazy and this is
probably the most concentrated highly
pigmented form of that kind of color
that I have ever laid eyes on
I only the eyeshadows and that's
probably what I have the most of from
the makeup geek line so I have narrowed
it down to what would fit in one small Z
palette so nine shadows that I want to
talk about that are my absolute
favorites from what I've tried old in
these little pans or you can buy them
you know in a little compact they are
$5.99 I was trying my makeup geek
shadows I couldn't help but compare
those to the Coastal Scents hot pots
which are the same size as these for
only a buck 95 of the piece and I think
they're very high-quality I mean they're
not even very hit and miss like there
are a lot of hot pots that I really
really like and I don't have every
single hot pot known to man but I do
have enough to fill up a couple Z
palettes and so I was definitely kind of
looking across that brand to this brand
and thinking you know is is Coastal
Scents better is makeup geek better I
think they're very similar in quality
but I think I have rounded up some
shades from makeup geek that I find to
be very unique and not just unique to
Coastal Scents but unique compared to a
lot of the shadows I have in my
collection and I got a lot of eyeshadow
so I feel like I picked my ultimate
favorites for makeup geek to share with
you in this video first one I want to
tell you about it's called beaches and
cream and this is kind of a matte soft
pea in my collection I feel like I've
either got a lot of creamy shades or
much more peach than this this is right
on the border of like a vanilla color
and just a little bit of peach thrown in
this is a great great natural looking
highlight shade and it works awesome
matte shades like this to blend out and
perfect the outer borders of whatever's
going on in your crease and just
bringing it up above like I used that
today on the border of my look and I
feel like it just the it makes the blend
look so good only the shade called latte
this is another kind of matte basic this
shape works well in a couple of
different ways if you want to just go
for like a really natural crease color
like if you just want to look like okay
that's just the way the contour of my
eye looks and I don't want makeup to
even hardly be detectable they're too
light not too dark or if you're going
really deep and dark and the depth of
your crease and you want to kind of
blend it out like a transition type
shade this is nice for that as well it's
kind of an unusual shape called country
girl it does have some shimmer to it
it's kind of like a deep rest color with
a little bit of like golden sparkle it
catches the light I feel like a little
bit more of that gold shows when it's
more in the shadows I feel like it looks
a little bit deeper almost like a brick
or burgundy color so really interesting
love that shade great classic but super
pigmented taupe is prom night love this
shade look how when it's in full light
you know it looks so almost silvery
bright and then when it's not you're
seeing more that deep taupe tone I've
got this shade today all over my lid but
this totally does a one shadow look
beautifully pack it on your lid then
blend it up into the crease really
softly and how the light works with this
you know it really will catch the light
when you pack it on the lids but it
looks much more like a contour kind of
crease shade when you've got it in the
crease and the light isn't hitting it as
much so I think that's a beautiful color
it step is a matte shade and it's called
unexpected I would call this like a
dusty lilac it is kind of unexpected I
mean you look at it and it's just one of
those shady clients that think so what
but then you swatch it out or you use it
on your eyes and you can see just the
slightest hint of a pretty soft purple
coming through and I think that makes
just a beaut
will shave you've got a dark color in
your crease blend it out with this and
it's just the softest prettiest like
addition to a look and the type of shade
that I personally just don't have a lot
of things like that I love a good
Burgundy especially this time of year
and I think burlesque has got to be one
of the top ones for me across my entire
makeup collection this shade is a
beautiful Burgundy brick red with a
little bit of shimmer I am wearing it
today like on the outer part of my lid
and crease just to deepen that up a
little bit and I think it is so darn
pretty and there's something very
beautiful about dark shades that really
manage to catch the light and look so
beautiful like that another shade that
is just the balm that I have nothing
like is this matte color called business
what's giving me this kind of hazy like
burgundy brick-red look right around the
outer border of my eyes I used my little
Sigma e36 brush went into that and just
really softly brought that color right
up through there and I mean this could
be good in a really intense way that I
think in a soft way it looks so unique
and different shade called poison ivy I
think it's pretty special I've got a lot
of olive green in my collection I don't
have a lot of greens that are like a
little step up from that in brightness
and I think this shade is so pretty it's
got a little shimmer in there a little
bit of sparkle and when you swatch it
out you don't just see the green in this
shade like you're seeing in the pan here
but you see some gold come out in it as
well and only a shade that is just
stunning like just sit and look at it
it's called Envy and it's a really deep
shimmery tea I'd mentioned doing
something kind of special with the gel
liner and fame and I do use it with this
shade when you layer a little bit of
this over some of this gel liner either
as a liner or as like a base all over
your lid and then you put this on the
effect is so pretty these two together
or I mean who can't wear that who can't
wear that as smudgy liner or wear it you
know a little
in your crease if you're always reaching
for gray and brown switch it up try this
this is so pretty so there you know
everybody those are my favorites from
the makeup geek line the quality of
these products compared to you know a
lot of products in my collection these
stack up really really well well thanks

was helpful and I'll talk to you again
