holiday gift ideas video I've been
getting tons and tons of requests for
this just over the past month or so and
I've really compiled a lot of ideas for
things that I have that I think would
make awesome gifts a lot of the things
I'll be talking about could pretty much
be you know a gift in itself meaning I
don't think a lot or anything needs to
be added to it but in the future I will
be sharing again my how to build a
drugstore makeup gift bag I'll do an
updated one of those for this year so
how to take a little you know makeup bag
and fill it with drugstore products so
you can kind of really customize your
price range and the things you put in
there and I'll also be blogging about my
own personal wishlist student for this
year this I just want to share some
things that I think make awesome awesome
gift got some pallets I've got some
brushes I've got just some other odds
and ends you see something you like in
this video you know you could share the
link with your boyfriend or your mom or
dad or grandma and grandpa whoever and
let them know what you want something
I'm going to talk about is a palette
this is one from Coastal Scents and it
is called the smoky palette and it is
not one of their larger palette is a 36
color eye palette and it's a great great
palette and I know I've talked about
this in the past but basically what this
is is one two three four five six sets
of six shadows so if you look you can
see different groupings you got kind of
your neutrals your Smokies blues pigs a
mix of matte and shimmer and colorful
and neutrals so um I've gotten questions
like I want to try a Coastal Scents
palette which one should I get and I
think this is a really great one to try
because you do have so much variety in
one palette and if you're giving this to
someone you know I don't think they'll
feel overwhelmed by the amount of shades
plus you have a little direction in just
the way they're grouped together is
something I use every single day and
it's called the my sculpted face palette
and it's from it cosmetics that's a
brand that you'll see on QVC from time
to time get are like four different
contour powders and you get two
highlights one is matte and one
shimmery you also get a little booklet
with this showing you know like all the
different things you can do you know how
to slim your nose how to contour your
cheeks and your for very instructional
product really because you have like a
little diagrams of how to contour how to
highlight so I have a full video that I
did on this if you want to see exactly
how it works and more details on it but
I just think it's not like necessarily
your typical makeup gift but I think
it's a wonderful product and I think if
people get this and they realize how to
use it they're gonna think like what did
I do without that palette that I gave to
to people last year and it just became a
total favorite product of theirs and I
just have to mention it because it's
really a gift you can't go wrong with
and it's the Urban Decay Naked palette I
mean I've had people ask me is that
worth it is it really good and you know
it really is it's filled with you know
different matte and shimmery colors a
lot more shimmer than that in here but
it's just the palette that can work with
everything you know you can get a smoky
eye out of this you can get a light
natural eye with this palette so it's
just a great value I really think that
whoever gets this will kind of feel
comfortable with the shades they're
getting Walla tea is amazing the texture
of these shades is fantastic so I would
definitely say Naked palette is a great
gift to give quickly I want to mention
something I know I talked about in my
laura geller video and that is a kit
called baked beginnings and this I
believe is my favorite thing for someone
who is trying to try just try out some
things from Laura Geller great baked
powder called balance and brighten and
so you get one of those you get a bronze
and brighten which I equally love which
I have hit the terracotta tile on there
and you also get a beautiful blush and
brighten so you get three of these and
you get like a little kabuki brush
that's in a cute little case there but
these will last you a really long time
and like I said you're getting to try
three of the best aspects of the brand
in my opinion you're gonna love the
balance and brighten for the fact that
it gives great coverage and it really
evens out and brightens the complexion
bronze and brighten is a great kind of
middle-of-the-road bronze
not too dark not too light and then the
blush and bride's kind of like it's got
some shimmer to it as a lot of her
blushes do so it can kind of double as a
great blush and highlight in one you've
got a lip product lover that you know of
or maybe that's you um I love this kit
from buxom so much I really like the
bare essentials buxom products the lip
products are great the glosses because
they do have just a little bit of
plumping action going on the colors are
awesome and I find they last a long time
on my lips so I got this last year and
it's not the exact same kit that I know
is being sold this year I think it's
called mix and mingle this year and you
can find it at Sephora but it's
basically the same idea it's four of the
buxom glosses and four of the big and
healthy lipsticks to show you like the
ones that I have you know you you do get
some nice variety and just are gorgeous
gorgeous colors and then I also turned
out to really enjoy these lipsticks
which are like jumbo lip it's as you can
see they come out like that and they
kind of function like a lipstick but you
have a little more control since they're
just a little bit smaller and I just
found myself using these so much over
the course of the last year I felt I had
to throw in my favorite brush kit the
brush kit that I use more than any other
the thing that on a daily basis when I'm
getting ready for work in the morning
these are the brushes I'm using and this
is the Sigma complete kit with the brush
roll so fresh roll opens up like this
and I don't store them in here usually
but I like to travel with this because I
think it's a great protected way to
travel with your brushes but you're
getting 12 Sigma brushes find like these
space brushes absolutely love the powder
brush use that all the time also you get
a stippling brush you get a great blush
brush an angled blush brush that which I
like to actually use with the nice
sculpted face palette so that's kind of
my contour brush foundation brush
concealer brush for eye brushes in here
that I absolutely use all the time one
is a flat shadow brush it's like a the
really flat kind of shader type and then
you have one kind of that typical flat
brush to pack on the color you get a
great crease brush
pencil brush so those four are the ones
that I find myself using all the time
then you also get an angled brush you
get an angled liner brush and then a
really precision type pointed liner
brush a leathery type case here but not
real and so it just snaps shut there a
lot of people compare these two Mac
brushes I only have one tiny Mac
eyeliner brush so I can't vouch for that
but I do know that I love this set and I
use them concentrate gift and if it
doesn't just scream gift by looking at
it on the outside I mean I don't know
what does this is probably my favorite
just presentation of any of these and
this is the Mallee
more perfect palette opens up like this
what I love is that you not only get the
palette you get three brushes now I will
say that the blush brush is a little
small but the two eye brushes that you
get are also really great it's like a
nice crease brush and a smudger brush
you also get my very favorite lip color
from Ali which is blossom and that's
kind of like a liquid lipstick comes out
through the brush tip here and then
you've got the palate which as you will
see here not only includes your
eyeshadows but a few other things as
well you get a couple of blushes you get
an eye base and illuminator so kind of
like a cream highlight and then your six
shadows which are all fantastic colors
like great everyday wear type colors but
you can also get that deep dark smoky
look because you're looking at a dark
navy a black beautiful bra I've got a
fantastic taupe a light pink and kind of
like a creamy kind of buttercream type
color and then two gorgeous blushes here
as well and a nice big mirror so travel
palette absolutely what I love about
this is that this is more than just
strictly an eye kit or strictly you know
a lip product you get your lip product
but you also get all of this as well
this next one is a real big one this is
something that I bought on QVC not all
that long ago and it is the photo up
mega palette and I was going back and
forth about purchasing this but when it
was clarified to me that this is every
eyeshadow smash
box puts out in full-size in this
palette and it's they set a new
formulation I mean I figured I gotta try
it I have to at least try it and I got
it home and guys blown away blown away
by the quality of these eyeshadows so it
folds out and this is what you've got
boom if you look closely everything
split up into trios and they said that
these are the equivalent to their full
size eyeshadows that they currently have
out being sold an individual tree these
are like the way the Smashbox trios are
like this you know in those kind of
triangular shapes here they've been
reshaped into squares
but everything's they're just little
sheets that lay over you could cut them
off but I kind of like to have them
still on there so you can just fold them
back when you're using the palette but I
like to know kind of what colors I'm
using so you've got them already kind of
split up for you so you see how they
were designed to be used so you see that
trio that trio you know you have some
guidance I guess is what I'm trying to
say first thought this was just a big
palette of generic shades I was kind of
like yeah so what but then I saw how
they were all divided up and I'm like oh
this is pretty sweet and then this the
center section here this is the thing
that I'm a little concerned about and
they haven't dried out on me yet but you
are getting some cream products here
you're getting eight cream liners right
here at the top and I just have a
feeling since I don't have caps tightly
screwed on this and I'm continually
opening it up I'm a little worried about
those drying out eventually they have it
yet so that's all I could say right now
but you get brow powders a full range of
them too huge blushes three highlight
shades and four lips Shea just and over
the moon with the texture of these
shades I mean they are soft but you can
put your brush in them and they don't go
everywhere you know we've all had that
experience where you tap into something
that's like powder City well these are
all really creamy and they said that the
eyeshadows are have been reformulated in
this photo op formula
and you know I was listening to the
presentation and I was kind of thinking
oh yeah okay I hope it's as good as you
say and then I got it home and I have
had the most fun putting looks together
for this and nothing is unwearable I
mean I tell you what I look at maybe
what some of the loudest shades in here
are and I think maybe that pink I've
worn that on the news yeah I've used
that on the air and also this teal right
here over on that side I mean it's all
still super wearable stuff so you're
gonna give this to somebody and I don't
think they're gonna feel like they can't
wear anything it's all definitely usable
and here's the other thing look at what
this folds up to be I have kind of a
hard time recommending certain palette
has they are so big and they're not
portable and I think what makes a great
gift is something that's easy to use and
take with you because we're all on the
go from time to time and this is just so
travel friendly here so I mean it's the
size of like a little clutch purse
practically so I totally love this
palette I am thrilled with the texture
of each and every one of these
eyeshadows and there's not a dud in
there and I'm thrilled to be able to say
that so I definitely think this is worth
checking out
final idea here and this is just
something I'm throwing out there because
this was given to me and I thought this
was such a touching and just kind of a
really sweet gift to give and my friend
David is a makeup artist in New York and
he works for Estee Lauder and he gave me
this lipstick this is a pure color
lipstick and lavish pink it's what I'm
wearing right now and he got my name
engraved on the cab what a sweet idea I
have never thought of that maybe I'm the
only one out here that hasn't thought of
that but I think when I saw that I just
thought my name is on the lipstick you
know that's such a sweet thing and you
know then he said you know you can just
take that and if you run out of your
lipstick you can still use that cap if
you're getting the same kind of lips
lipstick is kind of a small gift but
when you do something so fantastic like
getting a name engraved on the cap you
know it just makes it so wonderful that
was so creative and
just something that the makeup lover out
there would really really find to be a
special gift so that wraps it up guys
those are some of my top gift ideas and
I know we talked about lots of high-end
makeup in this video but another thing
as I said it's still coming my drugstore
makeup gift bag and that's a very
customizable gift that you can do
whatever you want with but I'm gonna
give some suggestions for some great
drugstore products you could throw into
a little gift bag and really make a
personalized gift that you put a lot of
thought into for someone so that's great
as well it doesn't have to be a high-end
gift to be a good gift but I think a lot
of these things I've talked about will
go over real well with you or whoever's
receiving them so thanks again for
watching guys have a great day and I
will talk to you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
