be a haul from Ulta and Sephora I'll go
ahead and start with what I got from
Sephora this is the high-end stuff that
I got and I want to start out by telling
you about the Urban Decay 15th
anniversary palette it is so pretty it
comes kind of in this little velvet box
so you take that out and I'm sure alive
you have seen this but this was the
first chance I had to get access to it
so just lift off the top and then what
you have are 15 brand new shades so you
haven't seen these in any other palettes
I wore yesterday I wore the kind of the
purple and pink colors and today I went
with more neutral shades I wore flow
which is kind of a pretty peachy shade
all over the lids and I used em ia which
is a really smooth brown color kind of
in the crease and smudged it down under
and i've swatched all of these and i
think they're really gorgeous it's just
a nice selection to have because you
have so many neutrals but yet some
really pretty colors to kind of pop
things out which i picked up a couple of
small sized items that i've been getting
a lot of requests to do tutorials on and
i thought oh here i can get you know a
few smaller things not spend the full
price but learn enough about the product
to do a review or a tutorial or whatever
so i got a lot of questions about a
thing from benefit called the
Porefessional and it's like a bomb to
reduce the appearance of your pores and
I actually found it within this little
kit that's called one primed day and it
gives you three different primer type
products so you get that gal brightening
face primer you get the pore fessional
and then you get stay don't stray which
is like an eye primer so I got all these
for I think it was 15 bucks so I thought
that's a decent enough deal to get to
try some of these and then have enough
knowledge to do a review and let you
guys know what I think so yeah the the
professional has drawn a lot of requests
and also another thing that I got
mini-sized was the Urban Decay all
nighter long-lasting setting makeup
setting spray so people wanted some
compared
to this and like maybe the elf makeup
setting spray and stuff like that so
definitely going to be trying this and
letting you know how that works alta I
ended up picking up benefits they're
real mascara this is another thing that
guys I have been getting so many
requests for people want to know how
good is this mascara really so um to
show you the brush here and this isn't
going to be my review because I've only
used this twice and here you can see
with the brush it's got you know it's a
rubber brush applicator but it's got
some little bitty spikes kind of right
around the tip which really I mean
that's a small detail but it really does
help kind of get your lashes really
fanned out I think around the outside a
lot of mascaras that I'm really
impressed with right off the bat
normally you know I use them awhile I
kind of learn okay this is the way I
need to apply this one to make it look
its best but this one I really liked
right off the bat and the number one
reason why is because it is so buildable
you can put on multiple coats and you
can just see the length improving on
your lash so I will keep using it and
kind of continue to form some opinions
on it and do a review for you soon now
because I got that I went to the
checkout and I mean talk about small
size products they gave me three little
sample size things just cuz I got that
mascara I got a sample of hoola bronzer
like that and then I got a little bad
gal lash which I've tried this before
this is a pretty good mascara in my
opinion and then something I haven't
tried which I'm really excited about is
a mini Benetint
this is like a liquid tint that you can
kind of like a cheek stain you can put
it on your cheek since gives you a
really natural flush so I've heard lots
of great things about that but I had
never tried and then I have some
drugstore things to talk about first off
some things from essence this is one
thing I went ahead and tried um it's the
essence forget it
three-in-one concealer I'm always
intrigued when I see creamy
drugstore brand concealers because this
pinky salmony shade here that's
something I'm always looking for from
the drugstore because there have only
been a couple
of salmon toned concealers which that
really attacks the blue toned under-eye
circles they're only been a couple that
I've really been pleased with and they
are Bobby Brown's corrector in bisque
and benefit erase paste so when I saw
this and I saw this particular color I
thought I want to try that and it was
just a little over two dollars I think
and so I wore that today I have this on
my under eye area and I got to say it's
not the creamiest product it has a
little bit of dryness to it so that may
be a cause for concern for some people
who have a lot of crepeiness or a lot of
wrinkling under their eyes but if you're
not dealing with a lot of that but you
do have the dark circles you may be kind
of impressed with this I used a
combination like I used this for any
imperfections elsewhere around my face I
use the skin tone one but I used the
pinky peach one right in here it's
extremely brightening I was really happy
with that now there is one that has a
slight Tyler's watching the football
game in the para todo if you just heard
that but this one has a slight greenish
hue and this one is the one that I just
can't understand I mean I put it on my
face it just looks green it's supposed
to counteract redness and there's a nice
little guide on the back that tells you
what to use each one for but I just
can't make that green be workable on my
face but as far as the peach and the
other color I like that also picked up a
couple of eyeshadows single eyeshadows
from essence I haven't really tried
their single shadows before so I have
one that is in metropolitan and this
says sparkling effect so it's like a
brownish taupe very shimmery and very
pigmented and there were samples there
testers that you could see like exactly
how pigmented they really were so that
was really nice to have and then the
other one I got is a metallic effect and
it says back to khaki so the other one
is more Brown and this is kind of like a
silvery sort of a silvery greenish taupe
color just has the slightest bit of
olive to it and this one isn't quite as
rich as the other one I mean it took a
little more to get that swatch off on my
finger but looking forward to
crying goes on my eyes and essence has
little nail polishes for 99 cents so I
got a couple of those one is called date
with the night and this is I thought
this was very pretty um kind of metallic
brownish silver I think would be maybe
the best way to describe that I'm
picturing this on my toes and I'm
thinking that will be really cool and
then a lighter color that's
irreplaceable and it has some sparkle in
it and it's just kind of a light sort of
champagne beige color what's with yeah
it's quite a bit of sparkle there I ran
across this NYX 10 color eyeshadow
palette the runway collection and I
thought and this is called um Haute
model and I was just like I must have
this as soon as I saw this configuration
of colors I thought this is the modern
take on smokey eyes you know because
these are not just black smokey eyes
that you could get out of this but
beautiful green plum sapphire blue deep
bronze I just I loved the possibilities
I could see in this palette as soon as I
got it and i swatched it immediately so
you can take a look I'll show a picture
here of the swatches they all have
shimmer to them but they're all just
really pretty and I thought you know you
if you have a matte black that's what I
would say if you have a matte black or a
matte brown and use this palette I think
you are totally set for getting some
awesome smoky looks so I can't wait to
use this
oh they threw in like an oddball kind of
teal light teal shade and a light pink
but everything else kind of has that
really nice depth to it so I love that
palette so that's my whole guys thank
you so much for watching this if you're
excited to see some upcoming reviews on
some of these things let me know if
you've already tried them so I can get a
sense of what I have to look forward to
or not with some of these things but
have a wonderful day and I'll see you
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
