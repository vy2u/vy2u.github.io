today this comes from Ulta and Sephora
and a little bit of mac and a little bit
of drugstore as well so all over the
place and this just yeah start piling up
on me and I want to tell you about this
stuff first thing is something I got
from Ulta and I'm wanting to branch out
a little bit try different brands you
guys don't hear me talk about very often
and one of them is cargo I've been
wanting to try one of the cargo bronzers
they are just you know kind of raved
about they get very good ratings from
like the editors picks and different
things like that so I really wanted to
test them out and of course I ended up
gravitating toward a little kit instead
how cute is this little bag here oh my
goodness so this I believe it's called
the Los Cabos set and it came with not
only the bronzer that I wanted but some
other things as well the bronzer is not
just the regular bronzer that Cargo
makes but it's the water-resistant
bronzer and it looks like this comes in
this cute little tin and then there is
your bronzer this has a little bit of a
glow to it so I do have to be a little
bit careful when I use this I don't use
this for a lot of you know heavy
contouring or anything like that but to
kind of perk up the skintone give the
skin a little bit of a glow that's what
I use this for it is really long wearing
but I do have to be careful with it
around areas where like maybe right in
here where I can see pores a little bit
more it can make stuff like that stand
out so that may be the one downfall to
the water-resistant bronzer maybe a
matte bronzer would be good to try
eventually as well but overall I do like
it it's very pigmented and you don't
have to work at it
a lot to build up the color so that's
really cool so you get a water-resistant
blush and this is in the shade Los Cabos
so compared to this this is a little bit
smaller but look at this pretty peachy
shade so beautiful a little bit of
shimmer to that as well looking at a
peachy shade with a little bit of golden
shimmer it's reminding me a little bit
of the moms hot mama
a little more peach and a little less
gold beautiful color really love that
then the other things in this kit a
couple that I haven't tried there's the
cargo swimmable z-- eyepencil wouldn't
it be fun for you to put on all this
like water-resistant stuff and just get
in the shower and maybe show you guys
what it looks like later might be fun
but yeah
cargo swimmable z-- i pencil in charcoal
Ides on really smooth very easy to apply
but I haven't really scrutinized the
staying power too much and then there's
also the better than waterproof mascara
see what the brush is like on that okay
I don't love this style of brush with
the big gaps between I love a lot of
thick bristles because I feel like they
separate my lashes out a little bit more
but we'll see haven't tried this yet and
then there's a really pretty nude lip
gloss in Las Vegas strip so there's my
swatch of that it's kind of sheer but
it's still really pretty and it looks
really pretty topping off like a nude
lipstick so that little kit is my
introduction to cargo you'll probably be
seeing more of those products being used
in future videos coming up I got this
Maybelline duo in pink suede it says
perfect pastels and it looks like that
and this actually reminds me so much of
this duo from Clinique that is called
what's it called strawberry fudge same
thing going on here so cool when you
find little dupes like that in your
collection but I've used this recently
and it's really really pretty this pink
has a little bit of shimmer there and
then this brownish color is kind of like
a taupe brown with maybe a little bit of
pink in it it's far more interesting
than it looks just to glance at it so I
think those two colors I've been
watching red lipstick sorry about the
red stain there but a nice little duo so
I'm just curious about that then from
NYX a lot of people were telling me I
should try this HD photogenic concealer
it's the yellow shade so it's really
creamy and it has that kind of a look to
it it kind of reminds me of something I
recently blogged about from Malley
she makes sort of a I brighten err
refresher type thing that's very yellow
tone and
really brightens up the under eye area
this is something that I think I'm gonna
have fun experimenting with so that's
the swatch there I'm also kind of
preparing in the distance for possibly
an essence one brand tutorial so I
picked up a few essence things I got
this cover stick and true nude it's just
one of those classic kind of stick
concealers and it seems to be pretty
smooth in application and pretty creamy
so I haven't used this yet but we'll see
how that does coverage wise let's see if
it can cover up this little scar I have
here a scar from the oven that haunts me
hey it kind of covered that up pretty
well didn't it not too shabby
also got the I love stage eyeshadow base
and this surprised me with how dark it
is it's kind of a darker tone so if
you're a darker skin tone lining look
it's a little bit deeper than a lot of
the eye shadow primers out there and
this does kind of neutralize the lids
Aluna that blended out there it's
definitely one that will cover up
discoloration it doesn't doesn't totally
disappear I've also got an essence lip
liner this is in in the nude always
looking for a nice nude lip liner basic
I think I'm gonna get a lot of use out
of that and thank you so much for all
the recommendations for this one this is
the essence gel eyeliner in Midnight in
Paris this says high precision gel
eyeliner waterproof and this is yet to
be used by me but I'm very excited to
give that a try I've heard so many
wonderful recommendations for this and
it was pretty inexpensive I think less
than five bucks over at Sephora I ended
up finding the Kat Von D ladybird
palette didn't even think I was really
looking for this but it really caught my
eye in the store and I've done a
tutorial using this already so check
that out but this orange shade this
burnt orange is absolutely stunning
these are matte shadows the texture on
them is really rich a doze for me are
very long wearing and several of you
have recommended that I tried other Kat
Von D palettes after seeing me use this
one so thank you for the recommendations
keep them coming but this comes with a
little eyeliner as well and a brown
shade
I'm just so impressed these kind of
remind me of like the shadows in the
meat mat nude palette a little bit only
with some some other colors thrown in
but I'm really liking the only other
thing that I found at Sephora I was
looking at some of the stuff that was
marked down and I remembered seeing this
before when it wasn't on sale and it's
the outrageous Prisma chrome in
outrageous metallic tote and it's a
Sephora eyeshadows single and this shade
is unreal so pretty taupe lovers look at
this I did kind of a charcoal almost one
shadow smokey eye I just used a
different shade for my highlight but
this is SuperDuper pretty love the shine
on that is one of those shades that I
talked about you know the ability to
catch the light at times and then to
look deeper at other times and I got
this on sale for seven dollars
checked out the matte counter in awhile
and I had one thing that I really wanted
to try and it's the Select cover-up I've
got the Mac Pro Longwear concealer but I
kind of was curious about this I'd seen
some people using this one and I thought
I wonder what the difference is between
this and the Pro Longwear and I don't
think I figured out what the difference
is just yet but I got it in nw20 I have
been liking to use it to get a lot of
brightness happening right in this area
a little bit liquidy so I feel like it
kind of lends itself to really blending
out on top of larger areas so let me
know your thoughts on this like I said
I'm not a real you know Mac expert by
any means but I just wanted to try that
something I thought was really pretty
and I feel like such a goof because I
got this it's a mineralized blush and
it's from one of the limited edition
collections I don't even know what the
collection is called but the blush shade
is simmer okay I thought I was getting
eyes shadows guys am I crazy I looked at
this and I thought I was getting a
really cool eyes shadow duo kind of like
the ones Steele is doing right now where
it's like shades blended into one
another and I thought ooh that gold
looks pretty and then that burgundy
shade well I could totally use these as
eyeshadows I mean check out you know the
swatches they're they're pretty but it's
actually a blush and I didn't realize
that until
it's like looking it over in the car
after I got it I'm like oh my god when
you blend across these shades you get
just this pretty kind of rosy shimmery
color which I really like I mean I have
no problem with it as a blush but I
thought I was buying eyeshadow I wonder
if anybody else out there was fooled by
that like did you think maybe that could
be an eyeshadow I'll use it as either so
it looks like it's got an e in it too so
that was cool lastly just a couple of
newish things that I've seen in the drug
store lately finally came across the
color tattoo pure pigments you just saw
me use these actually in a get ready
with me videos so if you want to see
them like actually how they work on the
eye check that out but I have buff and
tuff which is a golden e shade so you
are getting like the little pigment
shaker their golden e okay a little bit
flaky kind of loaded with shimmer and
then the other one is called barely
brazen and this we're looking at it's
kind of like a little bit of a peachy
peachy champagne shimmer there that's on
my pinky when I found finally found the
display of these they were completely
picked over like there weren't any fun
colors left in there I mean this was
basically it this and maybe a couple
other options these two shades don't
really strike me as anything fabulous
life-changing or anything I would
repurchase they're not bad but they're
just I don't know they didn't really
knock my socks off and maybe some other
colors in the collection would but those
two are just kind of so-so L'Oreal has a
new collection of lipsticks out it's all
like fun tones of pink which you know I
love so I picked out two I got pink
flamingos and this one was I wearing
this on beauty broadcast live the one
where Tyler was there
this was the lipstick I was wearing
reminds me a lot of Milani rosehip the
color statement lipstick but gorgeous
bright pink love that and then I also
got the raspberry rush which was sort of
the most reddish looking of the
collection how about i swatched those
for you if I can find some bare skin to
do it on yeah this is definitely a
reddish pink this raspberry rush and
then I'll swatch the flamingo pink
flamingos raspberry rush pink flamingo
this reminds me a lot of the wild
watermelon lip butter from Revlon only
it's going to be a little less shiny and
then of course there's that pink they
had a lot of pretty colors in this line
so I had kind of a hard time choosing
but these two made the cut so that's my
whole yo I'm gonna spend some time
trying to wash all these crazy swatches
off my hands and fingers I hope you guys
are having a great summer thank you so
much for taking time to watch and I will
see you very soon in another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
