that's always a good time on my channel
because we like to talk about the new
stuff we picked up and in my case this
is going to be some stuff that I am so
curious about some of these things my
curiosity just got the best of me and I
thought I have to try this and give this
a review first thing that I picked up is
the studio secrets from l'oreal the one
sweep eyeshadow and this shade that I
have is let's see it's playful for all
eyes so they have like different eye
colors and then they had a couple kinds
that would work i guess for anyone and
the concept is that you're going to take
this applicator you can tell i have it
use this yet but you use that curved
kind of contoured applicator and you
sweep it across all these shadows and
like that's going to be all you have to
do for your eyeshadows so like you go
like that and then you go like that so i
am really excited to see how this works
because i will admit i'm very skeptical
and I just kind of want to know you know
will that work and and will it look good
without having to do a whole lot of
blending and contouring and stuff like
that just a couple new things from
Milani at sevilla herb this was at
walgreens actually my walgreens took
away Milani and then they brought it
back and i was so excited and that
probably resulted in me getting a couple
of things they've got something now
called the multi tasker face powder and
it says setting finishing or blotting
powder a multi-purpose face powder light
to medium coverage gives you a matte
finish without caking absorbs excess oil
and reduces shine so it's got kind of
that Milani golden type packaging there
and I haven't really used us yet but
I've just kind of felt it there and it's
got a really kind of creamy a silky
consistency to it so and then you've got
your little puff that comes underneath
so I'm hoping this is a really good
powder for on the go and just achieving
a good matt finish really quickly
without feeling the need to maybe later
on a lot of product the baked powder
blush in Rose de Oro
um that's that's the name right there if
it will come up for you so this looks
interesting this reminds me a lot of
like the Laura Geller baked products it
has that very same look to it or maybe
like a mac mineralized product um but
this kind of makes me think of peachy
gold any warm kind of tones it actually
makes me think of a nice like little
summer blush or something you got the
mirror here the brush there there was
also a mirror in this one I believe too
but yeah you can see the blush is sort
of domed there so this is really pretty
I need to try it a little more to tell
you for sure what I think of it but the
color is really nice there's a new
product from burt's bees they're doing a
tinted lip balm I know they have like
the the shimmery like lip sheer products
and stuff but they've got this tinted
lip balm and it comes in this little
like cardboard tube but this is actually
what you get so it looks like a typical
lip balm it's in like a dark brown tube
and I got the shade in pink blossom says
a hint of color that cares for your lips
one hundred percent natural and it is
really nice and smooth however the color
came off quite a bit deeper than the
outer container would imply and this is
not something you can just pry into and
check it out in the store so no shimmer
to this it's creamy it reminds me at
first of a kind of those palladio herbal
tinted lip balms but maybe not quite as
much pigmentation so once again this
isn't a review I'm just kind of giving
you an initial reaction to some of this
stuff a new nail product is from sally
hansen and it's the Vitis surge cuticle
gel haven't really tried any sort of
cuticle gel but God knows I need it
because my hands are so dry and
especially you know right in around the
nail I can use something there to really
make that seem healthy and
and just moisturize so I'm going to be
trying that when I do my nails from
Revlon I've got the Revlon Photoready
concealer this is new and I just tried
this for the first time today on my
under eyes so this is one of those stick
type concealers and it looks just like I
think they had some color stain
lipsticks and they looked like this they
had kind of that you know it's a stick
format kind of domed and contoured there
at the top but at first try I think this
feels really good it feels a lot
different from any stick concealer I've
tried that was really you know others
have been thick and creamy and you know
maybe a little hard to blend and maybe
look a little cakey on the surface of
the skin but this came off really really
smooth so I'm excited to try that more
and another new revlon product is the
luxurious color smoky crayon haven't
tried this at all the shade i got it in
with steel smoke i think they may have
had a dark brown and a black I was
picturing this as a jumbo pencil and I
think that's what it ultimately will be
but right now it's little tip has been
shaped to be a pretty precise line there
but I think you could probably lay it on
its side maybe get a wider line but
basically it's like a really deep kind
of gun metal silvery grey a couple new
products from Lancome one of them that I
talked about in my foundation update
sort of video so check that out for a
greater explanation of the taunted doll
foundation but I do like this this is a
ultimate long wearing coverage intensive
foundation and I also tried one of their
new color design pallets in coral crush
and these were new and I just thought it
looked really pretty with the colors
that were in it let me hold this up and
let it focus in these are such gorgeous
shades of taupe brown coral kind of a
light pink shade and they look really
good on I mean they're rich they're
really creamy they have just a really on
a really nice color payoff and i also
like this coral
shade for use in different ways whether
it be on the lid or kind of as a fade up
off of your maybe smokier shadow it's
nice the packaging because you do get
this nice big mirror and yeah I'm it had
a whole little manual on how to apply
where to apply which color and all that
but I don't always abide by those rules
but I that's how you get different looks
you know you change it up but um that's
new from Lancome and then finally new
product from Coastal Scents they sent me
this Mirage palette it's a new 88 color
palette and please keep in mind that
though I got this for free I still I
hold everything to the same standard as
I review it so nothing gets special
treatment in my book but this is what it
looks like and I guess it's sort of the
thought that these are tropical kind of
colors I'm not really sure but they're
ultimately a pretty wearable set of
boobs i had that sheet up here that's
what just fell down but you're getting
greens neutrals some really warm kind of
colors that make you think maybe of a
sunset some oranges it's kind of
terracotta shades and a variety of
finishes nothing I'm super sparkly I
mean you're getting some shimmer but
nothing overly metallic or sparkly about
this as in not maybe as shimmery as some
of the shades in the 88th shimmer
palette and then you have some that are
definitely met so at first glance I
haven't tried this yet but at first
glance you've got what seems to be a
pretty good blend of light medium light
and medium shades but I don't know how
much real you know really really dark
shades there are you know you've got a
few but I mean to do an ultimate you
know have that at least one or two like
super deep brown or a super deep black I
don't really see that in here but we'll
see how these colors go on I think I'm
going to like it but I will keep you
definitely posted on how that works for
me so thanks so much for tuning in for
this haul video I will keep you updated
on all these different products and how
they work and have a wonderful day see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
