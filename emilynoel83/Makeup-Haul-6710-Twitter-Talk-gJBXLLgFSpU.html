for this haul video I'm going to try to
keep it as quick as possible it's a
drugstore haul a lot of lip products in
this one I guess that's just what I've
been gravitating towards lately over the
past couple of weeks now so yeah kind of
a collective whole I've picked up these
things over the past several weeks so
that's what i'll be showing you here and
then at the end of the video i'm trying
something new i'm calling it twitter
talk and what i've done is basically
just now when i started doing this video
i sent out a tweet to my Twitter
followers and said that i'm shooting the
next video for my makeup channel now if
you have a question about makeup you
know send me the tweet and i'll try to
answer as many questions as i can at the
end of this video so it's kind of like
you know you may see your question come
up here at the end so we'll see if I get
anybody asking questions or out there's
one already so when I get done with this
hull try to keep the hall fairly quick
so I can get to some questions
afterwards so let's start off I'll start
off with an eye product that I was
really interested in when I saw it in
the store when I saw it at CVS it was
the first time I'd ever heard about it
and it's the new maybelline volume
Express mascara called the falsies here
so it's kind of a pretty purpley tube
with some turquoise riding and the brush
is kind of interesting it has a really
like it's really flexible like it's it's
got this added segment here right here
on the brush I don't know if you can see
that but it really allows it to bend and
move pretty freely and it's also got
this kind of like curved shape here if
you see that like it's relatively flat
but it's got a slight curve to it it's
not a major curve so it's pretty easy to
use and like code all your lashes but it
has on the sides as you can see some
very long bristles I feel like this
mascara gives me really good buildable
length so like if I put on a couple of
coats of this my lashes look really long
one of the claims though that it made on
the packaging which I have over here is
that it like fills in the gaps which I
thought well how is that going to work I
mean going to totally create lashes
where maybe there aren't as thick of
lashes
and I don't feel like it does that as
much I don't feel like it maybe gives
quite as much volume as i would like but
the length is pretty fantastic on this
i'll have to post a blog about this and
really take some pictures next time I
kind of freshly apply this probably have
a little more on now than i would
normally want to use just because I've
been on doing the news and you know I
like things to be a little bit more bold
on the camera there but it is
lengthening actually when I first wore
it I asked the guys that I work with I
asked them you know does it look like I
have false eyelashes on nobody said it
looked like I had false eyelashes on but
they did say my eye lashes look longer
so I don't know how close track they're
keeping but basically that was a
consensus it's really lengthening not
necessarily any more thickening than
like say a l'oreal voluminous or
something like that but um it's I'm
liking it the more I use it and I am
feeling some good length so just keep in
mind it may take a couple of coats to
really get it and apply the code slowly
I mentioned this with my lancome hypnose
when i mentioned that i think in a haul
video about how you really need to apply
these mascaras slowly so not too much
product clumps up on the lashes at one
time or you can wipe down your brush a
little bit another I product I got was
one of these elf single eyeshadows this
one's in charcoal so I found this at
target this is what it looks like it's
got kind of a little bit of a shimmer to
it it's very velvety feeling and so it's
not like black but it is like a good
deep charcoal gray with a little bit of
sparkle and it's a pretty good shadow
compared to a couple of the others which
I got and I wasn't really all that
impressed by how much color they gave
off I got a couple of the lighter shades
and I just really wasn't nuts about it
this one it could be better honestly
it's not like oh my gosh this is the
greatest charcoal gray shadow go out and
get it but it I do feel like this deeper
shade shows up better works a little
better than the others it's very soft so
if I were going to compare that to what
are the other ones i have um
wild wheat that one was not so hot and
neither was a pebble which is just sort
of this matte taupe so um yeah of the
three this one's probably the best but I
wouldn't I it's no better than say the
black or really really dark gray shade
that comes in the cover girl drama eyes
yeah that was fantastic and this isn't
quite as good as that so sorry kind of a
so-so little review they're trying a new
foundation out that was recommended to
me by my sister-in-law Sarah she is
Sarah julene on youtube if you haven't
checked out her videos she has a lot of
good ideas and just some different kinds
of videos as well she's graduated from
school would be a counselor so she's got
some interesting insight on life in
general but anyway this is Neutrogena
Healthy Skin liquid makeup I've heard of
quite a few people given some raves
about this it's an SPF 20 exclusive
antioxidant blend and basically your
skin is supposed to be this is supposed
to improve your skin kind of as you wear
it instead of thinking as your makeup if
there's a bad thing that's clogging your
pores this is supposed to be good for
you i shade is natural beige I do not
have that one on today but I have worn
it in days past and I feel like it
blends easily and I can't really come up
with anything bad to say about it it's
fairly fairly long wearing but I do need
to wear it a while just to kind of get
in tune with it and to see what else I
really think so this is something where
the review will have to be pending on
that talk about lip products first one
the one I have on right now is the elf
minty lipgloss in houston so you can
kind of see this is a really pretty
berry lip gloss with sort of some
iridescent to subtle sparkle in there
but it comes off kind of sheer but I
really really was happy with how it
looked on my lips it kind of reminded me
of the lip color that Kim Kardashian had
on on the cover of shape magazine it's
just kind of a sheer berry shade that
just came off really soft and pretty but
yet it was some color you know it wasn't
totally nude which is a little bit
different from the way I typically
see her but I really liked it now this
is really sweet like it's a sweet mint
so if you lick your lips you feel like
the cooling sensation on your lips and
then if you were to lick them it does
taste sweet so you're kind of at risk of
wanting to lick all that off but
basically it's very pretty and I really
really like this one I would really
recommend this shade for someone who
just wants that light touch of color on
their lips for summertime it's like
three bucks at target if you can find it
there or you can find it on I slipspace
calm and but I was kind of worried about
trying this since I had already tried
this one in Nashville which is really
light I mean it would appear that that
would be a gorgeous nude on your lips
but really hardly any color shows up at
all on this one just looks kind of clear
and I expect some color you know I
thought man if the color showed up on
that that would be beautiful but I think
basically with these minty lip glosses
from ELF just keep in mind that you're
probably if you want any kind of color
to show up you've got to get one that's
going to appear a little more bold in
the tube it doesn't appear quite that
crazy on my lips but it does give off
some color so go for one of the deeper
shades in the minty lip gloss I think
you'll like it if that's what you're
going for if you just want player than
the lighter shades they're going to give
you clear so another elf product I tried
which this is the only one like this
that I've tried it's the two-in-one
conditioning gloss the shade is baba
boom it's another sort of kind of a
watermelon II looking color here you can
see the gloss in the innermost sex
you've got to glosses here that
intersection is kind of like a sparkly
pinkish red and then outside of that
you've got a clear gloss and that's
supposedly the conditioning gloss the
clear stuff what doesn't really work for
me about this is going to grab a Kleenex
so I can demonstrate here when you
squeeze this I feel like I get way more
of the clear gloss than the colored for
example there I just put some on this
tissue it just looks clear where's the
color I want color you know I expect to
get at least some out of this basically
you're not going to get that perfect mix
that you would think there's a whole
other application there one hundred
percent clear let's try a third time
and oh hey there are times a charm there
is a small streak of color there but
it's I put it on my lips and it's
definitely not enough color to show up
at all on your lips and this is probably
the one of the darkest ones they sold
and as far as the texture of that gloss
it's a little thicker than say the minty
lip gloss it doesn't really have much of
a scent but it's a little thicker it
kind of feels good on the lips I guess
it gives your lips a very um I don't
know full look I guess it's not like
it's plumping them but it's kind of
decreasing the look of any lines across
there and just kind of giving you that
kind of flat you know smooth surface to
your lips so that can be nice but as far
as color I mean this is kind of a fail
on elf's part and I like a lot of stuff
but this one I just couldn't make it
work for me like why are the the other
colors not coming out it seems like kind
of a long shot to you know just be able
to squeeze it and get the best of both
worlds it seems like maybe they should
split the tube in half and like maybe
that way you would be getting you know
put half the product on one side half on
the other and then you squeeze it and
get both because this whole thing just
isn't quite working and it's got this
sort of end on it that's a little more
rigid made me think maybe if you pushed
on that to push it out from the bottom
up it would come out more even but it
really didn't do anything anything
different they're so too bad sorry um
CBS I got some stuff on sits from CBS
because it was seventy-five percent off
and that included this Milani
buzz-worthy lip gloss in be mine again
I'm gravitating toward all these berry
colors this is sort of a reddish at like
a soft rosy red shade and basically this
is a squeezy lip gloss and it's got a
pretty color looks kind of like that
almost got a little bit of a pearly
effect sent wise it has a little bit of
a slightly fruity scent and it's a
little bit sticky on the lips and put
your going to get sheer color kind of
like that okay so it's going to give you
sort of color similar to what I've got
on right now you know nothing too thick
it's not going to give you flat color
that looks like exactly like it looks on
the tube so just plan on that
being a little more of a sheer gloss but
it's still nice I mean it has a little
bit of a golden undertone if you look
really closely you can see some hints of
gold there so I like that I mean in for
the deal I got on it i mean i only paid
you know maybe just under two dollars
for it so at seventy-five percent off if
you see that i think this is a good
gloss it's going to last a long time be
aware it is a little bit thick lipstick
I love this lipstick from wet and wild
it is number 9 15 a and I do have a
shade name for once it's called moody
mauve it's one of the mega colors
lipsticks so it's got the kind of
covered cap as opposed to the clear cap
on the others and this is another kind
of berry lip product and it's got a
little bit of shimmer to it but not like
overly frosty and I think this is a
gorgeous shade really like it a lot top
it with a gloss that you feel like might
be a little bit stickier and like a
clear gloss and the look is really going
to last for you there's what it looks
like on it's got a little bit of a sheen
but it's just got that light Barry look
I really like it and this was super
cheap as well I think this may have been
marked down but moody ma good berry
lipstick shade moving into Reds Milani
has come out with something it's a
lipstick and gosh there's no label on
this anymore okay they come out with a
red lipstick that it's all the same
doesn't matter what you get it's one
shade of red lipstick but it supposedly
adjust to like your body's pH balance I
don't know I wish it came with actual
packaging around it but it just had a
little like plastic thing I got off
there but this is the lipstick right
here it comes into packaging like this
I'll put it back on so you can see kind
of cute cute little packaging there and
they'd shown in the picture on the
display like different people and the
lipstick apparently came off a little
bit differently as it justed to people's
pH or their body heat or whatever it's
being gauged on I need to do more
research on this and try this thought
would be fun to experiment and try it on
a few with different people and see if
we all about the same shade or different
shades but that's what it looks like any
right now kind of looks like a classic
red lipstick it looks pretty on me I
like it but like i said i'm going to try
this out some more and see if that's
just kind of like a you know gimmicks
that they have or if there's actually
some truth to that that this will look
different on different people so kind of
cool check that out let me know if you
tried that because that sounds kind of
cool and finally i have this lipstick in
pearly pink it's from the new maybelline
collection for summer they've got a lot
of these color sensational lipsticks
that have the lighter to bond them
because they're all kind of light and
shimmery and as I was looking through
them I thought man a lot of these look
almost exactly the same like a lot of
them just look like light frosty lip
sticks but this is the one the model had
on and so I guess I thought okay that
one looks really pretty so I'm going to
get it but it's yeah it's Pearlie
Pearlie pink 720 and so you got this
nice like light frosty pink shade and if
you see it on it's got a little bit of a
metallic look to it but if you can see
it's definitely will catch the light and
really look light and frosty I like it a
lot I would tend to take like a lip
liner that was slightly deeper pink
light semi jordana lipliner in baby
berry which is just a slightly deeper
pink and kind of put that on first and
then put a layer of this on just so I
have a little more color to about some
questions from the Twitter talk thing
let's see what people are saying over
here we've got one from um let's see uh
I'm not sure how recently this was on
here it's Jenna rink and she says hi
Emily what color are you wearing on your
nails in the wedding tutorial winter
video by the way I heard from Jessica
and she's hopefully going to test out
the tutorial soon and I think she was at
work and she was like saw that it was up
and she's going to watch it soon so yay
Jessica anyway this is the shade that's
on my nails right now it's finger paints
and looks kind of like this it's like a
light kind of cotton candy pink the
shade is shall i illustrate and this is
available at sally beauty supply so it's
just a really pale creamy pink there's
no glitter in it just very soft comes
off a little more pinky I feel like on
my nail
than it did in the container so that's
cool um let's see questions questions
somebody commenting on the makeup room
that they like that that's awesome what
are the best makeup products for the
beach I don't want a full face of makeup
but I don't want to go totally make up
less and that's from Jay neb Navarro 84
I think that's good correct
pronunciation there for the beach good
question especially for this time of
year I would typically go out if I were
going to go into the water um you know
or be subject to possibly they're thrown
into the water or near the water I would
wear a tinted moisturizer with SPF cover
girl has a good one it's covergirl
smoothers and basically to smooth that
on all over your face that way you've
got a little coverage and definitely
some sun protection on your face and
then i would probably top that off with
like a cream blush i think that would be
a nice touch because you maintain that
dewy look it's like I feel like tinted
moisturizers sometimes you know don't
make you look totally matte so let's
just go with that and go with like a
dewy cream blush I like the one from Mac
it's called Posey that I have the only
one I have from mech but there are
others the maybelline dream mousse
blushes are good for that but just
anything you like and kind of just rub
it in and you get kind of that natural
like kind of glowing from within look so
that would be great just to give your
skin a little color maybe dust on a
little bit of bronzer on top of that and
you'll have kind of a ready to go in the
Sun look as far as far as eyes I
wouldn't concentrate on doing too much
especially if i knew i was going to get
in the water because you just don't want
to mess with you no streaking mascara
but if you can find a waterproof verge
and you like covergirl LashBlast is a
good one for not smudging and I imagine
if you got that in waterproof you'd be
in pretty good shape where that's
concerned but I wouldn't concentrate too
much on the eyes you know if you wear a
lip balm get a lip balm that has an SPF
in it as well it's surprising what will
happen to your lips in the Sun and you
don't think about putting any kind of
sunscreen on but
any kind of lip balm with an SPF I mean
check out chapstick there's multiple
kinds this AOS stuff that I have oh I
probably should included this in the
hall this is the honeydew melon kind
smells fantastic i'm pretty sure this
has an SPF in it as well may want to
check me on that but um yeah keep in
mind that your lips may burn too so
that's just a few ideas for a natural
look for the beach um next thing is from
pretty in pink 006 what's your favorite
eyeshadow quad from the drugstore oh my
gosh okay I said I should have looked at
these before and this is the first time
I'm looking at these so I'm kind of
having to think off the top of my head
here gosh one of the first ones that
comes to mind has got to be the
covergirl um drama eyes I mean it's
fantastic I've talked about it a lot I
don't want to seem boring to you all but
this is great that I use this in my
first makeover winners video and I'm
used it in a couple other videos as well
I did like a two-in-one Valentine's look
I believe using this this is just great
because it gives you everything you need
you get a black you get a pretty
burgundy red which I'm a big fan of
using shades like that anyway you get a
silver a white I mean you can get a
natural look to a smokey look with this
it's and pretty much everywhere in
between it's cheap its pigmented you
just get tons of color off of that and
I've reached for that on so many
occasions there's lots of good quads but
this one is really really good so for me
to just I guess come up with that one
off the top of my head that means it's
good right i was i was able to think of
it so next one is from caddies 95
question what makeup remover would you
recommend for waterproof eye makeup i
usually wake up with black under my eyes
okay common problem they're just not
getting all the makeup off the night
before what i like to use on my eyes
pretty much on a regular basis is the
same thing i use on my face which is the
ol a daily facials cleansing cloths they
do a great job of removing even
waterproof eye makeup just keep in mind
for more resistant makeup you may have
to hold it over your I really let some
of the
I kind of sink in and bright begin to
break down the makeup before you start
trying to wipe it off you know be very
gentle your I'm area is so sensitive you
should not scrub really hard on it at
all by any means but if you're looking
for something else to get off I makeup I
like the it's from almay it's the
oil-free eye makeup remover at
neutrogena makes a good oil-free eye
makeup remover does anybody else have
any tips on anything that would be good
for removing especially resistant I
makeup if you do maybe share in the
comments section below because really
the OL a daily facials cleansing cloths
work for me no matter what so and I
guess the biggest tip I can say is just
don't scrub too hard and be patient and
sometimes you may need to soak a cotton
ball in something and just kind of hold
it there but hopefully I was able to
help with some of these questions I
think that may be all i have for now let
me just double check here on my other
page yep that's going to do it so
there's a few questions i think i'll do
this on more videos where I have the
time to just go through a few questions
I think it's fun and it's just a way to
integrate my Twitter page its
twitter.com / emilynoel83 hopefully I
can catch up with you on there and have
a wonderful day guys and thanks so much
for watching my videos I really
appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
