for this hall video I'm gonna try to
keep it as quick as possible it's a
drugstore haul a lot of lip products in
this one I guess that's just what I've
been gravitating towards lately over the
past couple of weeks now so yeah kind of
a collective whole I've picked up these
things over the past several weeks so
that's what I'll be showing you here and
then at the end of the video I'm trying
something new I'm calling it Twitter
talk and what I've done is basically
just now when I started doing this video
I sent out a tweet to my Twitter
followers and said that I'm shooting the
next video for my makeup channel now if
you have a question about makeup you
know send me the tweet and I'll try to
answer as many questions as I can at the
end of this video so it's kind of like
you know you may see your question come
up here at the end so we'll see if I get
anybody asking questions there oh
there's one already so when I get done
with this haul try to keep the hall
fairly quick so I can get to some
questions afterwards so let's start off
I'll start off with an eye product that
I was really interested in when I saw it
in the store when I saw it at CVS it was
the first time I'd ever heard about it
and it's the new Maybelline volume
express mascara called the falsies here
so it's kind of a pretty purpley tube
with some turquoise riding and the brush
is kind of interesting it has a really
like it's really flexible like it's it's
got this added segment here right here
on the brush I don't know if you can see
that but it really allows it to bend and
move pretty freely and it's also got
this kind of like curved shape here if
you see that like it's it's relatively
flat but it's got a slight curve to it
it's not a major curve so it's pretty
easy to use and like coat all your
lashes but it has on the sides as you
can see some very long bristles
I feel like this mascara gives me really
good buildable length so like if I put
on a couple of coats of this my lashes
look really long one of the claims
though that it made on the packaging
which I have over here is that it like
fills in the gaps which I thought well
how is that gonna work
I mean gonna totally create lashes where
maybe there aren't as thick of lashes
and I don't feel like it does that as
much I don't feel like it maybe gives
quite as much volume as I would like but
the length is pretty fantastic on this
I'll have supposed to blog about this
and really take some pictures
next time I kind of freshly apply this
probably have a little more on now than
I would normally want to use just
because I've been on doing the news and
you know I like things to be a little
bit more bold on the camera there but it
is lengthening actually when I first
wore it I asked the guys that I work
with I asked them you know does it look
like I have false eyelashes on nobody
said it looked like I had false
eyelashes on but they did say my
eyelashes look longer so I don't know
how close subtract they're keeping but
basically that was a consensus it's
really lengthening not necessarily
anymore thickening than life say a
L'Oreal voluminous or something like
that but um it's I'm liking it the more
I use it and I am feeling some some good
length so just keep in mind it may take
a couple of coats to really get it and
apply the coats slowly I mentioned this
with my Lancome Hypnose when I mentioned
that I think in a haul video about how
you really need to apply these mascaras
slowly so not too much product clumps up
on the lashes at one time or you can
wipe down your brush a little bit
another eye product I got was one of
these elf single eyeshadows this one's
in charcoal so I found this at Target
this is what it looks like it's got kind
of a little bit of a shimmer to it it's
very velvety feeling and so it's not
like black but it is like a good deep
charcoal grey with a little bit of
sparkle and it's a pretty good shadow
compared to a couple of the others which
I got and I wasn't really all that
impressed by how much color they gave
off I got a couple of the lighter shades
and I just really wasn't nuts about it
this one it could be better
honestly it's I'm not like oh my gosh
this is the greatest charcoal gray
shadow go out and get it but it I do
feel like this deeper shade shows up
better works a little better than the
others it's very soft so if I were going
to compare that to what are the other
ones I have wild wheat
that one was not so hot and neither was
pebble which is just sort of this matte
taupe so yeah of the three this one's
probably the best but I wouldn't I it's
no better than say the black or really
really dark gray shade that comes in the
cover girl drama eyes yeah that was
fantastic and this isn't quite as good
as that so sorry I kind of a so-so
little review there trying a new
foundation out that was recommended to
me by my sister-in-law Sarah she is
Sarah julene on YouTube if you haven't
checked out her videos she has a lot of
good ideas and just some different kinds
of videos as well she's well graduated
from school to be a counselor so she's
got some interesting insight on life in
general but anyway this is Neutrogena
Healthy Skin liquid makeup I've heard of
quite a few people given some raves
about this it's an SPF 20 exclusive
antioxidant blend and basically your
skin is supposed to be this is supposed
to improve your skin kind of as you wear
it instead of thinking it's your makeup
it's a bad thing that's clogging your
pores this is supposed to be good for
you my shade is natural beige I do not
have that one on today but I have worn
it in days past and I feel like it
blends easily and I can't really come up
with anything bad to say about it it's
fairly fairly long wearing but I do need
to wear it a while just to kind of get
in tune with it and to see what else I
really think so this is something where
the review will have to be depending on
that talked about lip products first one
the one I have on right now is the elf
minty lip gloss in Houston so you can
kind of see this is a really pretty
berry lip gloss with sort of some
iridescent subtle sparkle in there but
it comes off kind of sheer but I really
really was happy with how it looked on
my lips it kind of reminded me of the
lip color that Kim Kardashian had on on
the cover of shape magazine it was just
kind of a sheer berry shade that just
came off really soft and pretty but yet
it was some color you know it wasn't
totally nude which is a little bit
different from the way I typically see
her but I really liked it
now this is really sweet like it's a
sweet mint so
if you lick your lips you feel like the
cooling sensation on your lips and then
if you were to lick them it does taste
sweet so you're kind of at risk of
wanting to lick all that off but
basically it's very pretty and I really
really like this one I would really
recommend this shade for someone who
just wants that light touch of color on
their lips for summertime it's like
three bucks at Target if you can find it
there or you can find it on eyes lips
face comm but I was kind of worried
about trying this since I had already
tried this one in Nashville which is
really light I mean it would appear that
that would be a gorgeous nude on your
lips but really hardly any color shows
up at all on this one it just looks kind
of clear and I expect some color you
know I thought man if the color showed
up on that that would be beautiful but I
think basically with these minty lip
glosses from ELF just keep in mind that
you're probably if you want any kind of
color to show up you've got to get one
that's gonna appear a little more bold
in the tube it doesn't appear quite that
crazy on my lips but it does give off
some color so go for one of the deeper
shades and the minty lip gloss I think
you'll like it if that's what you're
going for if you just want clear then
the lighter shades are gonna give you
clear so another elf product I tried
which this is the only one like this
that I've tried it's the two-in-one
conditioning gloss the shade is vah vah
boom it's another sort of kind of a
watermelon ii looking color here you can
see the gloss in the innermost section
you've got two glosses here that
intersection is kind of like a sparkly
pinkish red and then outside of that
you've got a clear gloss and that's
supposedly the conditioning gloss the
clear stuff what doesn't really work for
me about this is gonna grab a Kleenex so
I can demonstrate here when you squeeze
this I feel like I get way more of the
clear gloss than the colored for example
there I just put some on this tissue
it just looks clear where's the color I
want color you know I expect to get at
least some out of this basically you're
not gonna get that perfect mix that you
would think there's a whole other
application there 100 percent clear
let's try a third time oh hey there are
times a charm there is a small streak of
color there but it's
my lips and it's definitely not enough
color to show up at all on your lips and
this is probably the one of the darkest
ones they sold as far as the texture of
that gloss it's a little thicker than
say the minty lip gloss it doesn't
really have much of a scent but it's a
little thicker it kind of feels good on
the lips I guess it gives your lips a
very I don't know full look I guess it's
not like it's plumping them but it's
kind of decreasing the look of any lines
across there and just kind of giving you
that kind of flat you know smooth
surface to your lips so that can be nice
but as far as color I mean this is kind
of a fail on elfs part and I like a lot
of elf stuff but this one I just
couldn't make it work for me like why
are the the other colors not coming out
it seems like kind of a long shot to you
know just be able to squeeze it and get
the best of both worlds it seems like
maybe they should split the tube in half
and like maybe that way you would be
getting you know put half the product on
one side half on the other and then you
squeeze it and you get both because this
whole thing just isn't quite working and
it's got this sort of end on it that's a
little more rigid made me think maybe if
you pushed on that to push it out from
the bottom up it would come out more
even but it really didn't do anything
anything different there so too bad
sorry
cBS I got some stuff once it's from CBS
because it was 75% off and that included
this Milani buzz worthy lip gloss and be
mine again I'm gravitating toward all
these berry colors this is sort of a
reddish at like a soft rosy red shade
and basically this is a squeezy lip
gloss it's got a pretty color it looks
kind of like that almost got a little
bit of a pearly effect scent wise it has
a little bit of a slightly fruity scent
and it's a little bit sticky on the lips
and put you're going to get sheer color
kind of like that okay so it's gonna
give you sort of color similar to what
I've got on right now you know nothing
too thick it's not going to give you
flat color that looks like exactly like
it looks on the tube so just plan on
that being a little more of a sheer
gloss but it's still nice I mean it has
a little bit of a golden undertone if
you look really closely you can see some
hints of gold there so I like that I
mean and for the deal I got on it I mean
I only paid you know maybe just under
two dollars for it so at 75% off if you
see that I think this is a good gloss
it's gonna last a long time be aware it
is a little bit thick lipstick I love
this lipstick from wet and wild it is
number 915 a and I do have a shade name
for once
it's called moody mauve it's one of the
mega colors lipsticks so it's got the
kind of covered cap as opposed to the
clear cap on the others and this is
another kind of berry lip product and
it's got a little bit of shimmer to it
but not like overly frosty and I think
this is a gorgeous shade really liked it
a lot
top it with a gloss that you feel like
might be a little bit stickier and like
a clear gloss and the look is really
gonna last for you there's what it looks
like on it's got a little bit of a sheen
but it's just got that light berry look
I really like it and this was super
cheap as well I think this may have been
marked down but moody mauve good berry
lipstick shade moving into Reds Milani
has come out with something it's a
lipstick and gosh there's no label on
this anymore okay they come out with a
red lipstick that it's all the same
doesn't matter what you get it's one
shade of red lipstick but it supposedly
adjusts to like your body's pH balance I
don't know I wish it came with actual
packaging around it but it just had a
little like plastic thing I got off
there but this is the lipstick right
here it comes in a packaging like this
I'll put it back on so you can see kind
of cute cute little packaging there and
it showed in the picture on the display
like different people and the lipstick
apparently came off a little bit
differently as it just stood two peoples
ph or their body heat or whatever it's
being gauged on I need to do more
research on this and try this thought it
would be fun to experiment and try it on
a few of different people and see if we
all about the same shade or different
shades but that's what it looks like
anyway right now kind of look
like a classic red lipstick it looks
pretty on me I like it but like I said
I'm gonna try this out some more and see
if that's just kind of like a you know
gimmick that they have or if there's
actually some truth to that that this
will look different on different people
so kind of cool check that out let me
know if you tried that because that
sounds kind of cool and finally I have
this lipstick in pearly pink it's from
the new Maybelline collection for summer
they've got a lot of these color
sensational lipsticks that have the
lighter tube on them because they're all
kind of light and shimmery and as I was
looking through them I thought man a lot
of these look almost exactly the same
like a lot of them just look like light
frosty lipsticks but this is the one the
model had on and so I guess I thought
okay that one looks really pretty so I'm
going to get it but it's yeah it's
pearly pearly pink 7:20 and so you got
this nice like light frosty pink shade
and if you see it on it's got a little
bit of a metallic look to it but if you
can see it's definitely will catch the
light and really look light and frosty I
like it a lot I would tend to take like
a lip liner that was slightly deeper
pink light semi Jordana lip liner and
baby berry which is just a slightly
deeper pink and kind of put that on
first and then put a layer of this on
just so I have a little more color talk
about some questions from the Twitter
talk thing let's see what people are
saying over here we've got one from
let's see I'm not sure how recently this
was on here it's Jenna rink
and she says hi Emily what color are you
wearing on your nails in the wedding
tutorial winter video by the way I heard
from Jessica and she's hopefully gonna
test out the tutorial soon I think she
was at work and she was like saw that it
was up and she's gonna watch it soon so
yeah Jessica anyway this is the shade
that's on my nails right now it's finger
paints and looks kind of like this it's
like a light kind of cotton candy pink
the shade is shall i illustrate and this
is available at Sally Beauty Supply so
it's just a really pale creamy pink
there's no glitter in it just very soft
comes off a little more pinky I feel
like on my nail
than it did in the container so that's
cool um let's see questions questions
somebody commenting on the make up room
that they like that that's awesome what
are the best makeup products for the
beach I don't want a full face of makeup
but I don't want to go totally makeup
less and that's from je n'aime Navarro
84 I think that's good corrected
pronunciation there for the beach good
question especially for this time of
year I would typically go out if I were
gonna go into the water
um you know or be subject to possibly
they're thrown into the water or near
the water I would wear a tinted
moisturizer with SPF covergirl has a
good one it's covergirl smoothers and
basically just smooth that on all over
your face that way you've got a little
coverage and definitely some sun
protection on your face and then I would
probably top that off with like a cream
blush I think that would be a nice touch
because you maintain that dewy look it's
like I feel like tinted moisturizers
sometimes you know don't make you look
totally matte so let's just go with that
and go with like a dewy cream blush I
like the one from Mac it's called Posie
that I have the only one I have from Mac
but there are others the Maybelline
Dream mousse blushes are good for that
but just anything you like and kind of
just rub it in and you get kind of that
natural like kind of glowing from within
look so that would be great just to give
your skin a little color maybe dust on a
little bit of bronzer on top of that and
you'll have kind of a ready to go in the
Sun look as far as far as eyes I
wouldn't concentrate on doing too much
especially if I knew I was gonna get in
the water because you just don't want to
mess with you no streaking mascara but
if you can find a waterproof version you
like covergirl LashBlast is a good one
for not smudging and I imagine if you
got that in waterproof you'd be in
pretty good shape where that's concerned
but I wouldn't concentrate too much on
the eyes you know if you wear a lip balm
get a lip balm that has an SPF in it as
well it's surprising what will happen to
your lips in the Sun and you don't think
about putting any kind of sunscreen on
but
any kind of lip balm with an SPF I mean
check out chapstick there's multiple
kinds this AOS stuff that I have oh I
probably should include this in the haul
this is the honeydew melon kind smells
fantastic I'm pretty sure this has an
SPF in it as well may want to check me
on that but yeah keep in mind that your
lips may burn too so that's just a few
ideas for a natural look for the beach
um next thing is from pretty in pink
0:06 what's your favorite eyeshadow quad
from the drugstore oh my gosh okay I
should I should have looked at these
before and this is the first time I'm
looking at these so I'm kind of having
to think off the top of my head here
gosh one of the first ones that comes to
mind has got to be the cover girl drama
eyes I mean it's fantastic I've talked
about it a lot I don't want to seem
boring to you all but this is great that
I use this in my first makeover winters
video and I've used it in a couple other
videos as well I did like a two in one
Valentine's look I believe using this
this is just great because it gives you
everything you need you get a black you
get a pretty burgundy red which I'm a
big fan of using shades like that anyway
you get a silver a white I mean you can
get a natural look to a smoky look with
this it's and pretty much everywhere in
between it's cheap its pigmented you
just get tons of color off of that and
I've reached for that on so many
occasions there's lots of good quads but
this one is really really good so for me
to just I guess come up with that one
off the top of my head that means it's
good right I was I was able to think of
it so next one is from caddies 95
question what makeup remover would you
recommend for waterproof eye makeup I
usually wake up with black under my eyes
okay common problem they're just not
getting all the makeup off the night
before what I like to use on my eyes
pretty much on a regular basis is the
same thing I use on my face which is the
Olay daily facial cleansing cloths
they do a great job of removing even
waterproof eye makeup just keep in mind
for more resistant makeup you may have
to hold it over your eye really let some
of the
that kind of sink in and bright begin to
break down the makeup before you start
trying to wipe it off you know be very
gentle your I'm area is so sensitive
you should not scrub really hard on it
at all by any means but if you're
looking for something else that's to get
off I makeup I like the it's from Almay
it's the oil-free eye makeup remover at
Neutrogena makes a good oil-free eye
makeup remover does anybody else have
any tips on anything that would be good
for removing especially resistant eye
makeup if you do maybe share in the
comments section below because really
the Olay daily facials cleansing cloths
work for me no matter what so I guess
the biggest tip I can say is just don't
scrub too hard and be patient and
sometimes you may need to soak the
cotton ball in something and just kind
of hold it there but hopefully I was
able to help with some of these
questions I think that maybe all I have
for now let me just double check here on
my other page yep that's gonna do it so
there's a few questions I think I'll do
this on more videos where I have the
time to just go through a few questions
I think it's fun and it's just a way to
integrate my Twitter page it's
twitter.com slash Emily Noel 83
hopefully I can catch up with you on
there and have a wonderful day guys and
thanks so much for watching my videos I
really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
