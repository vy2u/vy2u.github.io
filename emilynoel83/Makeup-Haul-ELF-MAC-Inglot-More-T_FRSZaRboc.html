video I know a lot of times I start off
a hollow by saying this is gonna be a
quick little Hall on blah blah blah but
that is not the case here at all this is
going to be a pretty big hall because
I've got an elf order to talk about so
there are a lot of different products
there this is a nice chance halls in
general I think are a good chance to
pass along like little reviews on things
so it is game day for the st. Louis Rams
so I'm wearing my little Rams Jersey I
got this from TJ Maxx for like seven
dollars and it's like a real like Jersey
stun it's cute it's got like little
little rhinestones on it and everything
so I thought I'm gonna wear that today
it's gonna start off with the Mac stuff
because I've just got a few little
things here the first is the mac
prolongwear concealer I love the
foundation a lot and so I was really
curious about whether and I would like
the concealer so far I'm liking it a lot
I'm actually just wearing kind of a
tinted moisturizer type product this and
some powder today for like my face
makeup and it's in a shade nw20 this is
pretty much perfect for my under eye
area it's a little lighter than what I
might wear all over my face but it's
just right for the under eye it's got a
little pump it's a nice little glass
container here so really really amazing
coverage I think I also wanted to try
out like a cream contouring product
because a lot of times I contour with
powders so I thought especially since
you know I've got that great little elf
brush this the mini there the small
stippling brush that I talked about in
my last video I thought you know maybe
it'd be nice to try out a cream contour
and so I was looking around the Mac
website and they have one called pro
sculpting cream in pure sculpture and so
it's just kind of like this cream that's
probably quite a few shades darker than
my natural skin tone and you can kind of
blend that in it's in the same kind of
packaging same size it's like a cream
blush from Mac so I thought that might
be fun to experiment with and just see
if I can kind of get a method that works
for exam and something I really did not
need that much but I just wanted to try
it out I love the cream machine formula
for their lipsticks so I thought I'd try
this shade called cream in your coffee
it's kind of like a
ROS type color it's still a little
neutral it looks like this it has a
little bit of a berry look to it but
it's not heavy on the pink side I guess
is what I want to say the drugstore I
wanted to let you guys know and I kept
the packaging so you can see like what
to look for but Baby Lips from
Maybelline these are like their little
tinted lip balms that are really smooth
and moisturizing very easy to put on as
well but they've come out with some
limited edition shades and they're
packaged in like two packs I found mine
at Walgreens and this one has a limited
edition coral shade right here it's
called coral crush and then twinkle
which seems to it's kind of just like a
sheer maybe a little bit shimmery shade
and then I think they had another
package that had one of the regular line
colors in with maybe like a strawberry
looking shade but this is the one I
picked up because both were new colors
and they just had these out in Walgreens
in like a special display so if you like
the Baby Lips like I do you might want
to check that out also picked up one of
the Maybelline eye studio quads because
I love these so much and this one just
really made me think of fall and
something I would like to do a tutorial
with I posted a picture on Instagram of
me wearing this quad and it was just a
really nice metallic kind of bronzy look
this quad is called copper chic and this
is part of the regular line but the
shades are so just you know I've talked
i've raved about these kinds of shadows
before but they're very pigmented
very bold if you like metallic looks
kind of glowy eye looks a neutral look
but something that's a little bit more
because these are so shiny and they do a
tutorial with that if you guys want to
see it it would be very easy and basic
but I still think it would be fun then
really intrigued by this super super
sense
super stay 10 hour stain gloss and this
shade is called berry heavenly I really
couldn't understand how this was
supposed to work to be a gloss and a
stain but it comes out like that and
this particular shade looks a whole lot
like like Benetint you know that very
sort of stain and it goes on and I've
worn this just once and it does seem to
have like a little more moisture like
Benetint and some other liquid stains
get completely dry
but this one kept a little bit of a
shine but it also did stain so I'm gonna
have to use this some more to see what I
think but I think it's a gorgeous color
Walmart on hard candy has some new stuff
I've gotten tons of questions on these
these are the new 10 color top 10 i
shadow collections what they're called I
picked up two of these and I think they
had maybe three other shades like a blue
kit and maybe a greenish kit I'm not I
don't quite remember where they've got
really cute packaging it's like lace
right here and then you've got your ten
shadows on the inside comes with a
couple of applicators here and then
there's your shadows in both of my
palettes pretty much all the shadows are
yeah totally shimmery finish
I like this neutral palette I think the
shades are great it would be nice if
there were some matte ones in there but
the main issue is I don't feel like
these pack that much of a punch I've
used this you can get a you know a
decent look with it but compared to the
hard candy baked duo's like these I
think these are so much better quality
in terms of pigment you know we're wet
and dry they they look great these are a
little bit more hit and miss within the
10 color palette some of them I find
like when i swatched them they're
they're kind of flaky this one's called
naturally gorgeous if you're interested
in that as you can see lots of shimmery
metallic colors and then the other one
that I have in the purples is called
smoked out and this one I have not yet
used on my eyes I just swatch is found
with swatching them that some of the
shades are nice and then some of the
shades are a little bit flaky another
drugstore find it's a CC cream guys do
you know they went from BB creams do now
CC creams but it's from Olay
and it's the seven in one tone
correcting UV moisturizers so it looks
like this it's got a pump and it's kind
of like swirled with your tinted
moisturizer and then your I guess added
skincare benefits but I use this today
along with the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer it's not that much coverage
it's really sheer very sheer product on
the skin feels like a tinted moisturizer
actually like the texture of this quite
a bit though it's a good
level of moisture for me even as we get
into the time of year where my skin gets
a little more dry actually felt really
good Total Effects fights seven signs of
aging fine lines and wrinkles uneven
skin tone so if you've got issues with
that I thought that was cool age spots
gentle exfoliation helps with dryness
strengthens skins moisture barrier and
recaptures youthful luminosity so it
does after you put it on give your skin
a really nice looking glow so this is
only the second time I've applied this
and I'm kind of excited to see if I do
notice actual skincare benefits from it
I know in terms of coverage it's super
lightweight if you've got a lot of
things to cover up you want a concealer
but I hope to see that maybe over time
just skin care wise this is going to
improve certain things about my skill
has gotten a lot of new things they may
even have some newer things since I did
this haul but I just wanted to go
through and show you what I have there
are some things that I'm prepared to
kind of give you a little review
feedback on and other things that I
don't know so much about just yet first
thing is the baked eyeshadow palette
this is a pretty good-sized little
palette here my shade is called NYC nice
quality on the packaging and a really
nice big mirror here as well and then
what you're getting are these little
domes of color you're getting ten colors
in there as you can see you've got some
light shades like pink and sort of a
champagne color and golden ii shades
white shades silver and the bottom
you've got kind of a couple almost
repeat shades these two are pretty close
to the black and the charcoal dark brown
another really deep almost black color
and a navy blue I'm wearing these on my
eyes today and I wore them with like a
creamy eyeshadow base and I really think
that's necessary if you choose to wear
these dry and I haven't tried wearing
them wet yet but if you wear them dry
like they're they're kind of flaky like
that all the swatches it is they're
really kind of a powdery type schedge it
is I took like this shade right here and
I use the blue and a little bit of one
of these deeper colors and that's kind
of the eye look that I have now it's not
very intense I guess on the top of the
baked shadows I need to go back to hard
candy you know they I feel like have a
really nice quality baked shadow that
you can wear dry feel
like it's really pigmented or where it
went and kick it up a notch with these
warm dry I wasn't super impressed trying
out the flirty lash collection I
actually have the half lashes on here on
the outer part of my eyes so it comes
with a full strip of lashes a half strip
that I'm wearing the glue and tweezers I
know I don't really like the elf lash
glue so I didn't use that but as you can
see these are kind of like those a
little bit spiky sort of lashes say
they're really straight and the band is
not very flexible and that's really
important when you're using the half
strip of lashes to have a fan that's
going to lay down for you and be
flexible enough to curve with the eye oh
these were kind of difficult to work
with the effect is not bad the finished
product here but it's just kind of
tricky so pick up some of the elf High
Definition powder in the corrective
yellow tone so I thought this might be a
neat thing to try maybe to set the
under-eye area that's what I did today
here's without spilling it out maybe I
can show you you can see it's actually
you know pretty yellow and it's got that
same kind of texture like the Make Up
For Ever HD setting powder same texture
really as the other elf HD powder has
just got a more yellowish tone still
super sheer I used it to set my under
eye area today and it I mean it doesn't
seem like it adds any added weight or a
real powdery of appearance so this may
be a good thing to keep using to set my
under eye concealer if I'm looking for
something really light and not needing
to add much coverage your shades in the
contouring blush and bronzer one is
called Antiqua and this one is a really
bright pink and a dark brown and the
brown is not completely matte but it's
still something I feel like I can
contour when it's just deep enough to
give the right effect and it's not ultra
ultra shimmery a lot of sparkle in that
blush though I love the color I just
wish there wasn't so much glitter
because I mean that glitter really does
show up on your cheeks so that's kind of
like a little bit disappointing there
because I thought they had a good thing
going with that color combo the other
one I have is Turks and Caicos
and this one is again a deep brown and
this shade is actually kind of deceiving
it's got a little bit of gold and
shimmer but it goes on much darker than
you would think
like I don't know how to describe it
here it'll show up in a swatch it's
actually a pretty bold color so you've
got to be prepared for that like I
thought this was gonna be like a little
nothing shade on my cheeks but it's
actually like a deep neutral like dusty
rose type color so be aware that a
little bit will go a long way with that
even though for some reason it just
doesn't look as intense in the packaging
usually the other way around but it's
watches and it wears with a little more
color so I do like that one yeah I got
this mascara from the studio line three
and one mascara lengthened define and
volume eyes this has the same kind of
brush as like benefits they're real it's
got that end that has little spiky ends
that you can use in different ways it's
all a rubber brush I use this today um
actually I don't hate it
I haven't had good luck with like any
elf mascaras and this one I actually do
like this brush that they've got going
on the formula seems a little wet at
this point I think as I continue to use
it you know it might dry out just a bit
and be a little bit more separating but
I do like the brush a lot and I think
this is a mascara I could enjoy with
continued use and just kind of figuring
out you know each mascara has its own
way I feel like to use it and use it
most effectively like whether it's
waiting a little longer between coats or
just the way you wiggle it on I mean I
feel like every mascara has its own
little technique that goes along with it
so this is one that I think has
potential I know I asked a few weeks ago
about Inglot this is a brand I've heard
people rave about and I can't believe
I'm just now trying it but a lot of you
suggested you know to go with some eye
shadows eyeliner and then I just wanted
to try a random lip product myself but I
got the freedom system palette and it's
so cool these little tops are like
magnetized and used take that off and
there's your panel if you see all my
colors I think I'm going to do a blog
post about what exactly the different
shade
our that I have and some swatches but
all I can say is while these are super
rich nice quality buttery feeling color
I kind of just jumped in and and
randomly started picking colors I mean I
didn't think it was gonna really turn
out as nicely as this with having these
shades up top and then these kind of
warmer shades down at the bottom I
didn't know that was gonna be quite so
bright on that peach shade but it's nice
you know and these colors like the the
matte black and the matte brown are
great to have I got kind of a sparkly
color down here some purple tones that
are ultra ultra shimmery love a good
cranberry red color can top these out
and put in new shades so it's always
cool when you can totally customize your
kids do something on my blog showing you
more about those and then I also got one
of these liners if the eyeliner gel
matte 83 I wanted something other than
black and this is like a true gorgeous
looking royal blue which I thought would
be fun to play with and I've used this a
few times and it goes on so smooth like
so easy to apply
I got a lipstick this is 62 um I don't
know if that means anything to you
they have like a berry color with
shimmer it looks like this it's really I
mean the color intensity is nice it's
just a pretty berry with some Sheen
that's the whole everybody I hope you
enjoyed it I hope this gave you a little
insight on some new products or just
some things that I'm going to be working
with thank you so much for watching and
have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
