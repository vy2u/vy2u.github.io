for this hull I know everybody likes
hulls I feel like I just did a haul but
it was for t.j.maxx not makeup so that
totally doesn't count first off I've got
the lorac Pro palette I got this at Ulta
and it's just a gorgeous palette of half
man/half shimmer shades all neutrals but
I mean some sort of colorful shades in
there in the mix and I actually used it
for this tutorial all matte it's a great
palette I'm gonna probably do more on
this either in a blog review or a video
refined like the color selection there
is some fallout with the shades but if
you tap off your brush tap off the
excess product you will be in pretty
good shape for the eye look which turns
out to be very pigmented very blendable
and just fun to use so and that also
comes with a little primer as well at
behind the scenes eye primer from lorac
only things from bare minerals I was
looking for sort of a finishing touch
type powder before I went on my trip and
I didn't want to travel with any loose
powder really I just thought that could
be a real mess I don't want something to
break it goes all over so um I got this
bare minerals touch-up veil so it's like
their mineral veil only pressed and it's
in the tinted version so it gives you
instead of just you know white powder it
gives you a little bit of coverage but
it looks like this oops
comes with a little sponge and this is
the product here so as you can see it's
not totally white it's kind of like a
beige color and it just makes a nice
little touch-up prior I also have this
of course in the non tinted version if
you're interested in that but I'm liking
it so far it was handy for the trip and
I'm using it now just kind of as a purse
powder so I dig that for sure I also got
this bareMinerals
stroke of light eye brightener I
actually got this in the lightest shade
because I noticed it had a pinky tone
this one this one called a luminous one
and I think that that is really good for
just brightening the under-eye area in
terms of being a concealer I mean this
does not have a lot of coverage to it
but it does really brighten nicely and I
find that I'm using it on other parts of
the face like maybe down the No
because it is so light like I wanted it
to practically function like a cream
highlight for me without having shimmer
so that's kind of the interesting thing
with this it does not have shimmer or
sparkle but it does just by the nature
of its tone brighten so I do enjoy that
but just keep in mind it's not really
going to be something for heavy-duty
high coverage concealer I have a couple
of new Revlon lipsticks I was just
looking for some nice shades for fall
something a little bit brighter or
deeper or just something more colorful
because I like really you know amping up
the lips and so this is Revlon Super
Lustrous lip gloss lipstick in cherries
and the snow so many of you told me
after my favorite Revlon lip products
video that I needed to get this and it
is just an iconic color in the
collection I'm surprised I didn't have
it but as you can see it's actually got
a lot of pink to it I thought it was
going to be more of like a pure red but
and it looks kind of red here in the
tube but it definitely has some sort of
a a pink tone to it as well so kind of
like a reddish berry cuz I haven't worn
out my lips yet but I like what I'm
seeing there in the swatch and then I
got this shade in black cherry another
Super Lustrous lipstick and you're
probably thinking whoa what's going on
there I was wearing this in an Instagram
picture that I posted it's really just a
nice deep berry color as you can see I
mean in any of these you can sheer them
out a little bit with your finger and
apply them and make them look a little
more sheer but you know it's got a range
of you know ways this kind of a dark
color can look but I think it's very
pretty this lipstick from L'Oreal and
it's called spiced cider and from the
looks of it I thought that's a pretty
shade kind of a brick red I'm not in
love with it on the lips to be honest I
feel like it comes off a little more
Brown than I expected I wanted more red
and less Brown and it's kind of like a
brownie tone so if you want that if you
want like a brownish brick red that's
kind of what this is I just expected a
little more red in there alright there's
a new Maybelline mascara as it seems
like they come out non-stop with a new
mascara and it's the colossal volume
Express cat
version so it's got the little animal
print there and I of course had to see
you know is this amazing and right now
I'm thinking not it's a curved brush
mascara really short bristles and one
thing that I find is when I pull it out
of the tube it really seems to pull a
lot of the product awful things I wasn't
super impressed with was the fact that
it wasn't very lengthening and it didn't
thicken very much either even after a
couple of coats I wasn't thrilled but
I've only had this for like a week so I
need to use it some more to be able to
tell you for sure so look for like maybe
an updated blog review or a Facebook or
a Twitter post about this but right now
I'm kind of on the fence about Yale has
come out with their limited edition
Project Runway stuff and it includes
like eyeshadow quads and also what else
was there
lip glosses lipsticks blushes too and
there was really only one eyeshadow quad
that kind of appealed to me as being
something different and it's called the
muses gaze they look like this by the
way and this one has kind of some fun
colors it's got a gold a teal blue a
coral and a really dark greenish blue
use this yet but the swatches are not
impressing here's what they look like
look how sheer look at there's the blue
if you can see it the gold the peach
that shades kind of pretty but goodness
I mean another new collection in
drugstores is the wet and wild Fergie
stuff I instagrammed a picture that I
just took in the store of the full
display but there are three of these and
they're little box sets of a full eye
look and so there's one that I got that
has sort of the black and the gold and
silver another one had just straight-up
neutral smoky dark colors like black and
dark taupe and stuff that I already had
a lot of and then the other one has I
think it was silver and white and then
maybe like a blue and a purple so the
brighter one
and you open it up and what you have is
first off on this side a guide of how to
get the look and then you've got in the
box here if I could see all the products
involved so it's the eyeshadow quad a
mini mega length mascara a mini mega
eyes eyeliner which I do like the liquid
liner a pencil liner in a color a brush
and a brow comb so real quickly I know I
like mega liner this one that comes in
this kit has some glittery flecks in it
which is kind of cool the mega length
mascara doesn't blow my socks off I
don't love it the pencil these pencils
can be good they're not exactly the most
long-wearing things in the world but
they can go on kind of smooth and be
pretty colors I'm having trouble popping
this one out but it is like a golden
bronze eyeshadow brush is a duds McGee
right here let me show you it is just a
blunt cut brush kind of soft but not a
lot of bristles packed in there I don't
think it's going to be real good but
this little some of this stuff just
doesn't want to pop out for me but this
brow brush I mean you can definitely use
that
those are real handy to have you know in
a purse or in with your brushes it's got
a little comb for your lashes and a
little brush for your brows now the
shadows uh I wish they were better I
wish I could say these small in line
with all the other wet and wild products
we know and love but they're just the
lighter shades seem kind of chalky to me
and the only one that has a really nice
quality is the black so I swatch these
in the most Awkward place on my hand but
here's what you get and the Silver's not
too bad the yellow the thing is in the
pictures they show the yellow really
like popping in this look and it's
really just I kind of wish they gave a
more metallic gold but it's kind of like
just a so-so yellow and then the white
is you know okay but the black is really
nice and you can see the glitter and it
to spy the swatches that's my assessment
of
so I don't know I don't know how the
other pallets are I only have this one
but I'm kind of soso on that unless I
get my hands cleaned off here I
mentioned that I had run out of my malli
perfect prep primer I got it but I kind
of got it in a set of three other things
so now I have this big size of my
perfect prep primer which is great which
is like in case you didn't see that
video I described it as being just a
really luxurious primer it's kind of
like whipped cream is what it looks
feels so like silky smooth it just
blends right into the skin it feels
really lightweight yet you totally feel
like you have a nice barrier there kind
of locking in your moisturizer and
helping your foundation go on more
smoothly so loving that primer and glad
I've got that back but what came in this
sit in this kit were a couple of other
things and they are a perfect prep
primer for eyes and think of us more as
a skin care step than it actually been a
literal eye primer like urban decay or
two-faced this is something and they
give you a little brush to apply it with
it's like the texture of the face primer
only maybe even a little bit rich or you
just put it on with the brush I go under
my eye I go over my eye on the lid
wherever and it just makes everything so
feel so nice and so smooth that I just
feel like you know the better you can
make your canvas for your makeup you
know the better everything will look and
then there's this perfect prep IGEL
which was what I really really wanted to
try and it comes with this cool little
guy here and it's so cooling I think
this is like a stainless steel little
applicator here basically dip it into
this gel is apparently loaded with
anti-aging ingredients and peptides and
whatnot and you just run this around
your eye area and I tell you the deep
puffing that this does I mean I need
that in the early morning hours when I'm
getting ready so basically now the order
I'm going how I've integrated this stuff
into my skincare or my pre makeup
routine is using this eye gel and kind
of go around my eye area deep Huff's it
kind of soothes the area feels really
nice
then I moisturize all over then using my
Olay complete for combo to oily skin
then I do this
step this perfect prep eye primer kind
of locking in the moisture then I do my
primer all over my face and then I'm on
to foundation so works really well I'm
liking it so funny that wraps up this
whole kind of a wide variety of things
from a big span of time here so I hope
you enjoyed it and I hope you're all
having a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
