this is a video I've been looking
forward to doing for quite some time
I've just been compiling products that I
put into this category makeup I've
changed my mind about because some of
this stuff is for the better like I
didn't really like it at first but after
using it or figuring out some little
trick to using it I've changed my mind
or some things that I really liked at
one time but don't like as much anything
I think it is kind of natural to change
your mind on things from time to time
because I'm the type of person to like
even if it's something maybe I
originally didn't give a great review on
or something I'll still kind of keep it
around and mess with it from time to
time and see if I can work it in in a
better way and really try not to just
completely write something off and check
it and then you know forget about it
forever but the things that you did
really like I think it's important to
keep reevaluating it and comparing it to
the newer stuff that's come out and it's
like do I still really like that so much
so this is kind of a big update video
some of these things I have talked about
in specific reviews some things you
maybe haven't even really seen me touch
on very much just thing I want to talk
about which I don't think I have
reviewed yet is from Physicians Formula
and it's the mineral where talc free
mineral oh so radiant powder give it
close look and maybe I'll try to find
like an original like online picture of
this so you can see how it started but
all of these little circles actually had
a very metallic pearly shimmer on them
you can see a little bit of some
remnants right so it would make you
think okay this is supposed to be like
an intense highlighting powder that is
just an over spray those over sprays
really annoy me I think it completely
changes a product I mean it doesn't make
sense that something's going to start
one way and then perform totally
differently once you just you know work
off the top layer of product so I'm
still not happy that this product had
that but I must say once I did go ahead
and like kind of rub some of that off
and work through it I do quite enjoy the
powder that is underneath this in the
shade creamy natural this does have an
SPF 20 in it which I like
itself really has a nice texture to it
has a little bit of coverage it's not
entirely matte I think it has a really
great natural skin like finish a lot of
times I feel like I want to use you know
my fuller coverage foundations I love my
Estee Lauder Double Wear the Double Wear
max coverage and today I'm wearing what
is it the Revlon Colorstay whipped which
I think has really good cover so in
situations like that I don't necessarily
need a heavy powder on top but maybe
just a little something to set I gotta
say this has been nice for that now that
that shimmery overspray has worn off but
what's up with that why create something
that's going to just be totally
different eventually another thing that
I did a specific review on very early on
on my Express channel which is about a
year old right now I can't believe that
channels like my other baby you know
before the real baby comes and of course
in addition to cupcake yet but I
reviewed the rocket or very early on on
that channel this is one of those
benefit boxed powders it looks like this
it's you know a very soft
pinky type of color a little bit neutral
II definitely had some glow in there and
I didn't really knock this product
entirely in that review remember talking
about how I kind of wish there was more
color intensity it does have a pretty
finish but I thought the color was a
little bland now more recently I've been
enjoying using a lot of my cream blushes
using them on their own I've really
enjoyed the layering effect as well
which creates really great staying power
when you put on a cream blush and you
top it with powder in that respect you
know using a more pigmented cream blush
underneath something really soft but
still pretty and glowy like this it
really makes this product shops like
that's all this thing needed was just
that little extra color punch for me to
be really satisfied with for example
that's the way I'm wearing this today
I've got a little bit of a creamy
product on I lightly applied this on top
I'm not wearing any additional highlight
and this just gives the pretty glow the
cheeks appropriately for this video the
cream thing that I'm wearing underneath
is something that kind of been something
I've changed my mind about over time I
have actually most of these tart cheek
stains and I felt very indifferent about
these for quite some time testing them a
lot I'm trying to figure out do these
really show up on me are they that long
last day stay a little bit dewy on the
skin I don't love that so I just kind of
all over the place but there's one
particular shade in the line that I do
think is gorgeous and well I think it
does kind of call for something to be
put on top of it because of the
tackiness it can have it looks so pretty
on and it's the shade called natural
beauty the packaging on these is really
cute the top twists off and as you can
see this is a very reddish looking
product I feel like it gives off more
color than any of the other ones you
could dab it on your cheeks with your
fingers you will end up with this pretty
rosy type flush love using say it with
me they'll small stipple brush with is a
soft application doesn't interfere with
the products I've got going on
underneath today you know I've got a
little bit of that on my cheeks
I topped it with the rocket or and it's
a really nice combo sometimes with these
products that you don't originally fall
in love with it's like you just got to
figure out the way they work best or
what kind of partner they need to pull
off the best look another thing I like
about this cheek stain it does not
contain shimmer something I really like
appearance-wise texture wise though I
like a powdery product to top it and
those two just happen to work really
well together a couple of brushes that I
really didn't like so much at first and
I struggled to find a use for I feel
like I have found their purpose in my
makeup collection it actually was a trio
of brushes and not positive that these
are still available but I definitely
wanted to talk about them in case you've
got these too and maybe you felt the
same way I did but they are the
duo-fiber
Real Techniques brushes there's a big
one kind of a medium sized one and then
one I'm not sure where it's the other
one here is like the size of an
eyeshadow brush still haven't found much
purpose for that guy yet but these are
the perfect thing to brush off your
fallout you might get on your cheeks
from your eyeshadow oh those moments
where you realize your camera might have
been crooked the whole time
used to keep a fan brush handy in my
brush rotation here so I could grab that
and if I notice myself getting some
powdery fallout I could whisk it away
and that did pretty good but actually
compared to these it applied way more
pressure really want minimal pressure
obviously so that can just you know dust
away and not set into your skins keep
these in with my other brushes grab for
either of them interchangeably but
they're so darn lightweight and I really
don't love using these for any other
purpose don't feel like they're really
great about depositing much product on
my skin I mean they just would apply
such a sheer application of anything I
did with them yeah using them more as a
tool and just keeping them handy as I'm
doing eye makeup they're just great for
being so lightweight like the lightest
weight brushes I have eye products that
I wanted to mention that I have changed
my mind about for the better are the NYC
individualized compact pretty sure I've
mentioned these in a video not too long
ago this is probably the biggest
flip-flop I have ever done on a makeup
product like these went from being
something in my collection that was the
most despised brush and now being
something that I really enjoy I know
these have been reformulated and changed
and I really really like the reasons why
I didn't like these in the past and I'm
talking years and years ago like closer
to the start of my youtube channel and I
didn't like him because I thought the
shadows didn't show up at all not
pigmented dry chalky flaky and in the
cream stuff over here which is a cream
illuminator and a cream base were so dry
that they just they literally the pans
of product just fell out and I know that
over at least the past couple years some
reformulating has definitely happened
for NYC and I really like what they've
come out with it got some good trios as
well but as far as these little palettes
go the one I'm wearing today is called
best of Broadway loving this this is
such a pretty fall palette I've got this
on my lid this is kind of like an all of
the color actually like a dark brownish
olive I've got that kind of under my eye
in the crease i blend it up with this
copper shade which is stunning so that's
a great
on Midtown mauve great if you love the
very kind of pinky taupe type color and
then Union Square is really pretty as
well because you're getting this
gorgeous bronzy shade a plum and then a
very very user-friendly like medium
matte brown that's so nice in the crease
so easy and a nice matte creamy shade
there too next thing I believe got
talked about in a best in beauty video
but it's my Urban Decay Naked basics
palette this is just the first one
second one there will be a tutorial
coming soon I don't know I'm trying to
pre shoot so many videos with this baby
on the way I'm not sure what order I
better kick them out is this one that's
been around the longest and I remember a
couple years ago getting this and
thinking you know all these shades are
so common there's nothing that special
about it more recently I've seen the
value in this as a definite supplement
to other palettes that are lacking
something
maybe it's like you're smaller quads and
trios and it's like oh it's got these
couple really pretty shades but I need a
black or I need a matte Brown or for me
it was like using the Urban Decay
electric palette
everything is bright you need some of
these shades to be your highlight or to
be your crease color or whatever so yeah
total example of something I wasn't up
on as much at first but now I value it
and enjoy it a lot now some things that
I've changed my mind on but not
necessarily for the better first one is
the Maybelline great lash clear this
used to be the thing I think I always
talked about using on my brows to keep
them in place
it's kind of a finishing touch type step
you know it's still okay it's not like
this is the worst product in the world
by any means but I have run into
something that completely changed my
mind where brow gels are concerned and I
will probably never go back to this and
it's the NYX control freak
eyebrow gel so you take a little wand
out it's loaded with Jill this one I
take the wand out and it's just got the
perfect amount on there so I can
actually brush it through my brows holds
amazingly well and it just made me see
that I don't like that so much anymore
other thing that's caused a pretty big
shift in opinion for me has been the Too
Faced shadow insurance eyeshadow primer
I believe this got talked about a little
bit in my last
Emily Awards video this is actually you
know product I have regarded very highly
as one of my top eye primers for years
more recently I feel like a lot of these
little tubes have come out with
different Too Faced palettes and sets
here and there I feel like something
with the consistency has changed not
that I'm using an old one you know it'll
be something new but the consistency is
so liquidy and watery and like it's it's
kind of separated in they still never
really gets to that place where I'm like
okay this is nice and creamy and a good
consistency to be putting on my look
something has changed about this product
and I think since the early days of Too
Faced shadow insurance so many other
great eye primers have come out that do
maintain a really good consistency and
I'm thinking about the bareMinerals
prime time I really like that the Milani
eyeshadow primer I use all the time
another two-faced thing that I've more
recently kind of changed my mind on are
the lip liners the perfect lips lip
liners I can't take anything away from
these these are really great creamy full
color wonderful lip liner after losing
my liner in perfect spice and pretty
easily replacing it with something for
the drugstore which is the Milani color
statement lip liner inspiring how
important is it to spend high-end money
on lip line I just mentioned some of my
favorites which mainly come from NYX and
Milani in my little lip tutorial video
that I did and they're all just really
great products and I know I've talked
about loving these before but I just
can't really back up the need to pay
this kind of price when there are so
many great ones that I've got from the
drugstore another product that I've
really kind of gradually changed my mind
on as the years have gone by
are these NYX jumbo eye shadow pencils I
kind of remember toward the start of my
YouTube time when these were kind of
like the only game in town where creme
shadow sticks work and Cento fun colors
really creamy pigmented but didn't have
the staying power you always had to set
them you really needed to use them
sparingly from the perspective of using
these just as an eyeshadow base yeah
they're still good there's the colors
are still nights I can't take anything
away from that since then I've got so
many cream shadow sticks that come off
as pretty as these do but they could
wear the entire day with nothing on top
of
I love the ones from Milani Jordana
you've got color tattoos they've got so
many more things happening now in the
world of drugstore cream shadow that I
just don't find myself reaching for
these anymore even NYX itself has come
out with a line of jumbo pencils that
are designed to be really long wear so
again it's not a situation where I've
just woken up and decided oh I think
these suck now but I mean they're just a
lot of great things in comparison sorry
if my bra strap has been showing this
entire time let's try to peek out there
sorry but that pretty much sums up this
video it's very easy sometimes to really
get locked into one concrete opinion on
things but I think as as products change
as formulations change as the
competition for these different products
changes your opinions are going to be
different from time to time so I hope
you enjoyed this and I'll talk to you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
