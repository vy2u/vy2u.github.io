when I feel like I'm always talking
about new stuff and new palates and
holiday this and that I thought I'd do a
video about really old stuff stuff that
I have hit major pan on not just a
little you know Fleck of silver in the
bottom but things that are really
getting used up and I think this gives
some fun insight into my makeup using
habits I think it would be fun to watch
other people's videos on this too I know
there are a lot out there this is not a
new concept to do a video on what you've
hit pan on but if this inspires you to
check out your collection and do
something like this to feel free go for
it I think it would be great I was
actually inspired to do this because I
was reading makeup and beauty blog by
Karen she's great um and she did a post
recently on things that she's hit major
panel so like right after I finished
reading her post I was like I want to
look in my collection and see what I've
hit big pan on too so first thing is
this Bobbi Brown corrector in bisque
I've had this for ages so I don't use
this anymore and it's not like there's a
lot left to use anyway but I keep this
around and I keep that little bit in
there I'm more like of something to
compare other products to because I love
this particular shade this salmony color
for concealing dark under eyes so having
this around it helps me to compare other
things to it and be like oh that's
similar the biskits I used years ago so
that's why that's still hanging around
and sometimes like even with products I
don't like I get asked like do I keep
them around do I throw them out do I
give them away or are some things that I
think are total fails I may still keep
them around just to have something to
compare other things to because I do a
lot of reviewing and I also know you
guys like to see a big end-of-the-year
fails video so my NYX stay matte but not
flat powder foundation this puppy has
been used to the bone air and medium
beige is my shade I love this powder for
the finish I feel like it can mattify
your skin but it doesn't have a totally
matte finish you know what I'm saying it
can take away your shine but the powder
still has like a really natural look to
it so I love that still feel like I've
got a good amount in there that I can
keep using up but
once I do run out I will buy more this
one may not qualify as major pan but I
thought I'd mention it it's my Mally
ultimate performance professional
foundation in medium and I could hit a
little pan in this I've used this a lot
but it's really not my favorite
foundation I feel like I love the way it
looks when I first apply it to my skin
but I don't love this staying power
coverage is decent could be better as
you can see it's a little dark for what
my skin is now but I've used that when
I'm more tan mattifying face powder that
I use a lot is from Maybelline and it's
the shine free powder my shade is golden
and definitely hit pan on this guy I
think this is great for oil control
particularly in those months where I am
more oily and I may not even use this
all over my skin I will just use it like
around my nose forehead and chin pretty
so for just that small surface area for
me to have hit pan on it I think that's
saying I've used it a lot so that's a
good one other thing that I've hit pan
on is my ELF translucent mattifying
powder this is something that for the
longest time I still do this sometimes
um oh no my focus B this is a really
sheer powder I wouldn't say it's totally
translucent because if you do apply
enough to your face like you could get
kind of a whitish cast eye but if I'm
trying out something new eyeliner wise
using something unfamiliar on my lower
lash line and I'm not sure how well it's
going to stay I'll take a little
concealer brush into this and apply this
just under where my eyeliner stops and I
feel like it helps absorb oils and kind
of keeps things from getting too smudgy
and I think what you're seeing in this
video are the things that don't get
rotated as much in my collection like
the face products the bronzers and stuff
like that is you're going to see here in
a second you know you're going back to
the same ones time after time at least I
am like the same basic few and then for
blushes and eyeshadows I'm like all over
the place it's rare from you hit pan on
that kind of stuff especially now that
I'm trying so much different makeup for
my channel and everything I've got a lot
of bronzers to talk about here first one
and this is Revlon Photoready Bronston
chic probably my current favorite
drugstore bronzer just for the great
shade
Rayne she can go lighter you can go
darker as you can see I've just kind of
swirled my brush in there a lot and this
is what I've ended up with but it's
totally matte and it's great for
contouring if you've got really fair
skin and you want something to contour
with or if you are maybe light to medium
and you just want something that you can
perk up your whole complexion with
really lightly and the NYC smooth skin
face powder this has been repurchased
several times it's in sunny it's a nice
light matte bronzer so many people love
this is my essence Sun Club bronzer in
sunny a little bit deeper than the NYC
one and hit big pan on this to my sort
of justification for using tons of
bronzer is that I don't just apply it to
my face I also go down onto my neck
chest decollete area as well I think it
evens everything out if you're wearing
something more briefed up top I think it
just looks better and also when I was
doing news like it was crazy how much
added bronzer and blush it took to make
your skin look healthy in front of the
really really bright lights so there was
a time when I used much more bronzer
than I do now but it was definitely a
must-have my Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer you guys have probably seen I'm
trying to make progress on this and get
this used up but this is one of my
favorite high-end bronzers it's like the
perfect shade it's going to be darker
than the NYC sunny but matte again are
we seeing a trend with matte bronzer elf
contouring blush and bronzer yep yep
this is another deep bronzer I remember
using this a whole lot just contouring
your cheekbones this is the st. Lucia
shade and I've got the other duos and I
think this one's my favorite cosmetics
my sculpted face palette this is a matte
highlighting powder and I use that puppy
a lot and I've actually put mega dents
in these two contouring shades too this
is a nice little brightening powder it's
net you can definitely go too far with
something like that really lightly if I
thought it was getting oily I would use
this instead of a shimmery highlight for
a while for news may well my favorite
eyebrow products is the elf Studio brow
kit and medium there's a wax and a
powder I just used a little brush to
apply this to
does a great job filling in brows and if
I'm traveling trying to minimize the
amount of products I'm taking this is
definitely like the go-to brow thing to
take with my Milani blush in my tie this
is the most beautiful peachy pink
pigmented shade and it's kind of been
retired to the back of my blush drawer
cos I don't want to be using this and
tempting people with something they can
no longer find but this is a great shade
I know my mom has I think completely
used up one of these too I got her on to
it but it's a gorgeous shade of blush I
wish that would come back guys check
this out which shade did I use the most
and this is the covergirl trio in golden
sunset and the shade that's been majorly
used up here is golden sunrise for the
longest time now this is a pretty shade
but I would use this center shade which
is kind of a golden a color like that as
my highlight and I would wear it really
sheer under my brow because I didn't
want to wear a thick heavy like white
highlight under my brow so I thought
this warmed things up a little bit I was
able to lay off of this once I realized
they sold a single in that color but
this is definitely one of my most used
covergirl trios along with shimmering
sands which I believe I completely used
up one of them and the one I've used
most recently like a might get ready
with me that was a repurchase so those
are some of the things hanging around in
my collection that I've hit major pan on
as you can see lots of bronzers and
rotation I'm trying to use ups and
powders few little other odds and ends
here and there but thanks for watching I
hope you found this interesting and I'll
see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
