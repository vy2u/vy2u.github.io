my makeup must-haves this video is going
to focus on brushes and tools and I've
got a lot of different things to get
through so I'm gonna try to go through
them kind of quickly the first brush I
think everybody needs to have is a
fluffy powder brush this one has tapered
bristles meaning shorter on the side and
longer up in the middle this particular
brush came from Walmart it does not have
a brand name on it but it is very good
quality I've been using this for several
years now key to keeping your brushes
nice just continual upkeep cleaning them
and just gently traveling with them I
find that sometimes people Ram their
brushes into their makeup bags and you
kind of want to be careful when you
travel with your brushes that's what can
really make the bristles bad and keep
them from being good for a long time but
this one anyway could is the type of
brush you could use your bronzers with
your finishing powders you name it it's
just one of those great all-purpose face
brushes another face brush I think
everybody needs is a flat top brush
sometimes known as a buffer brush this
is a long-handled one from Sally Beauty
Supply the face secrets brand you may
also see a type of brush like this like
this you know a kabuki brush that's
actually short either one is fine but
what this is good for is for your
mineral foundations giving you that nice
even coverage this will give you more
full coverage more quickly with a brush
like this that is the flat top kind
rather
and my next brush that I think everybody
needs which is a kabuki this one is from
Jane difference between these two a
normal kabuki brush you know just a full
tapered bristle brush is gonna give you
a decent coverage but it's more
buildable than this which is going to
right off the bat put on quite a bit
more product so just keep that in mind
the difference there
everybody needs a blush brush about this
size again I'm gonna mention tapered
bristles shorter on the outside longer
in the middle and the reason why I say
that is because these brushes like that
are much easier to blend with this one
is from Revlon however I got it from Big
Lots so it's probably discontinued but
there are tons of blush brushes out
there just make sure a few qualities
that need to have tapered bristles which
you covered when you press it on your
cheek like the entire apple of your
cheek because I mean that's the kind of
coverage you want with a brush like this
you want it to be able to give you if
it's big enough like that give you
coverage that's not too cakey you want
fairly sheer coverage with most blushes
you can also use this for bronzer for
contour you name it but like I said the
tapered bristles and about this size is
good other face brush things you need to
have are a couple of different concealer
brushes this one is another again just
came from Walmart I reserve this for
powder products it's nice to set your
those oil-based eyeliners that you're
using those cream creamy pencils that
you might use a
I set it with a little finishing powder
and that won't run as much that's what I
reserved this one for and then I have
another one from CVS it's the essence of
beauty brand and this concealer brush if
I don't decide to use my finger which I
often do but sometimes you know it's
nice to have that brush that can get in
those little areas and this one is from
CVS and you can see about the size that
it is it's a good size concealer brush
great for around the eye area all right
moving on to eye brushes first one I've
you need an eyeshadow brush just your
typical brush this one is from ELF
extremely dense bristles holds a lot of
product in there a lot of people love
this brush we're just packing on the
shadow right there on your eyelid now
you also need a brush similar to that
only with I wanted to compare this to
the elf one this one is from Mary Kay
this is an eye shadow brush as well but
it got more flexible bristles you'll
find this kind of brush a lot of places
it's got this nice kind of dome and
that's good for applying your
highlighter all over here because you
don't necessarily want it's dense of an
application as you have with the elf one
so see what I mean elf for your floor on
your eyelid very dense densely packed
bristles not as flexible this one may be
a little bit longer bristles for and
we'll put more sheer coverage on the
brow bone area
now you also need some contour brushes I
recommend two different sizes this is a
very small one that is the essence of
beauty brand from CVS and it's great for
getting right in the crease and sort of
defining that outer V area and that
comes in a two pack as well it comes
with one that's just slightly bigger
it's like this is the Big Brother and
it's this one is slightly bigger I don't
really find as many uses for this
because I either use small or I use
quite a bit bigger and this is my Mary
Kay eye contour crease brush and this
comes in a wonderful brush step for Mary
Kay love the Mary Kay brushes and this
is good for just blending out those
harsh lines that you sometimes get as
you want our blending in the outer third
of your eye that's very good for that
these two work great together I usually
don't go anywhere where I know I'm
taking my whole makeup kit with me these
are two brushes that I don't want to not
have and lastly I think you all need an
eyeliner brush this angled one is again
from the Mary Kay brush set I love their
brushes especially their eye brushes I
used like every last one of them and
this one is just very um
very precise has a nice straight edge to
it very thin yet the bristles are stiff
you can't really push him over great for
using a coordinating powder liner to set
your cream or pencil liners under your
eye gosh there's a million one uses you
could use this with a liquid you could
use this just to solely put on your
layer because it's so dense it's it
could really give you great coverage
with any sort of powder that you want to
use as a powder of liner so everybody
needs the liner brush moving on
everybody also needs a brow brush to be
used and this one does not really have a
brand I just kind of have been using I
don't even know where it comes from but
you want to use that brush in
conjunction with some clear mascara this
is from ELF one end is for eyebrow one
is for eye lashes but I think they're
really interchangeable and the reason
why I think you need a separate brush is
because if you just kept brushing with
one of these I can keep it get too much
gel on your eyelashes so you put that on
there and then then this brushes it out
and shapes it how you want it okay got
to go faster now everybody needs a pair
of tweezers even if you're the type that
goes and get your eyebrows done
somewhere you need to be watching for
the stray hairs you also need an eyelash
curler this is a great one from ELF I
mentioned it a million times it's good
to have some applicators just regular
old eyeshadow applicators that you can
use to blend and they're very easy to
travel with and some people are a lot
more comfortable using these than they
are with brushes so if you haven't quite
warped your way into brushes these can
still be great especially for packing on
color
I would everybody needs a little bitty
pair of scissors this is actually may
have come with some kind of nail set I
had but it's great for trimming false
eyelashes and just you name it I just
always I'm raging with little pair of
scissors that I have don't know exactly
where they came from but you can find
them most anywhere any drugstore um
eyelashes if you have not tried false
eyelashes try the half lashes that will
fit on the outer half of your eye they
give you a nice cat eye effect they're
very easy to apply easier than
individuals and the long strips they
just apply so easily
I recommend the duo waterproof dark tone
glue because it's not like the white
kind that you have to wait to dry it
immediately fits right in with your eye
look I think and just a few other things
to have on hand with you on your makeup
desk or your makeup counter or whatever
it may be
um I think everybody needs some eye
makeup remover this is just a generic
kind from Target you need to have some
q-tips million-one uses for q-tips can
be great for dipping it in your eye
makeup remover removing any excess
smudges you have cotton balls great for
toner and of course makeup sponges help
blend out your foundation that's all I
have for my makeup must-haves
thank you so much for watching and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
