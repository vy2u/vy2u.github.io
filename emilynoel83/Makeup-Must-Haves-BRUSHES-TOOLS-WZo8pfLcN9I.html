my makeup must-haves this video is going
to focus on brushes and tools and I've
got a lot of different things to get
through so I'm going to try to go
through them kind of quickly the first
rush I think everybody needs to have is
a fluffy powder brush this one has
tapered bristles meaning shorter on the
sides and longer up in the middle this
particular brush came from walmart it
does not have a brand name on it but it
is very good quality been using this for
several years now um key to keeping your
brushes nice just continual up keep
cleaning them and just gently traveling
with them I find that sometimes people
ran their brushes into their makeup bags
and you kind of want to be careful when
you travel with your brushes that's what
can really make the bristles bad and
keep them from being good for a long
time but this one anyway could is the
type of rush you could use your bronzers
with your finishing powders you name it
it's just one of those great all-purpose
face brushes another face brush I think
everybody needs is a flat top brush
sometimes known as a buffer brush this
is a long handle one from sally beauty
supply the face secrets brand you may
also see the type of brush like this
like this you know a kabuki brush that's
actually short either one is fine but
what this is good for is for your
mineral foundations giving you that nice
even coverage this will give you
more full coverage more quickly with a
brush like this that is the flat top
kind rather than my next brush that I
think everybody needs which is a kabuki
this one is from Jane um difference
between these two a normal kabuki brush
you know just a full tapered bristle
brush is going to give you a decent
coverage but it's more buildable than
this which is going to right off the bat
put on quite a bit more products so just
keep that in mind the difference there
everybody needs a blush brush about this
size again I'm going to mention tapered
bristles shorter on the outside longer
in the middle and the reason why I say
that is because these brushes like that
are much easier to blend with this one
is from Revlon however i got it from Big
Lots so it's probably discontinued but
there are tons of blush brushes out
there just make sure a few qualities
that need to have tapered bristles which
should cover when you press it on your
cheek like the entire apple of your
cheek because I mean that's the kind of
coverage you want with a brush like this
you want it to be able to give you and
if it's big enough like that give you
coverage that's not too cakey you want
fairly sheer coverage with most blushes
you can also use this for bronzer for
contour you name it but like i said the
tapered bristles and about this size is
good other face brush things you need to
have are a couple of different concealer
brushes this one is another again just
came from walmart i reserve this for
powder products it's nice to set your
those oil-based eyeliners that you're
using those cream creamy pencils that
you might use a
I set it with a little finishing powder
and that won't run as much that's what I
reserved this one for and then I have
another one from CBS it's the essence of
beauty brand and this concealer brush if
I don't decide to use my finger which I
often do but sometimes you know it's
nice to have that brush that can get in
those little areas and this one is from
CBS and you can see about the size that
it is it's pretty good sized concealer
brush great for around the eye area
alright moving on to I brushes um first
one I've you need an eyeshadow brush
just your typical brush this one is from
ELF extremely dense bristles holds a lot
of product in there a lot of people love
this brush we're just packing on the
shadow right there on your eyelid now
you also need a brush similar to that
only with the I wanted to compare this
to the elf one this one is from mary kay
this is an eyeshadow brush as well but
it got more flexible bristles you'll
find this kind of brush a lot of places
it's got this nice kind of dome and
that's good for applying your
highlighter all over here because you
don't necessarily want it's dense of an
application as you have with the elf one
so see what I mean elf for your floor on
your eyelid very dense densely packed
bristles not as flexible this one may be
a little bit longer bristles Fuller and
will put more sheer coverage on the brow
bone area now you also need some contour
brushes i recommend two different sizes
this is a very small one that is the
essence of beauty brand from CVS and
it's great for getting line in the
crease and sort of defining that outer v
area and that comes in a two pack as
well it comes with one that's just
slightly bigger it's like this is the
big brother and this is the little
brother and it's this one is slightly
bigger I don't really find as many uses
for this because I either use small or I
use quite a bit bigger and this is my
Mary Kay eye contour crease brush and
this comes in a wonderful brush step for
mary kay love the Mary Kay brushes and
this is good for just blending out those
harsh lines that you sometimes get as
you want our blending in the outer third
of your eye that's very good for that
these to work great together I usually
don't go anywhere where I know I'm
taking my whole makeup kit with me these
are two brushes that I don't want to not
have um and lastly I think you all need
an eyeliner brush this angle one is
again from the Mary Kay brush set I love
their brushes especially their eye
brushes I use like every last one of
them and this one is just very um very
precise has a nice straight edge to it
very thin yet the bristles are stiff you
can't really push him over um great for
using a coordinating powder liner to set
your cream or pencil liners under your
eye
gosh there's a million one uses you
could use this with a liquid you could
use this just to solely put on your
lawyer because it's so dense it's um it
could really give you great coverage
with any sort of powder that you want to
use as a powder of liner so everybody
needs the liner brush moving on
everybody also needs a brow brush to be
used and this one does not really have a
brand I just kind of have been using I
don't even know where it comes from but
you want to use that brush in
conjunction with some clear mascara this
is from elf one end is for eyebrow what
is for eyelashes but I think they're
really interchangeable and the reason
why I think you need a separate brush is
because if you just kept brushing with
one of these I think you could get too
much gel on your eyelashes so you put
that on there and then then this brushes
it out and shapes it how you want it
okay got to go faster now everybody
needs a pair of tweezers um even if
you're the type that goes and get your
eyebrows done somewhere you need to be
watching for the stray hairs you also
need an eyelash curler this is a great
one from ELF I mentioned in a million
times it's good to have some applicators
just regular old I shadow applicators
that you can use to blend and they're
very easy to travel with and some people
are a lot more comfortable using these
than they are with brushes so if you
haven't quite worked your way into
brushes these can still be great
especially for packing on color on your
eyelid
um everybody needs a little bitty pair
of scissors this is actually made come
with some kind of nails said I had but
it's great for trimming false eyelashes
and just you name it I just always
arranging those little pair of scissors
that I have don't know exactly where
they came from but you can find them
most anywhere any drugstore um eyelashes
if you have not tried false eyelashes
try the half lashes that will fit on the
outer half of your eye they give you a
nice cat eye effect they're very easy to
apply easier than individuals and the
long strips they just apply so easily i
recommend the duo waterproof dark tone
glue because it's not like the white
time that you have to wait to dry it
immediately fits right in with your eye
look I think and just a few other things
to have on hand with you on your makeup
desk or your makeup counter whatever it
may be um I think everybody needs some I
makeup remover this is just a generic
kind from target you need to have some
q-tips million one uses for q-tips can
be great for dipping it in your eye
makeup remover removing any excess
smudges you have cotton balls great for
toner and of course makeup sponges help
blend out your foundation that's all I
have for my makeup must-haves thank you
so much for watching and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
