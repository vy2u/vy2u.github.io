must-haves does everybody need in all
the different categories and I've been
asked that from a lot of people that are
say trying to build up their makeup
collection and want to know you know
what certain things do they need and so
I've done one on the face so I'm doing
one on eyes lips and also all the tools
and brushes so if you don't see me
addressing the different makeup tools
yet i'll get to that as well so right
now we're on eyes and I think everybody
first off needs some sort of primer the
one that I've been using for a really
long time that seems to be lasting me
forever is my mary kay signature I
primer I know a lot of people like Urban
Decay primer potion I haven't used it
yet when I write out of this that's what
I'm going to get but i'm just using this
up right now and I mean it works great
it just a primer what it what it will do
is sort of give your eyeshadow something
to kind of I'm not going I don't want to
say it absorbs it but it gives it a nice
base to wear it like kind of neutralizes
whatever colors are on your eye and
allows the shadow to really pop so
that's something everybody needs because
it's going to take even cheap I shadows
and make them look with a lot more
intense than they would look on their
own um next as far as shadow goes now
I'm going to try to make this really
basic for those of you who have asked
you know what are the bare minimum items
that I need as far as eyeshadow goes the
brand i love is Smashbox I think it's
great there are so many of course other
eyeshadows that I have that are just
wonderful but I mean if you really want
to get just like some great quality
eyeshadow i really like smashbox in
general um but i think everybody needs
as far as shades go you gotta have like
a pearly white color works is a great
highlight
looks good all over the lid this trio
that I had it was actually a limited
edition one from Smashbox called
smashing cocktail hour and you can see
that pearly kind of white shade that
they have it's just it's just so great
it's just so multi-purpose and you know
you can just look on like Sephora calm
and see just look through their eye
shadows they'll have something looks
like a white pearly shade that's likely
the same kind that i have here because
it's just just a good thing to have now
low-priced alternative to that is the
cover girl one kit I enhancers and
champagne okay you're just going to get
that light shimmer just a nice all over
the lid kind of shade and when you
really want your eyes to pop it you know
even if you're doing a smoky look having
a lighter shade right in here can really
add to the effect so because you want
contrast you know what I mean when you
do a smokey eye dog all over it can be
fine but if you really want the darkness
to stand out you want something light
that it can go up against does that make
sense okay and the other thing I think
everybody needs is a black shadow I
really like um black shadows that have a
little bit of sparkle in them and the
high-end one that I use a lot that i
love is makeup forever diamond shadow
and this is the ID i like rubbed off the
name back there i can't remember what
it's called but it's the black sparkly
one if you're looking for it and that's
what it looks like it's just
you know it's not a cream it is a powder
and it I think it's actually coming up
more sparkly not all those sparkles
really even show up I just like the idea
that sparkles are there I don't know why
but I like that and then another one
that is very comparable to that that
also is great is Jane icings in clubbing
and that's in this little palette but I
have actually this one right here you
can see that sparkle did the to not look
almost identical here let me open them
both up for you look at this one and
that one in the corner I mean they're
really really similar they're both great
they're both really pigmented we get it
sparkly black what that's good for can
be to you know if you want you have a
smoky outer V that can be great also
using it wet at the liner is a great
thing to black eyeshadow is very
versatile don't be scared of that when
you say as a store and think oh my gosh
I would never wear this yes you would
you know there is you can make it a
sheer or as strong as you want it to be
it can come off like I almost a gray
shade if you use it very lightly with a
with the right kind of brush so just you
know everybody needs to have that so
I've mentioned it curly white kind of
shade and I've mentioned sparkly black
so or just black is fine too but those
two shadows if you want to get by on a
bare minimum and those can work really
well for you obviously there are lots of
other eyeshadow shades I mean do I think
people should have a plum shade of brown
shade but um you know I could spend all
day talking about that
and i'm sure i will get into you've seen
different reviews that I've done and I
will do more reviews in the future but
I'm just trying to kind of streamline
this and make it simple today so um but
I do think people should have when
you're starting out especially a fun
palette of eyeshadow I've mentioned
Claire's eyeshadow palettes that are
really fun to experiment with purples
and greens and blues and everything
another great one that I've had for a
while here is my Sephora palette Wow
takes up the whole screen just just you
know have a bunch of different colors to
experiment with and have fun with give
yourself the chance to look into those
other you know plums and and blue and
turquoise and things like that so that's
how you kind of realize you what you
really like me and go out and buy an
individual of it and whatever brand you
really prefer so next I think everybody
needs eyeliner you need a liquid and you
need a pencil for my coloring I always
use black for blondes you may use a dark
brown or you know other colors entirely
for a fun look but I'm just going with
you know like i said before there's
zillions of I looks I'm just trying to
simplify this for like what I may do on
and every day and I like this is going
to be really easy I like revlon
colorstay pencil in the black and the
liquid in the black as well and I use
the liquid on my top lash line and then
I blend in with the black down below so
really easy these do stay I promise they
stay here
and this especially that liquid that's
not going anywhere until you wash it off
and so those two products great I
products and then mascara okay I love
mascara i find myself buying it all the
time and I've got three of my best
suggestions for you here and they are
all drugstore brand excuse me first one
is covered Oh fantastic lash this
happens to be the waterproof version I'm
not specifically recommending the
waterproof it's just what I pulled out
because I have it in both this is a good
thickening this is what the brush looks
like this is a thickening lengthening
all-purpose everyday mascara really good
like you put it handles multiple coats
wonderfully it is a really cute tube I
just love that for every day if you want
a really dramatic look really really
good length in volume the hip mascara
l'oreal hip I don't know if I heard this
talked about a lot on youtube but I have
on other makeup sites I have it in full
ultimate black I think they also sell it
in blue but this is what that brush
looks like and this is just wonderful
length wonderful thickness and it's just
another one of those you know like these
are both great whichever one you pick we
would be happy with and then one that
I'd used a while back and then I'd like
stop using it forgot about it for a
while and then I went to the store and I
was like I have to try this again
because I loved it so much double extend
from l'oreal this is one of those too
enders it's got a primer on one end
and this is the you know the other end
for your regular mascara and this is
kind of like my I call this my fall /
cop-out mascara because if I was going
to do the false eyelashes and then I
decided I don't feel like it i'm too
lazy to do it this gives you false
eyelash look double extend really really
long length good thickness and you can
kind of control it with how much primer
you put on so keep that in mind last
thing I think everybody is a brow gel I
like the covergirl brand i also like
this one from ELF that gives you a lash
and brow which they can both work
interchangeably as far as I'm concerned
but those are the eye products I think
everybody needs thank you so much for
watching and keep watching my makeup
