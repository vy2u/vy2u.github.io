for people asking what I think are the
best products in every facet of makeup
whether its foundations eyeliners blush
you name it um you know what items do I
think are essential for people to have
and I think that's a really good
question and I really want to address it
and I started making a list of all these
different things and then I realized
this is going to take me way longer than
one video so I'm going to break it up
and I'm going to do face products eye
products lips and then a final video on
tools and brushes and things like that
so and the way I'm going to do it I mean
I'm going to go through every category
like I think for example I think
everyone needs a tinted moisturizer and
then I'll give you a product suggestion
and if there is a product that I suggest
that is a high-end I am I'm going to try
to come up with an inexpensive
alternative because I know you know
money is very tight for a lot of people
right now with the price of everything
going up so I'm going to try to work
with you guys on that as well um but
yeah alright let's get going on it then
the first thing I think everybody needs
is a tinted moisturizer like I said
before like I alluded to um I think the
one that I like is Neutrogena oil-free
moisture and sheer tint it's SPF 15 this
is very light and yes the tint works on
everyone and you guys more and more
makeup companies are coming out with
like tinted moisturizers and they're not
really tinted moisturizers they are like
light foundations this however is very
sheer you it's really much more of a
moisturizer it's not going to give you a
lot of coverage but it will help kind of
even out your skin tone especially it's
got really good skin and it does
need a whole lot of help but this is
something I use every day under whatever
I'm using pretty much so that's the
tinted moisturizer I think everybody
needs secondly I think everybody needs
to have a long wearing foundation you
never know when you're going that
special event come up and you need some
makeup that's going to give you
outstanding coverage and something you
don't have to worry about all throughout
the night you know so I've got a couple
that I've been using one is Revlon
Colorstay with soft flex it's got an SPF
six this is the combination oily skin
and my color is fresh beige and this one
I use probably more during the winter
months because it's a little lighter now
I'm using more of the Rimmel lasting
finish this is a mineral enriched
foundation it's claims to be
sixteen-hour
transfer-resistant which is true I my
color is soft beige and I love it and I
would use this as well if it might mean
like it's not right on my color I could
use it now but I just think this is a
better match but either of these are
great long wearing foundations they
really live up to their claims on that
secondly or third rather I think
everybody needs to have a concealer if
you're trying to streamline your makeup
collection maybe get a concealer that
can handle under-eye circles and
anything else on your face and one that
I think works for that is Maybelline
mineral power concealer my color is
medium 0-1 and sand is the name of the
shade and it's just one of these wand
concealers but what I like about this is
that this really especially for
summertime this Willey disappears into
your skin you know
some concealers almost make the problem
worse because it's like okay something's
underneath here and now you can really
see the concealer this just really melts
into your skin takes care of dark
circles beautifully and doesn't feel too
heavy on any areas where obviously you
don't want to irritate a blemish any
more by putting too much of an oily
product on there and this is really
gentle really good for your skin so
that's from the Maybelline mineral power
line next I think everybody needs to
have a pressed powder I use a pressed
powder after I put on foundation and
concealer to kind of set
I don't always put it all over my face
but I'll definitely use it to set a
concealer around my eye area or wherever
I put concealer so a couple good ones
are Revlon Colorstay pressed powder in
light/medium that's my color as you can
see I've used it quite a bit and that
just obviously I mean if the color stay
product works great with the foundation
works well with other foundations good
coverage the one I find that put in my
purse a lot is L'Oreal True Match color
is w6 in Sun beige and this is one of
those that opens up back in front with
the sponge and the mirror down here and
then your powder on top this has great
coverage this if you just wanted to put
on your tinted moisturizer and then put
on some of this you would have good
coverage with that it's just great for a
touch-up this is a nice warm color
there's tons of colors to choose from so
I recommend those as pressed powders
next I think everybody needs to have a
bronzer and I'm not just talking
summertime I think any time of the year
you
a bronzer will help anybody look more
refreshed and there are so many
different shades out there these days if
you have fair skin there's I'm sure
there's a browser for you if you have
medium even if you have dark skin and
you want to somehow you know warm it up
and there's so many different shades
right now bronzer is so much more common
than it ever used to be so a couple that
I'm going to suggest are the body bell
powder bronze in golden tan this is a
matte bronzer pretty much if there's any
sparkle in there is the most subtle
sparkle in the world because it is a
matte bronzer and that's good for people
to have if you really just want to alter
your skin tone basically if you want to
make yourself look like you got that
healthy glow a matte bronzer will not
take you overboard and make you look
unnatural another great one if you are
into the loose powder and the mineral
stuff is the new Maybelline mineral
power bronzer and sunkissed this is just
I don't know if you can see the shade
too well there but this is a great shape
of medium skin tones it does have a
little more shimmer than the other one
so use it sparingly it doesn't take a
lot but just a couple great bronzers to
have in your collection if you're trying
to build that up um another couple items
I think everybody needs is blush you
need two shades of blush um that's just
my opinion if you really want to have a
good natural look
the first one is um that I'm going to
recommend is cheekers and plumbery glow
the first kind of blush you need is
something that's kind of pinky peachy
this
a little bit brighter than its appearing
here but this shade is something you're
going to want to put only on the apples
of your cheeks give you that look of
health that nice glow and then the other
shade you need is something that's a
little bit deeper bronze or like a deep
peach this color is cheekers and golden
pink and it's a great contour shade it
can also work like it's kind of an
all-over face color just to warm you up
a little bit but using two-faced colors
especially if you plan on doing any
contouring if you contour with a color
like this it's going to look very
strange so you really need to think
about it okay I would get you know flush
cheeks that would be the apples of your
cheeks is where that's going to happen
and then if you want any kind of contour
be very subtle about it use very good
blending techniques but use a color that
would naturally create sort of a shade
there rather than a bright pink or peach
next I think everybody needs a setting
power I would suggest a bare minerals
mineral veil even if you don't use that
whole line of foundations I think this
is so wonderful
it makes all your makeup it basically
just makes you look like you just did a
flawless job on your makeup even if you
didn't somehow it just blends it all
together it just melts the whole look
together and makes it look so great and
like i said low-priced alternative to
that is maybelline mineral power which
they do theirs in a at least from what i
know a pressed formula this one is in
light it slides out here and gives you a
sponge old mirror down there i use it
with a brush that's just my personal
preference for light coverage so um you
need to
setting powder those two would work and
then lastly if you like mineral based
powder I'm going to suggest a couple to
you bare minerals or maybelline mineral
power high-end drugstore and easier
those are their very comparable they
both give similar coverage Maybelline
maybe even a little more coverage but
it's nice to be able to switch away from
the liquids all the time do something
that really is even better for your skin
which is the mineral stuff that's going
on right now so thank you for watching
and please watch the other videos I'm
going to have for your makeup must-haves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
