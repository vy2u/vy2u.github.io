sister's wedding it was awesome it was a
beautiful wedding and thank you to
everybody who when I was doing that I
tutorial thanks to everybody that said
good luck and wish her well it was just
a really great day and so I am back and
I am ready to share with you my makeup
must-haves for Eclipse this is part
three in my little series here so if you
haven't seen one and two I did them on
face product and eye products so and
I'll have one more on the way for tools
like brushes and eyelash curlers and all
that kind of things so let's get started
the first thing for lips that I think
everybody needs is a good ball and that
can kind of function as a primer before
you get your liner on there if you've
ever tried applying lip liner before you
have like any kind of smooth lip balm on
it kind of pulls it had hugs at your
lips and you want it to go on nice and
smooth so a couple of things and by the
way all the products that I'm
recommending here are very very
affordable so if you're a bargain
shopper like me definitely keep watching
because you can't these things will
totally fit into your budget I think so
a couple anyway lip balms that I would
recommend these are things that you can
find one of these is definitely
something you can find everywhere is the
Burt's Bees lip balm it's just got a
really cooling mint
I sent and it just it isn't so slick to
where what have you put on top it's
gonna slide off its really gonna kind of
grab onto that liner so and whenever I
use that I don't feel like I have any
like feathering outside of my mouth area
so that's a good one and then one that
you can wear alone this is kind of a new
thing I think cuz I just saw it like a
couple weeks ago it's the soft lips
tinted yes if you're a soft lips fan
you're like going nuts right now it's
tinted they have Lohse and bronze and I
have the Rose kind and it's pretty light
but and this is definitely not going to
show up oh wait I put it on here it's
just it's just really light you're not
gonna be able to see it it's not a dark
tint whatsoever but it's so nice it's
like the light this beautiful like
shimmery pink color and it's the same
texture it's soft lips and the scent is
just great
so I'm so happy they came out with
something like that because I know lots
of people love that brand so yeah it's
still SPF 15 and they have it in Rose
and bronze I've not tried bronze but I
have the Rose so those are a couple lip
balms that I like liners are pretty
important I don't wear them I wouldn't
say I wear them all the time but if I
really have a special look that I'm
going for and I really don't want to
mess it up by my lip color somehow going
outside my lips one that you can always
use for like anything it's Revlon
Colorstay clear lip liner you might be
thinking my clear is not going to do
anything
well it I mean it looks white here but
it's clear you know it does not show up
at all and it's just what think of this
is like an invisible fence on your lips
your what color no matter what it is you
could be doing a really super light nude
lip or a red deep red lip and when you
put this on
fill it in all inside your lips and it's
gonna you know your lip color is gonna
stay better and it's not gonna leave you
no feather outside your lip line so I
love that I love that I can use this no
matter what look I'm going for and you
guys probably know I'm a big fan of
Revlon colors today plus it has this
little anybody sharpener thing at the
bottom if you want a more precise point
on the end but Revlon Colorstay products
are great so that clear aligner is a
really cool fun another liner if you do
want color Jordana this is available at
Walgreens I have it in tawny and that's
just one of those liners that will it
will jump out of your hands and it will
match your lip color pretty much right
on so that's from Jordana the color is
tawny and I don't know if it does as
good a job as Colorstay does it staying
put or making your lip color necessarily
stay longer but it it does have a nice
match and it gives your lips a nice
border alright gotta speed this up next
for lipsticks I'm gonna recommend three
different color families and then give
you three lipsticks that I think fit
that light neutral a darker neutral and
a red slash berry shade so for my light
and light neutral and I recommend this
covergirl incredible color see how that
kind of a light shimmer put that on my
hand there you can see it's it's coming
off actually a little darker than what
it really is but it really there we go
what catches the light it's kind of a
nice light shimmer to it the color is
980 ty grande or something like that
really good love that that's from
covergirl and the dark neutral that I
would recommend is Revlon Colorstay lip
color and fabulous fig teensy i've
swatched it right below the one I just
did and this is I've worn this in
several videos and lots of people have
been like what color is that and this is
this is what I've been using a lot
lately I really really like it and
because it's just like it it gives your
it it gives your lips a little bit of
depth but it's not like hey look at me
so like that fabulous big Revlon
Colorstay and then for the red berry
shade this is so cheap it is NYC ultra
moist lip wear in sheer red is what will
click on the tube
and this is the third color on there and
I know you're probably not seeing a
whole lot of difference between the
second one and the third one there but
this is a it pretty red it's a it's a
great shade of red actually if you're
trying to get into red I would recommend
this one if you're familiar with talking
about undertones this would be a blueish
undertone as opposed to an orange you or
yellow undertone on the red and that's
known to make your teeth look whiter so
anyway that's NYC ultra moist and sheer
red gotta move on I recommend that you
have a coordinating lip gloss for all of
those different colors and so I'm just
going to run through those real quick
for my light neutral you've heard me
talk about this before it's Maybelline
lip polish in Angus nude flash yep
that's what it is and it's really pretty
it's great with it with a smoky eye can
you see that it's just real life very
pretty
and this for a dark neutral what looks
great over fabulous fig is the shade
it's like 99 cents on cherry culture
calm it's a muse tinted lip plumper and
I think this is nude this is the color
is like clumping nude or something like
that but it doesn't say on the container
I don't think I'm going to put this
right below that one and this you're
getting a nice kind of it's actually
kind of coppery you can see how the
light just hits these they look gorgeous
but that second petal area is a little
more coppery works well with those
mid-tone neutral bronzy little bit
deeper lip colors and then my last
recommendations for a berry / red look
if we're talking red I love this wet and
wild shade it's called red sensation it
got some kind of sparkle to it so get
ready
I love this color though I think you
don't run into enough good red lip
glosses and this is one that I really
like real shiny I like the scent
personally but you cannot beat the scent
of this one this is from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works it's lip wicious the color is
raspberry jam and this is great for a
berry lip color it's smells oh it smells
so good and it's got this really pretty
pinky red shade so you can see these
different glosses you can you know you
just can't beat them but where then they
look best I think one one with those
coordinating lip colors that I was just
telling you about so those are my
recommendations thanks for watching and
have a great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
