this video it's going to be all about
primers for makeup and I've gotten a lot
of questions just basic questions
wondering what exactly do they do why
should I use one what are some different
kinds so I'm just going to go through
that real briefly here for you basically
a primer is something you would put on
after a moisturizer so when you sit down
to do your makeup you put a moisturizer
on you kind of let that soak in and then
you put a primer on your face and the
idea is that that primer is going to
make your skin feel smoother and you're
going to be able to put your foundation
on it will go on more smoothly some
claim to minimize pores and sometimes
they even claim to make your makeup last
longer um a lot of people are believers
in using some sort of primer or base on
their eyelid because you've got you know
you cream makeup powder makeup you know
who knows what around your eye area and
a lot of people like to use a primer
like Urban Decay primer potion or two
faced shadow insurance which I like or
L'Oreal decrease just name a few there
so there we are primers for your eyes
like those but there's also primers for
your face and in the beginning when
primers started coming out I kind of
thought you know this probably isn't
that necessary I feel like my makeup
staying on ok or whatever and then I had
tried a little sample size of Smashbox
photo finish this is a full-size um and
then I was like oh okay I see it primers
are pretty good because this um smashbox
photo finish which comes in different
formulas it actually comes in a light
formula too and I think some different
color correcting ones there's also a
bronzing photo finish that I have really
doesn't bronze all that much I don't
really see that much difference but
anyway the photo finish basically is a
very very it
you can see it looks like a clear gel
and if i were to put it on my hands and
rub my hands together i probably
wouldn't want to open anything real soon
because it really does make my hands
have that smooth feel and to touch my
face afterwards I feel like my face
feels just silky when I put that on it's
the same with the laura geller spackle
which i have only used in like a little
trial size but those two are kind of
similar and that they are sort of a
gel-like consistency and then you put
them on your face and it in it dries to
like a dry like a dry silky kind of feel
and it doesn't take any time for it to
soak in you don't have to like wait like
you would for a moisturizer it just I
feel like I put it on in it instantly
you know okay I can start putting my
makeup on now and you can really tell
you know especially if you're putting on
your foundation with your fingers it's
going to go on more smoothly the fact
that whether or not last longer is still
something that's a little bit up in the
air with me when I'm using a liquid
foundation with this primer talking
about photo finish right now because I
don't know I don't know that i noticed i
notice a difference more so in the
application than the staying power let's
just put it that way in terms of
minimizing pores i think i might go with
that a little bit because i really think
photo finish I mean I to actually read
what it says here yeah to create a
perfect canvas for foundation
application apply the silky blend of
vitamins and antioxidants to cleaner
moisturize skin this totally unique
formula helps reduce the appearance of
fine lines and pores for visibly softer
skin and so it does soften the skin it
does help your makeup go on smoother and
that alone can be a real asset to people
especially if you have some unevenness
in your skin or you have you know places
where sometimes the foundation maybe if
you if you have real combination skin
where maybe there's some dry patches and
the foundation clings to those areas and
it ends up looking unnatural using the
primer just listed all
Don then there's some other kinds of
primers one that is my favorite from the
drugstore is the Rimmel fixin perfect
okay so this is a lot different it's it
has the exact same claims to smooth skin
minimize pores make your foundation last
longer but it's totally different in
terms of the consistency you can see
this is kind of like a peachy formula if
i were to rub it into my hand here it's
going to kind of disappear for the most
part you might have just a hair of color
there but and you know as soon as you
put it in it feels more like a
moisturizer than Smashbox photo finish
this because I can still kind of feel it
and I might give it a little bit of a
drying period but once it has started to
dry you do get that really really nice
smooth feel not quite as silky as
Smashbox but it is smooth and this is
one that for some reason I feel like I
like using this a lot with mineral
makeup because I do feel like it you
know it has it doesn't get quite as
smooth and dry feeling as the photo
finish does so when I put those loose
minerals on I guess I just feel like
there's maybe a little more staying
power with this with the mineral makeup
but you could use this with liquid to I
use it all the time with the Rimmel
lasting finish makeup and they make a
good pair together so I mean primers
basically if you're on a tight budget
and you are thinking you know I want to
get the bare minimum makeup you may not
really need a primer but if you do
struggle with feeling like you have a
smooth canvas to start your makeup off
with you know you might want to look
into that like I said there's formulas
like this that are more like gel also
some people use monistat chafing gel and
use that on their faces for fat for a
foundation primer and people there are a
lot of people that would do nothing else
because they think it works great I
haven't personally tried that so I can't
really speak to that but you may want to
look into some reviews on that see if
you think that's worth trying but for me
I really like the Smashbox photo finish
especially not so much the bronzing it's
not really that awesome but I just like
regular photo finish primer and
the rimmel fixin perfect it works great
with minerals that kind of helps them
cling I feel like a little bit more and
both do a good job of making your skin
feel smooth and overall making it easier
to apply your makeup so I hope this
answered a few are your questions about
primers without totally confusing you
all over again if you have more
questions that please let me know and
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
