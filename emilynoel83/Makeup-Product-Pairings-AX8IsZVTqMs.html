me for this video I'm so glad I managed
to find time in this day to do this
video because I have been really really
busy lately if you're keeping up with me
on Twitter Facebook and my blog you know
that Tyler and I closed on a house on
monday so we are going to be moving
completely by the end of this month and
it is going to be a big process we don't
have a lot necessarily that we have to
do to the house we're painting couple
rooms where you know making some minor
changes but just getting everything
packed up and ready to go and trying to
do that within our each of our different
work schedules because Tyler's you know
a typical kind of working nine-to-five
type thing and I am on this morning show
schedule that's kind of crazy so where
we overlap is where we're trying to kind
of work together and today I'm going to
do some painting and different things
but if you're really interested in that
kind of thing I am going to try to keep
my blog updated on a you know daily or
every other day type basis just with
some pictures partly so I can look back
and kind of remember how this whole
experience went and also so you can kind
of see the transformation happen as well
so that's beauty broadcast net is my
blog and I'm really pumped because I'm
going to have a beauty broadcast room
that's going to be completely devoted to
doing you know videos and that kind of
thing so I'm really really excited for
how that's going to turn out so thank
you for caring I guess room for those of
you who love me nice comments and words
of congratulations i think that's really
sweet so yeah I will keep you updated
but in terms of getting a lot of videos
done like this it's going to be hard to
find a lot of time for that so just
giving you the heads up on that you know
if I I haven't dropped off the face of
the earth i'm still here so anyway for
this video of what i wanted to talk
about was something i was noticing with
several different products i used this
morning and it's kind of like you get
into those rhythms sometimes where
you're using like two products together
like you use this foundation and so then
you're going to use this prep this
powder and it's like or you know two
different blushes you always wear
together two different eyeshadows and
it's like they don't even necessarily
have to come from the same brand you
could be pulling them just kind of
randomly but you're wearing them kind of
repeatedly because they work and so I've
noticed myself doing that quite a bit so
i thought i would share with you what
mine are and then maybe in the comments
section you can share what your product
pairings are here so the first one I'm
going to start out with these are all
things i've been using recently a lot of
things i used today so anyway first
thing is revlon photoready foundation
and natural beige I've really been using
this a whole lot lately I feel like it
feels a little lighter than my typical
Revlon Colorstay foundation or the
maybelline superstay 24 hour so it has
that little lighter feel it has a little
more luminosity to it and I know that
was sort of somewhat like a criticism
that I gave this foundation when i first
reviewed it but i found a powder that
really kind of turns down the shine on
my t-zone area and it makes this
foundation super wearable so i've been
using my clinique stay matte sheer
pressed powder it's oil-free my change
is zero to stay neutral and so you know
the clinic classic green compact and so
i'll use this powder I kind of use a
powder brush and sort of dust that
around on my nose and my forehead and my
chin and that way it's like I'm setting
the foundation but I'm really paying
attention to those key areas that tend
to get oily and I'm keeping the rest of
the face looking a little more radiant
so yeah these two products are a
definite pair that i found myself
reaching for a whole lot lately and for
blush two blushes that i just can't get
enough of i wear them all the time
together covergirl cheekers in golden
pink it's a great contour shade and
works great for me on the news where
that's concerned because I do like to
create quite a bit of definition there
so I am you know I don't know it just
comes off nicely on camera I think so
its Sun again covergirl cheekers in
golden pink it's kind of a mat and sort
of like a rusty kind of like a warm
bronze sort of Shh works nice for the
cheeks and then
on the apples of my cheeks my ultimate
favorite peachy pink as you can tell
here I hit pan on both of these it's the
Milani minerals blush in my tie and this
is so pigmented it is not shimmery but
it really makes a pretty peachy pink
shade on your cheeks something that I
think really works on a lot of skin
tones so that's a pair that I go to a
lot on another face product thing that I
seem to really use a lot together the
Rimmel natural bronzer lately i've been
using sunlight which is almost a dupe of
NYC setting if you can't get NYC sunny
but you can get Rimmel or vice versa
they're very similar this doesn't really
have shimmer in it it's just like kind
of a matte bronzing powder and it's not
very dark so you can use it all over
your face and just get a little color
but nothing too crazy and out there you
don't to really even be too careful
about how you apply it but it seems like
when I use this which I usually put on
before my blush I usually end up using
this mac mineralized skin finish in soft
and gentle I've been asked at times you
can see it's kind of golden II a little
bit golden lo kind of champagne and I
just barely will dot my brush in that
and I use it right up here and I've been
asked like you know are you using a
highlighter there or what is that so
that's this product usually that or the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips and
waikiki script but that's sort of I
guess all these products going to go
together it's like a little foursome of
products that I usually reach for a lot
especially for work I mean this is a lot
of work stuff that I use but now let's
do eyes and I product I use a lot I find
myself reaching for a lot as a contour
shade sorry I'm like sitting here on the
floor in my feet are falling asleep hate
that feeling um this is mac carbon so
you know go to matte black shade and
that's great null I like using it i have
it on today a little bit in the in the
crease here but sometimes I just feel
like it's too flat and it's not warm
enough and it just needs a little
something extra and one of the prettiest
shades to kind of top off with right up
in this area i don't know if it's
showing up a whole lot but it is they're
just really light
is this glam couture eyeshadow in palace
and this is one of their I think it's
one of their bright eye shadows and you
see a lot of sparkle in the container
but there's not a lot of sparkle that
goes on but nonetheless this is very
pigmented as just like a magenta shadow
and so anytime I've got something really
really dark and the crease like matte
carbon I'll take a shape like this and
sort of brighten it up there and even if
you know I'm wearing blue today you
don't have to match it but it's like I
just like sort of warming up something
so dark so these are two that i actually
used quite a bit on a regular basis next
for mascara miv I'm surely not the only
one out there that will use one kind of
mascara and then later on like put
another coat on with a different mascara
and it just works really well like for
some reason it's like you needed the
combination of two to come together to
really give you a good look on your
lashes I don't know but here's the duo
I've been using a lot lately they grow
luscious by fabulous mascara by Revlon
this is supposed to kind of overtime
thicken and lengthen your lashes I've
been using it for a couple weeks now
can't say I've seen any drastic results
I don't know I it's really hard to tell
like our my lash is in better condition
I don't know it's like not like normal
hair you know it's just your eyelashes
so i don't know i will tell you you guys
will be the first to know if i do see a
change in my eyelashes but it's still a
good mascara it's got a really big brush
and it really does just on its own just
putting it on it makes your lashes seem
lengthened and thickened but i find
myself very frequently reaching for my
Lancome Hypnose mascara when I want that
final deep dark long you know no spidery
ends no weird you know stuff going on
with the lashes this Lancome Hypnose is
a great final step so almost with any
mascara on the first step I really like
using this at the end it it seems like
it just really sets it off it's like one
of the last things I do before I go on
the air for the news is a coat of this
and I just feel like okay now I can go
then lastly I have two pairs of lip
products that I use a lot together one
of them is my room
exaggerated lip liner and ravish so this
is one of my favorite red shades I
talked about some of these products a
lot i'm sorry if you're getting bored
with them but this may be one of them
and i'll put that all over my lips and i
fill them in and this is very creamy
it's very easy to do that and then i
take this gloss this is a lancome gloss
called beach plum and it's one of the
juicy tubes smoothies but as you can see
any sort of creamy you know sort of
reddish plum gloss over the top it works
really well these two are kind of like
the same color so it's kind of some loss
that might match this and use them
together it works really nice because
this is so creamy and it gives you nice
definition to and you want definite good
definition when you're using a red color
like that now for kind of a new duo that
I use a lot something I talked about
recently revlon it's the color burst
lipstick and blush beautiful neutral so
it's got a little bit of pink a little
bit of neutrally maybe light brown nude
sort of all rolled into one end of a
caramel hint of light caramel there too
but a gloss that is so beautiful over
that I think this is the only duo of
things those within the same brand but
it's the Revlon super lustrous lip gloss
in foiled great gloss to have in your
makeup kit because this is so light it's
really light but it gives a great glossy
sort of reflective quality to it you can
see how when it catches the light it
just almost reflects the light and then
otherwise it looks just kind of nude and
neutral and trust me looks beautiful
alongside this lipstick these two shades
look great together so that's all i've
got for now those are just a lot of the
random things I reach for and when I
reach for this thing you know I reach
for the other thing too alongside with
it little product pairings there so tell
me what what things you like to use
together I think it'd be interesting to
see and have a great day thanks so much
