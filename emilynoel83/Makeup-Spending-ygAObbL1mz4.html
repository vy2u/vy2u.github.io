to take a minute to do a video on
something that's sort of it's pretty
much asking for your feedback on this
because it's something I'm really
curious about and so it's not really
like a question of the week or anything
but it's just kind of you know I'd like
to know what you think about this um I
got my idea for this video for My People
StyleWatch
I always get the style watch issues
because I just think that they they deal
more in like fashion and hair and makeup
and stuff like that but inside I saw
this article in their beauty section and
it said the question is what would you
buy with ninety five dollars and they
show how you can get this to your palate
you know I'll let you see kind of what
the article is here so we got two sides
here and they've got the Dior palette
keychain with like a lip and cheek tint
and face highlighter so like a mini
palette teaching for $95 or they show on
this opposite side all these things it
cost somewhere between you and just a
dollar or like twenty dollars you know
all these other items I got stuff from
ELF there
it's a mascara from prestige Elm a
Victoria's Secret makeup and all these
different things so my question to you
is not necessarily what would you spend
ninety five dollars on specifically but
which side are you on
do you tend to like to put if you've got
a X amount of money do you put that
toward one thing or do you would you
rather split up into a lot of different
things I mean I just think it's an
interesting question because I do think
that there are a lot of people out there
that might say okay I've got let's just
say thirty bucks you know I'm gonna
spend that on this one product from the
MAC store or I'm going to get one thing
from Sephora as opposed to going to the
drugstore and getting maybe you know
three or four different things I don't
know so I just kind of wanted to post
that question to you and see what your
take on it was
as for me I mean generally speaking
unless I've got you know one this one
high-end product that I've just got my
eye on and I have to have if I've got a
given amount of money generally speaking
once it's a special occasion or you know
something like I said some different
circumstance I'm usually going to want
to split that up and get more items
because I am a firm believer that there
are many drugstore items that can rival
the quality of many high-end items so if
you're making smart choices and
splitting up your money in my opinion
and this is just my feel free to you
know disagree with me I want to hear
different opinions on this but I'm just
saying that I would tend to split it up
because I do feel you can still get
quality products if you're making good
choices of course you can take you know
there's always the scenario where you
could take 20 bucks and totally blow it
on some drugstore things that are really
crappy or you could get one you know
awesome item that you know it's going to
be awesome from a department store so
there you can go both ways or you could
turn out to be make an uneducated
decision at the department store and you
could have gotten a handful or nicer
things from the drugstore so in my mind
it's about being educated as the
consumer here I am saw you like in my
news lingo but whatever I think it's a
matter of knowing what truly is quality
and what isn't researching the products
and that is how you can make the most
informed decision as to whether or not
you can you know go buy more things for
a certain amount of money or you maybe
you're better off buying than one thing
so I would just love to hear your
thoughts on this I think it will be
interesting for other people to read
through and get your thoughts so thank
you so much for tuning in for this video
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
