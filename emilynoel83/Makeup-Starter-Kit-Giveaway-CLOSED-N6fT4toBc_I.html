you my updated makeup starter kit video
and it's gonna be a giveaway it's gonna
be giveaway to three people three people
are gonna get the entire makeup starter
kit that I talked about in this video
always honestly kind of frustrate me
sometimes because I know only a teeny
fraction of the people who actually
watch the video get to get the stuff but
I thought this kind of a video talking
about a makeup starter kit would lend
itself to something that would be really
fun to receive and something I could
really build off of with some other
videos my whole idea with this video and
the videos that will follow is that
you're gonna get a makeup starter kit
okay everything you need to create the
look brushes tools included but also
three looks that are gonna play off of
those products using only those products
of course many more looks but I'm gonna
give you ideas and three separate
tutorials that will follow this video so
I'm so excited for this I've been
wanting to do something like that for a
long time and I'm also planning this
around back-to-school time I always
thought of back-to-school as a time for
you know a fresh star and we're always
either wanting to do new makeup or a new
haircut or new outfits and things so
it's great to have you know a fresh
makeup kit for back-to-school but I also
realized that I am very blessed to have
viewers of all ages out there maybe
you're well beyond your school years and
you just need a makeup bag makeover you
know you could use these products as
well so I wanted this to apply to
everyone be something all of my
subscribers could take part in if you do
want to take part make sure you
subscribe to this channel comment below
with either something you're looking
forward to about the school year or a
favorite school memory if you're out of
school like me so please follow me on
Twitter and Facebook and I will have
those links below for you as well
actually make sure you get entered again
make sure you comment you can comment as
many times as you want if you're under
18 check with your parents and make sure
it's okay that if you win I can send
something to your house again three
total starter kits they're going to go
out to three different people I wish I
could give it to everybody but at least
you will if nothing else have the
information in this video
to round up products of your own that
are similar or go out and get some of
the things I recommend so let's get
started with everything that's in this
kit first off there's gonna be a bag of
some sort that you're gonna get I
haven't quite decided what kind of bag I
just threw these things into my own bag
as far as tools go I wanted something
that was convenient size-wise if you
have to throw it in a purse or a
backpack for on-the-go use but yet
something that would contain absolutely
every brush that you would need and
something that could be used to create
full looks again in the tutorials I'm
not using anything outside this kit so I
chose the Sigma mr. bunny travel kit it
comes with these two cups you get a
great powder brush you get an angled
blush brush which surprised could
actually be really great for buffing and
foundation I also chose this kit because
it's all synthetic meaning these brushes
will work great for your powder products
but they can also double to work awesome
for cream products to a great foundation
brush and four different eye brushes
including a flat brush a fluffy crease
brush a pencil brush and an angled brush
farce face makeup goes a universal
foundation that I like a lot is the
Revlon Colorstay whipped this can be
great for your picture days your dances
your extra important days but also a
foundation that I think really remains
looking natural and long wearing on the
skin the covergirl plus Olay stick
concealer this is a concealer bomb I
think this is awesome because it can
make a great concealer or almost double
as a stick foundation you're gonna see
that happen in one of the tutorials
powders I have a couple of
recommendations for this kit things to
steer you toward depending on skin type
and it's the maybelline shine free
pressed powder if you're very oily or if
your normal to drive skin something that
really works for everyone and has really
nice coverage is the True Match super
blendable powder from L'Oreal and all
this stuff that I'm showing you will be
the stuff that you'll be receiving you
don't mind partially used right just get
egg this is all my stuff you'll get
brand new stuff but this is the Revlon
Photoready photo ready bronzer and
bronzed and chic I love it because it
works for so many skin tones it works in
four different colors great for
contouring or just giving your whole
skin tone away see how about blush
highlight 12 eyeshadows and two cream
products the momjo
Robb Stark pellet it's gonna be part of
this kid I love this kit I thought long
and hard about what type of eyeshadow
thing to go with and I thought this
palette gives you so much variety in
here because you're getting four matte
shades you're getting a bunch of like
shimmery or pearly finished shades in a
variety of colors these will be a lot of
great colors working into fall as well
but what's also important about this is
you get one of my favorite
across-the-board blushes which is the
balms frat boy you also get mary lou
manizer highlight and you get a couple
of cream products here you could use on
cheeks or lips one's a little bit more
of like a rosy nude and one is a really
deep red so I just love this palette I
love how compact and travel friendly it
is it really is the whole package I know
I've been talking about this for a long
time but I really think it's a perfect
starter kit I don't so as far as eyes go
I'm going to throw in the Milani
eyeshadow primer I think this is a great
base that neutralizes discoloration on
the eyes I'm gonna give you the Milani
eye tech extreme liquid liner this is
that pin form liner that I really think
a lot of people should try the pen
really lasts a long time you're supposed
to store it horizontally and it's just
got a perfect tip there for getting
really precise liner and if you're a
beginner with liner that's a great one
to try I'm going to throw in two pencil
liners a brown and a black they're gonna
be from the Maybelline master drama line
so midnight master and this one that I'm
actually holding is from Milani but you
will have the Maybelline kind in bold
Brown in black I just think our two
great basic kind of liners that belong
in a starter kit going in an elf
one-dollar eyelash curler absolutely
love that for a lash curler and the
essence I love extreme crazy volume
mascara this brush is unreal is loaded
with teeny tiny bristles including
bristles on the very tip your lashes
will just be absolutely magnified with
this stuff I'm gonna throw in the elf
studio eyebrow kit when I was thinking
of something kind of workable for
everybody I thought well this has your
tinted wax and your powders some people
might just opt to use the powder to fill
in some people would like to layer both
like I do also the applicator is totally
usable you get a little angled
and a little kind of like mini eyeshadow
brush or lip products I was very
strategic I wanted you to have a nude
lip a red lip and a pink lip and keep in
mind you do have a couple of cream
products and here that can double for
lips as far as separate things that are
easy to just toss in your purse or
backpack and go the essence lip liner in
in the nude great all-purpose nude lip
liner can be great to define your lips
regardless of the color of look you're
going with so loving this maybelline
gloss it's the color sensational gloss
and almond crush this is kind of like
the new Revlon foiled for me this is
just great topping off any lip look you
do to add a little more shine and it's
absolutely gorgeous paired with this
nude lip liner perfect shiny healthy
pretty looking nude lip and then a
couple of really great like easy on the
go quick lip products I love this baby
lips from Maybelline in Cherry me it
gives you the perfect like red tint on
your lips without looking too harsh or
too overdone and for a great pink or
berry lip I love the Neutrogena moisture
smooth color stick in bright there's no
way I couldn't throw in one of these do
you guys know how much I love these and
I just want everyone else to know how
great they are as well so that is
everything that's included in this kit
