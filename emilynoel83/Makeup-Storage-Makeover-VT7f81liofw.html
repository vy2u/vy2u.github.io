for this video I hope this video is
going to give you a few little ideas for
how to make these storage containers
that many of us have a little bit cuter
okay so basically this is a really
simple technique using some hot glue
I've got my mini hunt glue gun guys this
costs like two to three dollars at
jo-ann fabrics you can find that kind of
thing at Hobby Lobby Michaels or
anything like that so you need a hot
glue gun and you also need some beads
and I just have some in here beads and
little rhinestones that have kind of a
flat back to them that you can easily
glue them on to and basically we're
going to create some designs on here
that that spruce these up give them a
little pizzazz make them not look like
the typical old storage containers that
everybody's got in their home stay tuned
i will show you how i do i've got two of
the larger rhinestones to larger pearls
and two small person so I've got my glue
gun now is renewing his gun and I'm
starting out with the rhinestones I like
to start with the thing that's most
centralized in what I'm putting so I'm
going to take the glue gun just put a
small dot of glue right there on the
rhinestone and set it right where you
want it on your container and you do
have just a couple of seconds to kind of
arrange that where you want it but after
that you can see there's not a lot of
wiggle room so again i'm taking the
rhinestone putting a very small amount
of glue and then just put that right
where you want i'm going to take one of
these pearls camera probably won't be
able to pick it up but there are small
holes on each one since these are
actually beads so i'm going to put glue
on the side where there is no hole so
that won't show just put a little bit of
glue and then BAM right there and and
once you stop messing with it i mean it
will totally solidify on there
these craft organizers are really great
as you can see there's plenty of
compartments that i'm not using I've got
my hunt glue sticks over here some
little googly eyes and big rhinestones
different colors different sizes to
allow me some options for some future
projects thanks so much for joining me
for this video let me know if you have
any ideas and he do it yourself ideas
for making your makeup storage a little
more fun to look at I think this is
really inexpensive and easy so thanks so
much for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
