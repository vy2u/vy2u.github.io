different Kaboodle's storage bags
I know Kaboodle's you're thinking back
to like some pink plastic case that you
used to have when you were like 12 or
something Julie the line has really
changed a lot
I would sent several things to test out
of their different makeup storage / you
know it could be a travel bag for you or
whatever your needs might be but I
packed them all up with my makeup to see
you know how much can they hold how
durable are they going to be and also
just you know how well do they keep
everything organized we're going to take
a look inside these bags and see how the
storage panned out and then at the end
I'll kind of review them for you and let
you know which ones I think are worth it
so here's what we're working with we
first got this train case style here
it's kind of a charcoal gray color it
has a quilted pattern there but overall
you know it's hard case here it's like a
polka dot bag with kind of large straps
almost purse I guess and that concept
this one here and I'll explain but this
tray actually goes in this bag and then
here we've got like this big sort of
see-through tote and it's filled it
comes filled with a bunch of other bags
inside so taking a look inside the train
case you've obviously got that
traditional Train case opening something
I was not a fan of on the outside of
this is that this you see that these
panels actually move in like I can stick
my fingers up under that you know even
though it's got these nice attachments
in these good corners and these here
everywhere there's one of these panels
you know you can press in maybe if
you're storing this in your house or you
know it's kind of going through some
very controlled travel that this may
work but be worried about taking this on
airline or you know just worried about
it getting kind of tossed about you undo
the latches and open this one up opens
up like a lot of you know typical train
cases look and so you've got one two
three trays here three trays here and a
big open segment here at the bottom pick
this one up sort of with the mindset of
like going and doing me
upon someone else or you know maybe
Bridal makeup and you've got a bunch of
different foundation shades a bunch of
concealer shades you know you're taking
more products than usual I thought about
just packing up all these bags with the
same selection of products but really
they're all kind of different purposes
and you'll see why as we go along but
just to show you what is stored in here
like I was able to put in a lot of you
know eyeliners and eye primers and
products like that I think these little
trays are just perfect for you know the
long liners and stuff like that in here
I was able to fit you know several
products deep I've got the Naked basics
there with room to spare so I put a
couple of little palettes there you
could probably smoke in some more
singles I also wanted to show you that
these are just large enough to fit on to
naked palettes here so that helps you
understand how how you know deep these
little drawers are you can fit two naked
palettes in there here I've got just a
bunch of concealer some little compacts
one thing to notice that these are not
large enough to fit say a regular a
typical face compact like from the
drugstore or a Mac compact it's it
doesn't get it all in there and
everything in these little trays really
has to fit down in there because it's
all going to stack upon itself so their
minerals stuff in there some like I said
little compacts and then here you know a
bunch of lip products as well so for
that purpose you know I kind of like
these these pull out Train case type
things because you don't have to
necessarily spread out all your products
all over a table you can see you know
fairly easily a good amount of stuff now
when we get into what's down in the
bottom thing I wanted to show you is
that some foundations can stand up in
here some are too tall so here like I
was able to fit in you know several
different foundations that can really
tuck back in there but the covergirl one
for example the stay fabulous is too
tall so don't plan on being able to
stand up necessarily every foundation
you have I was able to fit in a lot of
you know primers or eye makeup and
reverse moisturizers
down in this part over here I've got
like a Revlon foundation Mally primer
some of those things that come in larger
jars other things I might typically take
with me would be some eyelashes more
than that one pair also I like to take
this little bag which is full of like
you know q-tips and mascara wands and
just a bunch of little disposable makeup
items so it's kind of nice that that
just fits right inside here I could you
know totally take this out and fill the
bottom here with other stuff also this
is where I have my compacts because as I
said these little trays are not wide
enough to fit you know your bronzer
compacts or your powder cessation wise I
do like these trays and I like the
ability to you know open it all up and
kind of have easy access to whatever you
know ever keep in mind that the bottom
part here is not really all that deep so
it's going to vary on how many different
things you can really stand up in there
it is kind of cramped what I do worry
about is that the panels are kind of
flimsy and just the construction is a
little bit I don't know loose seaming
and I think if you're going to do tons
and tons of traveling I might look into
a more heavy-duty Train case for that
reason this next bag is really fairly
compact the type of thing you could kind
of throw over your shoulder it's called
the envy and it's got a nice big zipper
across the top here and what I hope you
can understand that it had of a hard on
panel almost right along each side of
the top so that when you open it up it
really opens up wide and it's basically
a big open space in the bottom and then
you've got a bunch of little
compartments on this side some brush
holder parts on this end in the side
you've got a zippered compartment and
right over here you've got a few more
brush holders as well filled this with
the thought of it being kind of like a
weekend bag you know like this is what
I'll use to put all of my beauty related
stuff in if I were going away for a
weekend so I've got like some face wipes
in there I've got a travel brush set and
then I took just my own individual bag
here and filled it with you know my
makeup product Foundation
concealer mascara all those kinds of
things and I just put it in its own bag
in the bottom here I also threw in just
a palette nude tude and then I put in
some hair supplies so I put my big old
can of tres and they just to show you
that that fits in there also a curling
iron this is a fairly deep bag so it can
fit a lot of thing to be aware of if you
rely on these brush holders is that the
bag does at this point at this level all
the way around bend down so if you've
got you know shorter brushes you may be
able to make that we'll see this tall
blush brush right here which is really a
standard size for a brush it is too tall
and it does get crunched the feature on
this back that I really like are these
little pockets here where if you've got
spray bottles and things you want to
remain upright they can for example I've
got my all nighter setting spray there
there's a hair product a lotion that's
the a body spray and I love that it's
kind of kept out of the way there and
just kept up right here you've got a
pretty good sized just mesh pouch there
where I've got some clips some skin care
combs stuff like that there are also a
couple of pockets on the outside where
anything flat I put a couple face masks
they're quick place to tuck your phone
if you want to so overall I think this
is a really handy bag I love that it
just doesn't I mean it doesn't scream
this is my makeup bag you know like when
you see some of these it kind of just
makes you think traditional like here's
my makeup and this just looks like you
know another form of like a tote bag or
luggage or something like that and again
you can be really creative with the way
you fill it up I mean you could
absolutely just throw your makeup in
there but I like the thought of you know
utilizing one of those smaller makeup
bags to just tuck it in and then also
having hair stuff and any other thing
that I would travel with now to this
little guy and the way this one came was
this you know opens up and this tray
sits down in there right down here you
see these little divided up areas yeah
everything is poking up higher than that
divider you see
so when this sits down in there when
there's nothing in it it can sit flat
and then everything can be closed up but
this I don't know this is kind of
strange maybe they're assuming that you
lift this out and maybe store this on
your vanity this little part and then
you could definitely close this part zip
it up and travel with it but in order to
take it with you everything in here is
going to have to be shorter than the
dividers and even like a little lip balm
sticks up higher than the dividers or
nail polishes or your benefit Sunbeam or
you know a lot of taller products as
well of the way you know this can keep
you a little bit organized and keep
products upright I think that's neat I
just wish maybe it was a little bit
deeper the whole thing was a little
taller so I could feel like I could plop
that in there and then go you know what
I'm saying
as far as brush storage goes it was
really a challenge to get this larger
Sigma brush in there I also could not
fit my Real Techniques expert face brush
you know how those are a little bit like
almost flared at the base and I couldn't
even fit it in there and you can fit
with your smaller brushes you can go
maybe two or three to a little pouch but
definitely it's not all the brushes I
would take and if I were traveling I
would probably do something a little
different there but just wanted you to
see how that was this upper case goes I
just wanted to show how you know you
could take like all your face stuff in
here I've got several powder compacts
I've got you know a foundation and when
this when nothing was in here the case
was able to close over this so your
stuff sitting in this upper tray can go
up above just a little bit I've got some
blushes and actually fit quite a few
like shadow compacts in here along with
some pencils mascara stuff like that
thing if you are going to store this out
on your vanity we all know how dirty
this stuff storing our makeup can
sometimes get and this is not
necessarily this kind of surface it's
going to wipe clean it's sort of a
fabric like a satiny fabric finish there
so I would be a little bit wary of
storing stuff in that just because I
know it would get a little bit dirty
over time not really thrilled with the
overall concept of this case but I can
say it really feels like the most
durable thing out of all of it like it's
this is a really hard exterior on this
case and like you really can't press it
in in any way like it's very very
durable just kind of strange because
there's not a lot of things you can
store in here that are going to be
shorter than the divider so you can also
get this in and lastly we have this and
this is our big clear bag and it was
kind of funny because as I was trying to
figure out how to pack this I just
thought you know there are countless
ways somebody could decide to pack this
one up because you can just use the big
clear tote you could use any number of
different strategies for filling
everything else up but you've got the
big bag you've got this bag is also this
polka dot bag this polka dot bag and
this little guy as well and then of
course you've got that large size bag
all fitting inside this and it does fit
in here very easily it's just kind of
like a little puzzle you know it all
goes in there and you can even fit more
stuff in addition to each of these bags
but here they have supplied us with some
brushes in here I am not sure what the
story is behind this one there is no
brush on it but just some kind of cheap
brushes there I don't know just maybe to
show you that this thing could hold some
brushes it could hold some short brushes
but definitely not big tall like
standard sized long brushes I decided to
do was fill these three parts with
makeup and then I've got some hair stuff
and other toiletry items here bag says
Kaboodle's on it and I fit in here a Z
palette the lorac Pro palette my Yves
pearl palette and several wet-and-wild
trios inside this little guy this could
be like a secondary type brush holder
for you if your brushes are short enough
otherwise I've got this filled with
eyeliners lip liners lipsticks lip gloss
actually fit quite a bit in that little
one and this again has the brush storage
but it's only going to work for your
shorter brushes this one like longer
brush is really kind of cramped in there
and you're fatter brushes like these
synthetic ones from Sigma do not fit
down in these holders and there is no
stretch on these by the way
so you're somewhat limited in what kinds
of brushes you can store there but here
I just put in like all the face makeup I
might use a moisturizer a primer eye
cream foundation bronzer blush powder
and concealer and just kind of made that
my my little face container this bag is
very uncomplicated this is a big open
bag basically it's that little mirror
there and I put so much stuff in here I
put a lotion my brush a couple of
different large you know full-size hair
products a set of five hot rollers and
my bag of like a lot of the little
toiletry items I take if I fly or travel
somewhere and also my airbrush legs
thought that was cool that you could
take you know something as extensive as
you like a hot roller set and fit so
much other stuff in there as well and
then it all easily fit in here I had
room to spare again you could have stuck
in some other little bags if you wanted
to this could be your whole makeup
storage and you could go with you know
jewelry skincare and hair stuff and
another bag just depending on what you
wanted to do but I just thought I'd put
it together a little differently so you
could get an idea boy do I have a mess
to clean up
I wanted to show you what each of these
bags ended up holding so you could kind
of better understand the capacity inside
each of them so here's everything the
Train case had in there remember I kind
of packed this up with the thought of
you know doing other people's makeup or
doing multiple people's makeup so we had
lots of foundations in there we had
compacts palettes you had a nice open
area in the bottom to do what you wanted
with I wish it could have been a little
taller
the little trays the narrow trays were
nice for the most part I think those are
great for your skinny items your liners
mascara
as lipsticks things like that but you
are still somewhat limited with you know
larger compact the second bag I showed
you that cute polka dot bag so there's
everything we had in there I kind of
packed this with the thought of you know
maybe a weekend trip and this is all the
beauty stuff I would take so curling
iron hairspray also some body products
or moisturizers skincare and then makeup
was in its own little bag inside there
this is the one that had the lift out
tray and keep in mind we weren't
actually able to shut the bag with all
of these products inside but given the
tray that lifted out and then the little
slots in the bottom this is everything
we had in the zebra bag and then this
bunch of bags that all fit inside the
one clear bag here's what was in that so
we've got you know toiletries and hair
stuff and rollers and everything like
that all in all I mean I was pretty
impressed with what each of these bags
was able to hold
I think the capacity on the train case
is great but it's just I mean probably
not the most durable thing my favorite
and the one that I think I'll get the
most use out of is the little polka dot
guy because I just think it's really
cute and it's so open on the inside yet
it does have some good little
organizational things around the border
I think it's just really really handy so
I love that and I really like this one
too the clear that holds multiple
different sizes because I think you
could go so many different ways with
that and just really cater it to exactly
what you needed and maybe just grab out
one or two of the smaller bags or take
the whole thing if you want to this one
I wasn't really impressed with just for
the fact that you know it didn't all fit
together like I said hope this was
helpful to you if you're thinking about
makeup storage and for some people I
realize this might be makeup storage in
your house for others it might be just
your travel stuff so thanks for taking
time to watch and I hope you have a
great day
get his reckoning
