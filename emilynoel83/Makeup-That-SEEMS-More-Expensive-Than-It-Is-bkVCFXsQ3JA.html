years off to a wonderful start and this
video idea has been kind of lurking in
the back of my mind for a while I feel
like I've very slowly added to a pile of
things that fall into this category I'm
talking about makeup that seems more
expensive than it is it might be
something about the formula or the shade
or just the way it applies it just makes
it seem like it's worth a lot more than
what we're getting charged whenever you
stumble across a product like that you
want to share so that's what I'm sharing
with you guys today
first thing is a primer that I've
started using quite a bit in my stash
it's from Catrice cosmetics and it's
called crime and no it's not called
crime it's called Prime and fine and
it's a smoothing refiner they say and
this is really almost exactly like
something that I have from Tarte
like a very very similar texture it's
super smooth it's got a little bit of
thickness I once used something from
L'Oreal that was a lot like this only
that was even more heavy feeling on the
skin so this still feels light I really
want to show this like in application
sometime maybe gonna get ready with me
or something but you see a difference in
your skin right when you put it on like
with pores with shine it's very
smoothing you touch your face afterwards
the the whole texture of your face feels
very evened out so I think this is
definitely a top quality product and
just the feeling of it it's one of those
things where gosh that feels like a luxe
really high-end type of texture in a
product you know it doesn't feel cheap
here's a current foundation favorite
that's really screamin high-end to me
but it's from good ol Maybelline it's
the maybelline superstay full coverage
they're reformulated extra flawless
looking foundation I'm wearing it today
I think this applies like a dream it's
got a great little you know pump style
situation here which we all love or I
think we all love it
do we I definitely do I have it in warm
nude which is just a teeny bit on the
dark side for me but it works so well
coverage wise like I blend this out and
I immediately start thinking of the more
expensive foundations that I have and
I'm like this is every bit as good and
it lasts really well on my skin
not saying there aren't other drugstore
brands that have good coverage
foundations like L'Oreal has that total
cover in the squeezy tube and that does
work well but you have to be a lot more
careful with the application here the
application is just very easy and that's
sometimes a feeling that I come away
with when I'm using certain high-end
foundations it's like oh it just blends
in super flawlessly without a lot of
effort that's the feeling I get from
this and the coverage is fantastic and
can rival I think most full coverage
foundations that are on the market so it
definitely seems more expensive than it
is amazing product here from a brand
that I think maybe isn't getting quite
as overlooked as it once was but my
goodness this is great LA Colors mineral
pressed powder they are bringing it with
a fabulously textured powder here I
think this could be powder foundation
for some people I mean it really is soft
and smooth it feels even a little softer
than L'Oreal True Match I mean it goes
on the skin so beautifully and buttery
and matte it's definitely a matte powder
but it only adds to the flawless look of
your skin it buffs in so fully and so
nicely it doesn't look really like a
separate powder texture on the skin I'm
just really surprised that for like I
think this is a six dollar five or six
dollar product that they are able to
give this luxe and this rich of a
formula in a powder like this it's just
so so nice and if you were wondering
there is a little sponge on the
underside but I usually just dab a
little bit of this on after my
foundation with my elf complexion brush
and it's just so so nice I don't think
you'll believe it when you touch it how
wonderfully smooth and rich this powder
feels this next product was like the
first thing that went in the pile when I
was considering doing this video and
it's from makeup revolution and it's
their liquid highlighter seriously so
much better than I was expecting one
thing that I associate sometimes with
high-end highlights but more often maybe
with cheaper highlights is a lot of
filler some Sparkle maybe you know
something that's just going to make it
look very cheap and unnatural and that's
not this at all I have the shade
champagne and this is the only shade I
can speak for from this line I don't
know if the formula or you know the
composition of the product might be a
little different in other
shades but this one you're getting a
good amount of product it feels like to
UM 0.6 one fluid ounces you've got the
dropper here to me when I put this on my
skin it just feels like liquid health
you know like it just gives the most
beautiful glow without a lot of like
shimmery flecks glittery flecks the one
thing to keep in mind is when you put it
on your skin
I would blend it out immediately like
and dab it on and then don't wait and
put dabs on the other cheek like just go
ahead and kind of blend it in you can
use your finger or this is called the
high cheek bone highlight from Sigma and
this is also really nice I almost prefer
it over the elf small stipple brush for
straight up liquids like this product
because the bristles here are so dense
you just get a really even blend but
it's so so pretty like I can't get over
it and I love as I shear it out on my
cheeks I don't start to see a bunch of
sneaky glitter and like really weird
looking stuff this could be a total
everyday where at any time type of
product and you just have this nice
natural Sheen it's definitely giving
like the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
liquids a run for their money
guys here's another fabulous thing it
seems more expensive than it is and it's
from Shanny have you seen this brand on
Amazon lurking around with their giant
palettes well they have a blush palette
here it's a six color thing it's called
fuchsia something and it runs around
twelve thirteen dollars but let me tell
you amazing quality happening here these
are such nice blushes and what's really
special about this and what makes me
want to like shout from the rooftops
about it I'm gonna hold it just soso I
feel like you're getting the truest two
color look here you're getting every
shade you need instead of just packing
it with like okay here's your palette of
pinks know you've got pinks a couple of
them here I'm wearing this one today
kind of a rosy pink you got a nice like
peachy coral a cooler pink and then down
here at the bottom three really nice
kind of dusty shades so your purest
colors are up top and then things get a
little more muted at the bottom granted
everything is really nicely pigmented
but I love this deeper peach with a
little bit of gold
- I think levels of a dusty rose shade
this one a little bit deeper this one
has a little more bronze but I think
everything is so wearable and would
definitely have
impact on all skin tones I just lightly
dip my brush in tap off the excess gives
me a beautiful cheek look but it's all
about the variety right I want the mix
and I want it to be something exactly
like this so I love that and the feel of
the blushes like I said you will not be
disappointed they feel very high-end I
want to talk real quickly about a couple
of eyeshadows that have really really
impressed me L'Oreal has been doing some
good shadows lately like their singles
especially the matte color riche singles
which I mentioned in the Emily awards I
think they're great you know how I feel
about those I do think those and
honestly many other drugstore finds that
I really really like those kinds of
products I feel like seem more expensive
than they are here's another thing that
they're doing really well if these
infallible paints metallic singles these
are quite nice and I have tried a couple
shades the silver and the purple when
these first came out and they're nice
right but there's something about these
neutrals that are wowing me and
impressing me even more I love this rose
chrome and also this topi shade right
here absolutely stunning they are so
smooth one swipe swatches here for you
and these shades are actually beautiful
together I don't know if you're getting
the full scope of how pretty that peach
is but it definitely stands out and I
was wearing it on my lid the other day
and I thought wow that is gorgeous
it's a beautiful golden peach and then
this can actually be worn in the crease
or you could do like a one shadow look
kind of smoky eye with this I kind of
wanted to have these on my eyes today so
I could really show you what they do but
I'm in the midst of a weeklong shadow
project that you'll see more of at the
end of the week but those shadows
definitely if you've seen it if you've
been curious about them in the drugstore
not that I don't like the flat out you
know foiled silver shade it's really
nice but I think there's something about
these neutrals that just really speak to
me last but not least a lip product and
I think I mentioned this lip product
sometime in the summer but I continue to
have such a strong feeling about them
one shade in particular definitely lurks
in my purse a lot of the time and when I
find myself doing that you know like
carrying around a certain lip product
all the time reaching for it constantly
when I'm like not necessarily on camera
but just in everyday life I think it
needs
extra attention in a video I'm talking
about these Broadway colors true matte
lipsticks got a met dollar general these
could most definitely pass for a
high-end lipstick for sure they may not
look all that special in their tubes and
the font there is gonna like yeah and
whatever it doesn't look expensive but
they feel expensive hmm matte lipstick
creamy it sets into the perfect place
for me where I really do not feel like
it's gonna go outside my lip line at all
it's even a little less creamy than like
a Maybelline creamy matte lipstick but
it still doesn't feel drying whatsoever
no sticky thickness or anything like
that there's just a really solid matte
lipstick and the shade I'm wearing in
this video is lemon pie so great for a
little pop of color there but the
everyday essential basic is nude rose
I'm sorry but this is the shade
everybody's wanting to wear right this
dusty rose kind of mauve a just
beautiful color I love that and I find
myself reaching for it all the time when
I just kind of feel like I don't know
exactly what I want to wear now I'm not
really sure what's gonna look best with
this particular eye look or whatever
this always looks right so that's
definitely a thing you want to look into
don't just pass by when you're on your
way through Dollar General just stop
give them a look but that's all I've got
for right now guys and give me a couple
months and I might have even more that I
can do on this topic but I just I love
it I love when I stumble across a
drugstore thing it's just so great and
can totally compete I guess you'd say
with any of the higher-end more
expensive things in my collection so
thank you for your time everyone I hope
you're having a great day and I will see
you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
