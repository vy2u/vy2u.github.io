one I love makeup
number two the Jolly Rancher jellybeans
are incredible
they are awesome and I highly recommend
them and it's going to be hard to keep
my hands off of them during this video
and number three is what's number three
Oh
Facebook I'm getting messages people
wondering why I'm not adding them as
friends and the reason why is that I
have reached the friend limit on
Facebook and therefore yet there's a
friend limit and I've reached it so if
you want to be my friend I have created
another friend personal page kind of
thing and you can go to that the address
is right here and ya go there and I will
have lots of fun updates people have
told me what things they want me to
update their like cupcake and you know
various random of the things in my life
so yeah please go to that page in this
video I am calling this good to the last
swipe makeup why do I say that I'm
talking the last swipe of makeup the
last swipe of the bronzer the last swipe
of the lipstick stuff that I have used
up or nearly used up that I have on hand
still right now so please understand
that there are more products than this
that I have used up I just don't keep
every container I've every juice so some
of that stuff went out with the trash
you know years ago I'm going to go to
much in detail on each individual thing
because I've honestly talked about this
stuff in a lot of other videos I feel
like anyway and I think what we can take
from this is that for a person who has
is large of a makeup collection as I
have and there are things that I am
using up like down to the last drop of
something I think that says something
about the quality of the product or how
much I like that particular product that
given a lot of other options you know I
might keep going back to this or this
product or that product so basically
these are things that I like I you know
just looking around at what all of them
are I would recommend all these things I
really like them all so I'll just go
through them let you know what they are
name is and I
shadow palette that I really like and
this is from covergirl and it's called
golden sunset and that middle shade it's
like a coppery bronzy shade
I like that shade so much it has been
just one of those colors that I went
back to time and time again whether I
thought it looked nice on my eyelid or
kind of you know up on my brow bone
really lightly that was something I use
a lot for this is one of my favorite
covergirl trios they have a lot of you
know different kits that I like but
golden I always forget if it's sunrise
or sunset golden sunset is a really good
one for mascaras that I want to mention
that I have gone through not once not
twice but at least three times on these
lash discovery from Maybelline you can
tell that the tube has more not there
but this is the tiny brush mascara that
I think is awesome for lower lashes and
it doesn't get smudgy on me and it just
gives it's such a small brush so that it
really allows you to get to those little
bitty lashes on the opposite end of the
spectrum L'Oreal voluminous carbon black
love this mascara for building body
thickening lashes it's a good thickening
formula it's a traditional brush so I
feel like it does kind of build body
really easily you know you will find I
think you will like this mascara the
longer you have it like give it a couple
weeks and the formula will thicken up to
just the right spot Almay one coat
nourishing mascara triple effect this is
one of those mascaras it's like a
two-in-one brush one side has different
kinds of bristles on the other side so
one is more lengthening and one is more
thickening and I think this is a great
mascara I think I first heard about this
one or was for kind of prompted to try
this one a long time ago from Julie G so
shout out to Julie G but she's awesome
and she gave that recommendation and
then Lancome Hypnose four-mile own
high-end mascara that I really like I
like I have tried Hypnose drama for some
reason I like Hypnose better not sure
why I just think it builds the body
better builds the volume and it's just a
nice little brush there and
yeah that would be my high-end favorite
we're talking about face products one
thing that I think I go through faster
than almost anything is bronzer because
I must say when we made the transition
to HD at our TV station I knew I didn't
want to feel like I was taking on a lot
more foundation because that can be very
visible taking on foundation it can show
on a high-definition camera so what I
realized was that not only were the
cameras more more high quality but the
lighting was coming off so much more
harsh in HD so I felt the need to use
more bronzer to perk up my skin and it
really did help you know it didn't like
take me into oh my god she's so tan mode
but I mean it just gave me a little
boost of color that really kind of
brought me to you know even like you
without it you look kind of dead you
just need enough to sort of make
yourself look alive on camera so there's
the backstory you didn't really care
about and now on to bronzers this is one
I just threw out the other one that I
totally like used all that big part up
but elf contouring blush and bronzer
especially on the browser side love that
think it's a great contour great deep
matte contour um another one that I just
recently kind of pulled out again that I
hadn't used in a while is the healthy
glow bronzing powder from ELF this is
the $1 one it's called warm tan and it
has shimmer in it and what I use this
for is more like you know a little
dusting of bronzer on the decollete area
and sort of around the neckline the
shoulders when you want sort of a glow
with it it's a little shimmery to use a
lot of that on your face chocolate
Soleil bronzer loved this from Too Faced
classic matte bronzer that is going to
be deeper than your NYC Sunny's and
stuff like that I love this it smells
like chocolate I yes I have hit pan and
I will be starting on a new one fairly
soon probably but I like to use them all
I like to really use a speaking of NYC
sunny how many people have this kind of
a thing in there Dru
right now lots of people love in my see
sunny when I use it I mean I use it up
so this one is like a little bit lighter
than the chocolate so leg is held up and
a couple more bronzers these are from
Rimmel and they are the natural bronzers
one is in sunlight that is matte
Sundance has some sparkle to it I've
used them up about equally so these are
ones that I kind of rotate around about
blushes now Milani minerals blush in my
tie this one is a favorite favorite
favorite favorite I love the peachy pink
eNOS the matte color that it has and the
color payoff is awesome I have a couple
that I love from covergirl one is called
plum berry glow awesome pink blush hit
pan on this and this is also a
repurchase one so I've had that you know
totally used it up and I'm now on
another one and this precious little guy
this is my covergirl golden pink of some
crack pieces just fell out oh Jesus and
thank you very much to the person who
anonymously sent me two new golden pink
blushes thank you because I cannot find
gold and pink in my stores anymore but
this is the one remaining golden pink
that I have in my collection right now
I'm kind of going like backwards in this
video in terms of like sequence of when
you put on these products but that
really matter does it
um Mary Kay signature loose powder in
beige one this is totally gone I think I
just had this now for sentimental
reasons because I have loved them and a
person uses up an entire loose powder
that's saying something that is a love
product because loose powder you have a
ton of loose powder in there I mean
loose powder is an economical product
that you get a lot of when you get it
and so the fact that I use that up
that's saying something also I got this
awesome powder from Revlon I got it from
Big Lots and it's called even out and
it's a yellow tone powder look at that
yeah it's used up right out to the rim
whoo yeah you can just use that other
side as a mirror now if you wanted to
but that's awesome that like I said got
it a big lots I have one waiting in the
wings now past that
have not seen those sold in drugstores
lately
also my ELF High Definition powder
that's kind of like your translucent
sheer you know just goes over the top of
everything makes it all look blended and
nice use that up completely and that
didn't take long
foundation wise Rimmel lasting finish I
have gone through three four tubes I
don't know this is a loved one though
because I rotate through a lot of
foundations and then Bobby Brown
corrector in bisque this is another one
that has just been used right out to the
rim this is like that salmony color
concealer that really corrects they make
your blue discoloration on the eye area
lips I have a red lipstick from Mary Kay
well it's sort of like a deep red I
think it's kind of a wearable red
actually and the fact that it is a
little deeper it's called amber suede
and there that is so funny to look at
this stuff again but yeah it's kind of
like a deep red I use this a lot on the
news initially and I don't use as darker
colors as much anymore
but this is a really nice unhhhh red for
when you are wearing red and it just
really comes off nice color fever gloss
and heat stroke from Lancome I just ran
out of one and this is my next one that
I still happen to have but this is an
awesome kind of metallic pearly gorgeous
neutral sort of finish and the drugstore
dupe for that is one that I have also
just run out of and it's lovely from
Jordana and this I've gone through a
couple of these but this is very pretty
and it's very much the same but just
kind of shimmery metallic neutral gives
that gives back to the face a little bit
brightens the face guys that pretty much
wraps it up that's the products that are
good to the last swipe in my book anyway
tell me what things you use up on a
regular basis I mean what things do you
find that you will use them right up
until they're gone
you know what I mean like you're not
going to throw them away with just a
little left you want to use everything
that's there
so hopefully this gives you some ideas
of some products I really love and thank
you so much for watching and have a
great day so it's gonna do cupcake cam
at the end of this as you can see my
little sweetheart is sleeping right now
so I'm not going to ask her to get up
and do some cupcake camp for me but just
know that cupcake loves you all dearly
and thanks you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
