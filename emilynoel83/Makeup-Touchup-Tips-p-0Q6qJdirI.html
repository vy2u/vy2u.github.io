for this video what prompted this
particular video was a really really
great question that I got about some
tips for touching up your makeup so
you've gotten to the end of your workday
like I have right now and then maybe
you're going to do go on and do
something else and you don't have time
to redo your full face of makeup but you
still want to look fresh a lot of times
people have the issue with putting more
on when they touch up instead of
realizing that sometimes you need to
take a little off as well so I'm just
going to show you a few easy steps with
some some really you know very few
products just to show you how to do that
basically I had to do this a lot
especially when my when I was reporting
full time and at the end of my day I
would have to go on air and present my
story but throughout the entire day I
could have been outside my hair was
getting blown all around and you know a
lot was going on so I really had to pay
attention to the effectiveness of my
touch up to make myself presentable on
air when I definitely didn't have enough
time to redo everything so first thing
you want to look at is your skin my skin
right now after a day of work I am and
and and again maybe everything I'm
seeing in person is not what you're
seeing on camera but I am really a
little bit shiny here especially in my
t-zone area that's why I've got these
elf shiny racer sheets here these are
only a dollar you get 50 blotting sheets
in there I've used these on Tyler before
they work great for guys who don't you
know maybe they don't want to put any
makeup on but they look like kind of
greasy you know mid day so I'm just
going to take that and sort of blot it
all over my face and this is just gonna
pick up that oil that's sitting on your
skin and the action of blotting is not
going to totally you know remove you
don't want to put this on in rub rub rub
because then you are going to kind of
mess up the makeup that's already there
but this is just going to take away that
oil it's on the surface so once you've
done that kind of all over your face you
can just trash that and then the next
step is just go ahead and give yourself
a little more powder just to kind of
give you that
Wallace look kind of all over again I
really like the l'oreal true match
pressed powders this one that I have is
in Sun beige and if you have like little
smaller brushes like I have a little
posh travel brush set you know sometimes
those can be nice to just carry around
with you or you can use the brush guards
you know for any brush really or if you
have like the Coastal Scents kit that
you can easily travel with that's fine
too but i'm just going to show you you
know a quick little little brush that I
keep on me and the reason why i would
say use a brush not the sponge with this
this comes with a sponge and on first
application that's fine to give you a
little heavier coverage but on a
touch-up you you don't want to take it
on again so you want it to be really
light that's why i'm using a brush like
this that is suitable for really
multi-purpose it's small enough to be
good for blush but it can be powder to
get a little bit on there and then just
kind of go over the entire face you know
concentrating more maybe on the areas
where you did get oily and you want to
go over that again but this is just
going to kind of refinish the face just
like that
I like this powder because it does have
some nice coverage but you can go
sometimes go overboard get too much on
so there you go just go over your face
like that then if you want a little pick
me up a little you know brighter look
blush and bronzer either or is great and
a new product that I just got and I love
so much seriously guys is the elf
contouring blush and bronzer which gives
you one of each and i have not been in
any time I've seen somebody present this
in a video I've seen it and thought oh
those don't look too bold or you know I
don't know if that's going to do a whole
lot or if I've seen pictures I haven't
even been too impressed but this is
awesome this is a great contouring
bronzer and this blush is gorgeous so
it's great also that they come you know
right there in the same pack so you can
use them side by side and not have to
use two separate compacts putting the
blush just on the apples of my cheeks
just gonna dot a little bit of bronzer
on there go over the contour a little
bit go over temples you know anywhere
the Sun would naturally hit and there
you've got in a little extra glow to
your face and plus this has a nice nice
mirror for when you're traveling around
doing touch-ups and stuff so there you
go you've pretty much got your face
under control next the thing that I
would concentrate on is looking under my
eye area and in my mirror in front of me
I can see that some of a little bit of
my liner has come down just a little bit
under my eye not a ton but just don't
enough to make sort of a smudge there
for me so I always keep the Revlon
makeup eraser pen on me and basically
what this is is I makeup remover in a
little pin and so you want to have that
but also a q-tip because this will leave
a residue if you just leave it as is so
you kind of put it over whatever you
want to get rid of then take the q-tip
so you are once again dry and now you've
cleaned up that hole under eye area and
then sometimes you can just use a q-tip
on the other eye because it's been
moistened or whatever usually I only
have the problem on my left I really
don't understand that
and then if you wanted to go back with
your powder a little bit take your
powder brush and just kind of dust over
the area once more that's fine otherwise
this pretty much works having gone over
with the q-tip you nothing's you know
wet there you don't want to leave
essentially eye makeup remover under
your eye in a moistened state because
then it's all going to go away so there
we go we're good on that um one other
touch-up idea for the eye is to just
keep a like a dark shadow on you black
brown plum Navy whatever you're
comfortable with this is max carbon and
I find that this can give me a really
quick pick-me-up especially if you're
kind of doing the data night thing I
have a two double ended posh brush here
and this side is kind of like the crease
brush and so I'm just going to get a
little bit of that color right there on
the brush and then just kind of go to my
crease and this is just going to
re-emphasize you know whatever was there
before actually need my mirror to look
down in here you know kind of recreate
your outer V or just go over your
contouring I really F whenever I'm
touching up I usually only feel the need
to touch up with the darkest shade not
everyone may be like that but when
you're doing out of ease and stuff
sometimes that can fade on you a little
bit so anyway just go over that a little
bit these two sided brushes are so handy
because then you can go with the bigger
end and kind of buff out the outer edge
again but that's just a nice way to just
add a little more intensity to your eye
area for evening or to just redefine and
what's so nice you get a nice dark matte
color it can be as intense as you want
it to be carbon could have been a lot
more intense than I just made it there
but I just wanted a little extra
definition so there you go and one last
thing doof to do to perk up your eyes is
to just reeker lashes just a quick hit
on each I will make it look more opened
up and take away the need for you to put
on more mass
Scarah again it's not always about about
applying more sometimes you don't need
to do too much at all and then to really
perk up your face go ahead and use a
brighter color on your lips maybe it's a
brighter pink or red I'm going to use
the Maybelline and I think this is the
what is this called this exact product I
think it's like the moisture wear lip
color in roseberry and so it's just like
a nice kind of pretty pink shade a
little more vibrant than your average
one put that on and suddenly your look
looks your teeth look a little wider
your face looks a little more polished
and everything everything just looks a
little more pull together and you know
kind of a little more defined and awake
so there you go guys that's basically my
tips for touching up your face and
looking you know kind of reviving your
look maybe it's at the end of the day
maybe you're going for more of a
nighttime look of course if you're doing
a nude lip for the day and you want to
stick with that just take whatever gloss
or lipstick you're using for the day and
but these are just some quick tricks
that you can do on them definitely on a
budget for sure so thanks so much for
the question and I hope this helps you
guys thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
