don't put it on cupcake hi everybody all
right welcome Tyler he is in this video
to actually do my makeup Tyler is my
husband in case you haven't seen him in
any videos before he is not a makeup
artist he has never applied makeup to me
him or anyone else he has overheard me
doing a lot of videos right actually now
that I think about it I think once in
high school
at a pep rally there was some kind of
thing where the football players put
makeup on cheerleaders oh really
that was a long time sometimes I would
have given me the suggestion that maybe
you should have Tyler do your makeup and
see how it works and so we're gonna try
that first off he had to go through my
big makeup collection and try to kind of
pick out whatever things he thought
would work you're trying to find some
face products I guess come on face right
now there are a lot of things to choose
from um if you guys ever wear got
foundation bronzer powder just overheard
okay he is picked out everything that he
thinks he needs he had searched through
my makeup collection to try to find what
he thought would be part of the routine
and I must say he's kind of got it got
it covered here question is can he apply
it that question you know we're gonna
try it anyway so now he is going to go
ahead and apply the products I am NOT
going to correct him or change anything
he might do or jump in and you
finish something from here on out this
is all him and what he chooses to do so
let's get started
whatever happens I'm sure she's gonna
wash it off before she leaves the house
Sara Lee we'll see alright so I guess
we're gonna start with a concealer now
you're learning how the camera works
that's clean out go ahead a flage which
is really fun to say which is why I
picked it who makes it it was but hard
candy okay it says it's a heavy duty
concealer apparently he thought I needed
some heavy duty work really heavy duty
we're gonna work this on any blemishes
or any veins that we see right sure may
be way too much I think this is what I
do every morning at 1:30 in the morning
next we have a foundation primer right
you know this is Smashbox photo-finish
light focus at the end maybe we'll have
a little discussion deconstruct yeah
we'll talk about ways I might have done
this and call it what he screwed up best
me the feeling is weird on my end ooh oh
my I'm wondering if I might remember
I've never had a full face of makeup
done thank you can yes you can just put
it I mean I'm not gonna say any more
shoes I'm not gonna say anything this is
my new Glee shirt oh I just got that
yesterday for $5 at Macy's
this is dream matte mousse and I don't
read the product when I Maybelline Dream
matte mousse keep in sandy beige she
picked out everything he he made all of
the product decisions you be the judge
go on with our powder this is Revlon
Colorstay pressed powder - Vicky wine it
everywhere I look like he's so white and
horizontal swipe from bronzer okay
bronze yeah elf
warm bronzer there's no brushes I don't
have to find one there's your brushes
they're right here you just pick
whichever one you think my helper here
now okay cupcake
we didn't review or don't guess any
techniques before before this okay it's
coming to me I want to do the spots
where the Sun would normally hit hey
I've heard that phrase somewhere okay
don't put it on cupcake focused mmm say
happy this is the mood boosting no this
is gonna make me happy mood boosting
blush oh yeah their first casualty of
the casualty of the day he broke the
blush well it seems like I should put it
up here that's right put the bronzer so
let's do it now we're using Smashbox
flash powder for what ma'am for what
purpose
highlighting
start with our shadow insurance
something he heard me talk about and
quite often yeah this guy enchanted
glamor land yes okay he's going dig it's
like a Disney movie hey that's cute
it takes a little focus doesn't well I
mean it just kind of you got to get it
kind of close just gonna apply it I
don't know what to say I'm new but
you're gonna keep your eyes closed
there's no turning back now
keep going
the luminous carbon black Wario okay if
you need me to look down or look up is
okay
it's were this q-tip you speak of all
right so he's all done here's my
finished hold Mike you asked for this
what did you think do you have a new
respect for those for the ladies that
are getting up every morning no saluteth
it's impossible what was the hardest
part for it's a very small space isn't
it to wait for your Island are basically
just run circles around your eyes notice
just kind of the some some of the
strokes you are using with your with
your hands who are kind of like a
instead of a padding sort of it was very
much like like me it is to even have a
clue as to what some of these things
were used for I'm really impressed
honestly the application I mean might
leave something to be desired but you do
have an idea of what products are and
where they should go basically except
the highlight it was so funny because
you were putting the highlight um down
here and and highlight would normally go
you know kind of on top of the
cheekbones but I mean basically you
really did have a good idea a good sense
of what hope you found this entertaining
because that's really what this was
meant for this was not a critique on
Tyler's Birgit skills so much is just
having fun or messing around anyone out
there actually learned anything about
makeup wow you need to switch to a
different video Thank You Tyler
it was fun Thank You cupcake for
visiting and have a great day guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
