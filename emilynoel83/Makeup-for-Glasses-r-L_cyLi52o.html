tutorial
especially for glasses wearers out there
you get into consideration some certain
techniques that I think really help your
eyes and your whole face really shine
even though you've got you know a pair
of glasses on beauty I think something
we see is attractive our faces that are
symmetrical you know one side looks the
same as the other side when you put on
glasses you're really adding one more
element of symmetry to your face which
is a really good thing you know because
your glasses are gonna be perfect one
side to the other and so you put those
on and you're creating yet another sense
of balance from left to right on your
face so if you can use some other
elements like really keeping the year
under eyes bright keeping a nice defined
and yet lifted eye and I think also
balancing out the top of your face with
the bottom of your face and a little bit
of color on the lip I think it can all
come together to create you know create
harmony really on your face even though
I have been dealing with pink eye you
know over the course of the past week it
was kind of a blessing in disguise
because it forced me to really evaluate
how I did my makeup with glasses what I
could do differently to enhance my
feature just how to get the best look
possible so I hope this is helpful to
you I've already applied my moisturiser
my primer and my foundation all over my
face that I am gonna change up in terms
of my under eye concealer I really want
this area right in here which can kind
of get shadowed by the rims of your
glasses I really want this to appear a
lot more bright so I'm gonna go to a
concealer palette that I like this one's
from Coastal Scents and it's called the
Eclipse palette I'm just gonna go to
this shade here which is you know kind
of light for me I'm gonna start from you
know this very innermost corner and just
really start dotting the product right
here and sweeping it outward you know
right under my eye I realize it does
look a little crazy now but
once we do some blending with this takes
it down a notch but we keep it really
bright in this area get all the way up
to your lower lash line when you're
doing this because you can have
discoloration all the way to that point
and you can see for an even more
highlighted effect you can continue it
you know right up your cheekbone here
it'll all look a little bit lifted that
was using a regular old foundation
gradually making sure that this is
highlighted and brightened next I'm
going to set that with a really light
matte powder and I had this kit from it
cosmetics it's called my sculpted face
you could also use you know just some
kind of light translucent type powder
just we want to really lock this in for
staying power so I'm going to go in here
to this matte color and really just dust
that all over this area and I'm just
gonna dust lightly all over my face with
something that's more you know right
even in terms of my whole skin tone I'm
using my NYX stay matte but not flat
powder and just using this going all
over my face you can kind of overlap
those areas they'll still the brightness
there will still shine through but this
is just in an effort to set everything
next I'm going to add a little extra
definition to the face I think there's
just something that looks really nice
about you know the fact that you've got
your glasses going on here but then your
cheekbones and everything else looks
extra sculpted it just makes the face
look so much more finished and pulled
together you can use bronzer for this
step or I'm gonna just go back to my
contouring palette finding that powder
that is you know a couple shades darker
than my skin tone I kind of go between
two different matte colors just make
sure they're mad and go back from your
ear here and pull forward and then to
make sure it's buffed out I kind of go
back in circular motions and make sure
we got it
also under your jaw this can be a great
area to contour as well just kind of
right around the hairline so we can see
right through and we've got that
brightness still coming through we've
got our cheekbones kind of standing out
and the last sort of face step that I
think is important here is some blush
and one that I love is my Milani baked
blush in coralina basically we don't
want the look of any redness
or blotchiness around the nose so
keeping it kind of on the outer part of
the face going sort of on top of the
cheekbone and working it down so we got
our glasses on a bed we can see you know
our face still has structure and
dimension but the cheeks still have a
little brightness it's we're nice not
taking it in too far so it's to take
away the lightness that we have going on
under our eye everything I've noticed is
that I feel like my glasses practically
like just underline my eyebrows I feel
like the brows are even more I guess
evident they create this whole framework
for my face even more so than when I
don't have my glasses I just feel like
here you know they're really coming up
and being emphasized so even before I go
in and do my eye makeup I am just going
in with this its new product I'm trying
it's from NYX and it's called the
push-up bra for your eyebrow I'm just
filling in you know a few areas just
kind of evening out the brow as a whole
just making sure it's neat even with the
other side and you can use you know a
gel to just kind of keep them in place
so this eye look is pretty easy it's
just all about kind of definition not
doing too much and keeping the
brightness in the right areas so I'm
going to be using one of my all-time
favorite drugstore quads actually this
is from Maybelline and it's the stylish
smokes quad and natural smokes I'll be
using this matte shade for my lid it's
this creamy color right here that says
brow bone and basically we want that all
over the lid I have applied a primer I
take it kind of right around the inner
corner as well and just brighten up that
whole area also gonna use some of that
shade to go right up under the eyebrow
as well again we're eyebrows kind of a
spotlighted zone brush I'm going to go
into this taupe shade kind of a medium
gray taupe and just apply a little bit
of that on the outer part of the list
I've got some of that shade on a crease
brush here just taking that back and
forth just basic motions right through
our natural crease of our eye next I'm
just grab any sort of fine kind of
pencil like brush just something that
gives you a lot of control with the tip
of it because we want to create kind of
that lifted outer V while not
bring up the light part that's all over
our lids so sometimes really fluffy
brushes can it can be harder to control
the product so here we're gonna keep it
nice and light on the lid but just work
out kind of a lifted look on the outer
corner for some reason I've noticed as I
wore my glasses and I can see I feel
like that lifted nature of the shadow
really does come through it keeps the
eyes looking kind of up and I mean even
if maybe your glasses don't follow that
sort of a shape I think you still need
that lift to your eye so I'm using this
shade that says outer corner here it's a
matte Brown again you don't have this
exact palette but I mean just these
basic colors I wanted to keep this
something that could be basic and
everyday but as you can see I'm working
right off the very outer corner of my
eye here and just pulling up as if I
would continue a line all the way to my
eyebrow and so just work in that zone
take it into the crease a little bit and
for a little extra blending I mean just
take your fluffy brush once again right
over that and you can totally have
control over how much you you buff that
then I'm gonna do a little bit of lower
liner but we're gonna keep this again a
really fine line really close to the I'm
gonna go to that dark shade with a liner
brush and this is gonna give me an
angled liner brush it's gonna give me a
nice fine line and I'm just getting
right in between the eyelashes I'm not
in the waterline
it's practically gonna be undetectable
to someone who's looking at you but that
is gonna give you know some more
definition upper liner and this could
totally be a liquid this could be gel
I'm happening to use pencil here this is
my Maybelline master drama liner I'm
keeping it really close to the lashes so
I don't cover up you know the the
lightness that we've got going on on our
list I'm just gonna curl the lashes and
normally I mean I love the impact of a
big false lash you know but I feel like
even if I really bulk up my lashes quite
a bit under the glasses I don't feel
like they have as much impact as just
you know a little bit of upturned shadow
does I for some reason they just don't
they just don't come through you know
the same it doesn't translate on the
other side of the of the glass go with
like a coat of mascara here on my upper
lashes I just do just barely a coat on
the bottom for the lips I think you can
really do whatever you want here
I think light lips are great if that's
what you enjoy but I also feel like
because the glasses and your frames are
making such a statement up here I've
enjoyed the way it looks on me to just
balance it out a little bit with some
some nice color on the lid to give my
lips kind of a reddish coral color I'm
using a shade called blush in brunette
from Maybelline Color sensational I'm
gonna amp up the red with a great liner
here from NYX it's the retractable lip
liner in red add a little bit of
definition there this is going to be a
real sheer addition to the coral but I'm
using coral reef from Revlon Super
Lustrous lip gloss and just do a little
bit of that here in the center of the
lower lip this is definitely a look that
could work without glasses but with
glasses on I mean there are some
particular benefits here I mean what we
did with the concealer I mean we can see
that there is you know glasses create
shadows the rims are going do that a
little bit here on your cheeks but if
you've got an extra bright area there
under your eye I think that does help
just make the eyes stand out a little
bit more and see the lightness that's on
our lids the lightness spotlighting the
brows right here I think helps a lot I
also just like the look and I think it
creates a nice finished look when your
face is contoured you know you've got
your cheekbones standing it can be nice
to have a bright lip paired with the
glasses kind of balances out the face
from north to south instead of just
thinking about what's under the glasses
I hope these tips are useful to the
whole experience did force me to really
think about how to make my makeup look
its best
under glasses I mean I've been wearing
these on air quite a bit too for the
news so think about a lot of different
strategies on how
keep your face looking its best even
when you've got SS brains on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
