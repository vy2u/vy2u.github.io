you a really easy and inexpensive way to
utilize these little hot pots sold by
Coastal Scents they are great great
quality single eyeshadows that just come
in a little you know silver pan there
and you know many of you probably have
palettes that these can fit into coastal
scents actually sells 12 pan and for pan
palettes like this one this is the 12
that you can put these into and they're
actually you know there they will
magnetize right there into the palette
however I know Mac palettes they will
not are not magnetic for these and
neither are like these little elf
palettes see they're the same size so
these are kind of a universal size for I
can't really say universal but they're
common size for eyeshadows singles but
they fit in these elf palettes that I
have but they didn't stick like
magnetize so I came up with a way to
make that work and I'm sure you guys
have maybe done this before or seen
somebody else do it I just wanted to let
you know that it really works great for
this purpose too I found on some of
these I'll just go through what you need
some of these elf elements palettes and
you can of course get these from islip
space com or I found these at a meijer
store when i was up at my sisters and I
mentioned these in a previous haul video
but you basically open these up and what
you've got is these little you know
silver slots for the shadows to go and
if you use the elfish the elf singles um
they actually have a magnet on the back
these of course do not there just Mel
pans so you need to apply that magnet
and so I went to my hobby lobby store
and I found these craft magnets for just
a dollar ninety-nine they're just little
round magnets with adhesive on the back
and so what I did was I applied those on
the backs of the hot pots and I applied
it just above where the shade name is so
like that's m10 I can still see that
there so that way if I want to go back
and refer to it I can do so and if I
wanted to you know take these and then
put them in shift them into the
palette the one that is magnetized I
could of course you know take that off
and I would be okay I mean it might take
you much to like stick a little
something underneath it to kind of pry
it off but I'm sure you could do it so
anyway I'll just demonstrate for you how
I'm going to do this this is the way the
hot pots come when you get them in these
little plastic containers so you just
take them out and grab one of your
magnets and just peel off the backing
just like that so now I've got such
sticky adhesive there I'm going to place
it right on the back of the shadow to
where I can still see the number this
one happens to be s 20 and then I will
just sit it right here in the palette
and yay nothing's falling out so you can
have these little personalized you know
for pan palettes and you know you might
say well you know don't you just want to
have a big one like a nice big one like
this you know well that could be nice
but this is also great for travel these
elf pallets are great quality because
you've got a nice big mirror to look
into and a little space for an
applicator if you didn't like the one
that they give you that comes with it
you could put something else there um
I'll just show you I got four of these
and so with these hot pots have been
trying out I was able to oops there's
little applicator fell out I've been
just able to create you know different
different quads and of course the great
thing about it is you can switch these
around you know make your own do it
however you want to so anyway that's
just what I've done here and then this
last one that I just put together kind
of a purple and gold look here so let me
know if you want more information on
those pairings I just kind of threw them
together but yeah it's just a great way
to use those shadows and make them
portable and really easy to take along
and those magnets very cheap just a
dollar ninety-nine at your local craft
store and just a nice way to extend the
use of those shadows so thank you guys
very much for tuning in for this video
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
