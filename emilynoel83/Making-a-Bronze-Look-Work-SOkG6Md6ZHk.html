bronzer and blush and things like that
and I've done videos where i show how to
apply bronzer and well and blush because
in the summertime you really want to you
know have that fresh look of being out
in the Sun without probably getting old
sun damage and things like that but I
think that sometimes leaves people
thinking well what should I do with my
eyes and my lips to really make
everything look pulled together and
that's a really good question because
you can have a bronze look all over but
you can really detract from that by not
using um eye and lip colors that bring
that out a lot more in your face you
know what I mean like really cool colors
can um sometimes look good if you're
dark enough skin wise but you can also
kind of undo the bronze and you've done
if you don't use the right color so I
just wanted to talk a little bit about
the look i have on right now the
products i used and why these are good
choices for um for kind of bring out the
best in bronze skin so on my eyes right
now I always let you see a second here
um I used a really great trio from NYX
and it is the colors are on get it open
here
okay the colors are golden rust and
walnut bronze and these colors are just
a great example of some colors that
really work with bronze skin okay
because sometimes you know yes smokey I
can be good but these really just keep
the face looking so warm what I did was
I applied the golden shade on the inner
half of my lid and the walnut bronze on
the outer half and then I kind of
blended the walnut bronze and the red up
in here and I just really enjoyed the
way it turned out and you know it's a
way to look really natural because when
you're when you've got that bronze skin
that makes you look like you just been
outside you know you don't want a really
really overdone looking I've it is you
know smoky and line the waterline and
everything like that you kind of want
something that just looks fresh it looks
like you you know done something with
yourself but it kind of fits the whole
bronzed thing so if you have other
colors that are similar to these these
are really easy to use and blend they're
so pigmented but um if you got golds at
home or if you've got you know taupe
shades this rust is very unique I had
nothing like this before but if you do
you know go for those shades use them
work them into you know on the lid and
on the crease outer v area that will
look really good and then um if you
think about liners go ahead and use try
some dark brown and brown liners a good
liquid liner thats dark brown that i
have on right now on my upper lash line
here's the wet and wild mega liner and
it's number 8 68 and it's i believe it's
just called dark brown and on the box
you get it in but it's nice to you know
take a bit take a break from black all
the time and use something that just
tones it down just a little bit and then
underneath another brown liner i lie
that i use on my lower lash line is this
Maybelline unstoppable in Cinnabar and
it's kind of different because it's not
necessarily the darkest brown like kind
of just a true brown shade like if I
like you can see that that's brown
that's not black that is just
straight-up brown so that's nice too
sometimes you just under your you know
on the outer half or you know do a real
fine line towards the inner inner part
of your I you know that can work really
well for you so think um think warm
colors think bronzes golds reds and
browns on the eyes will really bring out
the most of your bronze skin and then
lips um nude can be good new can create
a nice contrast if you do like a really
light colored lip and then your tan skin
shows through that can look good but if
you don't have super tan skin and you're
wondering I can't I don't think I can
pull that off very well go for something
just a little bit darker that has a
bronzy West color tones think think the
color of eyeshadow that was in the
middle bear think that kind of lipstick
one that I like is the Victoria's Secret
lipstick in vixen and this is what i
have on right now and it's pretty
natural but it is a you know like a a
rusty sort of color it's not bright red
it's not pink it's a very earthy tone
it's what I want to say and then I went
over it with um let's see i use just a
kind of a sheer gloss it's the beauty
rush gloss and iced teas it is it smells
so good it's one of those swirly ones
and this is just an example this doesn't
have a ton of color but you know we
don't want the lip look to look too
overdone you don't want look like you've
been just slaving over making a lip line
so just throw on some lipstick and some
gloss over it or under it depending on
the look you're going for the reason why
you might put the gloss under it
use that first is because then your
lipstick will go on much more sheer over
the top you can also use a lip brush too
so I just want to give you guys some
ideas of products you can use that will
look really great for summer that won't
look like you know you spent forever on
your makeup but it will coordinate with
a bronze skin and work well with a lot
of skin tones you know whether you're
really dark or your light you can wear
these colors these colors are so
wearable and like I said it doesn't have
to be this brand but any brand that you
enjoy that works well for you I hope
you've got some ideas on how to use it
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
