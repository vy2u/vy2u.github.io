this video this is the mother of all
holes for me really I had the ultimate
shopping venue not too long ago when I
had my meet up at the Mall of America it
was in the Sigma Store which was so
awesome I've loved all about the
experience so you can check out that
video but also at the mall and you've
got to do a mullah of America Hall right
so much fun I got to meet one of my
YouTube friends here Kristin game she
came to the Meetup and then we had some
extra time where we could just run
around and do some shopping and it was
really really fun I also got to meet a
lovely new friend named Kara who lived
in the area and just we just had so much
fun it really fun had some makeup crazed
shopping buddies now and then so first
off we went to Sephora and I just got a
few random things was one of those
checkout aisle influenced purchases but
this is actually like a little magnetic
stack of brushes see how they just
really cling back in there so you've got
one two three four different like
brushes or applicators here so one it's
like a really pointy it says crease
brush but it's really just like a pencil
brush and then the other one here is
actually a really nice smudger brush the
next one is a stiff angled brush this
I've used a couple times on my brows and
it works really nice and then the other
one is just a sponge tip so I don't know
I just thought this is kind of cool for
travel and the brushes actually work
quite well so it's kind of funny how
like the Sephora brand stuff kind of
tends to be the overlooked stuff in
Sephora you know you don't really hear
it talked about as much as some of the
other high-end brands they offer but a
lot of this stuff is just a little less
expensive and I had talked in a previous
hall about these outrageous Prisma
chrome eyeshadows I got one
it was the taupe shade and then I found
a couple more and these work in markdown
but these shades are so pretty
this one is outrageous metallic beige
and I mean just
just like pigmented shades I mean if you
like some shimmer these deeper shades
like the taupe and this this is the
outrageous metallic purple these can
definitely be like a one shadow look
because they're so vibrant when they
catch the light but they look much
deeper when you put them in your crease
so I'm just so glad I found a couple
more of those I got one of these jumbo
crayon 12-hour waterproof liners so like
jumbo shadow stick and my friend David
said you know these are definitely worth
looking into these are awesome
so I looked at all the shades and I went
for a color this is called lilac shimmer
and I just thought it had when i
swatched it on my hand I just kind of
fell in love with this shade it goes on
so smooth and it's just a really pretty
light light purpley shade with a lot of
shine to it not like sparkly glitter but
just kind of a pearly finish that I
think is really pretty and once that
sets - you can rub over it and it
doesn't go anywhere so I'm pumped to do
a look with finally at Sephora while
I've been messing around with lots of
different under-eye concealers I've also
been messing with the different like
setting powders and brightening powders
and things like that so I thought I
really needed to try this one this is
from Laura Mercier and this is the
secret brightening powder I think any
product that has the word secret in the
name automatically makes us intrigued
does it not
and so this just it looks like this and
it's got the little sifter in there and
it's just a really really lightweight
powder I don't know that I even notice
any actual brightening that it's doing
when I use it under my eye I mean I feel
like maybe it's mattifying the area a
little bit but it really seems
undetectable and I've used this a few
times already I think maybe I need to
keep using it some more maybe try it
with some different concealers and see
if it behaves differently but I mean I
don't really do you get a big
brightening effect out of this or do you
find it to just be kind of an invisible
setting powder another little tidbit
about me is I've never shopped in a
Nordstrom before I don't know if that's
a big deal to some of you or not but I
just I never had there's not one of my
down and I just haven't really sought it
out as glad Kristen was there with me
because she knows her Nordstrom let me
tell you so she kind of steered me in
the direction of some things I might
want to try and so yeah tried some new
things I was really interested to check
out like a really high-end foundation
and just see how it compared to some of
the drugstore foundations I love and see
is there really that much better you
know so we headed over to the Giorgio
Armani area and I did get this luminous
silk foundation it just has a five on it
is that it's a foundation with a pump
here it's a very liquidy kind of
foundation it goes on it does feel very
like silky smooth on the skin and when
we were sitting there the makeup artist
like got it took off half my face and
then put this on and kinda showed me the
comparison to the makeup I've been
wearing all day to this so I really did
like the finish of this foundation I
felt like it was giving my skin a really
fresh a really skin length look but it
didn't have any visible shimmer to it so
it's just you know the foundation as a
whole on my skin looked really really
natural and so she applied this and then
she also used the maestro eraser dark
circle concealer and this has a two on
it so I guess I'm doing this at five in
this I don't know and this is really
really liquidy I find and I if I would
have been thinking I would have applied
these today so you could see them on my
face but I will definitely you know use
these in a video probably like in an
application so you can see exactly how
they go on but I was really impressed
with the way they both looked on my skin
she also used like a liquid bronzer
which I was really intrigued by and I
ended up having to order that because I
guess it wasn't in stock there in the
store but it hasn't come here to my
house she not only takes me a while to
figure out like what I think about a
foundation you will never see me do like
a first impression review on foundation
because chances are after that first day
you know maybe something's gonna change
or I want to see how it really responds
to my skin over time and stuff like that
so this will be review material
something I need to keep using demo for
you that kind of in in the Chanel area I
got a couple of Chanel lip products the
gossamer and zero for I think this was
this might been called sparks or spark
I'm not totally sure but this was said
to be one of the most popular glosses in
the line my friend David against said
that Chanel glosses are pretty much the
best glosses ever in his opinion so I
wanted to see what that is all about
here's a look at a swatch of this I love
the kind of berry red depth that this
has it looks beautiful on the lips it
has a great shine great texture I mean I
really enjoy it I don't find it to be
vastly different from some of the other
glosses in my collection I love one that
comes to mind that seems comparable
texture-wise
is the Neutrogena moisture shine gloss
but I mean it's a really great gloss and
it is a gorgeous color I'll totally get
use out of it but I'm just you know I'm
a little skeptical of that high price
tag for one one makeup product and then
I got the Rouge Coco shine in 79
it says saga and this was in like a new
little display and so I saw this shade
and it just really appealed to me just a
really pretty classic pink I thought be
the kind of shade I'd wear a lot you
know I get my money's worth out of this
stuff so obviously you know great
pigmentation really looks like it looks
in the tube staying power wise it's like
the shine doesn't stay on my lips very
long but I felt like the color overall
did it but they do just look so
luxurious and nice and it's just fun to
have that frame of reference you know
when you're testing a lot of drugstore
makeup okay what would be close to a
Chanel lip gloss or what would be close
to one of these guys so did you see this
haul please don't think oh my god she's
a bed in the drugstore no I I just you
know went to Nordstrom first time it was
a special anniversary day I guess I'm
excuse me if I'm saying this wrong but
apparently Nordstrom has like this
little back section that on an
anniversary time you will have access if
you have a Nordstrom card to all of
these different
like little sets like a first look at
them I guess first availability and so I
of course had to get a Nordstrom card
that day to take part in these sales but
whatever just tons of neat little kits
and things I hadn't really seen though
so again with trying new brands I got
this little kit this is from Kevin a
Quan and this is the iconic I set I love
my Kevyn Aucoin books that I have so
kind of pumped to see what his makeup is
all about but this says the set includes
a custom 5 pin eyeshadow palette
featuring our two essential hero
products and it says like what all the
shadows are and it gives you what you
need to create Kevin oak wands iconic
eye look
so little pouch here you know nothing
too fancy about that but then you do get
this really nice little compact which I
have not used these shadows yet I've
just swatch them but I mean talk about
basic you've got a couple of nice like
Matt or pearly and then semi matte maybe
satin finish shades this pink has some
shimmer but just known to be some I
guess the iconic shades of his eyeshadow
collection so I'm really excited to try
that out and then you also get a liner
this is in basic black I give you an
easy mini brush do that little detail
brush so really you know prefer to get
kits when possible because I think it
just opens you up to more products and
usually a much better value another kit
that was there was the voulez vous
voulez vous coucher avec moi c'est soir
getting a little French going on but it
looks like this and I don't know what
the names of these are I didn't say
anywhere like on the outer packaging or
on the back of this exactly what these
are called
it just says eyeshadows and blush but
you get two blushes one a little bit
deeper kind of berry blush and one looks
to be more of a classic like light
painter are these four eyes shadows kind
of a champagne color a matte light brown
sort of a like a silvery cool grayish
color and a
Marie Brown so i swatched those in the
worst possible place to swatch it there
right here and I mean I didn't find
these to be like buttery smooth um
shadows like I was expect and finally
this looked so cool to me this is from
Mac and this little set it says face kit
by Rebecca Moses and this says kit in
brown smoke is what this is so I thought
this looks so user friendly and fun and
it does tell you what all the shades are
so I'm going to kind of hold this here
and look on the back and tell you these
two are lipsticks this is ravishing and
myth I love this ravishing shade I use
this the other day so pretty and I have
myth and actually a full-size lipstick
then you have all the glitters eye
shadow
orb eyeshadow under that is trying to
follow my little guide here
showstopper and smoked sepia these two
appear to be matte this obviously has
some shimmer and that's kind of a
shimmery one too and then the blush is
Melba I love this blush I mean to look
at it it just seems so basic but it's
really really beautiful I like how
there's a little like trapdoor here to
cover up the cream lipsticks and I like
that the only thing I had tried in this
whole bunch was the the myth lips and
then you get a brush and other than like
a mini eyeliner brush this is the only
Mac brush I have it's got a really soft
angled brush and then your lip brush on
the other side so that is my haul for
Mall of America I told you I was trying
some new things and I hope you had fun
watching that I also want to tell you
that Kristen and I exchanged some gifts
by the way Kristen gang check her out on
YouTube you will love her first off she
has one of these of her own and I think
it's like the coolest little thing and
now I have one too so all you fellow
makeup nerds out there empties my own
little empties it got a little wrinkled
in my bag but empties tote this little
bit and look it matches the room and I
can just keep this some
and just toss my empty stuff into it how
dota ly beats the current thing I'm
putting my empties in so I love that and
then she gave me just some cool things
little things that she thought I'd be
interested in one is this Walmart brush
this high def angled blush brush says
this is really good and so I'm excited
to use that because I feel like I get my
I have a couple blush brushes that I go
through and they get dirty kind of fast
and you know you kind of want a fresh
one for new colors you put on so that'll
be nice to have in my rotation Justin
thought I might like this Rachel K
mineral color control CC cream so I
haven't used that yet but I'm very
excited to I never tried any of this
Rachel K business so that's cool
gorgeous nail polish here this is from
Revlon and the shade is not a and this
is like a really pretty dusty kind of
smoky purple you can't really see it but
when it catches the light it has like a
little like iridescent shimmer in it so
pretty and as a fan of the professional
super thick lash mascara from covergirl
and she compares this to the lights
camera lashes from Tarte which i think
is a great mascara and so I've been
using this a little bit and I really
like my mom actually uses this as well
if she runs out of her Mally
so really nice little brush nice formula
so thank you Kristin Kristin loves some
taupe as do i and I'd never tried these
hard candy singles yet it says single
and loving it and this shade is
attraction kind of it like a deep bronzy
brown taupe you know one of those
universal looks good on everyone colors
and I about flipped when I saw this
beauty spoon if you can't get to it
Beauty spoon it she said she found this
at Walmart what look it's like a little
spatula you get down into all your
bottles that you can't get the stuff out
of it says the new smart tool that helps
you spoon out all your creams lotions
serums and other products I freaking
love it finally this was something I had
like I think I saw it on her Instagram
and commented on it but this just looked
too cool this little binder Kristin had
filled up with all her liners so it's
like a liner binder and look it has
to flip a page to flip so you could fit
like I mean when you look at how big
these are you could feel like a couple
liners and each one and just have them
all nicely organized thank you so much
Kristen you don't even know how
overjoyed something like this makes me
and I'm excited because I was until I
did this video I was keeping the stuff
you gave me in there but now I can take
it out and begin to fill with empties so
thank you everyone for watching this
video I hope you enjoyed my Mall of
America hall of America this was fun
the experience was amazing that I had at
the meet and greet thank you again to
anybody who came to that it was
wonderful to meet you
and I will see you again in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
