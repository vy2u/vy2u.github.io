anywhere in the room
maybe it's hidden kind of like Where's
Waldo we just flew in from st. Louis to
Minneapolis it was a quick flight very
quick just a little over an hour come on
now it has my name on it
hi so okay normally the camera I use
Kristen is the things on this site Silas
we ruin me so we'll just do it this way
um you need longer arm yeah Kristen and
I just got ready together yay yeah you
have a good time it's way more fun to
get ready together than by yourself
totally is and then we're going to go
down to the store later so I think the
last time I talked to Tyler he was in
this general position he's psyching
himself up I can thank you tell me he's
storing all our energy he's prepared
hi everyone I am getting ready to head
down for the meet up it's about 12:30 is
right now so yeah
Tyler the man in the camera this camera
will basically be attached to my hand
the remainder of the day yeah
where'd it come from
we're at
Wow you drive up replies
standing at the back of the line
where'd you guys come from today
so we just wanted to say thank you so
much to everybody who traveled in for
the Meetup because a lot of people did
travel home well some long weary
travelers and then yeah everybody had to
wait in line for a while it was a woman
said she flew in I think her name's
Patti and she tweeted me she asked me if
I made it home okay and she was like she
flew in from Pittsburgh that morning and
people traveling in from places like
Kansas City Iowa City Chicago a couple
people from Florida there I believe we
had some international people from
Canada from Canada all the way from
Canada Minnesota so it was just really
emotional for me too to see people come
and and just take time out of their
weekend to do something like this and
you know you had to keep things moving I
had to go out and do it through the wine
and I actually had some in-depth
conversations with people was really
quickly spent some time talking to the
people that watch the video so really
fun and really nice and we also have to
spend some time with Kristin Kristin
game who is so fun and and she it's
really nice for us to hang out because
she could talk makeup but she can also
talk sports yes like nobody's business
just a new friend you know in my life
that I'm so um so happy to have met and
she is just goodness you do also to the
people who brought in gifts not just any
golf balls or pro-v ones those are
expensive amazing five bucks a pop so
thank you for your thoughtfulness we
just sincerely want to thank you so much
thank you to Sigma and everybody who had
in here
in making this possible it felt like
they pulled out all the stops and just
made us feel so so cared about and just
part of the family and that generosity
is just so appreciated yeah a lot of
little things that they just went the
extra mile on having flowers waiting in
the hotel room when we got there which I
of course appreciate very boy and every
person on that team just felt like you
know somebody like a friend we've hung
out with I I just enjoyed them so much
and enjoyed the whole experience so when
you go to the Mall of America you kind
of have to do a whole right isn't it
like mandatory I know I always do but I
got a bunch of makeup stuff from the
mall and so that will be kind of a
sequel to this video is my mole of
America haul so I hope you guys tune in
for that
thank you again I know there are people
who wanted to come but just couldn't
make it thank you for having any remote
interest in being part of the event it
really really truly meant the world to
us it was it was awesome thank you to
everybody so thanks guys we'll talk to
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
