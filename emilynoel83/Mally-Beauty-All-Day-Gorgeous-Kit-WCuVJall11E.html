for this video this is going to be a
rundown of the Mallee all day gorgeous
kit I mentioned this in my Christmas and
birthday hole I was wearing a lot of
these products in that video so if you
were interested in how to actually put
those on in this video I'll explain
what's in this kit how to wear it and
sort of my overall impressions of this
brand from what I've tried so far this
is the only stuff from the brand that I
have tried and I must say I'm really
really impressed with it this is
intended to be very high-performance
long wearing makeups are the color
products you will use your blush your
eyeshadow and your lip color so not only
do you get the products themselves but
you get a nice little pamphlet
explaining exactly how to use them all
that's Malley
you may recognize her from QVC that's
where I got this kit QVC calm go to that
website if you want more information but
this little pamphlet is really nice
because it walks you through exactly how
these products are intended to be used
and there is a real method to using this
makeup because like I said it's not just
putting on the blush it is a certain way
to do it to make it really laughs here's
a quick look at the kit this is what
you're getting you've got it it holds
everything so this is everything that
comes with it you've got your long
wearing lip color and a gloss that goes
over that that volumizing waterproof
mascara a long wearing shadow stick and
this is a plum colored eyeliner right
here on the other side you've got your
applicators a double-ended sponge tip
applicator which will be used for the
whole process of setting the eyeliner
and making that really long wearing and
then you've got a double-ended
synthetic brush and a brush in here that
you would use for the blush product but
I'll explain why I wanted to use that a
little bit differently coming up in the
inner pocket here it holds both of your
compacts one of them holds your blush
this is a cream blush right here and
then your powdered so those work
together to create that really long
wearing look and then you also
have an eyeliner this is sort of like
your eyeliner assistant here so you've
got your liner pencil and then you will
use the white side to sort of set that
liner in the darker side to really amp
it up and make it smoky if you want to
so here's how I used all the products
all right guys excuse the wet hair I
just took a shower I just want to get
you up to speed on what is on my face
right now because the Mallee all day
gorgeous kit is a color cosmetics kit so
I've got all my foundation and concealer
and all that stuff already on I used my
Revlon Colorstay foundation my shade is
fresh beige especially this time of year
it's a little bit lighter I use my
benefit erase paste under my eyes my Too
Faced it's a new powder I've been
testing out the amazing face skin
balancing flexible coverage it's
actually a foundation powder but if you
want a little more coverage like I kind
of mainly use this around my t-zone area
so I think a foundation powder is
actually alright to use there and then I
just dust it over everything with a
little bit of my hard candy bronzer in
heatwave this is a great great bronzer
it does have a little shimmer and glow
to it but everything else on my skin was
so mad I thought it could handle that so
we move on to this kit and the next
thing I would do if I was doing my face
would be the cheeks so from here on out
everything that goes on my face from
lips to eyes to cheeks is going to be
from the all-day gorgeous kit from
Malley so this is the way the cheek
product looks and you open it up and
you've got your cream cheap product and
then the powder and there's a brush
that's given to you designed to use this
and I did try using this in first which
is recommended for the cream product but
I just didn't feel like it melted into
my skin as well so I use my fingers for
that part and then I'll use this side of
the brush for the powder but it's a
really pretty just kind of fresh pink
look and I had this on in my big
Christmas birthday haul a lot of people
ask me what was on my cheeks what was on
my lips and it was all from this kit so
I'm just gonna kind of swirl my finger
in there a little bit get some of that
color on there and
. it starting right on the apples of my
cheeks and so you just kind of dotted on
blend it out and a little bit of a
circular motion and you'll see what I
mean in terms of the heat of your hand
making that more blendable so the idea
here is that layering a powder over the
cream is going to make it live so much
longer I got the cream on this cheek as
well and then I'm going to go into the
powder you're gonna use the brush that's
given which is just fine for blush and
I'm just gonna top that off just going
to put the blush where I normally would
kind of lay it down on the apple of the
cheek and then direct it back and you've
just got this pretty pink glow to your
cheeks now and this blush does have a
hint of shimmer very very subtle on
there's not a lot but there is just you
can see as I move it in front of the
camera the slightest glow to this so be
aware of that it's nothing that I think
is gonna make you look glittery but
definitely like the effect so I forgot
there's no brow product but everything
else for the eyes is in here the thing
that I wanted to point out is that she
has a shadow stick and it's not like a
whole pallet eye shadows it's just a
shadow stick and this shade is called
dusk and that's a really pretty taupe
with the most gorgeous sparkle and if
you like swatch this on your hand you
cannot get it off until you use some
kind of makeup remover or soap to get it
off because it really is long wearing so
I'm going with no primer and I'm just
gonna put this on my lid I'm gonna draw
it on straight from the product and you
can see how gorgeous that color is it's
kind of like a rosy taupe almost it just
has that slightest hint of a rose tone
and I'm just getting that all over the
lid and then as soon as I get it on
there you've got a little time to sort
of work with it and so I just kind of
blot over it with my finger and sort of
just gently work that to the crease and
it's just the most simple you know kind
of one-step eye thing and if you're on
the go and you're in a hurry I mean this
is a great way to get a nice pretty she
long
sheen on your eye that's not gonna
crease and fade on next up malli has a
system for long wearing eyeliner it
involves the liner pencil this powder
and this applicator so I'm going to show
you how to go through that step on one
eye and then I'll just repeat it on the
other eye
but this shade it's perfect plum is the
liner and it has the appearance of sort
of like the same style of liner as say
the ones from Urban Decay that kind of
thing and so what I'm going to do is
just line my upper lash line with that
so I've gone along my upper lash line
with this plum eyeliner and my one
complaint about this is that it's just a
little bit dry and I wish it was kind of
dark darker shade maybe like that if
this was double in and then I can use
this pretty plum on the bottom but I
want generally want something darker on
the top now the second step is kind of
going to correct that a little bit for
us but if I were just choosing to use
the liner itself I wish it was just a
little darker but it's it is really
still a pretty shade now I'm going to go
underneath the lower lash line with this
as well as take the special secret
setting formula the white side of the
split pan powder and use the fat end of
the double-ended sponge gently and
gently but completely set and cover the
entire area that you mind okay so this
is not just a white eyeshadow this is
used to be a setting powder so I'm using
the wide tip then I'm just going right
over the top of that and basically this
is going to act to seal in that liner
and I'm gonna do it on the upper and the
lower lash line because remember I put
the plum down here as well and next she
says to kind of bring back the intensity
there is a really really I think it's a
very very deep dark plum shade right
here and you use the other end of the
applicator so if you're a fan of sponge
tips which do give you a lot of control
I think for you know for the masses of
people out there I think this is going
to be an easy thing to do you just take
that smaller tip with some of the dark
powder and go right back over the top
and what this gives you is
kind of a nice actually if you enjoy a
plumb smoky eye or I'm sure you could
get this sort of thing in other shades
in her collection this is really nice
because it it takes your liner from
being really harsh and just a harsh
straight line to being kind of that
smudged out smoky look and so I'm going
to use that powder again on the lower
lash line and you could wing that out
some more if you wanted to or you could
even use a little of that powder in your
crease if you want that just to go by
the directions this time now you've got
this pretty plum smoky look and you can
use that that applicator to further
smudge this out if you want to use that
darker shade as a sort of an eye shadow
if you want a little more in the crease
on top of the shadow stick I'm just
taking my essence of beauty fine crease
brush and just kind of taking it right
there to my crease to give me a little
more intensity the next step is the
volumizing mascara so before I do that I
definitely want to curl my lashes got my
ELF eyelash curler here so I'm going to
do that this is actually the waterproof
volumizing mascara so you can see the
brush there traditional brush no rubber
bristles they kind of spiral around the
brush and then I'm just going to get
that going on the base of my lashes I am
in love with this formula because it is
it really like you put it on your brush
it really clings to the lashes it is not
wet it is creamy you can see how my
lashes just built up they're so fast
and this doesn't happen with a lot of a
lot of mascaras for me so instantly from
the first time I tried it it had this
effect there wasn't that waiting period
where you know okay this mascara is
going to really get good in a couple
weeks so just bear with it you know
because sometimes formulas need to dry
out a little bit but this just started
with a great great consistency there and
I just really love the length it gives
the thickness and it is waterproof and
it does stay very flexible feeling
throughout
a little bit on the bottom lash this is
right you can really see the difference
this is made from one eye to the next
which eye do you want to have I think
this one but I'm going to go ahead and
finish up the other side and then I'll
show you how to do the one of my
favorite parts of this kit is the lip
color and so it's basically a two-step
thing it's all this kid is all about
being long wearing and this first shade
is called modern mom and I love this
format I love the jumbo lip pencil
because it's more uni it's less work
than a typical liner is when you want to
fill in your whole lips but it's more
precise and more control than just
taking a lipstick on there so I love
this and I absolutely love this shade I
was wearing this in my again in that
haul video I was doing and just
basically go all over your lips with
this it's it's so easy I mean I just
love this format for putting on lip
stuff it doesn't have to have a point I
mean it is kind of a rounded tip but you
have all the control you need and if you
are worried about feathering outside the
lip line or anything like that this
really does stay so put that on I mean I
already did my brows but at this point
you know go on and do something else
with your makeup or or whatever you need
to finish up come back in like a couple
of minutes and we'll put on the gloss
did I mention the lip color actually
smells like sugar cookies it's amazing I
love that and then you take the clear
gloss and you just top it off here once
you kind of feel like they're done once
your lips feel just a little bit dry
with the long wearing lip color on there
just take this over the top and this is
such a comfortable gloss I feel like
sometimes these these duo's sometimes if
you have a gloss to put on top it's kind
of sticky or it's the exact opposite and
it's running off your lips this just
holds on your lips but it doesn't feel
too sticky and it gives you the most
beautiful shine so my overall
impressions of this kit I think it is
really awesome I mean I enjoyed it to
the point where the other day I saw
another Mally kit offered on QVC and I
went ahead and ordered it because I was
so happy with what was in this kit
um I just to point out kind of overall
what I thought I loved the lip duo here
I think that is a gorgeous look and I
almost feel like that gloss you
initially put it on and it feels a
little slippery but then as you wear it
I feel like it really adheres to the
lips and you hardly know it's on you
know you've got a pretty gloss on but
it's so long wearing I'm just really
really happy with that lip color and how
it wears so I would love to try more of
those the mascara is awesome you saw how
it really beefed up my lashes really
quickly and the interesting thing is it
stays feeling so flexible throughout the
day so it's really light on your lashes
and it doesn't weigh them down at all
the shadow stick I enjoyed that I
thought that was a really pretty color
and keep in mind you can use that as a
base with any of your eyeshadows that's
the thing that's kind of unusual you get
a full color kit but there's no actual
eyeshadow in it you know it's the
shadows stick and it's meant to be kind
of quick and easy to use but that shadow
stick is really long wearing the
eyeliner was sort of I wished it would
have been a little darker just right out
of the off the product once you add on
that other second step yes you can make
it darker and smoky but if you just
wanted to wear the liner as is you know
I wish it would have been a little
darker however that second step I've got
to say I love how you can get a smoky
look really you know smoke out your
eyeliner you can do it much more intense
than I ended up doing it with this look
but you can also make it something
that's really going to last I mean that
is gonna lock in there and stay so I
love that love the blush wasn't so nuts
about the blush applicator because like
I said I like to use my fingers to apply
the cream blush not this this side could
have been a little bigger but it will do
but I absolutely love that pink that it
gives you on your cheeks and the fact
that it lasts is great so overall very
very impressed with the malli makeup
that I've tried like I said I'm gonna be
trying more in the future let me know
what you think if you've tried this
brand of makeup if you have any likes or
dislikes or product recommendations for
me please let me know and thanks so much
for watching have a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
