me I know it seems like a long time ago
I did my big review video on a bunch of
different Avon products I was trying now
I bring you the mark items mark is kind
of that brand that's under avons
umbrella but it really is you know a
makeup line in itself so I just wanted
to tell you a little bit about some of
the products I've been trying I had a
good amount you know in this video to be
able to talk about everything and just
give you a big chunk of it for me and
just so you know most of these things
were sent to me for review I know you
guys know that doesn't play into my
opinion of them but just want to put
that out there first thing I want to
mention is a really unique unusual
product and I've actually found that a
lot of these products are pretty unique
but this is the touch and glow shimmer
cream cubes all over face palette and I
have it in warm glow so it's got this
very mirrored rose gold type compact
here and it opens up and you've got
these little cubes been around for some
time and I've been really curious about
it and when I got it I just assumed that
this was sort of a powder compact but
really you can actually like press these
down they're like a almost a really
solid cream type texture well I think
that's cool and I think this can give a
really radiant look sometimes I feel
like with my brush I don't really pick
up a lot of the product on it you know
what I'm saying like I do when I run my
fingers over it see all that glow and
then I might just kind of DAB that you
know on my cheeks and get a little bit
of shimmer and glow that way but with a
brush I'm not quite sure what the best
way is to use it so maybe if you've
tried this you know what's your favorite
way to work with this stuff but I could
see each of these being you know like
their own little eye shadow maybe you
know they've all got a little different
tone to them golds and bronzes so I
think it's pretty I just want to know
the best way to take advantage if the
actual color pay another thing that I
really do like and it's another unusual
I thought it was powder but it turns out
it's kind of a creamy product and it's
the on the dot I color compact I
freaking love this this is so cool I've
got it with a bunch of topes and purples
in it and again I just thought okay it's
a typical you know little eye shadow
palette but these actually have like
when you swatch them
you put your finger in there they've got
an actual creamy texture to them I don't
know if it's some sort of half-and-half
percentage on this like it's partial
green partial powder but it really seems
to be the best of both worlds because
you get the color payoff and the lack of
flakiness and fallout that a cream gives
you but yet I'm still able to pull out
like a classic blending brush and blend
out my eye look and get it just as
blended as I wanted to in wearing the
look today I'm pulled in let's see one
of these lighter shades on the inner
part of my lid I use this dark plum in
the outside a little bit of this deeper
taupe but to blend out that plum just
above the crease and just really really
like the effect they apply very nicely
with a sponge tip but I can pull in a
brush and get a really good effect too
there's an itty bitty mirror down here I
kind of wish there was a bigger mirror
up top but at all I would really like to
try more of these because I think that's
such an unusual texture and that it's
blendable like a powder but just
pigmented and rich like a cream it's so
cool I'm gonna pop open my Unni palette
this is not an Avon thing but it's just
where I'm keeping some of these other
products and I want to talk about these
eyeshadows now these are the singles
that I think you can get and like you
can buy a Marc compact if you want to to
put them in like four of them or duo's
or I'm not sure exactly on the side
these are like classic powder eyeshadows
okay so nothing really unusual about
these they are really nicely pigmented
if you see just you know touching the
product that's the kind of color I'm
getting off okay I really like this deep
purple especially sometimes brands I've
said this before but don't they don't
always seem to get purple right and this
plum is so rich it's called Piccadilly
and it's a matte purple and it's just as
rich as can be actually like pairing
that with this taupe taupe and purple
try that duo if you haven't already very
pretty soft light too nothing wrong with
any of these the taupe and the purple
are just kind of my personal favorites
but really just impressed by those I had
no idea you know mark was putting out
shadows that were so vibrant kind of
little goes a long way type product out
this open for you really pleasantly
surprised by these blushes too this is
charmed this
Kichi shade and this is dollhouse look
at these blushes in the compact I'm like
maybe there's a satin finish I'm not
really sure but really they're matte
blushes and really nicely pigmented at
that and you can see for yourself and
swatches obviously you'd wear them more
sheer doubt on your cheeks but it's like
where is this stuff been why haven't I
tried the else that I really wanted to
love but I got to say I just don't love
it that much are these gloss works see
how many I've got here and something I
instantly loved about them is that they
are so true to color like this this
purpley color looks just like that you
know this pink the coral very full color
like what you see is what you get that's
great
the texture of these though is thick and
I think it's pretty sticky I've got kind
of a tolerance for a certain amount of
stickiness but I feel like these are
just not SuperDuper comfortable on the
lips I will compare it to this thing
that I picked up which has the glow baby
glow hook up lip gloss this texture I
find to be much much more comfortable
umm it's smooth it almost feels a little
bit moisturizing and these are just so
thick I think if you're in love with one
of these shades you might be willing to
get past that but just on the verge for
me if not being something I want to wear
on my lips for an extended period of
time I will run you through what these
colors are if you're interested this
purplish shade is called Lola and it's
just a nice creamy purple there's just a
little bit of shimmer in there the
peachy shade is called tropica and
that's just a straight-up creamy peachy
coral this bright creamy pink is called
tempest and then I've got two more
neutral so that's more pink is called
parasol and then this other one that has
maybe a little more neutral II deeper
tone to it is called Roseland let's talk
about this by the way this was something
I just ordered myself out of curiosity
it's one of those hook ups so you can
get a couple of products you get the
little connector and then they just snap
in and you could combine any two
products you want I just randomly chose
a couple I got this gloss which is in
girly girl this magenta gloss which I am
wearing on top of something else which
I'll get to in a second and then I got
the scandal a hookup mascara I'm wearing
the mascara too I also have some false
lashes on surprise
but this is a traditional brush mascara
I like it for its ability to not get
clumpy and kind of cling to each lash
it's not a super wet formula so I do
enjoy that however I feel like after a
little time passes like after it's spent
I don't know a couple minutes on my
lashes I can see the curls start to give
your lashes are not curl resistant this
may be no issue for you but for me mine
are very straight so I have that problem
a lot but overall I do like the idea
that you can combine a couple of
products there you could put like two
glosses on or they have a bunch of
different product options but I do
really like this lip gloss it is so
smooth is a little bit minty I think I'm
getting a little bit of a minty smell on
it but it's not one of those you know
like knock your face off mints I don't
know knock your face off um I like it I
like this gloss texture actually reminds
me a lot of the regular Avon glaze where
glosses so really good stem really
loving for the vibrant color and talked
about this before is the make it rich
lip color crayon this is what I'm
wearing under that gloss these are not
like lip butter type moisturizing like
Neutrogena color stick those kind of
things you like I'm getting a bunch of
hydration out of these these are purely
like vivid kellen a is this pinky
fuchsia color that I think is so
gorgeous it's got shimmer if you wear it
alone it looks just a little bit
metallic I've got more of a neutral
shade here called hey honey not a huge
fan of that it's just so brownish that
shade I don't see myself wearing it a
lot but another really festive one I
think for the holidays is this one
called hot sauce and it is a you know a
vibrant red I think it's got it's not so
much a blue based red it's got a little
bit of orange e undertone there but
really bright and pretty finally I have
some of these no place to run long wear
eyeliners the story on these for me is
that when I first got them they were
smooth as silk and didn't smudge you
know the kind of liner that sets to a
finish where you could rub on it and
whatever and it stays put but a couple
months past I've been using them on and
off
and most recently they were so dry like
could hardly get color to show up across
my lash line dry and then I realized
something when you put the cap on these
there's something a little different
okay there you think you got the cap on
right like pretty much any other liner
but it snaps down even further I'm
wondering if that was my problem because
I realized I wasn't doing that I was
just messing around with these and I'm
like oh that may have played a role in
the product drying out on me um the
colors are pretty bold pretty nice I've
got the white actually in my lower
waterline for some real brightness I
haven't used white there in a while I've
been doing a lot of the skin tone type
liners but like drawing across my upper
lash line I could hardly get color to
show so again I kind of blame myself
because I don't feel like I was capping
these properties when I first got them
they were not that way and I've had them
for I would say a few months now that's
the story on the Marc products I've used
if you've got any suggestions for me
anything you think I should try that I
haven't used yet please let me know and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
