here on beauty broadcast you may have
seen my series on teen tutorials some
looks that are really appropriate for
you know teens and things like that in a
lot of you said you know I'm not a teen
but I love that kind of thing and so I
thought well maybe everyone could
benefit from this next tutorial on a
series of tutorials I'm going to be
doing called mature makeup so I'm I've
heard from some people that say I would
really like some techniques that would
be appropriate for people in the 40-plus
age range or just professional looks
looks like an wear to work you know
things that are without a doubt
appropriate for a number of professional
settings so I thought that's a great
idea I've been taking some suggestions
and tips on my blog I've been reading up
on this in hi bobbi brown beauty books
I've been talking about my mom about
things like this as well over time
really and I would sort of like to use
this as a forum for your thoughts to
what you know comment below tell me what
you want to see here what things you
think it's essential that I touch on I'm
going to show you a look today that is
um a really neutral I using some very
subtle contouring techniques that I
think can provide a lifted look to your
eyes I'm also going to take you through
a mineral makeup application using some
different techniques that I think you
might find helpful so I hope you guys
enjoy this tutorial and this new series
and as always let me know your feedback
I really appreciate it and let's get
students the first thing I did was I
moisturize my face and I paid very close
attention to really moisturizing my eye
area rehydrating that area can kind of
perk it up and sort of make you look
even more awake it's a really subtle
thing but I notice it whenever I notice
the difference from before I put
moisturizer on to after so do that also
use a primer I really like Smashbox
photo finishes one it's a high-end one
that I liked or Rimmel fixin perfect
using that sort of thing and i would say
maybe for for older skin Smashbox photo
finish because it really creates
a smooth surface for your makeup it kind
of keeps that makeup from sinking into
fine lines pores you name it and then
the next thing we're going to do is use
some concealer one that I like that I
think is fine for any age is called
Maybelline age rewind and I use it in
medium it's specifically an under-eye
concealer and not only does it conceal
but it has some components in it that
help it'd be like a brightening product
as well so if you're feeling feeling
like you've got kind of a dull under eye
area consider using this concealer it's
a drugstore item you can dot it around
you can use a brush for for this I'm
just using my finger it really doesn't
matter just as long as you get it in
there and work it all the way up to your
lower lash line because there can be
discoloration just right up to that
point so i encourage you to blend all
the way up to there and all the way um
towards the bottom of whatever circle
you're seeing and blend upward so after
you do that I would recommend setting
your concealer what you did under your
eyes with a light powder to kind of
reflect any lines and circles we I'm
using a product from everyday minerals
this is just a sample size of sunlight
concealer it's just a very light yellow
powder that um you can just brush on
right under your eyes and it's kind of
amazing I use it all around my eyes if I
use this product and it's just really
important to brighten it up not only are
we adding to the brightness around our
eyes but we're setting that concealer
now I know from my mom who is in her 60s
she does not like to use a liquid
foundation because she feels like it
does kind of settle into lines or
whatever and so she uses more powder
products and one that I would really
recommend for people is the everyday
minerals intensive foundation especially
if you've got that primer on there I
feel like it gives you excellent
coverage without being too much so I
think if you haven't looked into mineral
makeup as an option for you you know you
could always check out a drugstore brand
i like maybelline mineral
power and stuff like that but by far
coverage wise for giving you coverage
and not being you know annoyingly you
know settling into fine line areas
everyday minerals is a brand available
online and what I'm doing with this is
I'm just using my kabuki brush just when
I picked up from big lots and I'm just
swirling this product and my shade is
medium beige neutral and I'm just
swirling this all over my face and
you're getting picking up a subtle
coverage this is more coverage than
you're going to get with bare minerals
and it's going to be less of a sheen to
it don't feel like you have to
concentrate a lot on your under-eye area
with this because you've already put
concealer there and you've said it with
a light colored powders I think a
bronzer is a really really good asset
for everyone that's doing makeup and one
that I like if we're kind of sticking
with a mineral makeup theme here is the
everyday minerals bronzer in every day
it's actually a blush if you're looking
through their website but it's called
everyday bronzer and it's not over the
top shimmery it but it does you know if
you've been using that matte foundation
and stuff it will give your skin some
glow and I'm just using an even fluffier
kabuki brush here just used you know
it's fluffy a brush as you have is good
for bronzer because it helps it really
blend out and just apply like a wash of
that all over your face now if you've
applied that blush or that level of
bronzer and you feel like okay that's
fine for me you can stop there but if
you do want more of a contouring effect
to your bronzer you can do that but I
recommend making sure it's a matte
bronzer one that I like is the Milani
sunset duos this one is sunset breeze
it's a drugstore product completely
matte bronzer use a blush brush or an
angle brush like this and basically what
you're wanting to do is slim down your
face and so pay attention to write down
and here you go you know underneath your
cheekbones that area is a good good spot
to contour to kind of slim down the
bottom
of your face and just under your jawline
kind of right on it and under it is
another subtle way to contour and if you
want to contour your forehead you know
you're kind of going at your temples
here and just really pay attention to
blending even your nose can really be
contoured if you just go you know kind
of squeeze your brush make it smaller
and like that and then once there's no
more product on your brush just blend
right over the top if I could pick
probably an MVP product to give skin a
young fresh youthful appearance I would
say it would be blush blush can just
totally brighten up your face and give
you that you know glow that you've been
wanting one that I like from everyday
minerals is in Sunday brunch you're
going to be able to probably it's it's
just got kind of a a reddish rosy glow
it's pretty pigmented it has some some
kind of orange deep peachy undertones
and I just love the effect of this blush
this is one of my favorites one of my
all-time favorite blushes the first
thing I did for my eyes was applied a
primer and I used a product from be lush
it's it's a botanical shadow primer and
it's sort of a soothing formula so it
kind of you know has more of an effect
on your eyes in terms of feeling good
and stuff like that as opposed to only
being a way to help your shadow last
longer and not crease so if you don't
want creasing you really I think a
primer is is a good thing to use if
you're trying to guard against getting
all those creases in your eye area so
then we're going to start out and I'm
using a palette from be luscious and it
is in I believe this this set is called
naturals and you've got a range of nice
nice browns and in light pink sand topes
and so this is a really nice palette to
have for a professional look I feel like
so I'm going to take this first shade
here on the end it's just kind of a
neutral matte cream shade and I'm going
to apply that all over my eyelid
just like that it's looking very skin
tone you know but it's sort of
neutralizing any little discoloration
you might have on your lid ok the next
thing we want to do is where is that
brush I'm going to take a crease brush
here and give myself a wash of color
right here in the in the crease and you
may be thinking well for you know for
mature makeup do you really want to do
much with creases and outer fees the
answer is no not a lot but according to
my bobby brown book and this makes a lot
of sense if you can do like a subtle
contouring with your eye you can create
an effect a lifted effect so I'm going
to try to do that here I'm going to take
this shade that does have a bit of
shimmer to it and it's it's kind of like
a a medium plummy taupe shade so it's
got a little bit of plum tell a little
bit of just a neutral taupe shadow shade
and I'm just going to give myself a wash
of this color just right here in my
crease just really light and it just has
a hint of shimmer to it but you know
when we're talking about you at an area
this deep you know this more sunken in
area of your eye it's okay to try to
bring that out of it so we're just
deepening that slightly just like that
and then I'm going to take my fine
crease brush from essence of beauty CBS
product and there's a matte brown shade
that I love right here on the end and
matte shades can be your friend in terms
of creating a natural contour here so
what we're going to do is likely form an
outer V by just taking some of that
Brown working it out from about mid
crease out and corner up
just like that what you're doing there
is creating a lifted appearance to the
eye instead of just following the shape
you naturally go with shadow and subtle
you know keeping it subtle and really
blending it out you can achieve a more
lifted I look just like that so then for
our highlight I like this shade right
here in the middle it's kind of a pink
and it's not what I love about this
palette is none of the shades are
over-the-top shimmery if they have a
little sparkle to them it's nothing that
screams you know chunks of glitter you
know what I'm saying so if you want to
save us a nice safe palette that gives
you you know great pigmentation you
don't have to struggle you can see I
barely you know it didn't take you know
going back to the palette back to the
palette that's what I love about the be
luscious shadows is that you can easily
get the look on your eye you don't have
to keep going over and over and over
again I'm going to use a liquid liner
this is the femme Couture liquid
eyeliner in brown oops so I'm just going
to draw a straight line i'm just going
to follow the natural shape of my eye
here just like so now you heard me
talking about how you don't want to have
to be tugging at that sensitive area of
your eye there so i'm going to use one
of the smoothest liners i've used in a
while it is the be luscious automatic
long lasting eyeliner in bark and so
this is a deep brown shade and you'll be
able to see how little pressure I am
applying there you know I barely am
touching it to the area and I am
bringing this liner in about half way
that is all now I can't stress enough
the need to curl your eyelashes um
because this is one thing you know
eyelashes are eyelashes if they're
curled up your eyes more open and awake
and that is just something anyone can do
no matter your age to just you know open
that area up a little bit so don't stray
away from doing that then I'm going to
apply a couple of coats
my be less HD mascara it's one of the
tiniest one's around really it's that
big and it's just really good for
detecting every lash that you have there
you know it's just it really makes every
last one of them show up a final step
you may want to do with your lower liner
is give it a bit of a smudge here just
with a smudge tip applicator alright
guys this is my finished look I applied
a couple of lip products that i really
like but are a little bit bright but i
think it's still a really professional
edge to the look considering what so
neutral on the eyes I used my Rimmel
lasting finish lipstick and metallic
shimmer and so this is just kind of a a
rosy sort of pinky red shade and then I
topped it off you wouldn't have to do
this but I just like the added shine
there I topped it off with NYX lip gloss
in amethyst so just kind of a pretty
combo that I'm liking lately so I wanted
to share that with you but I just I hope
these techniques were helpful for you
and again please give me your feedback
what do you want to see in these videos
and what little tips do you think it's
important that I share I hope to hear
from you from you guys and hear your
feedback on this and thank you so much
for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
