this mature makeup tutorial if this is
the first one you're seeing this is
actually the second one that I have done
and basically the theme here is makeup
that you could wear to the office or
just to really you know keep a
professional look and it's also a makeup
that I kind of keep in the back of my
mind that might be good for aging skin
are people who you know are past the
teenage age range and don't want too
much shimmer or too much you know this
or that added to the look that can
enhance the look of fine lines and
wrinkles and that sort of thing so this
look I'm going to be taking you
step-by-step through the eye look for
the face look because I'm kind of tight
on time today I went through and I told
you everything I used but will not be
walking you through that look thats
Sarah those exact processes processes
today but it is going to incorporate
some loose shadows in a different way of
doing liner than I have done for a while
now so I hope you enjoy this look and I
keep on guys I just finished my face
makeup I'll just walk you through what i
use because of time constraints I kind
of just went ahead and applied it for
this time and I'm going to just describe
what I did instead of you know filming
it and walking it through step-by-step
that way so I hope this works for you I
applied some moisturizer and I'm kind of
doing a little test here so I'll
probably report back on my blog or
something like that but it's kind of a
two-prong test number one I want to see
how everyday minerals does without a
primer and i also want wanted to test
one of their different foundation
formulas which is the original glow i
have a sample here the sample i used on
my face is in fairly summer and the
difference between that i usually use
intensive and that's the most coverage
option they have with their foundations
original glow is the least and i would
say i mean after using it it reminds me
a little bit of bare minerals in terms
of very light coverage and a little bit
of a a sheen or or the glow that you
know the name implies so i'm going to
see how well it holds up
coverage was pretty light although it
did look good if you've got fairly clear
skin I mean I think that would be that
would work well but you know the lighter
the coverage is it kind of makes you
think well how well is the staying power
going to be so I'm this is one of those
things that's under review but I put
that all over my face the original glow
foundation and then I use sunlight
concealer around my eyes and I used the
pearl beige concealer which is really
just a light you know semi shimmer just
kind of illuminating powder also just on
this area under my eyes just to brighten
it up a little bit then I used where is
it I must have put it back I used
everyday bronzer it's a bits under the
blushes section on the website you SAT
all over my face then I used what may be
becoming my new favorite everyday
minerals blush I'm kind of getting
scared because I like every blush I try
and I feel like I get on here and I say
oh this is the greatest pleasure but
they must just have a lot of really
great blushes so but it's the salon fun
blush it's really kind of a deep shade
but it's under the shimmer section not
the matt and it's kind of just pinky
hints of lavender and a plum it's a
pinky plum that's what it is and I just
really like that a lot and then over the
top of everything i use my start to
finish powder in soft bronze just to
finish it off and kind of you know
airbrush the whole look use my new
brushes from everyday minerals as well
the buffer brush for my foundation which
may have helped you know in terms of the
coverage for this original glow formula
and I really really like this brush and
then I use this to apply my blush just
kind of lightly I kind of like stipple
it on and then blend it out so um anyway
I that's what I did on my face today and
now let's move on to the upper step for
the eyes I'm going to take my be Lana in
light and this is going to really help
us out with our loose shadows I really
like the way this product works with
loose shadows because it just grabs them
they I feel like they show up better and
it
just really helps them cling to your eye
so then the first thing I'm going to do
is take my everyday minerals shadow and
this is my first everyday minerals
eyeshadow tutorial by the way just in
case you were wondering them if you
haven't seen them elsewhere from me but
I'm going to take my ELF eyeshadow brush
and this shade is called baby bath and
this is a pretty sheer shade but that is
kind of what I'm looking for for my lid
here so I'm going to tap a little bit of
that into my lid and pack it on my elf
eyeshadow brush and then you can see
what's mainly coming through here there
is quite a bit of shimmer and sparkle to
this but I don't think it's you know
over the top at all so just apply that
all over it's gonna basically be look
like your eyelid just with some neutral
shimmer on top next I'm going to take
this mat ma vie plum color called
wallaby and I'm going to again put a
little bit of that into the lid and I'm
going to use my Sonia Kashuk medium
shadow brush to pack that on the tip of
the brush I'm just kind of packing it on
like that and then I'm going to just
give myself a wash of this sort of
plumbing shade here just in my crease
just kind of get it in your crease and
then blend it out ord it's amazing how
much can get concentrated there and then
you really realize how much you have
once you start blending out you're like
oh shadows still you know moving for me
so I really like this brush for that
purpose and work it up a little bit
higher really try to work out every last
bit you can get out of your brush to
work it up kind of higher because that's
what we want to kind of show through in
the end once we worked in a darker shade
and that darker shade is mystic night
really pretty shade when people heard in
my haul video that I had this one they
were like oh that's a really good shade
and so this is a shimmery kind of navy
blue with some interesting purple
undertones so what I'm going to do here
is again tap a little bit into the cap
of my brush and I'm going to take a very
small brush it's Milo Cornell Maxine's
mop a quarter inch yeah brush and I'm
just going to pack onto that really like
trying to force the product into that
brush and tapping tapping tapping away
so that way once I put it on here it's
gonna be more packed on as opposed to
loose and flying everywhere so the first
thing I'm going to think about is
getting some of that on the outer half
of my lid here it's really a gorgeous
shade and I you know these are just
three shades that I picked out at random
they didn't come in any kind of set but
I wanted three shades that I could you
know use in a tutorial together and I'm
really happy with that I picked these
three so I'm just kind of you can see
I'm doing that like you know the packing
in sort of effect here only with a much
smaller brush so I'm getting more
concentrated color so it's like what we
did before just on a bit of a smaller
scale and just work this out as much as
you feel comfortable with I like it
about like this for this look again this
is our mature makeup tutorials so you
don't want to get too wild and smokey
with it but just keeping it soft like
and if you are looking at your look at
this point in time and thinking gosh you
know it doesn't look quite blended
enough grab a brush like this like your
stuff like my Sephora rounded crease
brush and just use that to go over
lightly I'm barely applying any pressure
here and going over that lightly it can
sometimes be all you need sometimes the
key to blending is not going back and
getting more shadow is just taking a
babe bear brush and going over it and
another trick is to go back and
highlight with you know a lighter shade
and you might think well that that's the
same shade that baby bath shade that you
used on your lid so why wouldn't you
just do that step all at once well the
reason why I wait and then apply it
later up here is for blending I can let
it get on the outer you know ends of the
last shade I put on and it just all
looks more smooth doubt I'm going to be
doing something a little bit different
here I'm going to use that pretty mystic
nightshade as basically as an eyeliner
doesn't that look pretty much like
eyeliner there that's actually that
shadow and I'm using a product from do
op called payoff and it's basically a
solution like a mixing medium that you
can add to a powder shadow and make it
like a liquid liner and so what I love
about this and why will probably keep
this thing once it's all gone and put in
my own home made mixing medium that I
use from on course recipe is it's got
this awesome little dropper so I'm going
to be using my hand as you can see I've
already used my hand in for my last
application of this but I'm just going
to put a drop on there that's all you're
going to need seriously and this is how
i would do mixing medium anyway i'm
going to i'm kind of spreading that out
and getting it so it's not just like one
dollop and i'm just getting that
moisture on my hand and then i'm going
to put some more of that mystic
nightshade in the cat it's not one to
come out there it is and so I've got a
cap full and I'm going to dip my angled
shadow brush in that kind of pack it on
and then I'm going to kind of run
through the moisture that is on my hand
okay so now I've got a brush that has
some product on it I'm going to go to my
top lash line and watch how you're
getting this soft intensity there on
your on your lash line and it does it is
really soft still because this isn't the
darkest shade in the world but it's it's
just I really like the effect of this I
will probably use this product more I'm
putting a little more on my hand here
and grabbing a little more shadow but
I'm just going in sorry about halfway
there and just deepening it up really
close to the lash line and then I'm
going to be doing the same thing just
right underneath you know go back the
key here is keeping the shadow packed on
your brush then going back to your to
your mixing media medium and just smudge
that right into your lower lash line
sorry it's always hard for me because
I'm trying to look down at what I'm
doing just get that smudged in like that
and that's basically your liner now we
want to go ahead and curl our lashes
hold it for about 15 seconds then I'm
going to take my telescopic mascara from
l'oreal and this is just a nice
lengthening mascara we're going to use
and just apply a couple of coats of this
alright guys that's gonna do it for my
soft Navy mature makeup tutorial I went
ahead and put on a product that I'm
really liking for him also from everyday
minerals is like purely everyday
minerals look it's their natural lip
gloss in cozy nights and it's like a
tinted lip balm it looks kind of dark
there but on my lips it looks really
natural and nice and that was just a
free sample day through and I really did
even realize that they had those lip
balms but I really like those and it
just kind of highlights to look it's
showing basically what this look shows
you can you know incorporate navy and
purple into your eye look and make it
really really subtle but do some
interesting things for your eyes that
maybe neutrals and browns can't do so I
hope you enjoyed this look and have a
great day everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
