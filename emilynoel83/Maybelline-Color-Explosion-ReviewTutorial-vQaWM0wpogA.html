me for this video I'm so excited to
bring you this tutorial because lots of
people have been asking for green and as
you can tell it's definitely a green I
look today and I was really kind of
inspired to go ahead and do the look
when i found this palette at walmart
it's Maybelline eye studio in forest
fury and it's from a new line oops just
lost losing the applicator there it's
from a new line called color explosion
what's really exciting to me about this
once I got it home and got to swatch it
and feel it is it is so similar to these
new Lancome palettes that are actually
the Lancome color design and so they
have some really bright colors here's an
ad on the back of an allure magazine
they've got blues purples greens and
much more than that and you can see they
go on very bold they are all there are a
lot of shimmery shades and these pallets
I actually have one it's one of the less
colorful ones but it has some coral in
it and the feel of these shades and the
texture of these cuts shades I not
comparing colors obviously but just the
way they feel in the way they go on is
so similar and the pigmentation is
really great with both as well so I
wanted to point that out and let you
know that I think this is really worth
the money I think it would be fun to try
some of the other shades as well but if
you see want to see how I put this green
look together keep on watching so I
first applied my NYX eyeshadow base all
over my lid and then I'm going to take
the sort of spring green almost like a
neon looking green in this palette with
my Sigma SS 239 brush and I'm just going
to Pat this all over my lid and as you
can see it builds up rather quickly I'm
also going to flip my brush over and
just kind of pull it up through the
crease so we have sort of a base color
to blend with then I'm going to take the
deepest shade it's kind of like a deep
forest green but still has some shimmer
and it's kind of Pat that on the outer
part of my lid so you're going to notice
this deepens up the look a little like
working it also as
working on my lid I'm kind of pushing it
up towards the crease as well and then
kind of my classic trick for deepening
up the crease is just flipping that
brush over it really ensures that the
deepest part of this color is getting
right in here right in the crease area
then we're going to work with this shade
right here which is almost I think
bordering on like a light teal or light
greenish turquoise kind of it larger
brush and this is going to take up if
you can see this portion right here on
this I that's about where that's going
to go over here as well so it blends
really easily and you got to be kind of
careful you don't want to get you know
fallout going everywhere but I find that
these these shadows aren't giving me a
whole lot of fallout so it's good I just
pick up a little bit more of that
darkest color and with the larger brush
to just allow for a little more contour
right out here so it's like it's lighter
to a little bit deeper out it's really
sort of a light yellow shade with that
same kind of shimmer going on in it with
my larger brush and this is going to be
what basically borders my I were out
here so it's going to give a nice little
Sheen right in here just make sure not
to overlap too much of the green you put
on but you can kind of like practically
dab it on there at the top of this
palette there is a really high sparkle
shade like this had some glitter in it
I'm just going to really lightly just
blot my brush in there a little bit goes
a long way and I'm going to just kind of
get some of that sparkle up here I
really don't want it going everywhere so
I'm sort of blotting it but you can see
when it catches the light there's a nice
little messy I'm going to take the first
green we use that bright spring green a
little bit around this area and just
under the inner part of the eye then
we're going to take the deepest shade
right there that kind of dark dark jade
green get a little bit of that and just
make sure when you're using a pencil
brush like this just get the product
right on the tip that way you're when
you put it on it is going exactly
you want it and just a little bit more
right there I'm going for kind of a
wide-eyed look with this with this green
looks so I did put white liner on the
inner rim this is my Rimmel soft kohl
liner in pure white I use this quite
often in the mornings before the news
when I need to look really wide awake
and while it can look kind of stark when
you first put it on as you blink a
little bit I think actually transfers to
your upper inner rim and it seems a
little more natural then for the other
liner i'm using Milani liquefy liquid
eye pencil these last a super long time
and this one is in number six green so
just as kind of in case it's hard to see
on top of my other products this is the
sort of green it is it has a little bit
of a I don't know kind of an all of the
metallic look to it so I love that
they've started making these and
automatic pencils instead of pencils you
have to sharpen that is great and so I'm
kind of just starting in the middle here
and working it out and as I go inward
I'm keeping it just so close to the
lashes I'm almost getting it like in the
inner grant a little bit of that right
here on the lower lash line because this
is green it just gives a really pretty
effect it's almost like you can't tell
you put liner here it just looks like
you've got that great green shadow going
on and just kind of go about halfway in
if my lower lid would continue up like
that I'm just drawing upward a little
bit and i rarely do wings with a pencil
however this one seems to be able to
pull it off and you can see what's going
on here don't have to do this wing but I
kind of like it and to really make the
wing kind of blend nicely with the look
I'm going over it with the deepest shade
right here in this palette next I'm
going to curl my lashes and apply my new
maybelline the falsies flared mascara
and I'll join you when I'm done
alright guys here's the finished look as
you can see it is a super bright green
look but I think with the way it's
blended you know it doesn't have any
real harsh lines and edges I think this
is something you could definitely wear
out of the house and feel comfortable
with especially in the summertime I mean
I think it it while it's colorful it's
still light and it's nice to know that
you can get this look from a drugstore
palette actually everything I used on
the eyes with drug store but again this
is from Maybelline and it's called
forest rank wait Forest fury and the
line is called color explosion so I
found these hidden when I picked this up
at Walmart they had it in purple they
had a neutral palette and I think they
had kind of like a rosy color palette
i'm not sure if there were others that
were just sold out but because i've been
getting so many requests for green i
thought this would be a fun one to try
especially for that one right there that
bright green shade to see you know
exactly how pigmented it really was so
thank you very much for tuning in for
this video I would definitely recommend
these pallets because I think that they
are great color great quality and it's
just they go on and blend without a lot
of work just keep in mind pretty much
across the board they are shimmery so
it's going to be kind of a shimmery
sparkly I that you end up with
regardless of which palette you pick my
lips I put on my Revlon super lustrous
lip gloss and coral reef one of my
all-time favorite coral shades but to
give it some dimension kind of just
around the outsides I used my buxom big
and healthy lipstick in Fresno I use
this a lot to kind of deep in things up
just a little bit it looks super dark
there but it just kind of I don't know
adds a little bit of depth to whatever
lip color I have on if I want it you
know just kind of on the outside thanks
again thank you so much for watching
have a great day and I'll see you again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
