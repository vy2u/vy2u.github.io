requested tutorial today um this is
gonna be an eye look using the
Maybelline quad in designer chocolate
this was in my August best in beauty
video I was wearing this in that video
and just had a lot of questions about
how to use it and to do a tutorial very
simple these shades are really easy to
blend and it just is really interesting
with this kind of rosy mauve color that
we blend things out with it's really
nice so here's the tutorial first off
I'm applying my Avon extra lasting
shadow stick and this is in the shade
amethyst it's a really nice long wearing
shadow stick that could be worn on its
own if you just want a really simple
quick look but it makes a great long
wearing base as well so I get a little
bit on there and then kind of smudge it
around with my finger and I take a
little bit just under the eye as well in
the designer chocolate squad I'm going
to this light shade it does have some
shimmer and I'm taking a flat brush I'm
just gonna Pat that right around my
inner corner you can see some instant
brightness happening there and then I'm
gonna pull some of that pearly shade
inward just a bit on top of that
amethyst it really shines then I'm gonna
dip into this rosy shade and that's
gonna go right next to the white and
just dab that all over again it really
clings to the shadow stick and looks
pretty we just continue to get deeper
and deeper I'm gonna go to this brown
with a smaller shadow brush this is the
Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush and I'm
just gonna dab some of that didn't get
quite enough there dab it right here on
the outer part of my lid then I'm gonna
kind of wedge it in the crease and pull
that shadow upward there just a real
quick and easy way to get the shade
where you want it and then we'll blend
it out in a minute
then I'm taking a fluffier brush with
the brown and just getting a nice
diffused amount of that color all
throughout the crease from the inner
most part all the way to the outside I'm
gonna use a bear brush to blend out that
border then I'm gonna go to this shade
up here it's kind of a light beige not a
lot of shimmer in it makes a great
highlight so I'm taking that under the
then my favorite part we go in with a
little bit of an accent here I'm taking
a really small fluffy brush this is the
Sigma performance collection the e36 and
I've got a little bit of that rosy shade
on there and with this think about going
just above that your deepest color there
and it gives just the prettiest little
you know effect right on the outside of
the look even when slashes are on you
know you got your mascara on it gives a
really pretty appearance that's visible
when your eyes are open and the
application is so sheer and soft it
really doesn't need to even be blended
over again we're gonna do liner then get
to some more shadows on the lower lash
line but I'm taking this Jordana 12 hour
mate to last
liquid eyeliner pencil in black point
and it's not really liquid it's just a
liner that they say will go on like like
what I guess and I just realized my hair
is like going nuts it's like clipped up
crazy matica there but I was in kind of
a rush this morning so I'm gonna take
this all across my upper lash line and
if you're interested in my review on
these new Jordana liners and their
Jumbo's shadows Stix jumbo shadow sticks
I've got that info all along beauty
broadcast on net for you
so this liner goes on a really really
easy I'm not doing anything fancy with
it just get into the other into my lash
line line my waterline with this then
I'm taking the purple liner and I'm just
gonna put that on like my natural lash
line kind of getting right in between
the lashes just doing that on the
outermost part and finally back to the
shadows taking the smudge brush going to
the dark brown and that's gonna go right
here on the outer part of the lower lash
line for a nice pretty smudgy effect
next up this rosy mauve and that's gonna
work us the rest of the way in here on
the lower lash line next up I'm going to
curl my lashes and today I'm using the
telescopic shocking extensions mascara
from L'Oreal and then I'm gonna top the
look off with some salon perfect demi
whispies false lashes are
really love the way this ultimately
shapes the eye and just really works
nicely with this shadowless set her up
the lashes get them real close to your
lash line and then just connect them on
the outer corner and the inner corner
here and just to let you know what else
is on my face I'm wearing my boots
number seven blush this is in coral
flush so just a little bit of pink and
life there on the cheeks and then I have
kind of a cocktail of products on my
lips I used my ELF matte lip color in
natural just for some base color this is
a really nice new I line my lips with my
Milani color statement lip liner in
spice so it's just a little bit deeper
and then I used my glam gloss aqua luxe
from NYX and this shade is VIP for some
shine so I hope you like this look thank
you so much for requesting it and I'll
talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
