joining me for this video this is going
to be a review that lots of people have
asked me to do on the dream smooth
mousse foundation from Maybelline this
is a fairly new product and if you're
familiar with dream matte mousse it's
nothing like that dream matte mousse
real quickly just to show you it comes
in kind of a glass tub like this you can
apply it with your fingers it's very
kind of light and airy feeling but on
your skin it comes off very matte
I like that foundation I think it works
really well gives here definitely a
flawless look and to go along with that
there is the dream mousse concealer as
well which is kind of just a little more
pigmented gives off a little more
concentrated color but it's a great
under-eye concealer so that's your
little like quick quick background on
those products they're our dream mousse
blushes as well but now the dream smooth
mousse so what makes that different
well packaging wise it is definitely
different the top twists off here to
reveal the product which is in a fairly
flat normal you know I guess height of a
regular compact there and here's the
product you can see it looks almost like
a typical like cream to powder
foundation practically is what that
appears to be like and then this top
part opens and you have a sponge here as
you can see I've used the sponge I've
used this product quite a few times and
I've got to say I really really enjoy
this stuff this is some great foundation
and I'm happy to be able to say that
because I was kind of looking for that
thing that wasn't necessarily a liquid
foundation still get great coverage came
off really smooth but didn't look too
matte and too you know in the summer you
still want to glow you know and I think
there's definitely some strategy to them
launching this product when they did
because I think in this time of year you
want something that feels light on the
skin but still makes you look polished
and good so anyway the way this this
product feels my shade if in case you
want to know what is my shade Oh 240
natural beige that's what this is
um as I rub my finger in this I get kind
of it's it's very smooth like my finger
is just sliding around in there you can
see it feels a little bit more like
regular foundation but it just goes on
so smooth and it blends really easily
it's it's strange it's like you couldn't
dip your finger in here but I guess you
could if you pressed really hard but and
like you know get a bunch on your finger
practically like you were dipping your
finger into a tub of frosting it's not
that feeling like you get with a dream
matte mousse you're going to just get a
thin layer it's practically like this
thing has built in portion control just
for the texture that this has and the
fact that you're just going to be able
to glide whatever whatever brush
whatever sponge on top glide it on top
and you're gonna get a certain amount of
application there and it's not gonna go
too far overboard that's interesting and
I think it works well on my face that's
part of why I've bent with the staying
power of this because it's like it keeps
you from getting too much caked on your
face dream that mousse you know you've
got to watch yourself a little bit
because you can literally dunk your
finger in there and get out quite a bit
so that's nice about this foundation um
it staying power did work well for me I
thought it worked well throughout the
day for going through doing the newscast
sitting under bright lights I felt like
it really held up however I wouldn't
have probably wanted to wear this
without topping it with a powder whether
you want to use loose powder I love the
Mary Kay loose powder or like a pressed
powder Clinique has a good matte powder
or there are plenty of other brands that
make matte pressed powders they're not
all coming to mind right now but you
know I would want to top off at least
just the t-zone that's really what I do
I go over my nose my chin in my forehead
with some kind of powder so the rest of
my skin can be somewhat luminous under
this so the fact that this is so kind of
solid yet slick right on the surface it
keeps you from applying too much product
now how do you like to apply this some
people may like to use a brush I used a
typical flat foundation brush or a few
times did I applied this one that looks
kind of like this this one happens to be
from Sigma that works pretty well
although I really like just using the
sponge that comes with it I kind of like
the shape of the sponge they give you I
find it's very easy to get in around
your eyes if you don't have major
under-eye problems by the way this can
do pretty well to conceal those areas
although I still like using something
like the dream is concealer or my Bobbi
Brown creamy concealer kit just to give
me a little extra there I mean come on I
wake up at 1:30 in the morning for my
job I need a little concealer but some
of you may not and that's fine that you
this may be able to get you through but
basically I hope I'm conveying what the
texture of this is like you can see it's
smooth it goes on very smooth and very
evenly too but you get just that nice
thin layer that you need but you still
get coverage it's really interesting I
like it a lot I'm really glad Maybelline
came out with this there have been other
cream to powder foundations that I've
tried and it's like it still seems so
thick you know it's like when you were
if you were to drag a sponge over the
top of some other kinds it's like it's
really dragging this you could tell us
picking up a lot this is so slick and so
light I mean you get some on there you
put it on your face it blends in super
easily it goes on really fast great for
summer but I think this will take a lot
of people through all year round and
will probably I predict become a very
popular foundation for many of you out
there so again it is the dream smooth
mousse foundation from Maybelline you'll
find it in your drugstore if it's not
there yet it probably will be there soon
it's very easy to wear I would I'm
really curious to hear what those of you
who have tried this think about this so
far I mean those with different skin
types I have combination skin adding a
little extra powder worked for me but
you have really
oily skin how did this work for you or
if you have really dry skin how did it
work
I think offering those comments down
below will give people who are
questioning this product a lot more to
go on than just what I have to say so
thanks so much guys for tuning in for
this video oh oh
cent cent of the product what I always
forget and what someone always asked me
about I can't smell anything
okay that was kind of anticlimactic
thanks for watching guys have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
