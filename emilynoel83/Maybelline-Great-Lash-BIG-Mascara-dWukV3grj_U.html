tuning in for this video I am excited
and kind of disappointed to do this
review because it's not a positive one
I'll tell you that right up front it is
on the Great Lash mascara big ok see
those letters big it is claiming to give
you bigger lashes and buildable volume
because it's got a bigger brush with it
so I kept the packaging just to keep
those claims there so I could tell you
about it first he says great big brush
plus volume building formula gives great
big lashes volume built with each coat
no clumps no globs contact lens safe
blah blah blah so anyway the packaging
is exactly like the original great lash
and I will also start out by saying that
I tried original great lash a couple
times and I don't know why I tried it
twice because I knew I didn't like the
first time and guess what the second
time I still didn't like it it has a
much smaller brush and it I just didn't
think it was buildable at all I thought
the formula was too wet and just
couldn't give me volume made me look
like I had like five eyelashes and so
now I saw that this was a bigger brush
and I thought maybe the brush was the
problem so I got this and look how big
look how big that brush is there you
know that's like rivaling Diorshow you
know that's a pretty pretty big brush
and it's not the kind that really
spirals around it although it does maybe
look like that as I hold it there but
it's more like the bristles kind of are
just spiking well it might be kind of a
tight spiral but they're just kind of
spiking out from the brush you know not
a rubber brush mascara or anything like
that meant to build volume I do like how
its tapered at the tip that always makes
it easier to get in towards the smaller
lashes but overall you look at this this
isn't very long from here to here and so
that does make it harder for some people
you know like I like to have a little
longer wand that way I don't know I just
feel like I'm less likely to bump into
something especially when I'm going for
this eye over here but yeah I used this
and I think okay this is gonna really
you know give me some
volume honestly it's the formula that's
a problem with this mascara as well
because this brush did not affect things
for me I am so interested to hear what
you guys have to say if you've tried the
original and this and let me know if
this worked better for you because it
did not hardly do anything more for me
at all if I put it on very carefully and
very very slowly one coat I would get
nice separation and a decent amount of
volume in terms of looking like I had
more lashes but they did not seem
thicker at all they did not seem much
longer when you go in for that next coat
and they say this is buildable and I
believe they say continue building to
rebuilding with coats to reach to your
desired look do not let dry between
coats I would put on my second coat and
it just like they all all the progress I
had made to make it look like I had a
bunch of eyelashes here they all just
kind of you know went into their own
little lash families making me look like
I had like five or six eyelashes so yeah
really disappointing her on that because
you know you think like okay here's one
coat two coats it's gonna make it better
and then if you I thought well maybe
I'll let it dry then between coats and
then you're really not making any
difference so I'm running into basically
the same issues I had with the original
I feel like the formula is very wet with
this and I feel like that's what makes
you know one coat maybe look okay and
then they claim it's available you put
your second coat on and they all kind of
you know it's not good so what I've done
here get a little closer to the camera I
have that mascara on today and I
couldn't I didn't want to leave with
just that on so I put on a half strip of
false lashes I'll go ahead and take one
of those off here just to show you okay
and there goes my eyeliner too that's
what it does okay I believe you can
count how many lashes you see there one
two three four five six there clumped
together in six little families
ridiculous I mean their mascaras that
can make me look like I have actually a
decent amount of thickness
there with no false lashes but this one
can't do it you could see why I wanted
to put the false lashes on today so
anyway guys thank you for stopping in to
see this review this is fairly recently
put out in stores I got it at Walmart
for less than five dollars thank
goodness and will I continue to use it I
might use it from time to time if I know
I'm gonna wear false eyelashes and I
just want a little something to blend
the two but on its own I am NOT
impressed with this they say put the
words big on this and I just can't stand
behind it at all
so please let me know if you've tried
this and you actually thought it was
better than the original or maybe you
like the original better than this I
don't know maybe I mean maybe you would
it because that little brush gives you a
little more control maybe people like
that but anyway this is just my opinion
it just because it didn't work for me
doesn't mean it won't work for someone
else but just wanted to pass along what
I thought because I was just sort of
astonished at the fact that it was
really no better for me than the
original so thank you for that watching
this review on the great lash big
mascara and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
