video this is going to be a product
review on Maybelline lash discovery
mascara usually it seems like I'm doing
reviews on products that have maybe just
come out or it's something new but this
is really something that's been on the
market for a long time and I have
avoided it pretty much the whole time
because I thought okay who really wants
a mascara that you know is just gonna
give you a teeny tiny brush and not
gonna do anything for your eyelashes and
you know what's the point really I want
something that is going to be volumizing
not something that's just going to I
guess darken my already dark eyelashes
so I didn't really think it was for me
at first and then I started doing more
tutorials and things like that and I
started kind of enjoying the look of a
little bit more mascara on the lower
lash line you know just a little more
definition there sometimes I think even
dark haired people some I mean those
lashes are so fine they still don't
necessarily stand out all that much on
their own so I thought well I'll go
ahead and try this and maybe use it for
that purpose and for that purpose I feel
like it works really really well I will
use this I mean I use this most days as
my lower lash mascara this is not a
waterproof version that I have and it's
still um I don't have smudging problems
if you have an especially especially
oily skin or have real problems with
oiliness under your eye I know there is
a what
about positive there is waterproof
version of this but this is how tiny
that little brush is and it just gives
you it's just kind of like the brush is
spiraled around the wand there and it's
just so small I mean you can see how
tiny it is if I were to come up here in
just put it on here I actually have like
one little coat of this on there and I
just really like how it works for giving
some natural definition to the lower
lashes as far as using this on the upper
lashes it's not as much thickness and
length as I would want just for a day to
day but you will get a little more
length than you already have but it's
just going to really define every lash
so
can be a good thing I mean it picking
out every lash that you have I mean you
almost realize like oh I didn't know
that was there lash discovery is a very
good name for this because I definitely
discovered eyelashes I didn't know I had
here on my lower lash line so yeah I
mean as far as this being someone's
primary mascara to use all the time I'd
be curious to know if it is and if it is
that's great if this if this works for
you maybe you've got some naturally nice
thick lashes and you really don't need
to spruce them up that much at all then
that's that's great this might be for
you but for me I do like a little bit
more thickening on the upper lashes but
this is a fantastic product to help your
lower lashes stand out without getting
clumpy without getting too much product
on them that's gonna smear and smudge
around so very easy to use very
practical and I just wanted to tell you
about it so that's Maybelline /
discovery mascara you can find it at
your local drugstore thanks so much for
watching guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
