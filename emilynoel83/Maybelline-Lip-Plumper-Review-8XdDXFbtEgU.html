Maybelline's volume XL seduction lip
plumper and yes I had to write that down
because I think the name of this product
is so long you can't hardly remember it
but this is what it looks like it's in a
kind of mom metallic tube in this little
window here you can kind of see what
your what color your product is the cap
just comes right off and what you've got
here is sort of a plastic if it's direct
plastic that your lips will come in
contact with here and like five or six
little holes that the product comes out
of you twist at the bottom and so when I
twist with just one twist which is nice
it's not one of those you have to keep
cranking on before the product comes out
the gloss comes out at the top so to
give you a look of what it looks like
here on my hand
and the shade I have is 705 lusciously
spiced and actually I'm wearing it right
now too so you can see see what it looks
like and I think they have one shade
lighter than this isn't it's a real nude
shade and this is just like the shade up
from that so it comes in ten shades
total it claims to plump your lips 30%
more and it's a fairly new product from
Maybelline I believe and I was kind of
just tempted to try it because I had
heard some decent things from a few
people on makeup review type websites
and so I just wanted to try it for
myself and um I kind of always liked the
concept of plumpers I don't have the
world's thinnest lips to begin with but
I feel like this product honestly has
plump them somewhat and you'll find some
plumpers they say the product has
collagen in it or whatever and sometimes
you won't feel a tingle with those it's
more of just the formulation seems to
build up more on your lips and make them
look fuller that way this is really
glossy I feel like so that's one way it
makes your lips look fuller
but it also does have that tingle that
you will feel within about 10 or 15
seconds of applying it you'll start to
feel that and it won't last forever it
won't you won't feel it the entire time
you've had it on like I put this on
maybe 10 minutes before I did this video
and I can't really feel the tingle
anymore you can tell it's still on there
you know what I mean but the tingle is
not so intense and what that's doing is
there's an irritant in this product
basically that is telling your lips you
know irritating it somewhat that's the
tingle you feel and then they plump a
little bit more and I do feel like it
does I mean 30 percent yeah I might give
it that I mean I think it may that may
be an accurate claim that the product
has I really like this color and I've
worn this in maybe one or two other
videos and people have asked me Oh what
color is that you know what do you have
on there and I liked it too I really
like the color I like it's just a nice
neutral shade to have in your collection
and I like that as far as the packaging
goes I'm not really used to the fact
that it's coming out of directly a hard
plastic surface that you're actually
putting on your lips
other than those squeezy tubes which I
always put on my finger first and then
put on my lips but this I mean I haven't
noticed a real problem with this I like
it I like how one click and the product
is out here I like that it actually
plumps the tingle doesn't bother me but
some people you know you may really not
like that and I mean if you've tried any
lip plumpers before chances are one of
them has been the tingle kind and you
know if you're not a fan of that then
you wouldn't like this product on your
lips but if you want a little bit of
plumping which this will give you and
you want nice color and the texture of
it is it's kind of I mean it's not it's
not sticky but it's it's somewhat thick
and it's a thickness that I don't mind
I've tried some glosses that are like oh
my gosh I have to have this on my lips
all day but this is I mean it's it's
nice it's not too heavy it has a great
shine I mean I
you're really gonna be impressed with
the shine if you get one of these
products and overall I would say try it
if you're interested in a good lip
plumper that is around I think this may
have cost me in the ballpark of six to
seven dollars I'm thinking for this and
like I said ten different shades that it
comes in I don't have some more berry
shades and it had a shade that it's even
more nude than this this one again is
705 lusciously spiced and I mean if the
other colors are the similar texture
which I'm sure they are and shine as
well I may go out and try different
shades too but I just wanted to pass
this review along because this is a
product that I really like and I know
some of those lip plumpers are just you
know some of them like are painful to
put on some of them don't work at all
and I found one that I feel like works
and it also gives off nice color it's
not just one of those purely clear lip
plumpers so it's I mean it's very
functional very easy to use and I like
it and I think you guys will too so
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
