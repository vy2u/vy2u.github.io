tuning in to this video and thank you so
much to all the subscribers we got more
than five hundred some subscribers right
now I got so exciting I'm so happy that
people are finding these videos
interesting and informative and I know
it's just exciting to see that people
are interested in makeup there are so
many great people on YouTube and really
informative videos like every time I sit
down and watch some I feel like I'm
learning something new for somebody so
thank you to everybody who makes videos
and it's all you there watching thank
you as well I'm talking about the mental
power makeup today so I'm just going to
show you what I have and then I'll tell
you how I like it
I've got their concealer which is a
liquid I've got the liquid foundation
I've also got their finishing veil which
is a pressed powder form I've got their
mineral blush and peach which is loose
and then I've got their mineral makeup
powder that comes with a little kabuki
brush so I'm starting to tell y'all
first these products are on like a color
system to where if you pick one let's
say if I when I pick this this is one of
the first products I got um it's a
medium one and all the other products
correspond with that so like if this was
medium one I got the concealer in 0
medium 0/1 I've got the powder
foundation in medium one and I just got
this and light this is just kind of like
whatever and then I got my blush in
Peach so anyway as far as the face
makeup goes it's the colors are kind of
an a really easy to identify sort of
color scheme there you just kind of got
to decide what you are say in your
foundation and then just go from there
and so I'm really happy with the way the
color works like that's one of the
things I like best about this liquid
foundation is how I feel like the color
really
matches my skin and if it is a I would
call it a medium coverage foundation
it's okay it still lets your skin shine
through but it gives you this kind of
glow that I'm really struggling with
just describing it's not glittery or
shimmering it's just um it's just not
your typical thick liquid foundation and
I feel like it just the color on this
and everything else and worked out very
well for me this foundation is just the
tube twists off and then you just squirt
it up pop and um a little bit goes a
pretty long way I found it's extremely
easy to blend and I have the staying
power which I'm comparing it to some
pretty long wearing foundations
foundations that claim to be long
wearing like Revlon Colorstay
or rimmel's fairly new a long weighing
foundation and this one I mean a stands
up to it I've worn it on air I've worn
it anchoring and reporting and it's able
to a good test of makeup for me is can
it handle the intensity of the lights
for between a half hour and an hour's
time that I'm on there and this really
can and it doesn't another thing I have
to watch for is does as I wear the
makeup does it sort of change colors you
know how when you have makeup on and you
go through a day and then you're or
they're still oils coming out in your
face and it can sometimes change the way
your makeup looks and this is stays
pretty true to the color you initially
put it on and so I like this and I also
really like the concealer they have it's
really lightweight it's very interesting
because it has what I think for me is
great coverage for under-eye but it's
also very very light and I've been like
wait the color for me is in you know
what it should be your concealer
shouldn't be like really as dark I think
as your foundation maybe a little
lighter especially if you're just trying
to illuminate some areas under your eye
but this is very good I got into habit
for a while of using more creamy
concealers like I have a stick form and
I just kind of got tired of that I felt
like it was too heavy I have like you
know like those broken capillary areas a
little bit around my nose and I just got
tired of thinking I was putting
something so thick on top of these areas
where your pores get clogged so easily
so I just thought let's do something
lighter it's summertime and so this is
what I've got I really like it works
well all over the face and definitely
would recommend this these two are my
two standout items from the mineral
power line now close to that what I like
almost as well is their finishing veil
powder this is pretty cool this is like
um what this is like is the mineral veil
from bare minerals pressed into a
compact that's really what it is you
open it up there you over it up here and
then this part just slides open and they
give you a sponge and a mirror so it's
pretty cool packaging um I just I feel
like this is nice to put put it on with
a big brush so don't use the sponge I
just I don't know i don't i don't really
see putting on something that's supposed
to be very sheer in nature over the top
of your whole finished look and putting
it on with a sponge just seems odd to me
so i just use a big brush also a little
tip here is use a concealer brush and
apply the mineral power stuff the
finishing veil over the top and it kind
of sets it around the eye area really
brightens it up this is very translucent
you're not going to get color with this
but this is a good thing to keep in your
purse to touch up with if the day goes
on we all know that
mineral pop neural powders are
frustrating to travel with and so having
something like this that's pressed that
can just basically take away the shine
and give you a kind of a refreshed look
is a good thing so this is another
pretty good product I think would be
worth trying I have it in light it's got
medium and then a couple darker tones as
well um going down the line uh I've also
got I broke down and got the mineral
power natural perfecting powder
foundation I have it in sandy beige
medium one it comes with this little
bitty kabuki brush which I enjoy around
my eyes but I really don't bother going
all over my face with this this is just
a little too small for me but the
foundation you get a decent amount of it
this container is slightly larger than
say a bare minerals container is the
color is maybe a little darker like I
said I followed the whole color
identification system that have and this
is maybe slightly darker than I would
have initially picked for myself but I
think it's right especially during
summer time you know you kind of got to
think about those things because your
skin may get a little darker as your
outside more and that kind of thing and
coverage on this is pretty good I mean
you can wear it alone and you can build
up the coverage you want that's not
really an issue here as far as comparing
this to other brands like bare minerals
and things like that I can't say that I
can tell a huge difference
I do enjoy this and there's also no rule
saying you can't go over you know with
go over this stuff what I look I've
liked the most I'll just tell you real
quick I use the concealer and the liquid
and then I go over it with just a little
bit of it now I'm talking just getting a
big brush in and just kind of going over
your face with it and I think that's
fine to do and it's not like I'm really
going over and over it again like I
might if I was only using this but it
gives it great finish
along with the other products the
products in this whole line work very
well together so if you're looking for
I'd say a cheaper alternative to bare
minerals um I think this is a pretty
good choice I tried a lot of different
mineral things and this is probably one
of the better ones that I've tried and I
know I'm running out of time here but I
just got one more thing to talk about
it's the blush and I have it in peach
now I'm always told me that peach is a
really universally flattering shade of
blush on anybody so this is nice to have
if you want to stick with the mineral
line I mean you get a decent amount of
it
the color is not orange eh it's more of
a pinky peach which I like but
technically if you're trying to save
money you can get cheaper blushes than
this in other formats I don't think it's
critical that your blush is mineral as
well but I mean it does work well with
the other makeup it's a pre color um but
it's not like oh my gosh I have to have
mineral blush too you know it's just one
of those things and but overall I think
this is a really good stuff it's a good
price and thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
