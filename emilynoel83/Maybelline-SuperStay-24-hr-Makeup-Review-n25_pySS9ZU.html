for this video I hope you like the
hairdo today I did a little side bun I
actually use this for the news today I
kind of just um I choose my hair up here
a little bit and kind of pinned it up
like I would go half up so I did bobby
pins to pin that up in the back and then
I pulled it down into a low ponytail
like behind my ear so it's not like the
extreme side bun that's like maybe on my
ear but it's just right over here and
then I teased the ponytail a little bit
and kind of wrapped it around and
secured it with some bobby pins so I
kind of like it I think I might do it
some more you know it's just a nice
sleek look so I might do a tutorial or
something on that and in the days to
come but this video is about the
maybelline superstay make up 24 hour
makeup and I must say I wore this over
the weekend for close to 24 hours so I'm
not really proud of that because I don't
think you should be in makeup that long
but as you know I do a morning newscast
and so when the makeup goes on at around
1:30 or 2:00 o'clock in the morning you
know 24 hours later and I had gone to
visit my sister and I've been traveling
all throughout the afternoon and then
got there and where I would normally if
I was going to be up later you know I
might take a nap in the afternoon and
then redo my makeup in the evening so be
fresh you know into the night but didn't
have that opportunity so this definitely
stayed on until it wasn't quite 24 hours
but it was close so I really got a sense
of how well this lasted and basically
just to introduce you to this product
it says Microflex formula zero trans for
24 24 hour where my shade is classic
beige and I must say this shade works
really well for me
it says withstands heat sweat and
humidity which was kind of hard for me
to test since I wasn't sweating and I
mean it's not summertime right now
exactly and the temperatures are quite a
bit cooler where I am so didn't really
get to test that part of it but it does
say zero transfer won't rub off to sort
of talk about that claim a little bit on
when I had switched shirts
and I had kind of brushed a little bit
of the color on me not intentionally I
wasn't trying to do that but it did kind
of serve as a test for this and there
was some makeup on there now I don't
know if that was bronzer blush
highlighter you know like whatever else
I had on top of the foundation I
couldn't quite tell if the foundation
had you know worn off or not I do have
that foundation on today though by the
way this foundation it says it is
flexible breathable all-day comfort I
can't say that a foundation has ever
made me feel uncomfortable but yeah I
guess it's comfortable
it says oil-free non pore clogging and
suitable for all skin types that's kind
of where I'm going to get into why this
may I don't know that this is really um
maybe the perfect fit for all skin types
I use this all over my face
I used it under my eye area all around
my nose forehead chin you name it
I feel like this withstands the first
few hours of wear wonderfully because I
get on and do the news and I feel like I
have it it's a good finish it's great
coverage and I like just the way it
comes off so and plus the color
selection is good and this was a really
good match for my skin I feel like the
color selection was good anyway um
however if you get into the evening
hours of a day say I mean on typical day
if you put this on in the morning and
you wear it all the way through to the
evening if you have combination skin
like I do which can sometimes get oily
around the nose or forehead or chin I
think you're gonna find that this is a
little bit.we I think you're gonna see
that oiliness and it's going to sort of
alter the way this foundation looks a
little bit on your face it's still there
you know it's still it's still staying
on your face but I feel like I can see
that oil and I feel like I can almost
see the makeup a little bit more it's
kind of hard to describe
I did have ever since I've been wearing
this for a little over a week and I have
had a little bit of a breakout on my
forehead I don't know if you can see it
but it's there it's right in here I had
just a few little zits I'm not sure if
that's directly related to this or some
other product I've used but um like I
said the coverage is great the staying
power is good but I feel
this is not necessarily the best option
especially if you had really oily skin I
don't I feel like my skin is mostly
normal it's heading into the season
where it's actually gonna get borderline
dry and this may be perfect but I think
if you do have oil control problems you
put this on and it's it doesn't do as
well for the oil control as say Revlon
Colorstay for combination oily skin
Revlon Colorstay has two versions they
have the dry and normal formula and they
have the combination oily formula so if
you do have that combination oily skin
this seem to control the oil better for
me than this did and it's not just a
matter of controlling the oil I don't
think your foundations that should
solely be responsible for how oily skin
you have but how does it react with the
oil and how does it continue to look on
your face and I don't feel like this has
a cakey feel at all I do kind of
question in the ads where it shows like
the foundation on like a stretchy band
or something and when the band stretches
the the other foundation is just crumble
and this just stretches and you know
moves and whatever iPhone I don't think
I've had any foundation that really
cracked it and I feel like the I I've
been a big believer in drugstore long
wearing foundations and I've had two
great ones I like Rimmel lasting finish
my shade is 200 soft beige and Revlon
Colorstay in the summer a true beige
really worked well for me in the oil
come on oily combination the way these
would all compare would be kind of like
this in terms of skin type this is what
what would probably be most dry skin
friendly the maybelline superstay
lasting finish goes on like this goes on
really well too by the way spreads very
evenly it does feel like it has a little
extra moisture in it this is another one
of those that has moisture in it seems
to withstand the day a little bit better
if you have some oil problems with
stands it makes your makeup seem a
little more like it's staying fresh
longer than this so the lasting finish
is really good even if you are a little
oily but ultimately if you really have
oil control problems the Revlon
Colorstay for
combination oily skin it doesn't spread
on quite as creamy but if you're if you
have oily skin you don't want as much
moisture in your makeup so this one is
kind of like edging out on top still
lasting finish I really really love that
but I like all of these I just think
that they're slightly more suited to
different skin types and superstay
makeup should you try it for the 24-hour
wear I mean did my face look bad after
close to 24 hours no but it clearly was
not as fresh as when I put it on you
know the oil was starting to show
through it was starting to make the
foundation look a slight bit broken down
maybe in certain areas like around my
forehead and nose and so I mean it's not
a miracle worker but it is good and
especially if you have dry skin as we
head into winter time I think this will
be nice for a lot of skin types so what
I would throw this into my little you
know top three of drugstore long wearing
foundations and hopefully if you get to
check it out maybe you can let me know
in the comments section or shoot me a
message and let me know how that ended
up working for you so thanks so much for
tuning in for this video guys and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
