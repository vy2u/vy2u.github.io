well so far um this is gonna be a quick
review on a product from Maybelline a
new mascara I found out at my local CVS
store recently I included this in a hole
if you think this sounds familiar but
it's from Maybelline it's called the
falsies volume express mascara it comes
in this pretty kind of purpley tube with
some turquoise riding on it and
basically this is a mascara that
promises to give you that full slash
effect so I think that's personally like
what I'm after with any mascara I use I
want length I want volume I want them to
be separated just you know the look of a
lot of lashes there I have some pretty
high expectations where mascara is
concerned so just to describe this
product for you a little bit it claims
to have a patented spoon brush so I'll
show you that in a minute so it's a
little different shape than probably
just about any brush that I have used so
far and it says you know it's going to
give you eight times more volume without
clumping to complete the false lash look
is that's it has the spoon brush and
then it says careth fiber formula never
heard of this before it's kera fibre
formula and the wand is very flexible so
this is ophthalmologist tested it's
contact lens safe that's what the
packaging says I have it here in
blackest black so chances are you've
been out in the stores and you've seen
different varieties of the Maybelline
volume express mascara xand they have I
think the colossal is one of the volume
Express they also just have the
traditional and then this is I guess the
newest one that's come out so basically
the wand is kind of flexible if you look
here you can see that there is a little
point in this in this wand where this
becomes just a little more flexible a
little more bendy from that point it's a
traditional brush mascara while there
are a lot of you know there's a lot of
rubber brush mascaras out there this is
the traditional kind and as I hold it
like this this is what they mean by that
spoon brush design
it's just got a little bit of a dip
right in here it's very subtle but they
recommend that that's the way you apply
it they say apply it with the spoon side
like that so and then you can see on the
other side it's got kind of like longer
bristles that go out to each side there
so it's a nice brush I do enjoy it I
like that it's not as curved as some
curved brush mascaras are I feel like we
all have kind of different eye shapes
and a different width going on here
so sometimes the curved brush mascaras
are a little too curved so this is more
subtle and I don't think it's gonna be a
problem in terms of application so you
hold it with that spoon side up and then
you apply it and I generally like to do
that when I start out I'll apply it that
way and then maybe I'll turn it to the
other side to kind of make sure any
clumps are out of there and whatnot
basically the information you want from
me I'm sure is does this give you the
look of false eyelashes I'd have to say
no what I put on false eyelashes I'm
pretty impressed without my eyelashes
look and this doesn't quite take me
there well I feel like it gives me and I
have it on right now and I feel like it
gives me a pretty good length I'm
actually quite impressed with the length
on this but I don't feel like it gives
me the look of lots of lashes it
actually has a little claim in here it
says more visible lashes fills the gaps
so that would kind of mean like where
you have either shorter or more sparse
lashes it's going to make you look like
there are lashes there that don't
actually exist I'm sorry but I'm pretty
sure the only way to do that is with
some false eyelashes to genuinely make
that happen um so basically if you're
looking for a good lengthening mascara I
think this will be good in terms of the
wear throughout the day I've worn this
through my whole work day now and I mean
I don't see any this doesn't give me
much problem with flaking the only time
you really are going to notice flaking
is if you put this on initially and then
maybe you for some reason touch it up or
add more later in the day
as you apply that that's the moment
where you might see a little bit of
flakiness with this otherwise it lasts
really well and it doesn't tend to
smudge or anything like that I mean I've
had some you know sweat or different
issues you know around my eye area of
you have watery eyes I mean I haven't
noticed it reacting with anything like
that I just think that and when you go
to take it off it's just the slightest
bit resistant it's not quite as
resistant as covergirl LashBlast but
it's still I mean when you take go to
take it off you're going to want to
maybe hold your eye makeup remover or
your in my case the Olay daily facials
cleansing cloths hold it over there for
a little bit let it start to break down
the product and then wipe it off but
again good length doesn't really fulfill
its claim of giving you falsies with
your lashes but I think if you have some
natural thickness in there and then you
put this on like I don't feel like my
lashes are naturally all that thick but
if you have that and then you put this
on I think you're gonna find great
length and you're gonna get a look that
you like it builds fairly easily on top
of itself so I would recommend you know
you put on one coat put it on fairly
slowly you know let it really um
highlight each lash sometime when you
put it on too quickly it's like the
lashes end up kind of you know teaming
up and going their own separate ways and
you look like you've got about five
eyelashes so put it on slowly and then
you know before it actually gets dry go
ahead and put on another coat and maybe
a third coat and I think you're gonna be
impressed with the amount of length that
you actually get out of that so that's
my review on the volume express mascara
from Maybelline comes in the packaging
like that that's what the tube looks
like if you're looking for good lengths
maybe give it a try you know it's gonna
run you about anywhere from I don't know
uh six to eight dollars at your local
drugstore price is always very on this
kind of thing but if you can get a deal
on it you know maybe a buy one get one
free I would encourage you to check it
out it's a pretty good mascara so thank
you so much for joining me for this
video everyone and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
