review on Maybelline the falsies flared
mascara so maybe you've heard of
Maybelline falsies mascara well this is
like a little spin on that as you can
see the packaging has these little wings
on it and if you're familiar with the
the false lash effect that gives you a
flared look it's this kind of a thing
right is this picture on the packaging
shows you know the lashes are long and
then ooh look at the ends you know nice
and nice and long and extended they're
on the outside already reviewed just
that regular Maybelline the falsies
mascara that was probably about a year
ago so I will link to that video here if
you want to just see what the regular
one's all about in a nutshell it
lengthened well it didn't necessarily
increase the volume or give me a look
like I have so many more lashes than I
naturally have but it was pretty good
for length so it didn't make me look
like I had false eyelashes on and this
one guess what it doesn't either I don't
think anybody would think oh man those
real you know I don't think anybody be
asking me that when I have this on tell
you what my lash type is I feel like
when we're talking about hair products
like everybody talks about oh I have
fine straight hair or I have thick curly
hair you know we always refer to our
hair type when we're reviewing like hair
products or hairstyling tools but when
it comes to mascara it's like it's good
or it's bad for everyone and I don't
think that's always the case with a
mascara I feel like we need to be
telling people you know what our lashes
are like and you know why something
might work better for me and not as good
for you or vice versa
I have fairly like thin lashes they're
not super thick they're not incredibly
long that's it they're pretty much
average on length naturally and they
tend to want to point down so while some
people have like a natural nice curl to
their lashes yes I've seen people like
that and they're amazing like I would
love to have Tyler my husband's
eyelashes hi they're awesome
a lot of times I will wear false
eyelashes and that's given me a higher
standard so when I see something that
says the falsies I'm thinking
ya realize it has a spoon brush effect
so it's a very subtle curve if I don't
know if you can see that there's more
flat there so when it's turned this way
you see longer bristles the bristles are
longer on this end than they are on this
if I would put it on like that
the lengthened bristles will flare out
this end where I go any further with my
review I want to show you how this goes
on sort of wiggle it on up through as it
dries pretty quickly so if you want to
build it up and do multiple coats you
can just don't wait in between I'm
liking the length that I'm noticing on
each lash and it's doing it pretty I
would say maybe an average job on in
terms of the separators a certain amount
of these lashes kind of teaming up
together in terms of the flared look I
mean as you'll notice like as I was
putting this on you know I tend to like
to you really utilize the tip of my of
my mascara wand so I'm not always
leaving it just in this position the
whole time and I don't feel like I'm
getting any pronounced flare on the
outside I feel like naturally my lashes
are a little shorter right in here and
probably a little longer out here so
that's just the way you know that's just
what God gave me but as I put this on I
mean I'm not seeing a drastic like oh my
gosh and then look what happens on the
outside you know so I don't feel like I
look like I have false lashes on those
three coats on the top and then I'll put
a little on the bottom I haven't had a
big issue with this mascara getting real
smudgy on me so that's good like it
seems to wear fairly well this tip is
tapered this is a little longer bristles
so you would think that needs to be on
the outside well I am NOT one who likes
to flip my wrist around like this I go
in like this on the other side so I mean
I think that just goes to show that the
whole flared concept if you're not one
that wants to flip your wrist around you
know how does that even all that
relevant
so bottom line was this mascara I don't
think it gives me the look of false
lashes and I don't really buy the claim
that it's gonna make them look really
flared on the outside it does give good
length and if you unlike me have great
natural thickness to your lashes I think
you're gonna probably like what this
does but if you if you have a little
more sparse lashes like I do I mean it's
gonna give you length on what you have
but it's not necessarily gonna do a
great job of highlighting everyone this
is a lot like the other falsies but with
these longer bristles I think this might
be even just a little more lengthening
overall wand is it's got a little like
joint right here and it is kind of
flexible so it's not a rubber brush you
know this these are traditional bristles
but it does have that flexible head like
some of the rubber brushes have so
that's my review thanks so much for
joining me for this video and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
