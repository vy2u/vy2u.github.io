many people have been praying for us and
just thinking about us during this time
um you know when you're laying there in
a hospital bed and you know your baby is
just moments away I mean those things
kind of flood into your mind and I just
want you to know that you guys do feel
like family to us today we're
introducing a new member of the family
this is baby Bell was born on September
21st at 8:30 1:00 p.m. she was 19 inches
long seven pounds five point eight
pounds she's just precious we've had so
much fun with her already we've also
realized that having a newborn is so
much work but it's amazing just one is
check-in so thank you to everybody
introduced bill we're planning to do
kind of a birth story video on the vlog
channel for those who want more details
but in a nutshell we didn't know that
last Sunday was going to be the day I
mean I woke up and I was feeling some
contractions but that had happened you
know several other days the week leading
up to this and so I just wasn't certain
that this was the time in fact I
remember being on the phone with mom
saying I don't know if you guys want to
come down yet because this this may just
be you know
false alarm type stuff but it continued
throughout that morning and we decided
the contractions were getting closer
together more painful so we went on to
the hospital when it became no time and
it was time to push push for about 15
minutes and how she came and we're just
so grateful that she's healthy and she's
doing well just perfect but thank you
guys so much for watching and just in
terms of getting back to the regular
videos on this channel the next couple
you see may be ones that I've shot while
I was still pregnant
um so keep an eye out for those Oh like
you say thank you to ever
well as you can tell she's very thick
hey thanks guys we'll talk again soon
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
