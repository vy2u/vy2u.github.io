about to hit you in this video like I am
so excited about this idea I have been
excited about it for a good two weeks
now
I have an old-school caboodle and yes I
bought it knew it would be cooler if I
had like my old caboodle from years and
years ago I think it was pink glitter
and I'm not sure my mom probably
repurposed that to hold like bobby pins
and old buttons in a drawer or something
like that and if you follow me on
Twitter you know what's going on because
I was tweeting about this and by the way
I've got a weird lash situation I am
wearing the most stubborn set of lashes
known to man I think the brand is tart
and they just did not want to play nice
this morning especially this side it
feels so weird so sorry about that
anyways I was saying on Twitter how I
was perusing altas website as I tend to
do and I realized they were selling like
the classic caboodles on there and I was
immediately drawn in and I thought
wouldn't that be fun to have an
old-school classic caboodle the mint
green and lavender you know is that
about as old-school as it gets even this
little like clasp here at the front
that's totally the way it used to be and
it's called the on the go girl classic
case kept the tag so I can tell you that
everything about the way it is on the
inside is what I remember an old-school
caboodle to be like it holds a lot of
stuff this is heavy as I lift it up here
I could work out with this so several
things happened here at first I decided
I wanted the caboodle so I tweeted about
it and then I got massive support to buy
the caboodle then when I thought I could
use this for shop my stash items and it
would be so perfect cuz here's like a
noodle I'm going through my snatch I'm
finding older stuff it just all totally
seems to work I don't have to use any
other part of my storage for the shop my
stash stuff it can just you don't have
its own little home here that always
rotates out to like on a monthly basis I
really want to get back to that and so
once I had that plan in place the thing
was getting bought and I also know I'm
really enthusiastic about an idea when I
texted both Kristen and David to tell
them what I'm about to do so here's the
caboodle all opened up in its plastic
goodness this opens here yes there's a
nice sized mirror you've got that tray
here with a couple compartments even a
little lift out thingy here
and then I've got so much bulky stuff
down the bottom like containers of loose
powder and foundations and it's like
yeah this is this was built to hold some
makeup so please let me know in the
comments section if you have a caboodle
lurking around your house and you're
gonna do this too like if I can get
anybody else to do this with man I think
that'd be awesome
but Ulta is selling them if you're just
crazy enough to get a new one like I am
but let's go through I want to tell you
what I've shot my stash for some of
these are like older products that have
been around for quite sometime in my
collection some of them like new ish
things that I just really want to make a
point to use and if you got a big makeup
collection you got to do this stuff on
purpose like you really have to go
through look at what you have take
inventory from time to time oh and by
the way what happened to decluttering on
my channel well I'm gonna tell you the
sad honest truth about that when I
declutter I used the the top of my desk
here to sit out some things you know I
got to make the piles of the stuff to
keep and the stuff that's a maybe and
the stuff that needs to go away I need
to do some sorting and I know concealer
will be coming next and it's gonna be a
bear of a project there's a lot of
concealer there well the top of my table
is so cluttered right now that I will
have to declutter my table top before I
can even think about decluttering what's
inside that drawer my mornings are so
rushed here like I'm sitting down to do
my video I mean giving the videos all
the time they need but when I'm done I
am out that door and done so I've got
like a mess upon mess sitting on this
table of products and brushes and
different things that just need to be
put away you know go back to their homes
in this room so until that mess gets
cleaned up I can't deal with the mess of
concealer in my drawer that's real life
okay let's get back to the community I'm
crazy I'm going this okay Smashbox
photo-finish radiance primer with
hyaluronic acid I kept this around after
the primer declutter because I said I
wanted to use it and guess what I
haven't really reached for it so I used
it today and I'm gonna make sure to use
that as it is part of my caboodle shot
- stuff I grabbed out a couple of
foundations one is the Lottie London
selfie ready medium coverage Foundation
really enjoyed this and actually loved a
lot of the stuff from this brand if you
watch that video from I don't know
several months ago I was very impressed
and I use this yesterday now it's like
yes I really like that and then the
covergirl vitalist healthy elixir here's
another thing that like once I reviewed
it I just found myself moving on to
other things that I needed to try out so
I want to give this some more time and
I'm wearing this today and this
definitely gives a lot of like healthy
life and radiance to the skin the ladi
London has a nice natural look on the
skin but it's gonna be more matte than
the covergirl so I wanted a couple
options there um
concealer wise my gosh the brands I'm
talking about here this is so random
like as I was shopping my stash I was
thinking I bet there is nobody on this
planet who has this random of an
assortment of brands in their caboodle
or maybe they do and I got a covergirl
smoothers concealer stick this is not
that old like I don't remember when I
got this exactly but it wasn't that long
ago I have it in light I was playing
with that yesterday and it's actually a
really decent concealer stick remember
the covergirl plus ol a concealer sticks
it feels a lot like that formula a
couple things here from Bobbi Brown I've
got the corrector in bisque I completely
wiped out one of these quite some time
ago so this is my second one a nice
peachy corrector and then I've got the
natural creamy concealer kit here so
this is natural and this is the pale
yellow powder so I've got all of this
working on my under-eye today and I
really like that stuff that I just
hadn't been reaching for it Kogan doh
Moisture concealer have I ever even
talked about this on my channel I got
this off of Beauty lish some time ago I
thought it had kind of a peachy
corrector shade and then a couple of
creamy concealers here also great
product great consistency to the
concealer but it needs to be getting
used it kind of actually reminds me a
little bit of the Sonia Kashuk hidden
agenda concealer that's been another
great rediscovered product as of late I
think you're going to come away from
this thinking how does she fit that much
in the caboodle but it's not even packed
it could hold more I got a couple of
loose powders here I need to step out of
my loose powder comfort zone which tends
to be the Lorrimer
yeah if I'm gonna do any baking and then
I also love the two-faced peach powder
just kind of an all-over dusting but
I've had in my collection for some time
this coverfx perfect setting powder I
really need to see how this stacks up
against those other powders today I'm
just wearing this lightly all over I
need to test it more in a baking sense
but another one that I wanted to give a
little more attention to is my Kat Von D
lock-it brightening powder in petal and
this has kind of a soft peachy tone to
it but I have the cover FX + translucent
lights are you a fan of this like what
do you like to use it for best is it
more an all-over thing or is it a baking
thing tell me your preferences there I
want to try at different ways I pulled
out a couple of bronzers one of which
I'm wearing today that's the Too Faced
Sun bunny I haven't been given a whole
lot of love to this but this is a
shimmery bronzer it's got some glow to
it and I'm wearing especially the darker
side on my skin today and I'm feeling a
lot of radiance with this look so I
think that worked out well and then I've
got my ELF
bronzer palette in deep which I believe
I compared this shade to Marc Jacobs
bronzer that's been really popular
lately elf makes some really great
nicely pigmented powder compacts in this
format there's a lighter version for
bronzer there are different good blush
ones there's an awesome highlighting
palette so definitely something to look
into I just love how pigmented they are
and I used the whole bang thing on my
face yesterday
let's talk blushes for a second I've got
this awesome Tom Ford blush and frantic
pink that Kristin actually had gifted to
me a long time ago
and you know how it is with special
products like especially a gift product
you kind of just want to sit it on the
shelf have it look pretty and not touch
it because you know what if I used it up
it wouldn't be here anymore I need to
just love it and use it because it's a
really pretty blush shade I also found a
makeup geek blush that I want to use
this is in the shade called puppy love I
thought this is kind of an interesting
like matte Mavi neutral shade it's
looking even more like Mavi pink on
camera than it did just I don't know in
my regular lighting and then Ayane
Cosmetics does that name ring a bell for
anybody if it does you have been around
on my channel for a while this is the
color goddess kind of a satin finish
blush here sort of rusty I thought it'd
be
pretty with different warm shadow looks
that I might do this time of year but
this is like a Fred's super dollar item
I remember when I discovered these
blushes just amazingly pigmented
gorgeous blushes from this lines called
Ayane and I'm actually wearing a little
bit of goddess on my look on my cheeks
today pulled out several highlights
today I got the makeup revolution vivid
baked eye light in golden lights
gorgeous this is so pretty a makeup
revolution isn't that intense you guys
they have several highlights in this
format and I've always found the golden
lights one to be the most know profound
it's just so brightening also the one
I'm wearing today and this is such a
rediscovered like awesome thing here
this Becca shimmering skin perfecter and
prismatic amethyst I'm wearing that on
the tops of my cheeks really buffed it
in it's so pretty
like why are people not like talking
about this every single day how gorgeous
this is I just love that shade it's
extra brightening because it's got that
little bit of pinky lilac thing going on
it also this NYX away.we glow liquid
highlight in crystal glares I'm gonna be
trying to use this and see just how
similar it might be to the Becca liquid
highlights because it seems to have a
really nice Sheen across the skin and no
flex no chunks in it whatsoever so I
think I'm gonna love playing around with
that I've pulled out a few eyeshadow
palettes kind of some smaller things I
know I'm still like in the thick of some
holiday stuff and so I know
realistically I am gonna be needing to
gravitate toward the newer stuff at
times but what I wanted to go from my
shop my stash stuff I've got a few
things in here my busy art Bridal satin
palette I don't know if I've even told
y'all that I had this but I've used it
several times not nearly enough and how
beautiful is this halfway through the
video you've needed to be fed I'm out of
breath from just coming up the stairs
it's light outside now I mean I just
love the color selection the texture of
the shades they do all have some shimmer
but you can totally still work with this
palette and this palette alone which
might sound crazy but they're really
gorgeous shades and visie art does you
know the
shimmers or satin-finish colors so so
well so I'm excited to use that some
more also what I used on my eyes today
is this Kat Von D the little quad in
smoke I remember when she came out with
these smaller quads and I know I feel
like I'm drawn to the pumpkin the
cranberry type shades this time of year
I love that warmth for those fall tones
but a good cool smoky eye that's what
I'm working with today and I really love
it so much this shade is so good right
here
paired with these kinds of colors like
if you ever find yourself with you know
just that gradient of black to gray to
white and all that try to also find a
color like this which is just a dusty
kind of matte taupe and throw that in
because that helps the blending so much
with a look like this so I'm enjoying
that and then I also got this guy out
remember when I created a brush you guys
remember when I created my own buxom
palette you can go to the store you can
do it online you can pick out different
shades that you want six colors to make
your own custom palette and I made like
world's most random palette here but I
was playing with this the other day and
I'm like yes those are really nice
shadows and I do kind of like what I
threw in here it could create a lot of
different looks those are actually
really nice quality eyeshadows now I'm
guilty of always reaching for the exact
same eyeshadow primer although I'm not
gonna apologize because I love Milani
eyeshadow primer but I also have some
others that I should probably test out I
have this Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
potion in fix and I also have the one in
sin so I know sin is more of like a
shimmery finish this has been around for
a long time a lot I've probably used it
but see that like kind of borderline
pinkie glow that that has so it could be
nice to like really make a statement on
the lid you know with a shimmery shadow
and then fix is very um like skin tone a
little bit yellow tone totally will like
blank out any discoloration on your lids
so we're talking two really different
formulas from what I'm used to today I
used fix and I was like wow you really
got to make a point to smooth that stuff
out like in the future I might actually
use a brush to put that on because it's
not just like this sheer sort of
lightweight eye primer there's really a
thickness and
and opacity to the formula on your lids
so you got to be careful I guess I have
a couple of these things from Clarins
and they look gorgeous has anybody ever
used the ombre iridescent cream to
powder long-lasting shadows I have
silver pink and silver plum I feel like
I would love silver plum for a one
shadow look or like do a one shadow look
with that and then just pop a little bit
of this one right on the lid or
something I don't know they feel really
nice like a very beautiful texture of
eyeshadow but I want to see if they can
hang on their own or like what exactly
the best way to use these will be but
they do claim to be long lasting so
we'll see about that
grab my total tease mascara from
covergirl because I do really like this
one but I want to make a point to
actually use it and finish it up before
it dries out also my G Vinci base
mascara perfecto I remember this from my
super high end video this is one of
those things where I don't know that I
totally love this product so much but I
did spend some money on it and I want to
make sure I experiment with it at least
with different mascaras so I've got that
in here it's actually a pink lash primer
and then I have a couple of brow things
I really love that elf the instant lift
brow pencils working really great for me
but I grabbed out this makeup forever
brow pencil number 40 very classic just
standard pencil I mean it doesn't get
more pencil like than that it's a very
cool kind of medium to deep brown and
then also this Tarte arch architect brow
pencil and gel I was really getting into
this for a period of time and then I
don't know what happened it's kind of a
teardrop shaped somewhat triangular I
guess brow pencil so it's a little bit
on the thick side fills in the brows
pretty quickly and I'm wearing that
today by the way and then the gel holds
so nicely it's just a clear gel on the
other side so that's kind of a handy
quick duo I didn't want to overwhelm
myself with eyeliners because if I'm not
doing a super glam look a lot of times I
do skip the eyeliner but one that I
would like to work into a look is this
infallible paints in wild green so this
is a pen type eyeliner just a rich
forest green pretty much the shade that
you see there on the outer packaging so
I thought that would be fun also these
Maybelline Color
- I Chrome's which I would use in very
much the same way I would use those
infallible paints cream eyeshadows but I
have a great green here what's this
called electric emerald and then beige
luster are the two and I thought this
would also be a pretty eyeliner so maybe
I could work all of this into a look
together and then a couple of just
drugstore eyeshadows here I was feeling
nostalgic okay I pulled out my covergirl
shimmering sands trio just for a quick
look you know nothing beats that I would
like to pull that out again and then
Neutrogena nourishing long wear eye
shadow with built-in primer in classic
nude I think I reviewed this one and
another one that I had in my collection
quite a while ago but these are very
nice soft eyeshadows lip stuff keeping
in mind the fact that I've still got
some holiday type lip collections to try
out I grabbed five things from my stash
what is the thing I'm wearing now which
really feels I kind of like a lip
treatment
I suppose it's from Clarins and it's the
instant light natural lip Perfector in
0-8 I've had this for a while I think I
may have talked about this before it
smells like cake mix like a vanilla cake
mix that's just the instant thing that
comes to mind but it's got this little
doe foot the kind where product comes up
through and it is kind of a shear
thinning like some of this may have worn
off a little bit while I was downstairs
but I'll reapply Sun Salutation but I
have 955 here which is kind of a spicy
deep brick red comes off basically matte
on the lips another matte lipstick I got
Maybelline's formula is fantastic siren
and scarlet such a nice matte red
lipstick grabbed one of the lipsticks
from the Maybelline bolds collection
this one's called Moffitt I like to move
it move it and this one is
kind of a cream I would say a cream
formula it doesn't have an amazing
amount of shine but it's not quite as
flat as their matte lipsticks if that
makes sense really pretty shade there
sometimes these mauve colors are kind of
hard to make sense of but I see me
wearing that a lot and I wish I would
have worn it more and then also I've got
this bite amuse-bouche lipstick in
beetroot I can't remember where this
came from I think I got this in a set
but this is this is me
you know that's my berry right there so
I love that shade I've barely used this
color though and I think this time of
year is the perfect time to get it going
so how do I do guys I think I got some
really freaking random things in my
kaboodle this month and I really want to
do this more trying to really take
inventory of my stash on a monthly basis
get more on top of the decluttering too
but also just going through and
appreciating those things that I have
pulling them out getting use out of them
I get a lot of satisfaction out of that
and hopefully it's satisfying to you the
viewer to see me going back to things
that I've talked about and have really
loved and getting use out of them all
over again so thank you guys so much for
your time I hope this was fun and I will
see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
