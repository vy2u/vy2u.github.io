me for this video I haven't done a hole
in a while and this one I've got to say
is big there's just a lot of stuff to
include not all of it was purchased
necessarily on the same day but I mean I
just kind of wanted to update you on the
new things that I have that you may be
seen soon in a video or if you want to
see more of it just let me just a couple
things that I have tried and I'm going
to start off with those there are some
new pallets from wet and wild and they
are limited edition holiday pallets and
I'm so super excited that i found them
because i've heard people on Twitter and
on Facebook talking about how great
these are so this one is actually the
one I'm wearing now and it's kind of a
combination of plum shades and like
shimmery neutral shades so it's really
gorgeous i'm wearing more of the neutral
side today the lighting is kind of back
as i'm shooting this at night here but
um i really really think i'm going to
enjoy this and it just kind of stuck out
as unique and unusual there's a variety
of finishes and these pallets so that's
great and it also came with an eyeliner
this kit came with like a purplish one
which i have kind of on my lower lash
line and then there's another one that i
got and there were four different ones
the ones i didn't get there was one that
was more neutral Browns and then the
other was greens and blues but I had to
pick up this one this is called night
the one I just showed you a Sugar Plum
Fairy i believe and this one is called
night elf and this is how it's packaged
so it is more of like a giftie type
thing you get the liner and you get all
the shadows there and I thought this was
gorgeous with that red and the sparkly
black I mean this just screams smokey
eye and lots of things you can do with
that for that really glamorous holiday
look so I couldn't turn that one down
and also another thing people have been
tweeting me about are these pallets from
profusion and they're actually on like
eye shadow wallets so this one is a
green one and a lot of the shades like
if there were multiple colors of the
palettes I think the shades overlapped a
little bit in some of them but you can
see here it's like kind of a variety of
metallic shadows and I was watching them
I haven't
earn this yet but they're really vivid
they remind me kind of the coastal
scents like metal mania shades so if
you're looking for maybe a smaller
version of that or you haven't tried
metal mania and you want to see
something similar from the drugstore
then you pick that up the next thing
that I got this was from hard candy and
this is the glamour flage heavy duty
concealer this is new to the line and I
just thought this kind of initially
reminded me of the kat von d tattoo
concealer because it claims to be so
heavy duty and they actually tell you
how to conceal a tattoo with this stuff
because it comes with a little pencil as
well a little concealer pencil so I
thought that was neat really wanted to
test that as well as the hide n glow
cheek my shade isn't hot date and
basically this is a double-ended like a
cream blush but they're more like kind
of a transparent gel so it's almost like
a cheek stain sort of thing and so
there's a dark side in a pink side so
I'll have to try that and let you know
how that goes and as you can see my
nails are bare right now because I'm
kind of in transition this is what I'm
going to be putting on my nails next it
is bare naked from the Rimmel lasting
pro up to 10 day where people told me
that they work really well with the top
coat so this just kind of the nude che I
think it's going to match pretty much
anything I decided to put on so that's
good next up some things from neck and
this is exciting because I just tried
this stuff so I mean I just purchased it
so I haven't tried it but I got a new
foundation that I wanted to test out and
it is the mac pro longwear spf10
foundation so my shade they told me they
tested it out on me kind of reshape
tested me and it was NC 35 is what they
ended up giving me there so um I'm kind
of excited to test it out i will
definitely let you know how that
compares to like drugstore brands like
revlon colorstay and maybelline
superstay and whatnot also got a
lipstick in and
is in a cream sheen in cream cup and I
just thought this was gorgeous it's kind
of like a pinky nude shade and it does
go on a little bit creamier I feel like
than some of the other colors i have so
that's nice and then I got this this is
really cool because it contains Mac
products that I have never tried before
pigment and eyeliner and what else is in
here a mascara from Mac as well it's the
noble night / in line I bag and so this
is really close thinking of trying some
more things individually but then I saw
this and just thought well why not you
know if I'm wanting to try things out I
might as well just do it this way so you
get this cute little bag which actually
says Mac on the little crest so they're
so very preppy and cute and then you
also get a little magazine lash you get
a liner in blitz and glitz and there
were two different options here and I
went with the one that comes with the
the teal pigment you can see they're
very metallic and fun and then the liner
is blitz and glitz which really up close
in the Sun this looked like a dark dark
brownish black with sparkle but it looks
more like just plain old black here and
then you get a mac what is it a 209 mini
like liner brush to use with that so I'm
super excited to test these things out i
have never tried any of the mac like i
said pigment cream liner or the mascara
it comes all together in this little
kind of try me set so i'm gonna see how
that goes i also went to Alta where I
got kind of a wide range of things I'm
trying out this benefit erase paste I've
heard some good things about this is it
as a concealer and it really has my
here i got it in medium and this
definitely has a salmon EPG kind of
undertone which should be really good
for dark circles so we'll test that out
and see how we're requesting a really
glittery glam holiday look and so i
picked up one of these knicks glitter
cream palettes and how much fun could
that be for you know really sparkly look
this one is in sweet chocolate browns
and I'll open it up if that makes any
difference if it's super bright and
sparkly either way but I just kind of
thought with the golds and then there's
just some actually sparkling neutral
shades but it looks so you know blingy
and fantastic there I'm excited to see
how that works also from NYX I got a few
new single eyeshadows I have this one in
wildfire which is a pretty kind of jade
green when I thought wildfire I thought
why would they named a green shade that
I so got dark brown which is just a nice
matte ground and a blue in Atlantic and
these were Martin down so this has a
little shimmer to it so I just thought
hey i'll try and while I have the chance
because I don't have an Ulta really near
me so where we were at I was like I need
to go nuts here who got a couple of the
knicks mega shine lip glosses because i
love these lip glosses and the shadow
guy a pink frost which is just a really
really light pink with some shimmer and
then sweetheart which is a it's a shade
i have on right now so just kind of a
pretty nude gloss um i just love the
texture and feel of those glosses and
i'm trying a few more things from the
brand essence i try to lip gloss from
them a while back and i wanted to see
how some of the other stuff was i got
the black mania carbon black mascara and
i also got the black mania eyeliner pin
the pin is is unique and that actually
has an angle to it many of the liner
pins I've tried have a like a pointed
tip but this one has an angle so that
could be fun it might make it easier to
do cat eyes or things like that i'm not
sure but excited to try that it's got a
nice tight cap on it too so that's a
good sign and then this is the brush on
the mascara their unibrow a couple of
lipsticks the shades are glamour Queen
and femme fatale and these are this is
glamour Queen I thought it was really
pretty it's kind of a neutral but it's a
little bit deeper and it has some
shimmer to it so I thought why not test
it out see how these lipsticks are
because they were really cheap and then
this is femme fatale which has it
more of just a creamy shade and it's
kind of just oh my gosh cupcake hello
she just dove onto the desk here um but
this one's just kind of a creamy sort of
very shade and I thought it would just
be really pretty for the holidays I also
went to forever 21 and I got some boots
so I thought these were really cute
they're kind of shorter boots but they
have a nice little heel on them and the
toe is somewhat pointed and they have
this little you can see um like a little
end that goes through a loop there to
sort of make them a little bit slouchy
and I tried these on they looked really
cute with my G also this headband kind
of a sparkly headband maybe I could
warrant with my ponytail today that
could have been cute yeah so use it in
situations like that but it's kind of
not it's not really rhinestones it's
just like a dark sparkly bead on there
then clothes wise I'm sorry if this
won't show up very well but I got this
little dress and it's kind of like a
little shirt dress it has sleeves that
are just coming down a little longer
than like a cap sleeve but this is like
a army green leopard print so it's got
the green black and gray in it has a
little tie that the tie goes around your
waist and I tried this on and I was like
oh my gosh this is so cute and how cute
would it be with like a black sweater
layered over the top of it or you know I
could even wear it on the news it's kind
of like an underneath thing because we
try to keep our prints to a minimum but
I think underneath something more
something solid this print could look
adorable peeking out through so really
like that and I also got this top which
they had kind of on special display and
so it really caught my eye and it's a
three-quarter sleeve that's kind of
gathered up toward the shoulder and then
you can see it's got this really super
cute ruffle around the neck so I thought
this would be a great top for the news
as well just that extra added detail and
I love this color of blue I love that
royal blue that's just it just really
pops on our camera and we have a blue
background as well so it just really
comes off nicely
we're back so Tyler what did you come up
with I got two things one pretty big
ticket item and then one moderately big
ticket is your big ticket I don't
actually have it yet but in a picture of
it and say a bonded driver today for
golf for golfing but they had to order
it they didn't have the 1i news in stock
what's it called its called the callaway
diablo octane which sounds really cool I
thought there's a shot of it eight yards
longer than titanium what does that mean
kid if you'll hit it long as I guess the
ball goes 8 yards further when they use
whatever composite metal they're using
where they got that from but I'm gonna
lie this is kind of going over my head a
little bit yeah yeah they kind of
suckered me and they were like hey Drago
I thought they knew they nor you in no
I'm a sudden I started hitting this
driver extremely well so had to go with
it well that's awesome so something to
look forward to for all the people that
actually understand go I guess hablo
they got the eight and a half degree
loft tour pro version which doesn't have
any bearing on my skills as a golfer
actually I also got this I guess you'd
call it a jacket it's wiki Tyler got it
from Marshalls by columbia right and you
got it like half the original cost
they're supposed to be a hundred bucks
and I have 50 soon why why did you why
did you need this I needed a like jacket
that I could wear to work when it's not
really cold and it's not like a super
super formal looking type of thing okay
because all the jackets I have real like
a like a trench coat or a mega long
black winter coat but I don't have
something that's just kind of light yeah
it's lined in kind of a softer material
and the what's on the outside I thought
it would be appropriate because it's
it's not like a win jack
it's not like one of those athletic
coats know where this a lot I'm sure
daily until it gets really cold then
you'll put on a different jack I don't
put on a much heavier jacket there
anything else we should share with the
masses hmm weird give it give everyone
an update on the cupcake she's got a lot
of energy lately she I'll run around all
around the house it seems like she's got
to speed she's either like really
sleeping one to like be on top he is
sleeping and let me get all of it I line
up yes she drives you to close your face
is probable and then lay there or she is
just racing Racing racing oh yeah I'd
behind stuff and jump at you and you
want but I like to lie on her back and
then like number belly realities back
you know what I think it's time for okay
Kim okay Kim Yong gig ever it's like
it's t-shirt done but it's cupcake in
cupcake cam now
