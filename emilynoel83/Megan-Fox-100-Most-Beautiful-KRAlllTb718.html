Magazine's 100 most beautiful people
series where I kind of select a
celebrity that was on this year's list
in the magazine and I go ahead and try
to duplicate their look basically so so
far I've done Jennifer Lopez and Carrie
Underwood and today's look is Megan Fox
so if you haven't seen the magazine this
is her look there she's got very you
know fresh skin as its characteristic in
many of her pictures but in this one her
eyes are sort of natural and she's got
kind of a rosy lip so that's sort of you
know the look I'm going for here with
this and so it's a very actually easy
look to duplicate and it's the kind of
look that could be a great everyday look
for a lot of us so that's kind of why I
wanted to pick this I know sometimes you
know we've probably all seen her looking
different than she does maybe in this
picture but I thought this was kind of a
classic you know shot of what she
usually does look like so I'm gonna base
it off of that picture in the magazine
and take you through how I did the color
on the face the eyes and the lips and if
you want to see how I pulled it off keep
on watching all right something I've
noticed is that Megan and almost all of
her pictures just seems to have a really
great glow to her skin it's not
necessarily a completely matte look so
that's why I'm gonna be taking some
bronzing products and also a cream blush
to show you how to kind of achieve that
look that she's got first though what
I've already done is applied a
foundation and I used one that has not
necessarily the most matte finish and it
is Maybelline's mineral power I am
medium one and then I also used my Bobbi
Brown foundation stick in natural just
to conceal some areas around my face
it's just really nice for spot
concealing and then I dusted some Mary
Kay loose powder all over just to set
that part now as for the rest of her
face it's it I won't necessarily call it
in this picture that I'm going off of
super bronze but it just has that really
healthy look so I'm gonna use a bronzer
that I recently got that I'm really
really liking because it's just natural
enough you know what I mean it's not
over the top it's not and
believable sort of bronze but it's from
Mac and it is the bronzing powder and
golden and so it's not overly shimmery
but it's just the color tone works
really well with my skin and I'm just
going to use this you know where I would
usually put bronzer kind of around your
temples where the Sun might naturally
you know hit and I'm using this big
kabuki brush I've had some questions
about it I found this at Big Lots and
the brand is called upstage there's no
telling exactly what Big Lots will all
be can you know how they all kind of
carry different items at different times
so I can't promise you that every Big
Lots has this but you know it might be
worth a look so again just kind of
dusting this giving myself a light
dusting and then I'm gonna go back and
kind of concentrate some right there
kind of it's a little cheek contour same
for this side and right up in here so
now we've got that pretty kind of not
over-the-top but a little bit of a
bronzed look and then I want to keep
with the dewy cheeks that she has so I'm
gonna try another new Mac product I know
I got a few new things but this is the
cream blush in Posie and so it's a
really pretty kind of deep pink shade
and a little bit goes a long way I found
but I'm just gonna get a little bit on
my finger and sort of dots them right
here I'm just gonna kind of blend it out
in a circular motion mainly blending it
back and this just gives us that really
fresh healthy look so same here just
kind of blend it back using very little
of the product and then just to sort of
set the look and keep with the somewhat
you know just semi semi shimmery look
that she's got going on
I'm gonna use my Physicians Formula
shimmer strips in Waikiki strip it's
kind of a peachy glow and I'm gonna use
my fan brush to make sure I keep it
really sheer on the application and I'm
just going to just that over my cheeks
for a highlight here and right down the
nose
and across the forehead alright time for
the eyes and Megan's eyes at least in
the picture I'm going off of our pretty
minimal so and you really can't totally
see maybe exactly what's done in terms
of eyeshadow but I can tell that there's
not a lot of contouring out in here and
it's kept for the most part pretty
natural so I'm gonna use a new quad that
I have from covergirl called drama eyes
and these colors are actually really
pigmented and have really nice color
payoff so covergirl has kind of changed
their formulations of their shadows and
so if you're looking for a quad like
this I mean with kind of some smokey
shades this would be a really good pick
but today you're gonna see how we use it
in more of a natural way so I'm gonna
take the silver shade that's right here
right there and I'm gonna use my ELF eye
shadow brush and I've already put on
some Too Faced shadow insurance but I'm
gonna use to apply this silver all over
my lid here just to give us kind of that
base color to make us seem wide awake
you know and ready to go okay
that'll be good there and then I'm gonna
take my uhm medium sized essence of
beauty crease brush and there's a really
pretty kind of burgundy shade here on
the end and just to give us some natural
contour to our eye I'm gonna get a
little bit of that on my brush and not
really try to form an outer V or
anything like that but just kind of get
that here in our crease
just deepening it up a little bit
burgundy shades can be a really really
natural contour and if you're looking
for you know an easy easy way to get
that depth that you want without using a
black shade try a deep burgundy or you
know deep plum those can be really
natural because you're working off of
tones that are natural in your skin
those you know really kind of red
undertones and things like that so
anyway you've got a little bit of that
there and then just for a teeny bit of
added depth in the corner I'm going to
take my smaller crease brush and go to
the the shimmery black shade and just
apply a little bit of that right on the
outer half of the crease I'm trying to
use a very light application here
because I don't want to go make this
over the top or anything like that we're
just going for a little bit of
definition here okay and then I'm gonna
take a separate shade because then she
doesn't have any real bright white
highlight up in here it's kept pretty
natural so I'm going to take this a
single covergirl single and golden
sunrise which I used to use them a whole
lot adds just a highlight shape you
might think that's a little dark to be a
highlight well use it really lightly
it's just a really great wash of kind of
golden a warm color so I'm using my
Sephora rounded crease brush and just
kind of going over the border of what we
did and go all the way up to the brow
just for a nice warm sort of highlight
there now for liner I'm going to be
using my Revlon Colorstay
liquid liner in blackest black and
really there's not much going on on her
bottom lash line so we're gonna keep
this pretty much confined to the top and
we are gonna be putting on some
individual fake lashes here in a second
so I'm gonna get put this down as sort
of a base for them so you can't really
see where you put them on exactly
and this is not winged out this is kept
pretty natural I can tell that she's got
just some black classic black liner on
her top lash line so that's just kind of
what we're sticking to here you may want
to widen it out just a little bit at the
corner but other than that keep it
pretty standard
so Megan maintains a pretty natural look
to her lashes but it has it's like a
natural thickness so what I'm gonna do
is go ahead and apply a couple of coats
of my all may one coat nourishing
mascara and it has it has two sides to
the wand one is thickening and one is
lengthening so that's gonna kind of make
up my two coats there I'm gonna just put
a little touch of that on the bottom and
then I'll come back and join you when I
put on three little bundles of
individual lashes
all right the individual lashes that I'm
using are from the elf individual lash
kits so these are probably my favorite
individual lash bundles that I have and
they're only a dollar so that's awesome
and I've already applied two of them and
you'll be able to they'll show up a
little better once I top them off with
mascara after they've totally dried but
basically the way I do this is I pull
one of them off and you can see it's got
that little bitty tip there I grab my
lash glue and just kind of get a little
bubble of it up there and then you've
coated that little on tip of the lashes
and we're gonna let that dry here
briefly and then I'm gonna go ahead and
just set it on there and I'm kind of
focusing them on the outer half so we've
got that nice little sweep of thickness
with the lashes they're usually you know
you want the glue to get tacky so you do
have to wait a little while because then
it's really gonna stay where you want it
rather than drooping down and stuff
there it is it's on there it's these are
very very fine lashes and they don't
show up actually a whole lot until you
put a little coat of mascara on there so
I'm gonna go ahead and do that and then
join you with the finish guys here is my
finished look as I said I'm channeling
Megan Fox in this in this look and
really I mean I think the only thing we
haven't touched on yet is the brown she
has um somewhat a decent amount of
thickness to her eyebrows so for me I
didn't have to do a whole lot because my
brows are sort of similar thickness so I
just went ahead and filled in a couple
little places on the outer edges put on
some gel so they kind of stay in place
and kept it like that as I said we put
on the bundles of individual lashes to
give ourselves some thickness at the
outer edges and then her lips are just
kind of a really fresh sort of you know
pinky just kind of really feminine shade
just kind of juicy lips but they're not
totally red and so I used a shade it's
from the Maybelline I think that's the
moisture extreme lipstick and this shade
is rose berry
so I put a coat of that on and then
blotted it off because I thought it was
a little too bright and then I topped it
off with sort of a lighter pink lip
gloss it's the covergirl amazement lip
gloss and this is everything's rosy okay
so kind of a lighter pink and I think
that kind of achieved what she was going
for not overly shiny but still you know
really really pretty and just that you
know it kind of gives you that glow to
the rest of your face so anyway guys I
hope you enjoyed this tutorial and thank
you so much for watching I think this
even though you know we don't all have
her blue eyes or whatever you may not
have the same features as her like I
mean I definitely don't but it just goes
to show that you can use some of the
things that you see on a day to day
basis in Hollywood and actually
incorporate it into your own makeup look
so thanks for watching guys have a great
day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
