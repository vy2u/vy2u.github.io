Magazine's 100 most beautiful people
series where I kind of select a
celebrity that was on this year's list
in the magazine and I go ahead and try
to duplicate their look basically so so
far I've done Jennifer Lopez and carrie
underwood and today's look is megan fox
so if you haven't seen the magazine this
is her look there she's got very you
know fresh skin as is characteristic in
many of her pictures but in this one her
eyes are sort of natural and she's got
kind of a rosy lips so that's sort of
you know the look I'm going for here
with this and so it's a very actually
easy look to duplicate and it's the kind
of look that could be a great everyday
look for a lot of us so that's kind of
why I wanted to pick this I know
sometimes you know we've probably all
seen her looking different than she does
maybe in this picture but I thought this
was kind of a classic you know a shot of
what she usually does look like so I'm
going to base it off of that picture in
the magazine and take you through how I
did the color on the face the eyes and
the lips and if you want to see how I
pulled it off keep on launching all
right something I've noticed is that
Megan and almost all of her pictures
just seems to have a really great glow
to her skin it's not necessarily a
completely matte look so that's why I'm
going to be taking some bronzing
products and also a cream blush to show
you how to kind of achieve that look
that she's got first though what I've
already done is applied a foundation and
I used one that has not necessarily the
most matte finish and it is maybelline's
mineral power I am medium one and then i
also used my Bobby Brown foundation
stick in natural just to conceal some
areas around my face it's just really
nice for spot concealing and then I
dusted some mary kay loose powder all
over just to set that part now as for
the rest of her face it's it I won't
necessarily call it in this picture that
I'm going off of super bronze but it
just has that really healthy look so I'm
going to use a bronzer that I recently
got that I'm really really liking
because it's just natural enough you
know what I mean it's not over the top
it's not and
believable sort of bronze but it's from
mac and it is the bronzing powder in
golden and so it's not overly shimmery
but it's just the color tone works
really well with my skin and I'm just
going to use this you know where I would
usually put bronzer kind of around your
temples where the Sun might naturally
you know hit and I'm using this big
kabuki brush I've had some questions
about it I found this at big lots and
the brand is called upstage there's no
telling exactly what big lots will all
be caring you know how they all kind of
carry different items at different times
so I can't promise you that every big
lots has this but um you know it might
be worth a look so again just kind of
jesting this getting myself a light
dusting and then I'm going to go back
and kind of concentrate some right there
kind of it's a little cheek contour same
for this side right up in here so now
we've got that pretty kind of not over
the top but a little bit of a bronze
look and then I want to keep with the
dewy cheeks that she has so I'm going to
try another new Mac product I know I got
a few new things but this is the cream
blush in Posey and so it's a really
pretty I'm kind of deep pink shade and a
little bit goes a long way I found but
I'm just going to get a little bit on my
finger and sort of dots them right here
I'm just going to kind of blend it out
in a circular motion mainly blending it
back and this just gives us that really
fresh healthy look so same here just
kind of blend it back using very little
of the product and then just to sort of
set the look and keep with the somewhat
you know just semi semi shimmery look
that she's got going on I'm gonna use my
physicians formula shimmer strips in
Waikiki strip it's kind of a peachy glow
and I'm going to use my fan brush to
make sure I keep it really sheer on the
application and i'm just going to just
that over my cheeks for a highlight here
and write down the nose and across the
four
all right time for the eyes and Megan's
eyes at least in the picture I'm going
off of our pretty minimal so and you
really can't totally see maybe exactly
what's done in terms of eyeshadow but I
can tell that there's not a lot of
contouring out in here and it's kept for
the most part pretty natural so I'm
going to use a new quad that I have from
covergirl called drama eyes and these
colors are actually really pigmented and
have really nice color payoff so cover
girl has kind of changed their
formulations of their shadows and so if
you're looking for a quad like this i
mean with kind of some smoky shades this
would be a really good pic but today
you're going to see how we use it in
more of a natural way so i'm going to
take the silver shade that's right here
right there and i'm going to use my elf
eyeshadow brush and i've already put on
some Too Faced shadow insurance but i'm
going to use apply this silver all over
my lid here just to give us kind of that
base color to make us seem wide awake
you know and ready to go okay that'll be
good there and then i'm going to take my
um medium sized essence of beauty crease
brush and there's a really pretty kind
of burgundy shade here on the end and
just to give us some natural contour to
our i I'm gonna get a little bit of that
on my brush and not really try to form
an outer V or anything like that but
just kind of get that here in our crease
just deepening it up a little bit
burgundy shades can be a really really
natural contour and if you're looking
for you know an easy easy way to get
that depth that you want without using a
black shade try a deep burgundy r you
know deep plum those can be really
natural because you're working off of
tones that are naturally in your skin
those you know really kind of red
undertones and things like that so
anyway you've got a little bit of that
there and then just for a teeny bit of
added depth in the corner I'm going to
take my smaller crease brush and go to
the shimmery black shade and just apply
a little bit of that right on the outer
half of the crease I'm trying to use a
very light application here because I
don't want to go make this over the top
or anything like that we're just going
for a little bit of definition here okay
and then I'm going to take a separate
shade because then she doesn't have any
real bright white highlight up in here
it's kept pretty natural so I'm going to
take this a single cover real single and
golden sunrise which I used to use on a
whole lot adds just a highlight shade
you might think that's a little dark to
be a highlight well use it really
lightly it's just a really great wash of
kind of gold any warm color so i'm using
my sephora rounded crease brush and just
kind of going over the border of what we
did and go all the way up to the brow
just for a nice warm sort of highlight
there now for liner i'm going to be
using my revlon colorstay liquid liner
in black it's black and really um
there's not much going on on her bottom
lash line so we're going to keep this
pretty much confined to the top and we
are going to be putting on some
individual fake lashes here in a second
so I'm going to get put this down as
sort of a base for them so you can't
really see where you put them on exactly
and this is not winged out this is kept
pretty natural I can tell that she's got
just some black classic black liner on
her top lash line so that's just kind of
what we're sticking to hear you may want
to widen it out just a little bit at the
corner but other than that keep it
pretty standard so Megan maintains a
pretty natural look to her lashes but it
has it's like a natural thickness so
what I'm going to do is go ahead and
apply a couple of coats of my all may
one coat nourishing mascara and it has
it has two sides to the 11 is thickening
and one is lengthening so that's going
to kind of make up my two coats there
I'm going to just put a little touch of
that on the bottom and then I'll come
back and join you when I put on three
little bundles of individual lashes all
right the individual lashes that i'm
using are from the elf individual lash
kits so these are probably my favorite
individual lash bundles that i have and
they're only a dollar so that's awesome
and I've already applied two of them and
you'll be able to they'll show up a
little better once I top them off with
mascara after they've totally dried but
basically the way I do this is I pull
one of them off and you can see it's got
that little bitty tip there I grab my
lash glue and just kind of get a little
bubble of it up there and then you've
coated that little on tip of the lashes
and we're going to let that dry here
briefly and then I'm going to go ahead
and just set it on there I'm kind of
focusing them on the outer half so we've
got that nice little sweep of thickness
with the lashes they're usually you know
you want it the glue to get tacky so you
do have to wait a little while because
then it's really going to stay where you
want it rather than drooping down and
stuff there it is it's on there it's
these are very very fine lashes and they
don't show up actually a whole lot until
you put a little coat of mascara on
there so I'm going to go ahead and do
that and then join you with the finish
all right guys here is my finished look
as i said i'm channeling megan fox in
this in this look and
it's really i mean i think the only
thing we haven't touched on yet is the
brown she has somewhat a decent amount
of thickness to her eyebrows so for me I
didn't have to do a whole lot because my
browser sort of similar thickness so I
just went ahead and filled in a couple
little places on the outer edges put on
some gel so they kind of stay in place
and kept it like that as I said we put
on the bundles of individual lashes to
give ourselves some thickness at the
outer edges and then her lips are just
kind of a really fresh sort of you know
pinky just kind of really feminine shade
just kind of juicy lips but they're not
totally red and so I used a shade it's
from the Maybelline I think it's the
moisture extreme lipstick and the shade
is roseberry so I put a coat of that on
and then blotted it off because I
thought it was a little too bright and
then I topped it off with sort of a
lighter pink lip gloss it's the
covergirl amazement lip gloss and this
is everything's rosie ok so kind of a
lighter pink and I think that kind of
achieved what she was going for not
overly shiny but still you know really
really pretty and just that you know it
kind of gives you that glow to the rest
of your face so anyway guys I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and thank you so
much for watching I think this even
though you know we don't all have her
blue eyes or whatever you may not have
the same features as her like I mean I
definitely don't but it just goes to
show that you can use some of the things
that you see on a day-to-day basis in
Hollywood and actually incorporate it
into your own makeup look so thanks for
watching guys have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
