joining me for this video on this is
going to be all about a new palette from
Coastal Scents it's the 88 metal mania
palette I've already posted a tutorial
I'm using this palette obviously it
doesn't show the whole scope of what
this is cuz there's 88 colors in it so
I'll probably do some more looks but
this is just going to be kind of a
run-through of what this pellets all
about and how I feel about it after
using it for some time now and also in
this video I'm going to compare this to
my Coastal Scents 78 palette which is
sort of like the 88 only it's got blush
in it
the 88 shimmer and the 88 warm so I get
so many questions like you know they'll
see when somebody will you know learn
about Coastal Scents for the first time
and they think they're going in for one
palette and then they look at the
website and they're like which one do I
need now I totally know that feeling so
I'm going to sort of explain who these
different palettes may be best for how
they compare that sort of thing so let's
get right into it with the metal mania
palette what you're getting is you know
one of these plasticky palettes here has
the whole label there on the front what
palette it is metal mania you might get
a little intimidated like you know that
sounds kind of intense but really it's
not that scary and it's honestly not
that metallic really um so here's a look
at the 88 shades you are getting here at
first glance I think this appears to be
a very neutral palette I just feel like
the whole color scheme is very neutral
as a whole very much kind of based
around our natural skin tones you're
gonna see over on this side sort of a
brighter color scheme here with these
pinks but still you know pinks and
things like that do play off of natural
tones in our skin um when you look at
these I think they appear like the
shades in the 88 shimmer palette they
appear to be quite shimmery most of them
however there are a few that are kind of
deceiving and they don't instantly look
all that shimmery but they have like a
that dual tone to them it's like they
have a blue undertone or like an
iridescent finish that you don't expect
to see so that's kind of fun you know to
be able to go through the palette and
then you know not
everything is kind of what you first
think it is when you see it the main
thing that I think people need to know
about this palette is that the finish
you get on your eye completely depends
on what kind of brush you use or what
kind of method you use to apply it okay
if I take my finger and I rub it on top
of one of these shades I am going to get
a very metallic finish there you know
but if I took this product and I put it
on a brush that was somewhat more fluffy
and I got it on that brush and then I
applied it on my hand I'm going to get a
much more diffused color there so
basically what I'm trying to get at is
that if you want to apply this and make
it look light and not too thick and not
too metallic or shiny or shimmery all
you need to do is apply it with a you
know like a fluffier brush you pack it
on you get the shine you dust it and
make it a little more blended out you're
not gonna get all that shine I've really
noticed that with the tutorial I did I
was kind of surprised at how much of an
impact that made on the application I'm
just going through the colors I find
that the gold colors and sort of the
metal toned shades here like the golds
and there's a few Silver's that really
come off super pigmented I think the
folks at Coastal Scents did a great job
in terms of those golden shades because
they are really truly metallic the the
bronzes there's like a deep bronze here
that I really like I mean check it out
these are these can be very intense and
then going to a silver one where was my
silver yeah here we go you know the
silver is pretty impressive as well so
kind of those you know there's gold
bronze silver those shades I feel like
really pull off this metallic look well
so if that's something you're going for
you can achieve that with those shades
and then we go to like a green and the
green is pretty but it doesn't quite
pack as much of a punch
necessarily
there's a few greens you've got a few
plummy purples which also you know don't
turn out they're pretty but they don't
turn out to be quite as intense as those
you know metallic metal shades and then
you've got some really fun bright colors
that I think are fun to play with and if
you watch my tutorial you know I like to
use these you know pinkish shades or
brighter shades kind of up in here kind
of fading that darkest shading your
crease up to something that's really
light and fun there's a pink and you can
see almost as I put it right up to the
camera at least from my vantage point it
practically looks purple there it's pink
so you're seeing that kind of double
tone on some of these this is one that
has that look oh there's an interesting
pink here I need to find a clean finger
there's a pink that has sort of a it
looks blue and sometimes it looks pink
and then there's a white that is like a
truly gosh hopefully I can show you but
it's there on my ring finger and it's
like a true iridescent finish with sort
of it looks goes from pink to green to
practically blue so there are some
surprising shades in this palette some
of them are more shimmery than others
they don't all have the exact same
finish though many of them do look
shimmery and metallic some of them you
know honestly don't look that metallic
at all
some of them are practically borderline
like a satin or a matte finish just a
few just a couple and there are that way
so you are gonna have a little variation
sort of the bummer to this palette is
that when I want to use some of these
brighter shades and make a look out of
them and what you may've seen that I had
to do in my tutorial using this palette
I had to go out and find a separate like
matte black shade just to tone things
down a little bit and I understand like
it wouldn't make sense to say idiot
metal mania palette plus you know one
matte black shade no that doesn't really
make much sense at all so I see why you
know it doesn't make sense for them to
throw in one matte black shade but
that's the problem you are
into when you get these pallets that are
just sort of labeled that way because
you know you're not gonna get that one
matte shade to kind of pull everything
down a notch and sort of make it even
more wearable make you look less muddy
you know the closest you can get in this
palette to black it's probably this
shade right here may not look black from
that vantage point but it's still very
shiny and so I feel like sometimes looks
with all these colors require something
a little more matte thrown in so
assuming you have you know a matte brown
or a matte black in your collection I
think this could work for you if you
like neutrals it's gonna work for you
fine but now I'm gonna lay down my
palettes side by side we're gonna take a
closer look at them and really see what
one might be best for you okay everyone
here we go here is our Coastal Scents
metal mania palette as you can see
variety of colors somewhat a variety but
you're getting into a lot of warm shades
with this palette but you've got a lot
of neutral colors as well those bronze
gold and various typical shades you
would think of in that metallic format
are in this palette you've got a lot of
rosy shades as well looking at this next
to the 88 warm palette you can kind of
see a lot of similarities just overall
looking at this one with the 88 warm
palette you're going to get all the
colors you need for a smoky eye
including matte shades you get a
combination of matte and shimmer colors
you have a lot of options for highlight
shades which if you are looking at this
in person you would be able to see the
subtle differences and some of these
light colors here but you also get some
warm shades some plums some Browns some
pretty peach colors so looking at them
side-by-side I mean while the metal
mania palette is somewhat neutral the
warm palette is going to give you some
options in terms of finishes you've got
matte Brown matte black and all that if
you feel like you you really aren't all
that wild about shimmer and you you
mainly want neutral shades then go for
the 88 warm
but if you do want to experiment with
some color and have a great amount of
neutrals still and you like shimmer go
for the metal mania palette and right
next to that I have the 88 shimmer and
what I sort of wanted to be able to show
here unfortunately like I said the
lighting isn't fantastic but you can see
the finish on some of these these colors
here in the metal mania looking at the
finish over here on the 88 shimmer
palette you can see although it's
different colors it's a very similar
finish really like if I were to swatch
one of these golds here in the 88
shimmer and then swatch it right over
here they're really a lot alike okay so
you know if you like color if you like
experimenting with the Blues the Greens
a wide range of pink and purple this may
be for you and it's a good kit to have
in your or it's a good palette to have
in your kit because you can kind of draw
in any random shade you want you know if
it's that kelly green shade or something
that's turquoise or coral I mean you
have it pretty much all in there and
then you have a couple of lines here
that are somewhat neutral but once again
to tone down some of these you may want
a matte shade just singularly in your
collection
whereas again with the 88 warm you have
those in the palette coming over here
this is actually a palette that I don't
hear people talk about a lot I don't
just have the regular 88 matte palette
the first one I got from Coastal Scents
was this one which is the 78 palette and
you are getting a lot of matte shades
although some of these do have a little
bit of that satin finish meaning there's
just a hint maybe of a little bit of
shine in those shades but I liked how
what kind of attracted me to this was it
was kind of before I was really getting
into combining different colors and I
could tell each set kind of had its own
thing going and I could figure out where
to go from there and then it has it does
have come with some metallic colors
right below it you can see these
neutrals and the rectangular shapes you
know you get a great great rich black
and then
you know summer mat summer shimmer I
really like that and I wanted to try the
blushes too so you get six different
shades of blush so this is a really good
combo palette because you're getting
some you know really shimmery shades
you're getting some some mats that you
can deal with you're getting some Browns
and neutrals and colors and blush so I
enjoyed getting that as a starter
palette because I felt like I really
understood a lot about you know what the
Coastal Scents shadows were like so once
again we've got the 88 warm very neutral
mix of matte and shimmer
you've got the metal mania palette which
is a lot of neutral some warm shades and
they're almost all a very very shimmery
finish
you've got the 88 shimmer palette which
is incorporating probably like 80%
colorful shades with a little bit of
neutral but they all have the same
shimmery finish and then the 78th
palette where you've got a mix of colors
neutrals shimmers mattes and you have
some blush guys that's all for this
