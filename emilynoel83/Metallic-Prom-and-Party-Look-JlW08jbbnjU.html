this video today I'm going to show you a
very warm very sort of shimmery metallic
I look today and it's using the new
palette from Coastal Scents it is the 88
metal mania palette so to give you kind
of a closer look at this you can see a
lot of the shades appear to have some
shimmer and some are just downright
metallic as the sort of name suggests
but it does vary there are some that
aren't necessarily that shimmery at all
so and I find that if you want to pack
on any of these shades you will get that
metallic finish but if you buff them on
more like sort of a finishing shade of
finishing touch to your look it's not
going to be that metallic at all so
don't be necessarily intimidated by this
palette thinking that everything's just
going to look like that you know metal
finish it's not necessarily going to be
that way so I think you'll see what I'm
talking about as you watch this tutorial
my first step was to apply a shadow
primer all over my lid I used two faced
shadow insurance and next I'm just going
to apply the first shadow uh i'm going
to use all over my lid and in this kit
it is the third one down one to three on
the left hand side of the palette it's
this one right here and it just looks
like kind of a basic light a somewhat
shimmery shade but what's really
interesting is it has like an iridescent
pinky glow to it so it's really really a
neat shade I didn't realize that till i
swatched it but i'm going to apply that
here on my lid and you're hopefully
going to see that little bit of there's
a little bit of a pinky iridescent like
pinky lilac glow to this shade so I'm
just getting that all over my lid I use
my SS 239 brush for that step and next
I'm going to take a little bit fluffier
brush I'm going to go with the SS 224
time just using my travel set their kind
of handy to just keep out here by my
makeup area but the next shade i'm going
to use is just kind of a general light
shade it is right here you can see mine
one of my nails has come off but it's
it's right here in the palette it's just
basically a light kind of peachy
shimmery shade
so just pick some of that up and that is
going to kind of serve as just a light
highlight shade here right under the
brow just get that out of the way next
go back to the 239 brush and I'm going
to be using one of the red shades in
this palette it's three over on the side
and it's this shade right here just kind
of a sort of a metallic ruby color and
so I'm going to pack some of that on to
my brush and first put it on the outer
half of the lid here as I apply it to
the lid I'm also kind of using the tip
of that brush to push it back towards
the crease as well so just kind of start
to blend that color in that direction
next I'm going to use the SS 224 brush
again it's a little more full and I'm
going to that same shade and I'm just
going to dust this in the crease so
we're getting it in the crease but we're
also building it up just a little bit
just above the brow bone there so you
can see we've got kind of that wash of
color and a lot of what I've realized
about this palette is you know if you
pack the shades on they really can look
metallic but if you just want to dust it
on like a light wash of color like we're
doing here it really doesn't look that
metallic at all so it's kind of all in
your application the brushes you use and
it's in that will determine basically
how vivid and metallic the look is so
now that we've done that we're going to
go to a brighter shade in this palette
and it doesn't necessarily look that
metallic to me but it is this bright
shade right here it's just too up over
on the right side of your palette 2 a 2
in and two up and I'm going to take the
fluffy brush that I just used once again
pick up a little bit of that color and
just use that on the border sort of
overlapping the maroon that we just put
on there so we're going for a little bit
of a bright kick right here and then
we're going to pull it down with some
contrast after we do our liquid liner
here in a second now there is some
darker shadow I'm going to be working
into this look but first I'm going to
use my L'Oreal carbon black liner
intense liquid liner I did recently post
a review on this and I might typically
since I'm using such kind of frosty
light colors on the lid I would have
maybe used Revlon Colorstay because it
goes over it a little more effectively
but I'm out of that so this is what I'm
using and this is fine so I'm going to
really start very far in you can see on
this side we've really gotta clean point
there on the inner part so I'm going to
definitely aim for you know right on
that right on the inner part of the
tiered not not in the tear duct but
right on even with the inner part of the
eye there and from there on out just
keep it close to the lash line and just
draw it right across once you start
getting to the end I'm kind of drawing
it a little more straight out like this
and then I'm going to connect it up and
you can see we basically got a little
wing going here not like a super
dramatic cat i type wing but basically
it's just a good way to thicken the
liner and get our eyes getting that more
um you know turned up look on the
outside while I'm on liner I'm going to
just finish up on the bottom i'm using
the extra intense liquid pencil liner
from l'oreal this is a lot like the
Milani liquefy and it's just basically i
kind of got the two to compare so
they're basically interchangeable
products it's just a really really long
wearing pencil liner that's very intense
in black and you have like a short
amount of time to smudge it if you want
to but from there on out it's basically
going to stay put exactly where you put
it so I'm going to just kind of blend
this up to that outer corner here at
first and then just take it basically
all the way in under my eye
just like that I'm keeping it just kind
of right among my lower lashes here
sorry it's kind of hard to stay in the
shot but connect it all the way in to
that inner corner and sometimes it helps
to go ahead and do that and then just
fill it in just like that real quickly
while smudging is still sort of an
option here before this gets totally dry
that's when you can kind of blend it a
bit and sort of ensure that you have you
know not skipped any little areas in
there so no big deal not a real
noticeable smoky smudge that we're doing
we're just kind of making sure
everything's connected next I'm going to
pull out Mac carbon and that's basically
because in this whole metal mania
palette while there is a shade that sort
of resembles black let's see it would be
this one right here that's about as
black as it gets and there's not really
even a dark black straight up black
metallic or you know a matte black of
course that's not in there and I really
feel like what you need to kind of set
off these shimmery shades is a matte
color so one way we're going to use this
is to set our lower liner so I'm going
to take my Coastal Scents tackle on
liner brush and just kind of get some of
that black on there and go right over my
lower lash line next I'm going to take
my sign crease brush from essence of
beauty this is available in a duo from
CVS this is the smaller of the two that
are in there going to go back to matte
carbon and basically we're going to get
some of this going in our crease and
just really give a nice contrast to the
the kind of rosy shimmery theme we've
got going on so here I am just going to
my natural crease with that you'll find
it'll blend fairly easily on top of
these shades and it won't be as
intensive of a matte black because you
are going on top of some really light
shimmery colors
so it's going to be fairly easy to blend
there so just kind of start at the
corner and go in and I kind of took it
all the way and on my crease there now
that you've kind of covered your crease
area with that if you want to build it
out a little more you definitely can
just buy sort of playing off of the
outer corner of your liner and sort of
boosting up that intensity just a little
bit there next I want to play with one
of the purple shades in this palette and
it is which one did I use it's in sort
of the purple row here and it is 1 2 3
up so it's this one right here and
that's sort of in in the center of the
palette I'm going to take my same tackle
on liner brush and kind of wipe that off
here real quickly that I used for the
carbon get some of that purple on there
and actually go just under wear that
black liner is on your lower lash line
this is going to be really subtle but
it's kind of kind of make this look up
here a little more smokey so just go all
the way under your lower lash line with
that and another way I want to use that
same color is with my fine crease brush
I'm going to pick up some of that purple
and just kind of pull it right here this
isn't an area i usually deal with a lot
with eyeshadow but i'm going to pick
some of that up and I'm see how I'm
going just under that little wing that I
created we don't want to give ourselves
that black eye look but um I think this
is really pretty kind of fading up to
that outer V with some purple and then
the top part kind of has that really
warm remember that sort of pinky magenta
shade that we put on top at this point
you just kind of want to give your eyes
a second look before we start messing
with lashes and for me I'm going to take
that bright um kind of pinky red magenta
shade and just give myself a little more
of that
because i think the carbon covered a
little bit of that up and i want it to
still show through so i'm just putting
that there and there we go for lashes
i'm going to apply my Lancome Hypnose
mascara to my top lashes a little bit of
Maybelline lash discovery on the bottom
and then I'm also going to apply my
ardell lashes number 116 so they're sort
of a there a little bit more like a cat
eye lash they get a little thicker and
longer towards the outside so I'll put
those on and then I'll join you with the
finished look
hey everyone here is the finished look
as you can see kind of a metallic look
but it's really all in how you use the
products or the colors in this palette
as to how it's going to actually appear
on your eye is the finished look so but
anyway what I did here since I last
talked to you I put some Lancome Hypnose
mascara on my lashes to kind of get them
and that turned up fashion that they
need to be to really fit with the lashes
put on my ardell number 116 eyelashes
which are a little bit flared out at the
ends I also put some white eyeliner on
my waterline just to kind of make the
eyes appear even larger and then I
finished it off with one more coat of
mascara so the eye look is pretty
dramatic on my lips I'm using a shade of
Revlon super lustrous lipstick called
champagne on ice it's a really nice
shimmery so much shimmer a nude lip
color so I put that all over my lips and
then I topped it off with actually next
I used sorry it's getting complicated
here i used a liner from NYC in nadi
nude and that's just a little bit deeper
on nude color that i use to sort of
define the Cupid's bow area just to find
the lips and blend it out a little bit
and then I topped it off with super
lustrous lip gloss in foiled a nice
shimmery shade that I've used quite a
bit so I hope you enjoyed this look
using the 88 metal mania palette some of
the shades are super metallic some
aren't quite so metallic it's just and
again if you depending on how you choose
to use this palette will really
determine the finish you receive so
thanks so much for tuning in for this
