video because I haven't done a haul in a
long time I feel like so thought it was
about time to update you on some new
products I've picked up this isn't a
really big hole it's a lot of drugs it's
all drugstore except for one thing
so I'll just get started and let you
know what I've gotten kind of what
you'll see soon probably coming in terms
of reviews and that sort of thing so
first thing I want to tell you about is
something I found at Walgreens
it's the EOS limited edition lip balms
and these smells so good and one of
those products when I opened it up i was
like feather smell this thing you know
because it smells so good
and so you got two shades in this and by
the way I found this in a little special
2-pack at the end of a random aisle it
was probably an aisle for like candles
or something and then there was the EOS
lip-balm
so um yeah I was pretty excited when I
ran across these cuz this one is
strawberry and I don't have the exact
names cuz they're not on the packaging
and I threw away the little container
but I know one is slight one is
strawberry and one is passionfruit there
might be a little different name for
them but oh they smell so good they
smell really fresh I'm not sure if I
like them better than the lemon just
because that lemon is really something
special but these are really cute
obviously and just fun to have so I mean
I've got a couple more of those now and
that's the type of thing that I mean
I'll have one in a purse plug one by my
bed I'll one by my makeup area so it's
nice to have a few and all the scents
are really great but that lemon one is
especially off another couple of lip
things that I picked up which I love so
much yay
it's the l'oreal colour riche League
loss leg loss leg loss I don't know but
it's le Glos and I tell you if I had
tried these a little bit sooner before I
did my favorite summer lip glosses video
one of these probably would have made it
in and I'll probably have a bigger
review coming on these because I think
they're awesome
I have raspberry splash which is a
really pretty pink and it has some
shimmer in it and I should probably just
go ahead and do a swatch by the way
those if you're not familiar with
those are not colored or tinted in any
way but anyway here's the raspberry look
at the pretty kind of little bit of pink
shimmer it's gorgeous and so that was
the first one that I sort of gravitated
toward when I picked him up and then
later on because I realized and the
scent smells like a like a vanilla
bakery or like a vanilla cupcake or
something and then this other one is
called saucy mauve this one is the one I
have on right now and I feel like my
lips this is not a lip plumper but
something about the shine in these just
kind of makes your lips look a little
fuller it must maybe kind of fill in the
crevices or whatever and that this one's
a little more neutral and there's a
swatch of it and I kind of got this one
because it reminded me a lot of my
all-time favorite lip gloss from Jordana
called lovely and it just has a really
pretty sparkle you know it's light but
it really kind of grabs the light and
you just feel like your face is a little
bit brighter when you wear it so I'm
really glad I got those and then someone
had recommended to me somewhere on the
Beauty broadcast Facebook page about the
Revlon just bitten lip stain and balm
and I do like lip stains I mean I've
enjoyed the covergirl ones and the
Palladio ones and they're all kind of
the same you know they're the same
marker concept like you're gonna put
that marker and just kind of draw it on
your lips basically and so I'll give you
a little swatch of this one this shade
is called Victorian and like a lot of
lip stains it has a little bit of just a
fruity scent reminds me of like the
smell of a popsicle or something they
all kind of do and so this is kind of a
rosy berry type shade and what's neat
about this is that you get the lip stain
and then you also get this nice little
balm which it doesn't it doesn't twist
it's just like that's the amount of balm
you get and the balm doesn't seem to
have much of a scent going on to it but
you top the lip gloss with the balm
which I've just done and you can kind of
see how now it has some shine and I love
how natural that looks
actually I'm really a fan of this
concept of just having the bomb right
there and it's not like you couldn't
take like if you already have a lipst
and you like and you have lip balm you
like I mean you could top one off with a
OS you know it doesn't matter what kind
of lip bond you put on it so not saying
like you have to go out and get the
Revlon just bitten just because it's all
two-in-one but you could just consider
taking your note your lip stain topping
it off with a balm it's not a real novel
concept but it does make the lip stain
look a little less dry and it just is a
very natural look and then you don't
have to worry about it coming off that
quick I'd say it lasted me through
actually a twit trip to I put through a
trip to the local winery we went to over
the weekend so that was lots of fun and
I mean that's it's definitely a test of
staying power when you're putting your
mouth on it glass you know I have a
couple of eyeshadow quads well not
they're not neither of them as a quad
one is five one is three
okay let's start with the trio this is
from wet and wild one of the few trios I
hadn't yet picked up and I was wearing
this I think I might have been wearing
this in my lip gloss video I was alone
where I was wearing a black shirt and
that day I wore this but it's called
don't steal my thunder and basically
you're getting a white and silver and a
deep charcoal and it doesn't disappoint
as you can imagine lots of the wet and
wild
oh this was an awkward place to push it
and put the swatch it exactly where I
can't turn my wrist ooh
okay there's the white silver and black
trust me on this one they are pigmented
and they're really nice no smokey eye
instant smokey eye and you know no
worries Ben the shades I'm wearing right
now are from the Maybelline eye studio
color explosion quad and caffeine rush
and you guys might have remembered when
I did my tutorial using the green one so
I love that and then I thought I have to
go get another shade and this was the
one I was really wanting because it has
beautiful totes and different like kind
of just light shimmery colors that are
really versatile and I actually just
blogged about this so I have some
swatches there so
go to beauty broadcast Annette and I'll
expand on this a bit more but I really
like this and I'll probably get even
more use out of this one than I did the
green one but I have that on now with no
other no other shadows so you can see
just how dark that darkest shade turned
out to be so I really like it definitely
a fan of the color explosion last thing
I want to show you is something I got
from QVC and it's from brand called it
cosmetics not sure how many of you have
tried that line I got this off of QVC
and typically when I see it cosmetics on
QVC they are talking about a like a
finishing powder or a concealer but I
hadn't seen this in a presentation but I
just came across it on the website I was
actually on my QVC Beauty app and so
that's when I saw this and it's a
contouring palette so it said it's
called my sculpted face and you open it
up and you get a couple of mirrors which
are not okay maybe one just got real
blurry I don't know you get like a a
couple of mirrors one is normal one is
magnified but the main the real deal
here is this palette you get two light
shades one is shimmery one is matte and
then these are your contour shades for
me I've been using like this shade or
this shade to contour with and it what's
neat is that you do get like there's a
little description on the back there and
kind of a little map of where to contour
on the face but it's a really nice guide
if you want to kind of go back to class
so to speak before contouring so it
talks about you know it's got this whole
thing on what to do so if you're a
little unsure I mean tells you exactly
how to slim or straighten the appearance
of your nose how to bring out your
cheekbones how to contour your double
chin slender eyes your forehead I mean
and it gives you steps for each one of
those so I thought that was really nice
and it kind of got me thinking about
ways to contour and stuff like that that
I maybe hadn't really been doing a whole
lot of or wasn't quite sure about so I'm
always learning
I am always learning I tell you tell
Polly we'll do a full review on this
to show you how I use it think in a
review toriel sometime I wanted to tell
you about those things some things you
can maybe expect some reviews on coming
to be here that could be on my blog but
just keep checking back and thank you so
much for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
