one tutorial in this video one of the
looks contains color but then the other
contains even more second really
incorporates green and even gold to get
a really dramatic funny part about this
is that both looks really build on top
of one another so you do part one and
then if you want to continue and add
more color you just go on to part two
and you don't have to really go back and
and take anything off or change anything
but I'm using this Milani runway eyes
eye shadow palette in oak Couture and so
it's going to really show you a lot of
possibilities look number one really
just uses some of the pinks and purples
in this look it's a little bit softer
look definitely something that you could
wear for daytime it's also very easy to
recreate so if you want to see step by
step how I did it keep on watching first
I applied my Smashbox photo-finish lid
primer all over my eyelids and then I'm
going to take one of the NYX jumbo
eyeshadow pencils this one's in lavender
and we're just gonna lightly apply that
all over our lid and kind of a little
bit under the inner part of our lower
lid so you can see I'm just kind of
dabbing that on here just to give us a
nice light base because I feel like this
look it's gonna be a little bit you know
lighter and and softer even though it is
colorful and I think that helps grab the
color then we're gonna take that right
underneath just like this and the reason
why I dab but with my finger is that
takes away excess product there and it's
gonna keep it from creasing on us next
I'm going to take my palette here in oak
Couture from Milani it's the runway ice
collection we're going to start with the
shape at the very top which is sort of a
purple with pinkish undertones and I'm
going to take my ELF eyeshadow brush and
just really pack the product on there
and then pack it all over my eyelid so
this is going to be like it you know
it's really purple but I feel like of
the two shades
purplish shades in this palette this is
the one with more of the pinky undertone
then you may want to grab a little bit
more of that color and kind of flip your
brush over and bring it up to the crease
a little bit so when we put that other
shade of purple they're really going to
blend next using one of my crease
brushes from essence of beauty this is
the larger of the two in the duo I'm
going to go down to this bluish purple
right underneath the shade we just used
and so pick some of that up with that
brush and we're gonna take that right
into our crease so this is it's not so
much a deeper darker shade it just is a
different tone and I think it works
nicely in the crease here next think
about working that color into a little
bit of a soft outer V here so kind of
work from the corner of your eye up and
we're just kind of drawing the shade out
a little more it's not gonna be a big
bold outer V like we would do with a
black shadow but we're just extending
the color out a little bit just like
that
next take a little bit fluffier brush
I'm just using a random contour shadow
brush from Revlon that I have here and
we're going to go to the pink and this
is basically going to fade up from the
shade we just put on all the way up to
our brow bone it's not necessarily a
typical highlight color but it is going
to really warm up this area and just
give it a light kind of pink flush so
now that you've sort of tinted this
whole upper area pink we're going to go
back to the bluish purple shade the
second one down and take a new sort of
stiff smudger brush or a q-tip could
work here I'm using this one from
bourgeois Paris and I'm going to be
using the tip of this brush I'm going to
be placing it right on top of that
bluish purple and then go right under
the lower lash line here mainly about
3/4 of the way in
just lightly smudging that shade right
under our eye then you want to think
about how you're going to blend it on
the outer part here and for that get a
little more on the brush and then sort
of draw like a diagonal line up from the
corner of your eye there it's just gonna
help in blending just lay some of that
color down right up there kind of right
to where we you were doing that outer V
just contribute a little more color to
that and really get it kind of deepest
right around the outer corner of your
eye to really create a border here it
might not be a bad idea to take some
sort of finishing powder I like to use
my Maybelline mineral power finishing
veil and just a concealer brush that I
use for dry products and kind of just
take that right under the eye I would
always do this after I did liner anyway
just to prevent you know oils from sort
of seeping and down onto my face in any
way but it also kind of creates a color
barrier with this look now we're gonna
take in a black eye pencil I'm using my
Milani liquefy metallic eyeliner pencil
I don't feel like this is necessarily a
metallic shade here I know some of the
other shades they sell on this line or
metallic but to me this turns out to be
a very rich black and it goes on so easy
I'm gonna be putting it on pretty much
the outer three-quarters of my upper
lash line and you barely have to touch
it to your skin for that color to come
on there and what's neat is I tested it
on my hand and I just put it on and then
waited a few seconds and then really
rubbed on it and you know it stays so
that's a rare rare quality in a pencil
or cream liner but I'm not doing
anything fancy with this at this point
I'm just drawing it out to the outer
edge and when they smudge that a little
bit with a q-tip here but like I said if
you want to work with smudging this line
or do it quickly after you apply it so
that way it hasn't already started to
really
solidify on you so just like that that's
all we're going for a liner why is just
a little bit of depth there on the upper
lash line and if you want to soften it
up go right ahead next I'm going to curl
my lashes and apply a coat of my Lancome
Hypnose mascara and I'll join you with
the finished look
okay so I just applied some of that
mascara to my top lashes and then on my
lips I'm using the Jordana easy liner in
baby berry so if that's what's giving me
the bulk of the color you're seeing
there on my lips and then I used my one
of my lancome juicy tubes smoothies in
tickled pink so this is just a nice
classic creamy pink gloss but then to
just perk it up a little bit right in
the center I put on my wet n Wild mega
slicks lip gloss and sinless which is a
really really light shimmery pink I
rarely would use that shade all over my
lips I like to use it just to kind of
highlight on pink lip looks but now
let's go ahead and get a look at the
dramatic look
now for look number two we are adding in
a couple of new shades so I'll show you
exactly how to do that and also how I
changed up the look everyone now we're
gonna crank this look up a couple
notches and add some more colors from
the runway eyes palette so first thing
we're going to do is go to this green
shade in here and I'm using my little
mini contour brush from Coastal Scents
but you can use a q-tip or any other
small applicator or brush you want and
I'm just gonna pick up some of that
color on there and then take it right
under the eye and you get this gorgeous
kind of emerald green look it's really
pretty and so I'm just gonna dragging
that in and under I'm going just about
maybe halfway in with this shade and it
just really doesn't need you know it's a
pretty effortless step there you just
kind of put it on and it's and it really
stands out I'm also going to just sort
of go around the just outside the tear
duct area and work it up a little bit so
we can kind of carry that green up just
to touch there next kind of clean off
your brush and go to the white shade in
this palette right at the bottom pick up
a little bit of that this is again a
very shimmery shade and I'm just going
to kind of go even further in and just
sort of overlap that green and we're
getting a huge amount of just a really
reflective look there and also go just
underneath it it's gonna brighten it and
just lighten it up even more
elsewhere on the lower lash line go
ahead and take a smudger brush I'm gonna
go back to that bourgeois brush that I
was using earlier and I'm gonna use the
second purple shade there the bluish
tone purple and just get a little more
of that color going on the lower lash
line so just build up that intensity a
little bit more kind of just stop when
you hit the the green that you just put
on next we're going to switch up our
liner a little bit on the lower lash
line we're going to line our waterline
with
same Milani liquify pencil there so I'm
just lightly pulling down and applying
that dark black right there it glides on
super easy and now you can see we're
given a whole nother you know a whole
different look with this and then I'm
just going to go under on my natural
lash line just a little bit and actually
draw it up and create a little a little
bit of a wing there you know see how I
just extend it out just a bit and it's
going to provide even more of a defined
look to the outer part of our lid and I
got to say this pencil is really awesome
for that there's not a lot of pencils
you feel like you can really create the
winged liner look with but this one is
very very soft and creamy and and then
it'll set to where it's not gonna smudge
on me so there we go
just kind of putting it on there like
that and then we're gonna go in with a
new color I guess we're bringing in an
outside shade here because the only
thing I feel like that Milani palette is
lacking is a black and so I'm using my
Mac carbon a matte black shade any matte
black color you like to use will do but
I'm gonna top off what we just did there
I'm using my Coastal Scents taklon liner
brush just gonna top that off with a
little bit of powder there just to
ensure that it stays okay just like that
and then if you want to do any more
smudging there or add any more like
purplish color underneath in case you
feel like you've covered it up go right
ahead then using my essence of beauty
fine crease brush I'm going to take Mac
carbon again and we're going to apply
that to our crease and so you're gonna
see a real this look is going to be
amped up even more and it's amazing what
just the addition of one color like this
can do for the look and I'm gonna sort
of surround instead of just working off
of that outer V and like nothing really
comes down below it I'm sort of surround
this little outer liner that we've got
going on here just surrounding it with
that black just kind of a light dusting
sort of like we're doing here but still
really getting it in the crease the
crease is where you want it to be the
darkest and then just working out a
little bit as you can see I've just
worked it out a little bit further this
way so we're going a little more like a
horizontal you know really filling the
space there and then I want to sort of
go over the top and blend out with some
more of the purple shades so we're still
really incorporating color into this
even though we've gone dark and so I'm
taking that top color there that it's
probably my favorite purple shade in
this palette really really pretty
using my the larger of the two brushes
that come in that crease duo from
essence of beauty I'm just going over
the border of where I put carbon and so
I can see a real difference here and
just it's it's a little bit warmer now
you're just seeing more of the color
popping through next using the
applicator provided in in this palette
we're going to take the gold and
actually use this kind of right under
our eyebrow this is gonna be a subtle
little change here I mean you would
expect I think to see like the white
underneath there with this look but
since we have the access to this color
it's just gonna make it look a little
warmer here than just putting a splash
of the white but you could totally do
white there if you want so going with
this gold and the sponge tip applicator
just picking up some of that shade I
want I do want it to be as intense as it
can be here so I'm literally going right
under the eyebrow with that it's giving
me a pretty sparkle sort of just nice
highlight next I'm going to sort of give
my lashes another coat of the Lancome
Hypnose mascara and I'm also going to do
one coat on the bottom lashes and then
I'll join you with the finished look
alright guys here is the finished look
you can see that that extra coat of
mascara on the bottom really does make a
difference in this look and I just added
a little more bronzer my contoured the
cheeks just a little more I used my Too
Faced chocolate Soleil matte bronzer
which is a little bit darker just to add
some contrast to this look with the
first look basically I had just put on
sort of a pinky toned blush and a light
dusting of a lighter tone bronzer like
NYC sunny and that's how you get that
more natural finish with the lips I
actually blotted off the brighter pink
shade we were working with with the
first look and I instead went a little
bit lighter so the eyes could really be
kind of the focus and I just wanted this
little reflective light look on the lips
so I used the NYC lipstick in chiffon
which is a really light shimmery pink
and then again just a dot of the mega
slicks wet and wild lip gloss in sinless
just in the center to give us a little
more of a glossy so much for tuning in
for this two-in-one tutorial I've gotten
a lot of great feedback on these so far
and I've got to say I really like doing
them because I feel like sometimes you
give out one random look and you know
maybe people don't want to go that
dramatic or they don't want to go that
light natural so I feel like you kind of
get the best of both worlds and at least
a couple new ideas maybe you already
have one of the palettes I've talked
about but you just wanted a new way to
switch it up so I'll continue to do
these in the future and let me know if
you have any special pallets you would
like me to use for them thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
