this review video this is gonna be all
about a new eyeliner pencil that I tried
and I really don't branch out a whole
lot where eyeliners are concerned
because I am very stuck on Revlon
Colorstay products I really like the
liquid liners and also the pencil liners
I think are good too but I sort of just
wanted to see you know okay what else is
out there what sounds interesting to try
and so I went to CVS the other day and I
got this Milani liquify metallic
eyeliner pencil and this particular one
doesn't really look metallic I think
maybe some of the colored options were
but this one is really just um just a
black pencil as you can see there
so on this I really wasn't quite sure
what to expect I thought it had the
appearance of those Urban Decay
eyeliners and so I thought wonder if
it's if you know it might compare to
that I don't own one of those but I do
know that people say it goes on very
creamy and then it really lasts all day
and that's really the story with this
too um it claims for all-day wear smooth
applications smudge proof paraben free
and basically under how to use it says
draw a line along where you know top
bottom wherever you want to put it apply
product allowed to dry for 15 seconds
and your look is set for day tonight
remove with eye makeup remover and I
gotta say it really did deliver on that
promise because I've worn it out several
times I wore it one night when I was
going out and it stayed completely fine
the whole time and this that you see
here has been on for a little over 12
hours with no touch-ups and so I mean it
really has not come down and caused any
issue like under my eye it's not smudged
or flaked off in any way so I've got to
say that's really really awesome and
another cool thing about this liner is
just how easily it glides on I mean a
really rich line and I barely guys I
barely press this onto my skin I mean
it's just super super easy to use and
now if you wanted to smudge that out if
you did it quickly
as you can see I'm doing with this line
here you know you can smudge it out you
have to keep in mind you have a time
frame to work in because it is going to
dry eventually and then it is not going
to want to smudge at all so yes I can
safely say use this on my under eye and
it lasted and I used it on my inner rim
and it actually lasted there as well and
and you really want something that can
easily go on your on your waterline and
if you're going to use it you know you
want it to go on very easily I don't
have my waterline lined right now but I
can show you just as a sort of a
demonstration here just how easily it
does go on I mean one step like that and
you're totally done with it here so it's
just super easy to use just glides right
on doesn't your tape my eyes I obviously
obviously can't say for a fact that if
it doesn't irritate my eyes it's not
gonna irritate your eyes you know I
can't make blanket statements like that
just because you really can't in the
world of makeup you don't know what's
gonna work for someone and then not work
for someone else but as you can see here
we've let a little time pass and I
cannot smudge that line this is like you
know basically what some of those like
my Coastal Scents gel liners you know
they worked like this as well you draw
the line on can't smudge it I haven't
found a whole lot of pencils that work
that way except Revlon Colorstay was
pretty much that way but here the
blankets that you're starting with is so
intense that to have something like that
that can last and hold that kind of
intensity is great and what's really
neat about this as well as it's so soft
if you wanted to do you can actually
wing out the liner with this and I do
demonstrate that in an upcoming tutorial
that I will do but this usually I would
use only think to use a liquid liner to
wing out my eyeliner but this honestly
can handle it if I wanted to extend my
liner up just a little bit this can do
that and so I just find that very I
guess surprising that something can go
on so creamy and yet dry and
so long so if that's what you're looking
for in a liner pencil I highly recommend
the Milani liquify and I will link to
where you can get more info about this
on their website and maybe you can
browse other shades I would definitely
like to try more shades after trying
this one but it's just amazing the
staying power and how smooth and easy it
goes on so thanks so much for tuning in
for this video guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
