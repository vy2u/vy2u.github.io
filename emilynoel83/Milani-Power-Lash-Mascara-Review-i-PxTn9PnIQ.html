review on a product that i've recently
tried and just going to warn you this
may be a little negative seeming so i
mean it is it's probably going to come
off kind of like a rant because i'm just
not a fan of this mascara at all it is
Milani power lash it comes in a big
radish radish okay that's red red and
black tube and it's about the size of
like my diorshow mascara it's taller
than lash bless so just to give you an
idea this is like a big mess area here
and iron adjust to describe the product
a little bit it comes the shade is black
and I believe that's the only shade it
comes in it has kind of a long brush and
a big the brush is pretty big it is
actually similar in size to a Dior show
brush similar actually you know in the
way the brush is structured with the
bristles and all it's somewhat similar
your shows is just a little more like
spiral around this one is a little more
like just kind of fuzzy like straight
out from the brush and ice when I first
looked at the brush and got it out I
thought wow that looks like a great
brush you know it just something about
it just looks so so thick and everything
I thought that's surely going to be good
but I think the big problem with this
mascara is the formula I think it's
really a little bit too thin and it just
does not build up on your lashes and
create any thickness whatsoever so I'm
going to run down I opened up the
webpage on my laptop here so I could
tell you what the claims were for this
product it says a super thickening and
volumizing mascara with lasting cool
effect the big brush coats and separates
each eyelash making them fuller with
each application this lightweight
mascara will not smudge clump Orgel all
the vitamin A panthan all and bamboo
extract nourish and condition preventing
breakage and falling and falling of
lashes cleaning falling out Burt I don't
know just following in general take
power of your lashes they
to deserve to look amazing available in
black only okay yeah only black um so
yeah this this does not really live up
to those claims at all I mean power lash
volumizing mascara and that makes you
think what big thick lashes but I can
tell you this just does not I mean I I
would have used it if had I kind of knew
I wanted to do this review but this
morning I mean I went to work today and
was on air for the news and everything
and I just thought I don't want my
lashes to look like crap for the news so
I'm not going to use this today so I
mean if that gives you any indication of
how much I am against this I mean I use
mascara that unless that I think are you
know maybe not the ideal mascara just
cuz I have them and I'm going to use
them but this is not one of those this
is one that I like used a few times just
to make sure I didn't like it and from
there on out I just don't want to use it
and I the only reason why I've kept it
around this because I knew I wanted to
review it and kind of like warn you guys
about it I don't know if you've tried it
or not if you have I mean I apologize
that I don't want to come off like I'm
flaming this if you love this mascara I
think that's awesome if it works for
somebody out there but just does not
work for me and there's not much more I
can say about other than the fact that
it does not live up to its claims I mean
super volumizing come on I mean this
brush should be awesome look at that
doesn't that make you think wow that
might actually do something well it
doesn't it's like the formula is so thin
like I mean I actually did go ahead and
put a little bit on my lower lashes
didn't really I mean it's just I don't
know I i I'm just a I'm kind of at a
loss for words for this because it said
oh this is what i find interesting here
is the first line of the product
description a super thickening and
volumizing mascara the second line a
lightweight mascara I mean
I agree that's maybe one claim it lives
up to it's so lightweight it cannot
build on itself hardly at all it just
does not create volume if you want
natural if you want like your lashes but
darker maybe use this but don't be
fooled by the big red and black
packaging and the ginormous tube and the
huge brush I mean don't be fooled guys
I'm just warning you if you're if you
are going for power lash volumizing
mascara that's not what you're going to
get here and it's a false claim I mean
it's just that it's not true if you're
and and you know I say that oh if you're
going for a more natural look this would
work for you but obviously if you're
going for a natural look you probably
wouldn't go out and buy power lash
volumizing mascara you know your bid
you're probably not going to be happy
with it it's just what I'm saying so
anyway like I said I this was my
experience with the product maybe you
have just like sep amazon women lashes
are some amazing lashes and you just
need next to nothing on them and they're
going to look great no matter what and
any there are maybe there is a
circumstance where this works for
someone it just does not work for me and
i thought i would just pass my
experience along to you there are so
many much better mascaras out there if
you saw my question in the week video
where i recommended a few those are all
great i have even more beyond that that
i would recommend to somebody long
before i would recommend this which i
would not so anyway thank you guys so
much for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
