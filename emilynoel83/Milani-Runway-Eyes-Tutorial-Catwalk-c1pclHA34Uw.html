video I'm really excited to show you
this I look that I've got on right now
it's using a new product that i've
recently purchased and never used before
so this is kind of like the trial run
its Milani runway eyes and the shades i
have aaron it's the catwalk palette so
we're going to be using these top three
the black blue and sort of rosy pink and
then the light shade here at the bottom
and also that kind of coppery color so
there's so many different looks you
could get out of a palette like this so
i just wanted to try to work in sort of
as many shades as i could and i was
going for sort of a smoky look but also
a little bit of color here and there so
hopefully you'll be able to pick up on
how i did it and maybe be able to
recreate this look yourself so to see
how I did the look keep watching okay
guys the first step is going to be to
apply a light colored shadow base and
I'm going to use my be luscious shadow
magnet in light and this is just a
giving up putting it on our lid here
will give our shadow something to cling
to so just getting that all over the lid
need to do my nails here but just get
that all over the lid just like that and
then we're getting out our Milani runway
eyes palette in catwalk and so it's got
all these shades in it and we're going
to start out with this lightest shade
right here at the bottom just a shimmery
white for that I'm going to use my ELF I
shadow brush and just get some shadow on
the brush and just work that in all over
the lid mainly concentrating on the
inner part is where we want the biggest
concentration of color
next I'm going to go for the shade right
above it it's kind of a peachy gold
color and I'm just going to use that
right here on the outer part of the lid
and then I'm just going to also work
that up to right under my brow bone
because this is going to turn out to be
kind of like our highlight shade here so
I'm just going to apply that all over
its really kind of skin tone but just
nice and shimmery so that's kind of like
a base color for all of our other powder
shadows next I'm going to go up to this
blue shade there and I'm going to use a
new brush that's a Sonia Kashuk brush
and it's the medium eyeshadow brush I'm
going to get some of that blue shade on
the tip and I'm going to just kind of
use that to get in the crease and also
work it out word so not only outer part
of the crease but also the inner part
this is just a nice flat kind of shader
brush that can cover a lot of space if
you want it to and I just want this wash
of blue to be definitely involved in
this look so just go all over just like
that and we may come back to these
colors once we do our upper liner that's
kind of what I did once i got my liner
look how i wanted i went back and sort
of adjusted some of how the shadow
looked in certain places and next I'm
going to take mine where is it your my
fine crease brush there it is and I'm
going to use the black shape right at
the top there it's kind of a sparkly
black and this is what we're going to
use to do our outer V
so I kind of tend to start by
concentrating the color right in the
right where I want that V to sort of
begin and I go up to you know that
towards the middle part of my eye and
out from the outer corner of my eye and
that starts to develop the outer let go
one step up this is my fine crease brush
this is the step up from that and that
is from you get it CVS it's the essence
of beauty brushes I use them all the
time and I'm going to go to this sort of
um maroonish deep pink shade it's kind
of like a rosy maroon and I'm going to
use this to UM go all over the border
here of this color of this sort of deep
blue that we've created and just really
boy you know kind of blur the line I
just love the effect that that's
creating we've got you know light in a
light shade in here some blue some
really deep shades and then ending off
with this really warm red I just and
kind of like falling in love with the
effect of this shadow that you can get
here in some unlikely shades that I
might not have thought up myself to use
together but basically once you've got
that there is your shadow look but we
may come back to this after we do our
liner which is guys for liner I'm going
to be using my Revlon Colorstay liquid
liner in blackest black and that's going
to just give us a nice line and it's
always nice to put some liner down if
you're going to be using false lashes
which obviously I have done on that I so
one of the beautiful things about Revlon
Colorstay liquid liner this traditional
form is the fact that it can go over
these highly shimmery colors and it
still remains a rich black shade so I
love that
so I'm just taking it all the way out to
the corner and once I get there I'm
going to wing it up just a little bit
more now for the lower lash line I'm
going to be using my revlon colorstay
pencil liner in black great duo to have
to have that liquid liner and also the
color stay pencil I get questions you
know what's your favorite eyeliner it's
got to be these two by far although i do
switch it up sometimes on the pencil and
use black brown or black berry or other
colors that they have but it's just they
work so well together and I can count on
them both I can trust them okay I love
being close in like this to show you
exactly what I'm doing with the shadow
but I'll admit when I start
concentrating on my liner I sometimes
can get out of frame okay alright guys
there's a few things that we're going to
go back to our shadow palette for one is
to set this liner and for that I'm going
to use this black shade here at the top
so just take a liner brush and we're
going to go starting right up here this
is also going to help blur the line
between the liquid and the pencil so
just start there and just go along this
whole area here another thing we want to
think about is what's going on right
here in the corner now that we've
applied our upper and lower liner I'm
going to go back to our blue shade here
with my fine crease brush and just kind
of bring the color down just a bit just
ever so slightly just to really frame
that the outer corner of the eye and so
I'm using that blue shade there and then
just kind of work it in it's sort of a
no man's land of color there you know
just kind of starts to look dark after a
little while obviously if when you start
when you start bringing in black that
can tend to happen and I don't mind with
this look but there are certainly other
looks you could do with this where you
left the black out and get more of the
blue look or more of the rosy look to
this you know it's just a matter of
preference what you want to go for i was
going for a more smoky look today so
that's why I incorporated the black I'm
just going over that once again with the
sort of rosy hue there and that's going
to do it for our shadow and liner and
we're going to be prepping our lashes
for the false lashes so I'm going to go
ahead and curl them with my elf eyelash
curler and hold it for about 15 seconds
then I'm going to apply a coat of
L'Oreal's lash out mascara it just does
a good job of kind of holding that curl
that we've created and just just helps
the lashes mesh a little bit better with
the false lashes that we're going to be
putting on here in a second and if you
have not yet seen my fall / tutorial
just search through my videos for that
it will take you step by step on how to
apply false eyelashes alright guys
that's the finished look here on the
lashes I used for our dell fashion
lashes number 106 and also I applied a
little bit of my Too Faced lash
injection on the bottom that's a
waterproof formula so I just felt
confident doing that so they wouldn't
smudge but um yeah this was a really fun
look to do on my lips I have a let's see
I use this Maybelline lip Express
lipstick and liner and one in mocha
blast it was something I actually found
at the dollar store and it's just kind
of like a medium sort of brownish pink
and then over the top of that I used my
it's a limited edition Revlon shade and
peachy sheen but they also have a shade
out right now called life's of peach if
you're looking for something in the
stores right now of that type but I hope
you guys like this look and thanks so
much for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
