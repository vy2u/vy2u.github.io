bump its tutorial for you this time
using the mini bump it's these little
ones that come in with the kit and
they're really pretty easy to use I'm
just going to give you a couple of ways
to use them and hopefully this gives you
some ideas so we're gonna start out with
is um pulling up like what may be your
bangs or just this front portion of your
hair so just pull this up just about
that much you know just I mean you can
kind of test it out and see you know
sort of poof it forward and see the sort
of what you're going to be getting there
to work with and then add in more hair
if that's what you want to do but I'm
just going to pull up this much hair and
I'm going to another big rule in my
opinion for the bump it's is to spray
the back part of the portion you're
pulling up just lightly just like one or
two spritzes I'm using the final take
from beyond the zone that's available at
Sally's and it smells so good so if I
get the chance to use it I do but just
pull it up and then I'm gonna take my
rat tail comb and just do a really light
tease there on the back of that just to
give it a little more texture and it's
gonna grab on to the bump it really
better so here I'm gonna take that and
just put it right behind that hair and
just kind of you know kind of Jimmy it
back and forth a little bit and then
just put this hair oops drop my comb I
just put that pull the hair back over
the top and these mini buffets are
really easy to conceal I guess you'd say
and it gives you height hair that you're
not going to lose basically throughout
the day or night or whenever you might
want to be putting it in so anyway I
pulled the hair back over that and then
I'm going to crisscross a couple of
bobby pins basically right on top of my
head here so this is not too hard to do
many people who have experience with
using some bobby pins so this isn't a
lot of hair you're having to pin back
either so
shouldn't find this to be too terribly
difficult up to this point but once
you've got that position there how you
want it just go ahead and spray what you
pull back there and you can see you've
just got that nice bump that you see you
know lots of different people using and
you could go ahead and curl your hair
more leave it like this or I'm going to
show you a way to take that second mini
bump that you have and give yourself a
little bit of lift back here as well so
again it's just this big it's like about
the size of your eye and basically look
at that portion that you've pulled back
that's kind of back in the bobby pins
and take that hair plus a little more
right below it so I'm taking some of the
hair that's coming out of the bobby pins
some of the hair just right at that
point in my crown and I'm pulling up
basically a second section here a second
section of hair we're gonna be working
with and I'm gonna do the very same
thing here when I spritz it a little bit
on the back side I'm gonna tease it just
a touch and then I'm gonna place this
right behind the hair I've pulled up
kind of wiggle it back and forth it
should feel a little bit like I almost a
little scalp massage or something
because that is really those little
teeth attached into your hair next
another thing you want to have as we
start to play with what's back there is
one of these hair pins available at
Sally's very cheap you can get them in a
pack and it just helps you deal with any
hair that's been teased and I use it a
lot mine do dealing with the bump it's
just for she you know she's trying to
get the shape you want and that kind of
thing so I'm just positioning the hair
how I want it it's not making a lot of
sense from the forward angle but what I
turn to the side you'll see what we're
dealing with here we've got oh you know
a nice amount of volume here in the
crown if I can turn sideways and see if
you can see what I'm talking about here
but we've got a little more umph back
there you know what I mean instead of
just everything falling this being
volumize and everything else falling
flat you've got a little more you know
volume in the back and you could of
course go ahead and turn to the other
side for you here but you could go ahead
and curl this hair more mine's just kind
of somewhat straight today a little bit
sorry man
turned under but you know do whatever
you want with the length of your hair
but this is just a couple ideas of ways
to use the mini bump it's to create a
cute style that's maybe a little
different from what you would just do
without the bump it's so the mini bump
it's are really really easy to use I
would really recommend them for those
who are struggling with maybe the full
size right now if you want something to
that's really easy for your hair to
conceal definitely give them a try and
also remember that make sure you're
pulling back enough hair when you want
to the hair that you want to cover up
the bump it in any way that you're using
these make sure you're pulling back
enough hair make sure you're spraying
the back and teasing it slightly and
make sure you're spraying the overall
look okay so always give it the
once-over there I'm not worried about
this falling out whatsoever I can shake
my head and I mean this one's obviously
a little more secure but this one is not
going anywhere okay
so hopefully that's given you old guys
that little idea of how to use those
little bump it's but thanks so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
