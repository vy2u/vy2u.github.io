this video I am so excited to share this
with you I've worked in three of your
biggest requests from my last video into
this one video it's a full face using
just six products you guys said in my
backpack makeup bag video that was all
about like the little must-have awesome
little products you need to have with
you on the go whether it's back to
school back to work back to wherever
you're going got a great request
somebody said I love your makeup
routines and makeup videos but can you
do one with less products and I said
challenge accepted so we're doing that
in this video also people asked for just
something quick something quick and easy
so low on time is something you can get
out the door with also lots of requests
for a more natural eye look so this eye
look is very natural it's like your eyes
but better it's working with you know
maybe the brightness you wish you had in
your eyes and the natural kind of
contours you wish you had and just kind
of putting that in there but non giving
the look that you know a lot has been
labored over on your eyes so I thought
how about we also use like products I am
100% in love with right now so it is six
products fast easy fun things I love I
hope you love it too so keep on watching
alright guys face routine is a whopping
three products that's it we're keeping
it simple here I'm using my dalton
conceal it concealer my shade is medium
I love this product so much and I know
it's more of a high-end product but
you're getting so much in here it
actually has a cap there and then an
airtight cap right there and you're
getting about as much product in an
average like pressed powder you know
like that size of compact but it is your
concealer really nice texture um it's
just like as you can see you know you
just Pat over your spots and your issues
and it's super easy to use but the
texture is so nice it's not too thick
but it's a very pigmented and very full
cover spots blemishes anything you know
it can tackle it and not look heavy and
it can be a great light foundation
substitute you know got a little spot
right down here I actually kind of
like putting the concealer on blending
it in and then dabbing over the area
with the sponge and it like takes away
any excess product and leaves you with
just the right amount I'm going to use
my Neutrogena Healthy Skin powder and
this is just a pressed powder it has SPF
20 it's a really great powder for kind
of mattifying the skin giving you that
little extra boost of coverage but never
feeling too heavy pressing it on with
the puff you're getting just a little
more coverage out of it and you know we
left out our foundation for this step so
it's kind of like taking over for that
then I go to my it cosmetics this is the
vitality face disc if the Live Love
Laugh vitality face disc and it gives
you matte bronzer highlight and blush
and so this is very quick and easy I
tend to use just one brush for all this
if I'm going to use the bronzer mainly
as a contour I just take like a blush
brush and then kind of just start
blending this in in the hollow area
there of my cheek to add a little
contour you may go under the chin this
is really great because as you can see
when I put my brush to this product it
doesn't get like flaky or anything it
doesn't get super powdery or chalky
seaming so you don't have a ton of
fallout or a ton of excess product you
know kind of going everywhere when you
put your brush in so that's really nice
it's a really kind of subtle bronzer I
know it looks quite dark there in the
packaging but it never seems like too
much on mice you know I come down here
to the blush this is a gorgeous peach
with a little bit of glow it's got a lot
of pink in it as well and I just kind of
apply that to the outer part of the
apple of my cheek and blend up a bit and
it's just the perfect color I love the
glow that this gives circular motions
and then blending up and then the
highlight is right here for you and it
has a little bit of shimmer to it it
kind of reminds me of mary lou manizer
from the balm and i just apply a little
bit to the Cupid's bow and then kind of
blend over that just for a little added
glow there down the nose typical areas
we highlight eyes this is a look that's
going to mimic like the natural
brightness or contouring
kind of wish you had in that eye area
but it's not gonna look like a ton of
product or you know a really overworked
slaved over eye look that's not what
this is this is very low maintenance I'm
using an eyeshadow palette with colors
that can also be your liners because
they're that dark and pigmented it's the
NYX 10 color eyeshadow palette the
runway collection and it's the caviar
and bubbles kit here so this is a
must-have great neutral palette it gives
you great shapes like I said for light
tones medium tones and then of course
some wonderful deep and dark colors as
well so I'm gonna use my Sonia Kashuk
small eyeshadow brush this is the one I
recently picked up I mentioned it in my
target haul and I am so loving this and
we're going to go to this light almost
pinky tone shade and this is like the
master brightener color and I did apply
it a little bit of a primer first but as
you can see with very little effort you
can take this right around your tear
duct area and all over your lid and it
just brightens the eye so much just that
one color and I'm gonna kind of wipe off
my brush a bit and go to the dark brown
that's right next to it it's a matte
Brown get a little bit of that on your
brush and then all you're gonna do is
with the light patting motion take that
right on the outer part of your lid
you're overlapping some of that pink
it's not gonna look too heavy you're
just going to have that look of just a
little bit of natural shading happening
there I think grab you know a little bit
more fluffy brush and fluffy crease
brush will do and we're gonna go up here
to this kind of medium sort of taupey
brown kind of shimmer color and just tap
your brush into that and you're going to
take this right through the crease just
where your natural crease is we're not
doing anything fancy here just back and
forth just you know natural crease look
here and then because we laid down that
lighter shade and then we're going to
take a little bit darker shade over it
it's going to look so natural so blend
it out it's this makes it really easy go
to that dark brown again
just tap your brush in it just one tap
that's all you need these are pigmented
shades and then go to the outer part of
the crease and just blend in Word the
first place you put your brush is where
the most products going to go so always
remember that any time you're doing eye
makeup but see how because we're going
over that lighter shade what we put here
almost looks like it blended itself
practically because it's just coming off
with a little bit lighter finish that's
a dark dark brown but it's coming off
just so pretty and natural I love that
then just grab another fluffy brush or
clean off that same brush going back to
the pink and this becomes our under the
brow brightener our liners are coming
from this palette as well there are a
couple of really great dark shades a
matte black and a matte Brown here I'm
using my Sonia Kashuk smudge brush a
little bit thicker than you know some of
those really sharp angled liner brushes
but it's gonna give us a little bit more
of a forgiving line a little bit more of
a soft line as well so I'm gonna go to
the black and just get a little bit of
product on there tapping off the excess
and then I'm gonna go right on the outer
part of my upper lash line here and just
Pat that in I feel like you want to feel
like you're almost put overlapping the
base of the lash like right where your
lashes are connecting to your lid you're
overlapping that area a little bit I try
to kind of like fade to nothing that's
right around the inner third of the eye
then for the brown I'm gonna use the
brown under the eye just a little bit
it's just gonna be a little less intense
than the black same thing
aim for going right between your lashes
and stop after going about two-thirds of
the way and give the lashes a good curl
okay I recently got this little mascara
from Sephora in the it's like the
500-point kit for beauty insiders if the
outrageous volume and this came with
like a little smokey eye look some
products to get a smoky eye and I just
really love this mascara
one is big lots and lots of short rubber
bristles and I'm just gonna apply a coat
of that to my upper lash in other
mascaras I love I'll make it up and grow
from the drugstore for this whole look
it's been like you know easy minimal
products kind of effortless stuff and
for lips I mean you can go with the
natural lip or you can go with you know
a brighter lip and it's technically no
more work to do one than the other under
using party pink from Maybelline it's
one of the color sensational lipsticks
and I really love this one this has kind
of been like a rediscovered favorite for
me recently and the way I like to wear
it to get the color but not get like
look too overdone is to kind of lightly
go over your lips with it and then I
just run my finger over the whole lip
look I run my finger over it something
about it makes it seem a little more
natural a little more wearable not quite
so you know BAM there's my bright pink
lips it's like there's the color but not
quite as much shine impact alright guys
I hope you enjoyed this video 6 items I
mean that's the great thing about items
that can multitask I mean the it
cosmetics disc that contains several
products but it made it more convenient
and easy because they were all in just
one thing we didn't have to dig around
for a bunch of stuff also a great
neutral eye palette that can do more
than just be your eye shadow it can be
your eye liner by the way throw on any
lip look you want with this if you're
you know nude lip girl go there red lip
would be awesome here because the eye is
so minimal but I went for pink and I'm
loving that too so thank you again so
much for taking time to watch and for
taking time to give me such awesome
amazing thoughtful requests thank you so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
