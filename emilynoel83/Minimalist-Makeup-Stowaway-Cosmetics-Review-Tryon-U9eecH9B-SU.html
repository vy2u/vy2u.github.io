I am reviewing a new line of makeup or
at least it's very new to me it's called
stowaway cosmetics
and I actually ran across this brand on
Pinterest I was going through like
trying to find this taco casserole
recipe I pinned five months ago and
there was this ad like within my
Pinterest feed for stowaway cosmetics
and their whole mantra is makeup you'll
love in sizes you can carry and finish
before it expires so they're giving you
product in these smaller sizes and the
price tag for these things isn't
necessarily miniature you'll see as we
go through everything here I think is
generally costing a little bit more than
a drugstore item might but I thought
this sounds interesting this is
something I want to explore a little bit
more kind of a new idea in the makeup
world I wasn't approached by this brand
by the way I wasn't sent anything from
them I just kind of got on their website
and decided what I wanted to order and
so I got something called the essentials
kit which kind of let me sample a lot of
different products but just to give you
a little bit of background on the brand
first I found this out from the FAQ
section of their website and they are
what's known as EU compliant so that's
in compliance with European makeup
standards where there's like 1,300
ingredients or items banned from
cosmetics and in the u.s. there are only
11 items banned from cosmetics so the
standards are obviously much higher with
European makeup so they're calling
themselves EU compliant because they
went along with that sort of restriction
they're cruelty free they are not 100%
vegan because they say some items
include beeswax as an ingredient and
they are gluten free so the kit that I
went with contains the BB cream the
concealer it's got a like a lip and
cheek Rouge a lipstick a mascara and
also an eye liner and you can see you
know what I'm talking about some of
these sizes are pretty darn small and as
far as the whole claim of makeup that
you're going to use that before it
expires I really think that's going to
vary depending on how much other stuff
you've got in your rotation if you were
to purely use this stuff maybe that
concept would hold true but if you're
occasionally you know
in a different concealer using a little
bit of this other lipstick or this or
that I don't think there's any real
solid guarantee on that and I know I'm
talking to a bunch of fellow makeup
addicts here on YouTube who have a lot
of makeup and this might not be all you
use just because you ordered the kit but
what's on my face today with the
exception of a brow product it's only
this kit so I didn't pull in anything
extra and I can see a few ways maybe I
would improve the look if I were to
bring in some extra products but yeah
this is it there is nothing of a powder
consistency in this kit and I do find
that a little surprising because they
talk about being so like on the go
friendly because everything's so little
but having more than this several times
already I can tell you know I make it
midway into the day and I really do feel
the need for a powder tight touch-up and
I'm not even that oily but I want to
quickly take you through and show you
application and just talk about each of
the products here so the radiant
complexion BB cream I have this in the
shade light and as you get the kits
online they're not completely pre done
for you you select like your foundation
shade concealer shade the lipstick and
all that the instructions say to apply a
pearl sized drop to clean moisturized
skin I did that I used my Sigma f80
brush I feel like it was a good shade
match the coverage was a little better
than I expected actually I think it's
kind of like a light to medium coverage
you can build it up if you want to add a
little bit more to certain areas you
will notice some increased coverage
there isn't any SPF that I can see in
this product so that would have been
nice the finish on the skin is just very
natural I don't feel like this has been
packed with any kind of like glowy
fillers or anything that's going to
really like catch the light and make you
look super dewy once you've got it on
this kind of reminds me of my Rimmel BB
cream the kind with the blue cap just
the standard formula but maybe a teeny
bit less coverage than that next up
you've got this concealer and it is just
itty bitty you're only getting point one
five ounces in this but I have this
concealer in the shade light as well and
I definitely use that around the under
eye area I used it where I have a little
bit of redness around the nose and I
really like this concealer I think it's
creamy it doesn't seem to exaggerate the
look of fine lines around the eye area
it has some really nice coverage the
only thing that it left me wanting when
I got it on was just I felt the need to
set it because it never really sets even
this long after doing my makeup you know
it still feels kind of tacky and I think
that can affect staying power if you
happen to touch you know your under eye
area you feel like maybe am I lifting
off some of that concealer also if you
chose to do lower lashline mascara and
you've got a tacky concealer underneath
it I noticed this the first time I use
this kit you will have a little bit of
transfer underneath the eye and these
days I really am enjoying the process of
baking my concealer because I feel like
it gives just such a flawless look to
the under eye and here you know it did
cancel out some darkness but I can kind
of just just with the due eNOS of it I
can see it very much in person as I turn
my head you know it'll catch the light a
bit more in certain areas and almost
make me look like I've got a little bit
more of a hollow under the eye next
product is this lip and cheek Rouge so
it's a kind of two-in-one multitasker a
great cream blush I was able to easily
apply this with my fingers and it's even
kind of a dark shade that I chose
because I have it in the burnt rose
color and I just I picked it because I
didn't feel like I had a lot of shapes
like this in my collection as far as
cream blushes go and I think it's just
beautiful it sheers out to give you a
pretty you know rosy flush it's really
pretty on the lips as well but with this
it seems a little bit more generously
sized it seems to be you know similar in
size to a lot of other cream blushes I
might have so I didn't quite notice that
downsized product concept as much with
this for the eyes there are two products
there's an eye liner and a mascara the
eye liner I have it in the shade jet and
I think there was a brown option as well
so jet is the black this is probably my
least favorite product in the kit it
really is smaller as you can see that a
standard eye liner would be and I don't
find myself using up eyeliners super
quickly so I respect the fact that this
might be one you could actually use up
within the expiration limit and all of
these are marked by the way with when
they expire there's little indicators on
the boxes so for example this eye liner
is
to last 16 months but I applied it
across the upper lashline I felt like it
was just too dry it tugged quite a bit I
felt like I was spending too much time
on it just because I was trying to get
really really close to the lash line and
it was just a little too dry to easily
allow that to happen I don't feel like I
got full-on black when I first applied
it and then it does have a tendency of
fading a little bit as the day goes on
so I wasn't super impressed with that
next up we've got this mascara and there
are a couple of choices that you have if
you're getting this essentials kit I
went with the more dramatic mascara I
think it's called extreme lash and it
does have this rubber brush it seems
like kind of a large brush you've got
varying lengths of bristles some are
really short and then there are like
three rows that stick out a little bit
longer and I kind of like the effect of
the mascara I did find it to be really
lengthening it's a formula that's not
super wet and inky I did enjoy that but
what I found kind of interesting is that
you're getting a size here that's pretty
comparable to what you would get in a
mascara sample for most brands right
it's not very big and they say this is
gonna last six months on the mascara and
I've always heard that the general rule
of thumb for mascara is three months and
if I am using a certain mascara
consistently it will pretty much only
last me three months so I'm really
shocked that this is gonna last six
months and it's way less product than a
regular mascara final thing and the best
thing in this kit to me is the lipstick
and I chose the shade fig and I think
it's just gorgeous so I kind of swiped
away the lip and cheek tint that I had
on there to show you first and this
lipstick it smells awesome vanilla sweet
creamy super pigmented with one swipe I
don't see it bleeding outside the lips
it just it feels so comfortable and a
lipstick is really a product that I
don't mind having in the smaller size
because it takes a while for me to go
through lipsticks it's very infrequent
that I finish a lipstick I am a lip
product addict and I've got a ton of
them so I totally see the appeal and
having something smaller that I don't
know if I'll even use this up
it's more likely that I will this is
just a killer formula it was above and
beyond anything I was really
anticipating and I'm like yeah I love
this stuff I would love to try more I
think having a tiny lipstick is super
handy put it in a little clutch stick it
down in a wallet or something so this
whole kit cost me $75 I get that they
are using better ingredients they're
made in the USA there are a lot of great
perks about this brand and I do think
the finished look that I ended up with
is definitely something I could feel
comfortable wearing outside the house
you know it was quick to do I feel
finished it didn't require a lot of
tools you know if you want to apply
different things with brushes or sponges
you can but you wouldn't absolutely have
to bring in anything additional the best
things in the kit in my opinion the
lipstick as I said also the lip and
cheek tint I love this because I got a
pretty dark shade it was very easy to
blend so I think that's definitely
saying something about the formula and I
did like the concealer although it's a
tiny size and I feel like there was a
huge air bubble in mine because I
haven't used it that much before this
and I felt like I was really you know
needing to squeeze a lot to get some out
today I think if you have really dry
skin you might get done with this makeup
look and feel like okay that's
absolutely perfect because you didn't
apply any powders on top there maybe
clinging to your dry areas you know you
used the BB cream the concealer in a
creamy type blush and that might be just
perfect for some people of that skin
type but for me I tend to have some
staying power issues around the t-zone
and also like I said I feel like a
little under eye setting powder could
really help this out and so I think a
powder in this kit just a small you know
on-the-go type thing would be the ideal
touch or maybe even like a mattifying
bomb like Molly's face defender would be
nice to have that thing's $75 I mean
that's a decent chunk of change and to
be getting mostly really small size
products for that price you almost feel
like you're paying for someone's idea of
being innovative and here's something
small that you're gonna actually use
that before the expiration date and that
sounds like a good thing but like this
itty bitty concealer was 16 dollars you
know it's a nice concealer but dang and
I am NOT one who knows all the ins and
outs of
out packaging and manufacturing and the
reasons why certain costs are necessary
to do a B and C with a product but in an
ideal situation I think it would be
great if these products could be a
little bit less considering you're
getting so little product so if you guys
have tried this stuff as well let me
know what you think I feel like I've
been seeing ads all over for this brand
maybe it's just because I've visited
their website now and bought some stuff
and I just keep seeing it over and over
thank you so much for watching and I
will talk to you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
