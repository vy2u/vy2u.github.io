this is actually out of my tiara of not
team people people style watch and I
just thought wow this is a really pretty
look and it's actually an article
talking about eyelashes and as you can
see the lashes kind of take the
spotlight here in this look and her
absolutely glowing skin and so I tried
to do some highlighting and really have
fun with the lashes overall it's kind of
a more natural I look so I think this
isn't really the fact that this looked
like a wearable look really made me want
to try it some water line lining so if
you're into that you might enjoy this
look as well but if you don't know who
minka kelly is she is on my very
favorite TV show which is friday night
lights I think the season finale
actually just recently wrapped up but
she is Lila on that show and it is just
such a good show it's on NBC so I think
if you go to NBC's website and look up
that show you can watch past episodes
i'm pretty sure and you can also like
learn about the cast it's just like
great acting great plot i mean i just
can't say enough about that show so
there's my little TV review for you but
she is really great in it too and she's
also just absolutely beautiful so this
was a really fun look to play with and I
hope you guys right guys here's what
I've done so far I've applied my Rimmel
lasting finish foundation all over my
face and I then I applied my Coastal
Scents camouflage concealer palette I
used a couple of different shades sort
of a lighter shade just mainly right in
here and then more of an exact skin tone
match towards the outside just to
conceal any under-eye circles and then I
went over it all with a light dusting of
my mac studio fix powder just really
really lightly because as you can see in
that in that picture she has while she
has sort of a dewy effect she also has
very good coverage to her makeup so I
wanted to kind of duplicate that effect
as well but for now we're going to do a
little bit of contouring and also some
highlighting to kind of change the
dimension in our face as I look back on
the picture she I mean you can
definitely see that there's been some
contour
ring there on the side of her face maybe
around our temples and thence clearly
some highlighting and blush there on the
cheeks so I'm going to take hey Sonia
Kashuk product it's the golden cream
bronzer and so this is a cream product
and I'm going to do is actually grab a
sponge here that I'm i just used a
little bit earlier today actually and
i'm going to kind of DAB it in there and
build up a little bit of that color on
the sponge and then i'm going to use
this to create a nice cheap contour
what's nice and you can see that that's
coming off kind of like a streak for now
but i'm going to flip it over and use
the reverse side of that sponge to
basically just blend that out and this
is going to just give us a nice like
kind of thinning effect to our face and
what's also nice about this is this is
just a great bronze color with a no
shimmer so you can use it you know to
really get that nice contoured look
another thing you can always do is get
like maybe a stick foundation or
something that's in a little bit deeper
color than your skin tone and use that
to contour but you can see i'm just
going right there under the cheekbone
area you can also do it around your chin
and the sides of your nose and also up
here around our temples too so i'm just
taking a really light amount on there
and I'm just kind of swiping it on so
there is our cream contouring next we're
going to do some highlighting and for
that I'm going to use my ELF shimmering
facial whip and this shade is toasted
and so it's kind of a um just a light
maybe like a hint of bronze but it's
just kind of like a light creamy shimmer
that sort of got like a pearly almost I
don't know a little bit of a brownish
hue to it and I'm going to dot this
right here along the top of my cheek
with this look there's clearly some glow
to it even though there's really nice
coverage and
so I'm just going to let make sure I've
got that kind of on top there of the
nice contour we did so we're really
getting you know the opposite effect and
I'm also going to apply this right here
on top of the brow bone and that's going
to kind of be there for us when we get
to the eye part and a little bit so now
that we've done a couple of cream steps
on top of our foundation and everything
I'm going to go over that with some
powder bronzer this is Milani powder
bronzer in light and I'm just going to
use my fluffy kabuki brush and just kind
of go over my entire face placing
special emphasis on those areas where I
did contour with that cream bronzer now
for my blush I'm going to do a little
added contouring with my covergirl
cheekers blush and golden pink and so
that's basically just a matter of going
over that same area where we use the
cream and you know this is really you to
look that you might use for a special
occasion or something like that because
you are using a lot of different
products you're using a lot of coverage
and a lot of color with the face makeup
so this isn't the type of thing you may
necessarily need to do on an everyday
basis with your makeup she's also got a
really pretty pink or a peachy pink glow
to her cheeks but it's very light and
subtle so I'm going to use my Milani
mineral powder blush in my tie and this
is a nice matte peach so it's going to
kind of you know put it lightly right
here on our cheeks and so we still got
that shimmery glow underneath but we're
not taking it overboard with this
I love this shade then just for some
really light highlight I'm going to take
my physicians formula shimmer strips and
this is in Waikiki strip it's a peachy
glow bronzer i'm just going to sweep
this along with this is my fan brush
that I got from coastal scents and i'm
just going to sweep that along kind of
concentrating right up here oops got my
hair with it really lightly right on top
of the cheekbone and also dusting it
kind of right in here you just kind of
want this center of the face to be the
really illuminated part and it'll
contrast even more with the area's we've
contoured ok guys we're going to get
started on the eye look first I applied
a primer it's a the l'oreal decrease I
primer and it's something I'm probably
going to review pretty soon because I've
heard it's a really nice alternative to
Urban Decay primer potion a similar
formula to that so I will be looking
into that and get back to you on it but
I am going to be using my palette my
Coastal Scents 12 pan palette don't know
if you can see there i have replaced it
with a few different shades since you
last saw me use this in that glam and
girl a formal look um so I mean they may
be a little rearrange or whatever but I
just I'll let you know which shadows i'm
using for this and all over the lid I
was really silly and when I was starting
out this I I started to go back and
forth oh it's like no I'm saving that I
for the tutorial but I will tell you
what I used on my lid there I use this
shade which is M 20 it's a matte shade
and according two encores channel if I
mentioned that any of these are Mac
dupes he went through all those coastal
scents hot pots and he identified what
the duplicate max shade was and this
shade that I have on my lid is brulee
okay so I used my elf shadow brush to
just pack that all over and then I used
I'm trying to find the brush used here
um I'll use this shade right here it's
kind of a medium brown shade
it and this shade is actually m16 and
the Duke the Mac duplicates shape for
that sorry I've got like papers and
everywhere letting me know exactly what
it is that's charcoal brown ok so I'm
going to go ahead and apply a little bit
more of this this really isn't the most
dramatic look in terms of eyeshadow as
you can see so I'm really kind of
keeping it simple there I've got some of
that charcoal brown and then the shade
that was right in the corner that I had
here s35 this is a dupe for satin taupe
from mech so I'm going to use a little
bit of that just grab a smaller brush
here and get a little bit of that right
here on the outer corner of the lid and
just you know deep in my crease a little
bit but this is not a situation where
we're creating like a really substantial
outer V by any means or anything like
that I can just tell she's got a little
bit deeper shadow shade right there in
the in the corner of her eyes so that's
what we're working with and then I'm
going to take my Sephora rounded crease
brush a little bit fluffier brush I'm
going to go to this gorgeous um peachy
shade right here really shimmery really
pretty and that shade is s oh nine and I
don't think that's actually at least to
my knowledge that has not been
identified as a dupe for any particular
max shade but I'm gonna pretty much go
over that darkest shade because you can
see that she's got a really warm
practically peachy gold-tone coming
right off of her crease here on this
visible part so I'm going over it with
that and I'm gonna just kind of blend
that up to my brow bone as well and then
I'm going to take this shade here which
is s 03 that's also hasn't been
identified as a dupe for anything but
it's a pretty kind of buttery shimmery
um creamy golden tee how many many more
words going to describe it I'm just
using that to brighten up the brow bone
even more and that's going to be it for
now for the shadow
I'm going to be coming back to it in
just a second the next thing we're going
to do is go ahead and line our top lash
line with liquid liner i'm going to use
revlon colorstay and blackest black and
just give myself a nice line a nice base
for our false lashes we're going to be
putting on here so I'm just going to
start in here at the inner corner and
just line all the way across you can I
sometimes do all sometimes go a little
bit up and then I'll just fill in the
line and get done really and close to my
lash line so I don't have to really
worry about it when I'm getting in you
know really really close to the lashes
that's all I have to think about this
also isn't much of a winged outlook
either so I will make my line a bit
thicker on the outside but I'm not
necessarily going to wing it out much
I'm gonna do it just a little bit here
sorry if you couldn't see that
now for the lower lash line yeah you're
going to see me do something you don't
see me do too much i'm going to want
line up my waterline with my mineral
where I pencil from physicians formula
this is kind of an item that's under
review for me right now so I'm just
going to lightly pull down here and
apply that to my waterline and this is I
mean what the picture says so I'm just
going along with it now that I've got
the waterline there i'm going to go back
to my shadow palette and from the looks
of the picture she's kind of just got on
her actual lower lash line there's just
a little bit of shadow kind of fading
this out you can see I kind of have that
effect there on the lower lashes and I'm
going to go back to the shade that was
the dupe for satin taupe it's right up
here in this corner I'm just kind of a
nice neutrally kind of dopey shade as
the name would lead you to believe and
I'm going to take my angled liner brush
get a little bit of that on my brush and
then basically just go from right here
lightly under the entire lash line just
deepening that up and it's going to
create it really pretty like fade effect
from that dark water line I'm really
sorry I'm really having a hard time
staying in this shot we're trying to
keep it soft because overall this look
is really about the lashes and not so
much anything else and that is the
reason why she was featured in this
article was the lashes and then what's
interesting is underneath that it looks
like there's yet one more shade that she
has on that's sort of a light shade so
I'm going to go back to that pretty
buttery yellow shade we put up there on
our brow bone and I'm gonna just go
right under this to to kind of just
accent I guess and
maybe draw a little more attention to
the eye area like we didn't do enough
already so you can see just a little bit
of shimmer they're right underneath now
in terms of lashes I'm going to go ahead
and curl my lashes and I'm going to
apply my Too Faced lash injection on the
bottom lashes and the top just to kind
of get them ready and get them sort of
in that nice upturned shape i find that
mascara can sometimes maintain the curl
better than just a simple curl with the
eyelash curler like i'm doing now and
we're going to use some of those fun
revlon self-adhesive lashes and you're
going to see in a second just how
quickly those go on and but for now
let's just get little fringe going here
on the bottom well I really start to
realize how long my lower lashes are
when I start applying this stuff and I
really want to keep it like non clumpy
and really not too terribly thick so I'm
just really trying to be careful on that
application there and then I'll go ahead
and apply to the top too
alright guys it's fall / time and I'm
get the Revlon let me show you the
packaging here verse it's the Revlon
fantasy lengths if you haven't seen my
other video on these of the two kinds i
have i'm going to be using they'll be
more intense kind now it's the
intensifying set that's what it looks
like they're so i'm just going to very
gently peel that oops i got the bonus
lash strip there they give you an extra
adhesive strip there we go now I've got
these lashes themselves and I'm going to
just kind of this is what it looks like
now so just to get even more curve going
there I'm just kind of bending this
strip getting it ready for my eye and
this is the adhesive and it's going to
be great because you're going to see
exactly how fast I won't edit this this
part through anymore I'm gonna put it on
there and almost immediately I'm going
to be able to go ahead and apply mascara
not worrying about any glue with this so
here we go um just going going to kind
of I'm going to actually zoom out so uh
when I move around I don't risk getting
out of frame as much and so just place
them on
tues
just like so and there we go
they are on and they're ready to go this
is so great
so I just kind of place them you know
right where my eyeliner was basically
and they went on very easily right now
I'm just making sure that the inner
corner is pressed down and my outer
corner 2 and that is that and I'm just
to kind of help bond them again I'm
going to go ahead and apply the mascara
that no wait time here they are on there
you can see I'm jiggling my mascara wand
through them there is no risk of these
pulling off they feel just as secure as
any other perp alright guys that is all
for our Minka Kelly inspired look from
she's the Lila from Friday Night Lights
as you can see she's got just a really
nice basically natural eye but the
lashes kind of stand out and for the
lips she's got kind of a light pink lip
so I went ahead and applied a lip liner
I used my Rimmel exaggerated in easton
snob just a light pink then I put on
lipstick it's the wet and wild 5-10 a so
that's just a light pink kind of
shimmery lipstick put that all over and
then went over the top of that with my
Revlon Colorstay mineral lip glaze in
eternal blossom just a nice light pink
there so I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial just kind of inspired by
something something I saw and it was fun
to kind of go through my own shades that
I had and try to sort of pick what I
thought it would take to duplicate the
look so thank you guys so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
