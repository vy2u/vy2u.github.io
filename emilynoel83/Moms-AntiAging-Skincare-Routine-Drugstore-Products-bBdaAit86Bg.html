name's Jackie and you may remember her
from a few other videos we've done
recently we did some little reviews yeah
before um some key products that were
working for her make up lies but the
real question I feel like I tend to get
for you people say ask your mom
what's her skincare routine because that
seems to be maybe the most difficult
thing to find the just right thing so
mom is in her 60s she's tried a lot of
different skincare items right and she's
got kind of a couple of routines that do
overlap a little bit with some of the
same products for day and night but
there's several steps serum the spot
cream the eye cream why is that
important because I got older know once
I didn't need all those things and once
then you go into the into the store and
you say oh there is an eye cream yes I
will get into that that was some years
ago and oh there is a serum oh you have
that now and that spot cream is good no
you you just start adding and then you
hope you're not overloading yourself
with with things and the the procedure
and the product groupings that I've come
up with seem to work for me now that
doesn't mean no work for everyone that
way but they seem to give me some
results I don't think any of its magic
but if you're going to even hold the
line a little bit mom's skin would be in
a place where you're not overly oily
right you're in a place where you want
to hydrate hydrate I wouldn't say my
skin even appears to seem dry but you
just know that it's lost the things that
we used to have in the youth and you're
trying to kind of replenish so let's
start out and we wake up in the morning
you wash your face what do you wash your
face with by the way we didn't really
bring that right I had an old uncle who
was a doctor and he told me wants to
wash my face wash my face with dub soap
okay I know that's a crowd I've heard
people say it's not good not good but
anyway that has worked for me the reason
was at that time that it doesn't totally
strip your okay skin of the moisture
you know it leaves a little something it
really does and let's talk about step
one and all kind of it show the product
here's the camera but it is Neutrogena
rapid wrinkle repair eye cream so tell
me about this and how this is working it
has no irritating qualities to it at all
and I feel like it kind of works on
those areas that you know the gross
physical little lines here and there it
just seems to to do the job that it says
it does this does have retinol and ethem
and so you feel like this is something
where you've noticed a difference
somewhat and you feel like oh and with
continued use it does I've got it really
kind of helped along here I would say
that's probably the best I've used so
far the next thing you're going to use
is this rapid wrinkle repair serum so
it's the same collection basically but
this is a serum it has a little pump
actually but this is a squeezy tube and
this again has the retinol in it so I
wasn't this the first thing in this
rapid wrinkle repair line that you
started using I feel practically like
when I touch my skin it's firmer okay I
don't know how to even describe that
because I feel like when you get older
the outside starts to lose its
elasticity and you're just kind of I
mean and I didn't feel like there's just
a little little bit more more firmness
there and I've been doing this for like
four months mom and I we talk daily on
the phone and it's often that our
conversations do turn to you know makeup
and skincare stuff and I remember you
saying shortly after you tried this that
you really thought it was doing
something and I remember that like we
said the first product from the line
that you got into and then you kind of
thought well we'll try the eye cream
we'll try this or that so glad to hear
that that's working out um you have
another step now this is from a
different line it's from Garnier it's
the skin renew dark spot corrector in
this really bright green too and I know
puck uses as well she did a guest review
on my blog about this saying how well
she liked this how do you use this I
just put it on the places that have come
up as little dark spots I've had just
several and I would have to say over
this length of time if you use it
religiously and you just end screen and
you use a sunscreen and your your
moisturizer has a good one or even you
know which is what I rely on I want
thirty on that okay so it's made a
difference it's done yell I feel like
that I don't know I don't think any of
them I've heard say they will totally
rid you of it mm-hmm but if they just
downplay them someone by the time you'll
put on say a foundation you put on a
little concealer you really can I've got
some here I've got here here I don't
think they stand out like you Jill you
do not look like a leopard at all you
but I would look like if I didn't oh
yeah
daytime its eye cream serum spot and
then you have another convoys your I
served and it'll be same well it's the
rapid wrinkle repair line it says SPF 30
and this is just the moisturizer and I
like the thirty particularly as you get
into the summer and spring and you're
outside more I just feel like it really
does keep everything else you've done it
keeps it good you know and you don't get
worse you don't get more sun spots you
don't make them stand out more I can use
it several different ways I could put
that on next and then I could put on if
I did it that way I would go ahead and
put on this Rimmel a lasting finish
lasting finish I will put that on over
it last for a full deal that's what I
would do for full coverage you're going
to let the moisturizer go ahead and sink
in a little bit use this separate or you
can buy the day I was just going through
a normal day what I would do is mix
those two or I would use the BB cream
mm-hm
and it just gives you one less layer
and it really does enough it's okay you
know it may not cover it quite as much
but I don't feel like I need a ton of
coverage right now did you say that you
know the truth I don't feel like I'm
covering up a lot I'm trying to
moisturize the skin I'm trying to keep
the skin right we're trying to get the
skin in the best condition it can be and
I mean that should be everyone's bill so
that the makeup can be so you're not
covering continuously but I like the
concept of you know if you're going to
add some moisturizer to a foundation
you're going to be taking you know
making it a little bit lighter weight a
little you're going to dilute the
coverage somewhat and so that's a good
option and really all these BB creams
tinted moisturizers everything like that
is essentially you know it's it's a
foundation type product that has got
some you know extra hydration in it and
so you can create your own by taking a
foundation you like in a moist this is
just something I've tried a lot of BB
creams from the drugstore I have not
been pleased with a lot of them I did a
four and one kind of review thing but
most recently I've tried the BB cream
from Rimmel I thought this was the one
with the best coverage it does have a
little bit of moisture to it as well I
just this was the one that I felt like
was doing the most so I said mom why
don't you try this and see what you
think of it and I mean as far as it came
off I've been just color wise we did
pick the lightest which I thought I
wanted its life is a little darker even
though when I mix my mix mine with
moisturizer I'll take like one dawn of
the Rimmel and maybe two dots of the
moisturizer and just mix those in like
okay go with it I like it okay but I
didn't think it did quite as much as I
maybe wanted it so that's your daytime
skin care routine from there from your
foundation you can go on with makeup
products powder what I normally go with
concealer right after that well that's
still a little bit moist I think that
goes on a whole lot better and then I'll
go on and do whatever else I want so
fast-forward through the day if it's
night time now your wash your face again
and a lot of this routine you've said is
the same
she goes with the rapid wrinkle repair
eye cream she goes with the rapid
wrinkle yeah the mailman's here rapid
wrinkle repair serum uh do you do the
dark spot again yeah before bed and then
we're not gonna mess with foundations
anymore but you have so it's all the
same except the moisturizer changes for
a night and she has rapid tone repair
moisturizer says night time so no SPF in
this one but this the rapid toner care
line is more about evening out skin tone
so another kind of way to help her use
that too I just all over would help I
thought you've been using that for
summarizing that for a while and it's
that where I like that too
overall you've got a skin care routine
that's geared toward anti aging it's
geared toward decreasing the fine lines
and wrinkles a lot of it is Neutrogena
rapid wrinkle repair rapid tone repair
and you're you're pretty satisfied with
the way this has been going right yes I
been looking for quite a while to just
kind of up the thing from what I was
using which was none of this type of
thing to tell you the truth every time I
go into the store to look for one of
these they're sold something is sold us
and they sold out and so I'm thinking
it's becoming quite popular and so it's
hard to find everything you want at one
time so when I go in there if I think I
may be needing this I'll get it I'll
just have it on hand and it does these
aren't overly expensive but if you're
paying twenty dollars every time you
know you go in for something I think
it's nice to just spread that out so
every time I go I'll just pick the thing
I'm Lois stand by the entire say I don't
mind that worrying about running out of
writing and so I'll just buy the one
thing and then next time I'll buy maybe
another one and I keep that always there
so when you run out of things you can
get in trouble yeah and maybe then you
go for a week and you didn't have that
right so I'm trying to really stay with
it so I can know for sure if that's what
I want to keep doing it for now that is
what I want to keep doing so great if
you're interested in some makeup product
recommendations some different things
I'll link below to all the different
videos mom and I have done together
because we got some like key products
which she's reviewed favorite products
that sort of thing so
thank you so much for watching mom thank
you for sharing like yeah and we'll see
you next time bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
