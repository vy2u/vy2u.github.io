today her name is Jackie and she is
going to be telling us about some of her
must-have products the products that
have become part of her daily routine
because a lot of people ask me you know
those questions about my routine but at
the same time I also get those questions
for my mom and people have been
wondering you know what are some things
that continue to work as you age because
you are now I don't know if you want to
fix t6 66 years old and I think mom
looks awesome for but she's she's just
kind of developed a routine and she
doesn't want to spend a lot of money on
it either so or really time you know I'm
not into just you know experimenting to
the degree that you do but just trying
to buy things that work great and so
we're going to start out by talking a
little bit about the skincare routine
starts with an eye cream it's Neutrogena
Healthy Skin eye cream so what can you
tell us about how this works in how you
use I mainly I chose it because it was
not irritating and I could actually get
it up very close around the eye which is
what I wanted to do I didn't want to
have to you know stay away from the eye
that's what it's for and so I would go
over the entire lid underneath and even
in this in the inner corner I didn't
have any sensitivity or anything would
you say you have kind of sensitive skin
around the eyes I guess I must but I've
tried several that do bother me so this
one definitely does the next thing mom
has is and looks like you've been using
quite a business this is from Garnier
and it's that skin renew dark spot
corrector and my sister uses this too
and she had a review on my blog so you
might be familiar with the product that
way but um how do you use it just kind
of on spa it's actually cold I think I
moisturize err also but I don't put it
on they would probably ask you to put
that all over your face if you want to
it's kind of expensive so I just kind of
go to the areas that I needed in
and use my Oh life or my moisturizer so
this would be like sunspots age spots if
you use it consistently
have you noticed because I saw you
earlier was like without makeup on and I
thought I don't see that spot she was
like pointing out where the spot was and
I can hardly see it well there there are
a few places but I I noticed using that
on a daily basis morning and night you
can really keep them a bad you can at
least keep them that they will diminish
some not totally leave but they will
diminish some and then they will stay
there if you will use sunscreen over
those develop and that leads us right
into in this next product what this mom
which is Olay and it's number 30 on the
SPF okay Olay complete it's the daily UV
moisturizer mom's got it for sensitive
skin here
you really can't diminish totally those
spots and little things you'd like to
get rid of maybe but they won't go any
further if you'll continue using this
right and then mom goes into makeup and
she's got a foundation that I
recommended to her I believe she's been
using this for at least the past year if
not longer and it's the Rimmel lasting
finish it is 102 warm and it says 25
hour foundation whether or not it's 25
hours I don't think either of us really
want to leave it on that long to find
out but I mean this is a good long
wearing yeah foundation would you say
you don't feel like you have to redo
anything like that it like it at the end
of the day or something it's good it's a
good coverage wise singing and not
overly it's it's got a nice thinness to
it that doesn't feel like you've caked
on any and how do you put it on with
your fingers I just put it on with my
fingers and I I kind of stay away
actually from my eye area because I'm
really not wanting to darken underneath
the eye so I kind of just and you know
go everywhere else I think is kind of an
issue so I I do get that always with
everything I put on right on my neck mom
has a concealer if she's using it's a
pretty light shade it's classic ivory
from covergirl it's the fresh complexion
and this is kind of like it one of those
concealers with the wand applicator can
you tell me about where you out of that
I like to use that I have a very small
chin and
and I really want to define it from my
neck so in the way that this works you
can just kind of take that off put it
around on there and I put maybe a little
above my lip I might go up over my eye
in this area here and under my eye I'm
trying to use this as a liquid to you
know keep from filling into the crow's
feet and the little round wrinkles
around there and this seems to work good
for this sometimes we think about
highlighting as the final step of makeup
but really you can start from your
concealer which I sometimes do kind of
thinking about okay maybe bridge of the
nose maybe chin maybe under eye brow
bone different things and that can be a
good less coverage now mom has been
using some different powders at this
point in the game she will take a powder
that kind of locks in the staying powder
power of those cream products and she's
had some different ones from covergirl
but I introduced her to something today
that I think is good provides just that
little bit extra coverage a little bit
of brightening continues to even out the
skin I know I've preached about this on
my channel before but it's the Laura
Geller balance and brighten and what
you're looking at here are various
shades of the color kind of swirled in
one and so it's a very corrective
product this shade is called regular and
I'm also giving Mama's Ecotools brush
Ecotools is a great brand of brushes
they're extremely soft wouldn't you say
when we use sister there and you can
pick this up at any drugstore Target
Walgreens things like that just gonna
swirled that in the product went all
over her face
and it kind of I would say this is maybe
just a hair deeper than mom's natural
skin tone but it kind of perked it up
don't you think yeah I gave you just
that little feeling of warmth on your
face I like that we didn't even really
feel the need to use a bronzer or things
like that a blush that she's been using
is this pretty much the only one you use
like that's why I've been kind of
sticking oh like that this is Milani
minerals blush in my tie and this is one
of my personal favorite shimmer in this
but it's kind of like a
nice deep sort of peachy salmon color
and you generally like peachy blushes
like that right I feel I really want to
blush I've always done that since I was
like a teenager I don't know what it is
maybe I just can't cheeks I know but
that that seems to work and just always
I got that finishing touch next
mom's got a must-have lip product and
she's got a key reason why she likes
this and here's the what the box looks
like it comes in a box
it's covergirl outlast all day lip color
this shade and it's the shade she's
wearing today is called crushed shells
number 541 says it's a new shade and it
was in a special display reason I went
to this was as you get to be this age
and really hit 50 say or if not before
everyone starts to get these aligns the
little vertical lines above their lip
here and there and if you put on a
normal nice lipstick even you blot it
you try as hard as you can you eat a
little something all at once
it's running into those cracks you can't
do anything about it yeah this actually
I guess would be referred to as some
sort of a form of a paint yeah you
actually can paint it on it has a lovely
little one kind of a little foam thing
that works very well and then you let
that dry for just you know a few minutes
then then coat it with the gloss that
comes with like a foam yeah it's just
totally clear and it goes on top and you
can reapply that throughout the day now
seems the only thing I don't like so
much is that it seems you need to do
that quite often yeah that's gonna wear
off but the color really but the color
will go no yes it's not like something
that you would even if you were to blot
your lips with a tissue this is the kind
of color that does not come off and it's
not a stain it's not one of those thin
stains but it is that lip color we
practically paint on it drives it will
last you the entire day until you are
but even though I called it kind of a
paint it does not crack it does not look
strange in any way I use this to begin
with it
together something's going to be out and
I couldn't look at my lips I could look
in a mirror every few minutes to sit
yeah and so I had to be you know sure it
wins a gana you can really candle mom
doesn't tend to use a lot in the
eyeshadow department um we have gone
through and used different things like I
think we've used the wet and wild like
matte colors and things like that
basically she's staying away from
shimmer on the lids and that sort of
thing and today we went really simple
and we just took like some of this
balance and brighten powder or you know
any kind of light powder you have and
she just kind of went over her lids with
that and you know that takes care of
discoloration because many of us have
purplish to reddish pinkish tones on our
lids naturally and if you just want to
you know make it easy on yourself you
could just put a powder over it that's
all mom did today and then the next
thing mom probably goes to is the liner
she's using L'Oreal telescopic
waterproof eyeliner as the skin here
starts to come down somewhat you can go
ahead and nicely line your eye with just
a normal liquid that's what I have used
eyeliner and find it up here later okay
so she's basically saying this skin
above your eye starts to come in contact
yes so it's just as important as this
lipstick that does not run up in the
cracks
this will stay put this is a really dark
brown for me it has a little shine to it
I didn't want to go black if I didn't
have to and I this was a dark brown very
lovely little tip and it's more like the
the marker yeah and mom has used the
covergirl lime last 24 hour and she she
liked the way that went on and
everything started to the only thing
with that is she started to have issues
with it drying up I didn't have issues
with mine going getting dried she would
like do one eye and then felt it was
drier when she put it on the other eye
I have not had that problem but this is
something a little bit more if you've
had issues with markers drying on you
this is that inkwell type of formatting
all day you will not find it up anywhere
else and it comes off pretty easily with
a really soap and water if you use that
or a makeup remover for I've my mom goes
from using eyeliner to using her mascara
and she is a fan as am i of the Mallee
volumizing mascara more to wet summer to
clumpy
this was a nice mix of it went on nicely
it was wet enough but you didn't have
everything sticking together all the
time and it stayed soft it wasn't that
that guess you know stiffness and
flaking off when and I don't have that I
feel like one of when a mascara does get
really hard and brittle that those are
the mascaras that are more likely to get
hard brittle and dry and then flake this
I haven't had flaking with you haven't
either
this is not waterproof guys this is just
a regular mascara and you and you it
looks like you put an idol on the lower
I will instead of lining my lower eye
were that there's where you're going to
you're going to have your wrinkles at
this age and then you don't I feel like
it made a harshness there it also drew
attention there that I didn't really
want but I did kind of like to at least
emphasize the lash a little bit because
I had quite a bit here and then to just
go with nothing there it didn't seem
right it's it's strange it's kind of
like you're putting something there but
yet you're making it look more natural
natural by doing that's what I've tried
for myself none of this would work for
just everyone but if these are just my
own tips with my own face sure and
you've got a couple more things to
mention for brows and if you don't do
much more to your face and eyebrow is is
going to use different kinds of multiple
brands different pencils some the
texture wasn't was an issue too hard too
waxy too heavy
some summit was just finding the right
color I am
and something that I picked up for Mom
and I thought she would be interested in
trying it so this morning she did she
just kind of instantly thought ooh
that's something I like
it's from Milani and it's the brow tint
pen and this shade that she has is 0-1
natural taupe so this would be something
for like the light blondes out there is
what it is it is a tiny tiny tip there
on the marker and this is going to draw
on just like a little marker you're
drawing this over a lot of hair it's not
going to make as much sense as if you
are kind of my mom said yeah she's kind
of recreating it into her eyebrow but
you want to be careful when you go to
apply something like this that goes on
so easily that you're not just drawing a
line if you want to make I met I try to
make little like hair motions look a
little feathery motions a laws look
super natural like she said but you can
get away with those little light strokes
because the tip is so fine it's even
finer than some eyeliner pen tips that
I've seen us have some existing brow
hair there she uses like a gel like the
covergirl it's just a clear mascara
actually lifts them a little more and I
do tweeze my brows as you get older you
find you don't need your tweeze near as
much as I know you do but you want to
stay keep a nice line going there and
keep that cleaned up and then this just
kind of lifts that on up as you have
already applied your your killer it's
great it looks right thank you so much
for emptying out your makeup bag today
I'm showing everybody what you use I
know
there are I'm so thrilled that there are
more and more people of all ages tuning
in to beauty broadcast now and just
asking you know what other tips what
more can you tell me what can your mom
say because mom has been in some videos
before and so I think I'm just thrilled
that she could be here today to talk
about it I wish mom could be here more
to do more of this I don't know if she
wants to but this isn't my thing but you
know if I can help Emily out a little
bit or and
one else you know I would like to so I
hope some of these things will be
helpful cool yeah well thanks so much
for watching guys have a great day and
I'll see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
