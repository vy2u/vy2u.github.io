joining us for just a few little reviews
on some things that have really been
helpful in in her skincare routine or
her makeup routine and one of those
things that I think everybody struggles
to find just the right thing on is an
eyebrow product right yes you've tried
pencils I'm sure yes as my eyebrows
thinned somewhat and kind of changed
their shape a little bit I started using
quite a few different things they were
either hard to apply they wouldn't stay
on or they looked too dark to light Plus
being blonde I mean you're trying to
look for the light things that still
aren't to oranjee I know I've seen some
yes but we've talked about and they just
haven't been exactly the right color so
what mom's gonna be talking about is
this Milani brow tint pen and if you've
seen the video we did a few months back
on mom's favorite makeup products this
was something at that point she had just
kind of started started using her first
impression on this little pin as you can
see a tiny itty bitty tip there her
first impression on this pin was you
know that it was really easy to use and
look natural and nice but this is still
that pen that's saying that I gave you
that day and you've still been using it
and you've used it daily ever since and
it's still not run out and a half months
and I think that's incredible so when
mom was telling me that it's like we
need to you know update people and let
people know about this because eyebrows
are a common problem a common question
I've tried this product too and I've got
to say I don't have a lot of brow to
fill in Iran so I kind of feel like I'm
drawing over on top of hairs and it's
kind of a liquidy pen so I don't feel
like it necessarily like I don't need as
much you know fill in but if you're
really kind of going over an area where
the brow is almost non-existent that's
where you say this comes in because your
eyebrows look completely natural they
look the complete right color on your
skin and with your
hurshe the zero 1 natural tote yes so
why don't you love this well it does you
can remove it easily but it does stay on
only like to use a gel over the top of
that to kind of make pull the eyebrows
up
well that gel in that kind of emotion to
make it look more real if you've drawn
any kind of a line along there you don't
want to see just the line you'd like to
see some eyebrows right so kind of
combing them and getting them yes and
the gel makes that stay and it also just
keeps everything intact for the rest of
the day we sense that time soon that
video you know mom had said oh that was
working really well and I think we've
gone to the drugstore picked up one if
not two backups but she does know I get
touched those so and I think that would
be the complaint with a lot of people
about a pair like this whether it's a
brow product or an eye liners that oh it
dries up too fast and I don't want to
keep buying it over and over but this
has been good for you and I know well
heids on so easily - it's not a great
thing it doesn't take any time at all to
do and you do store it like this in a
drawer
now the packaging had said that it said
that and you really fly
that's what's worked for me I just put
it in the drawer pull it out and it's
fine I know there are some higher end
brands I think Laura Geller has a brow
marker or something like that obviously
that's going to be a little bit pricier
this is a drugstore price range item I
don't think it costs more than five to
seven dollars on the maximum it's a
really really small tip so you feel like
you can actually make this look like
yeah I don't know that I can make it
look like hair exactly but I can get it
right where I want it and that point is
never diminished or you know flatten
down for a downgrade or gotten you know
different shaped it's it's exactly look
at your eyebrows I wouldn't ever look at
you and think she's building her
eyebrows because it so naturally gives
like that little backdrop to any sparse
areas and just makes them look you know
just fills in it does what a brow
products you do so but the thing about
it as you do get older those eyebrows
that tend to go down lower you do need
to kind of go up
those a little bit and and bring bring
that up when I do one I check the other
eye that has not been done you can see
quite a deuce oh yeah so that brings
them up to where they always were you
don't want to overdo that cuz you can
look to surprise and if you're younger I
mean I know mom told me this and she
would probably advise anybody else of
this as well don't over pluck your
eyebrows because there will come a time
when they don't come back and there
would come a time whether you pluck them
or not some of them will not come back
and it seems like from the middle out
you have the biggest trouble and that
means if I've seen many people to just
leave that and just let that be well it
ruins the whole shape of your eye and
the way it looks so you need to it's the
complete finishing touch to your face so
that's again the Milani brow tint pen
felt-tip brow color that the shade mom
has a zero one natural taupe but I'm
sure they're probably I know there's a
dark brown there may be one other shade
in there as well but definitely worth
checking out if you need a good brow
product thank you mom thank you okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
