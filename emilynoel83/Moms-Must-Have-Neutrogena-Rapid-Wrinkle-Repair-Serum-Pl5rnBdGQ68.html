you may have seen her in some other
videos we've done but I thought it might
be fun to do just a few little like mini
reviews just giving you a heads up on
some products that have been
particularly helpful to her um mom is in
her 60s and she's kind of been
continuously adapting her makeup routine
for what works best and so I get a lot
of questions about that but I think
sometimes mom has the best answers for
some of these things so first thing
she's going to talk about today is what
what do we have here this is a
Neutrogena wrinkle repair serum rapid
wrinkle repair yes a rapid being a wig
Oh
just kind of stumbled onto this I'd used
something for wrinkles as I've been
using and this seemed a little too good
to be true I think if it runs around $20
but that's not terrible for some what
fine I'll martyr drugstore right in at
Walmart it takes just a small bead of
this and it's the serum now you can get
the moisturizer also I've never used
this particular serum had pretty big
claims though right like what didn't
what what sorts of things were they
saying in the commercials you saw I
think it's a retinol type product I
hadn't been using that over the years
and they say you really do need to use
that and but it was supposed to kind of
diminish not maybe your bigger wrinkles
which these kinds of things probably
would need injections of something but I
have minor forehead wrinkles which I
could have a lot more of I guess but
they were able to be worked on crow's
feet a little places around your chin
you know there sometimes your cheeks
start to sink a little bit you start if
you'll wrinkle there it just goes right
into your skin absorbs totally and
quickly it has a little pump with nice
pump and yet says just apply daily to
cleansed face and neck so after you wash
your faces is like the first thing that
they're honestly so what have you
noticed with it what would have been the
listen in what timeframe did you I would
say more like maybe two weeks I started
noticing a little less at the edge of
the eyes the crow's feet I thought it
kind of acted really quickly up here and
on the cheeks I just felt like
everything looked a little smoother it
just seemed a little less quickly
wrinkled as I would move my face around
you know made me seem just a little
better somehow and so DS this morning
and night you said I've been using it
morning and night I don't know that you
really have to it says works well under
moisturizer or makeup so I reuse this
you top with the moisturizer yes I do I
actually use the Garnier spot a rain
over that in the areas only that I
needed on and that seems to be helping
and and then I put on I gets the L'Oreal
it's number 30 SPF moisturizer it's very
thin the time you get done with that I
haven't even been using today I did put
on a foundation don't you have boys
Rimmel lasting finish but generally I
don't what I do is I put on all of those
things that I've mentioned then just
apply a little concealer here and there
uh-huh
then go ahead and put on my balancing
right and balance of brightens super
Larry Ellen you know yabber eye makeup I
wanted I'm pretty quickly done is this
something you would recommend to people
who are seeing I guess um wrinkles like
you said the crow's feet or wrinkles in
the forehead or anything like that and I
would say right at the beginning of the
noticing of those things don't let them
get terribly ingrained I mean there are
certain things that I this will not
probably help I'm like I said the lines
that come in here on some people I have
I've always had a heavy cheek and when
that starts to kind of come for when
you're going to get that but I do use it
all through this whole area just and
hope for the best all that but the rest
of this really has shown some
improvement more than probably other any
other product and mom's tried a lot of
different things a lot of different
things that come from the drugstore and
I'm sure there are some good
moisturizers and stuff but I think the
technology is probably getting better
and better with some of this either
maybe the combination of this and that
Garnier spot cream mm-hmm have enabled
me not to feel like I need them this
coverage of makeup really oh well thank
you mom for hopping on to do this quick
little review on the Neutrogena rapid
wrinkle repair serum it says accelerated
retinol is contained in this product so
if you need something like that maybe
give it a try
hope it helps someone even talked about
this no we're doing a video on this
noise feathers like little Ricky oh I
didn't know that no yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
