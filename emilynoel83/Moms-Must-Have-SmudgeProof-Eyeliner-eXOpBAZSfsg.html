my mom Jackie she joins us for a little
review on one of her just must have
makeup products I think it's good to
have a review from a different point of
view and a different I'm older person
people ask me a lot for my take on
something that works well for this kind
of skin people who have had questions
for somebody with aging skin or special
issues like that mom has had some ideas
and some good low cost products that you
can come across that really works so
this one we're going to talk about is an
eye liner and this is the L'Oreal
telescopic waterproof eyeliner and I
think you have it in a dark brown shade
and to show you the tip here it is one
of those it's got kind of like a little
inkwell designed there and this is not a
brush but it sort of comes to a very
fine tip here if I were to show you how
that draws on it's a little bit flexible
can you take us through a little bit
like the trial and error you've had with
with the eyeliners you've used well I
just stayed with a liquid eyeliner that
was totally not waterproof and little by
little I would see it taking off on my
upper reimann and as I would find yeah
maybe my eyes watered or any little
things that would bring moisture to your
eyes something you're using on your
upper lashline
yeah and and and that was terrible
because you'd be out you wouldn't know
it was something like that and we can't
have a mirror everywhere but of course
that just washes off easily and
everything well this is a little harder
but still working it off but no big deal
compared to what it does so if you've
got and I think we talked about this in
your makeup in mom's favorite makeup
products video as you age sometimes the
skin that's up here kind of at your brow
bone area can sometimes come in contact
with that lower lash line and as it does
there can be a transfer happening there
you might be young and you've got sort
of a hooded eye or you've got an issue
there where you feel like the liner just
won't stay on
and it's transferring to other parts of
your eye so you've got to have something
you can trust you know man I had no idea
you know what to do that and I think you
I talked to you I had suggested some
other kinds to mom she had used a cover
girl one it was like a 24-hour line
blast and I think that worked well for a
period of time but with that it was more
the format I think it was getting dried
too quickly and it just wasn't working
as well so mom kind of stumbled upon
this telescopic water proof kind in the
drugstore figured okay so it's
waterproof I'll try it and this has been
pretty much the most hardcore eyeliner
you've used I did get it in the dark
brown and I know you suggested black
different times but with my coloring I
just felt like I needed the less you
know the less harsh look that I can yes
practically black but it's not like
total black black if you're trying to
understand what cutting around that I
usually start not right in the center in
the middle but out here just always and
they just increase that line just don't
bet to get to the end and then really
stop there I don't do too much sweeping
up or anything like that because of the
skin that's kind of kind of wrinkly
there but anyway this stays on all day
and you don't even have to think about
looking in the mirror wondering where
did that go so you have not had smudging
with this never smudging yes it doesn't
go up here it doesn't go anywhere but
you say eyeliner is one of those things
you wouldn't leave out of here
absolutely wouldn't as you get older
again your eyelashes usually thin out
too yeah a decent amount when you say
yeah yeah but to try to help make up for
that I've done one eye not done the
other eye yet and you can see quite a
difference in it just popped your eye a
little bit more the whole thing and then
you add your Matt your mascara those two
things together at this age really work
well I people think okay eyeliner that
defines my eye shape and whatnot but you
make a good point on the eyeliner really
makes it gives you a thicker look at the
lash line so I
that that is really important liquid
liner I mean I've told people before if
you have to go with like the most
long-wearing thing on your upper lash
line because it's hard to get a liquid
on your lower lash line and mess with
that but on your upper lash line for
real long wear a liquid is pretty much
where it's at
yes because that's going to it's not
going to maintain any sort of creamy
texture there's something that you're
going to touch and smear off it is going
to kind of just dry and just be there
and so I'm glad mom has found a good one
so if at any point I feel like I need a
super super long wearing eyeliner and
that's the one I think that and and I've
used it you know every day it's just
there's no problem there's no I have no
eating or any kind of thing I had that
once with one of these that's a video
waterproof and I've I've never had any
problems at all of this that's just me
maybe this wouldn't work for everyone
but it's it's working yeah that's the
little disclaimer on everything you know
because there are experiences that we've
had with stuff but I'm glad that you
know mom you've had some great drugstore
suggestions because if you can spend
less on some of this stuff and it works
fine on so I'm willing to spend more but
if I don't need to if these things work
why not go with them yeah and then if
they don't I'll ask you well thank you
mom for sharing your tips and as always
if you've got a certain kind of video
that you would like to see for a mom
certain kind of advice or something we
will keep that in mind thank you guys so
much for watching and have a great day
