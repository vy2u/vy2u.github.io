mom this is Jackie
and you may have seen her in a few
videos here and there that I've had
we don't live close enough together to
where we can do this as often as I think
I would like to I don't know how much
she was to be here not the camera I like
to help you if there's something I could
tell you but I want to be able to offer
to people but maybe haven't been able to
do a whole lot of this so far is to
think about makeup and beauty as you age
how do you hold on to any sort of
youthful youthful image or youthful
qualities and characteristics as you get
older because let's face it
god-willing we're all getting there's
one three keys to sort of retaining your
youth and I guess being a lifelong
beauty and I'm not first thing that you
were going to talk about is eating and
valuated people I think just pretend
expect to eat like they did one that to
say they were a teenager and as you age
your metabolism usually goes down some
you you get to actually just eat less
and it's that's kind of sad in a way but
if you'll accept that it can really save
you a lot bro it can be something you
sort of fall into when you're eating
with a spouse a and portion size and you
maybe just say okay I'm gonna go along
and I'm gonna just do exactly what
they're doing well chances are you're a
different size than he is okay
virtually the same foods but you just
simply don't eat as much and it just
depends on your activity level if you're
out I like to walk every day if I can my
husband walks five or six miles every
day if he can well he can eat more than
I can eat and that's okay but if I
decide I'm gonna really get active that
day well maybe I'll wait more but you
have to really just understand that
because you you can't just continue to
be the way you used to be it won't work
and something that I've found helpful is
to actually
down what if what you've done and
comprises usual our number two kind of
point here is specifically exercise and
I mean I don't I don't love to exercise
people Vasily right precise routine and
and I'm not the type of person that lets
go out make a jog or or really you know
get down the floor and do a bunch of
push-ups but I think what the the real
key is would be consistency with what
you're doing and to get something going
so what light for example what do you
I've always walked it just seemed like
the reasonable thing to do if I had
young children I I was ahead a stroller
in front if I had rode bicycles I didn't
do a lot I didn't do anything terribly
strenuous but I didn't do it continually
and like daily basis daily basis a good
half hours what and they Emmet's it's
been said you'd really don't have to go
crazy doing doing it but you have to do
something and it's just good for your
body's good for your mind it's just a
good time to think and when I had Emily
when I was about 37 years old
I remembered saying to myself I would
stay as young as I could for her I
didn't want to be an older mother but up
here you know just earlier because I had
to Sybil I have an older sister and
brother that are and I go my older than
me so I walked even LAN every morning
you know I would try to do everything I
could
getting in a daily routine that's wise
and getting yourself kind of up and
together and that can be a challenge I
hear from a lot of people that maybe had
a traumatic event in their lives maybe
they're going through divorce
maybe somebody's in the hospital maybe
they're in the hospital or you know
there's just different things that can
throw your life out of whack and how do
you bounce back and get into that
routine I mean is it just a matter of
saying hey I'm going to do this set your
mind to it and decide that you're gonna
start taking care of yourself well it's
best if you never get out of the habit
it's it's something you should do at a
young age and you'll find through all
those years things will shift and change
but you can if you stay in tune with
yourself and you're doing your working
every day with yourself nobody knows you
better so you you aren't your own makeup
that's innocent and you see what things
need to shift in that color old but I
need to change this kind of powder I
need to do whatever and you know it and
so you do that but I think no matter how
you feel you will always feel better if
you get up and take care of yourself in
the morning comb through your hair it
doesn't have to be anything elaborate
but you know put some makeup on even
just a simple three or four things two
or three things and and it just makes
you feel better when you look at
yourself it makes other people feel
better when they look at you but again
just like the exercise just like the
evening you you learn that these things
work you don't get up every day and
decide to do them you've already decided
to do them so every day that's just your
routine and I like that I mean the
things we've talked about it's not like
here's mom with her crazy you know who
he suggests she's you've never heard of
before diet diet exercising and you know
daily routines and stuff but it's
something maybe we all need to be
reminded of a little bit more because it
is easier said than done
we all think okay diet exercise but how
many days can you really get it all done
so it is something you need to think
about and set aside some time for and
it's it's easier if you can maintain
what you have as well as you can and
you age wait your makeup and all these
routines that it is to start over and
try to do it like saying you've gained a
lot of weight to lose that way it's
easier really in the long run to just
take care of it when you see it starting
to get out of balance you know I'm just
I'm going to find a way that maintenance
is the whole thing this is the
maintenance project get started on your
maintenance project thank you so much

have any of your own tips to longevity
