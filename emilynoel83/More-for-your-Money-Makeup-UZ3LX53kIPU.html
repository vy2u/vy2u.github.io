today I just want to put that out there
I am coming down with a cold and I was
sitting around and I was just thinking
you know I really want to do a video
because maybe it'll just get my mind off
of this because sometimes when you're
sitting around with nothing to do all
you have to think about is that you feel
not so good so I'm going to get get into
a project or something that kind of
makes you think less about how you feel
so that's why I'm doing this video and I
want to inform you about more for your
money makeup products and what I mean by
that is not just a situation where
you're getting a lot of product which is
the case in some of these but also in
some cases you may be getting a lot of
different uses or a lot of variety
within that one product or you may find
that as a product where just a little
bit goes a long way so even if it's not
an especially large product maybe it's
just so high-quality or so pigmented
that you're gonna have it for a long
time because you don't have you're not
you know using a lot of the product each
with each application so the first thing
I want to talk about is the NYX mega
shine lip gloss I've got one right here
and I think this is definitely a more
for your money makeup product because I
was doing some comparisons in terms of
actually the amount of fluid ounces that
you get in different lip glosses and
I've always thought that this is a
substantial amount of lip gloss you have
one of these and you feel like you have
quite a bit and when you look at the
product this is another telltale sign
and kind of a packaging trick that some
products will use when you look at the
bottom of say a buxom lip gloss like
this is probably the biggest lip gloss I
have look at that you know it really you
know you hold it there in your hand and
it's tall and it's kind of wide but
actually look this way at the product
and you can see just how much packaging
surrounds what is actually a very small
tube you know diameter wise of lip gloss
look at the NYX mega shine lip gloss it
goes right there there's no there's no
excess packaging and
so you don't feel like you're paying for
a lot of extra packaging either I mean
this is not a very fancy tube but you're
getting a lot of lip gloss and that's
what really matters and it's very very
good quality here's my comparison for
those who really want to get down to
amounts here what you're getting in the
NYX mega shine is actually 0.53 fluid
ounces for 399 at Cherry culture calm
okay point 5 3 fluid ounces cherry
culture calm for a mac lipglass you are
getting 0.17 flew announces for 1450 ok
so we went from 0.5 3 to 0.17 so there
you go comparison wise and then for a
steal a lip glaze you're getting point
zero eight fluid ounces for $22 okay and
you know what I like the cheapest one
and the one you're getting the most
stuff better quality wise than either of
these another line of products I want to
mention is hard candy there are a couple
products in there where I feel like you
are getting an outstanding amount of
product for the money you spend and with
the glamoflage concealer you use very
little each time you apply I mean you
only need a small amount and you're
getting a lot here as well so in a
couple of ways and quality wise it's
just great also the hard candy sheer
envy primer you're getting one point six
ounces in this I mean I compare that and
I think this works wonderfully but
compare that to my Smashbox photo-finish
Lite which this is the small one that
costs you know twice as much as this
this one did and it's just kind of
ridiculous when you start making these
comparisons something else I'm trying
I'm trying out that expert sensitive
line of products from boots and this is
the expert sensitive light moisturizing
lotion look at the size of this puppy I
mean really this was not very expensive
at all I will put the official price
down there for you but you're getting
six point seven ounces with this thing
and well I am NOT nuts about the way it
comes out it's actually just a top like
that and you just kind of got to squeeze
it out out onto your hand which isn't
horrible but I mean it's not my
preferred way to use a product I still
really enjoy the product itself for
giving me moisture but not too much and
not making me greasy and whatnot but
that is a phenomenal value you won't
find too many moisturizers giving you
much more than what you get there
another super economical choice for
makeup products is loose powder loose
powder is one of those things that will
last you a really long time just in
terms of I mean the longevity of the
product certain cream products you know
aren't going to hold up as long in your
collection and for different reasons but
these will last you a really long time
and you get a ton of product I love my
Mary Kay signature loose powder and it
is lasting me so so long and good
quality of end great coverage another
one from the drugstore that I think is
pretty good it's not I know it's not
right up there with the Mary Kay but
it's still a good loose powder and it's
something you get in terms of product a
lot of and NYC smooth skin is what I'm
talking about there another product that
doesn't look especially large as I show
you the packaging is the elf studio
blushes but I must tell you and this one
that I just opened up is called candid
coral and this one is blushing Rose you
will use just a tiny amount of this when
you put it on a blush brush just to grab
my blush brush and show you tap it and
you will not need more than that I could
use a little blush myself right now I'm
not feeling that hot but um you know you
just get a little bit on in men I'm done
I need no more blush so that's one of
those things for $3 a piece you're going
to have that for a long time because it
doesn't take a lot
products that are multi-purpose are
definitely situations where you're
getting more for your money especially
when it's a good quality product and the
Physicians Formula shimmer strips are
great for that what I'm holding up here
is designed to be like a face you know a
shimmer powder or a bronzer what you're
getting is a highlighter a bronzer and
one two three four five different
eyeshadows
is what you're getting and yes they are
pigmented yes they can work fine as an
eye shadow Physicians Formula maybe one
of the more expensive brands from the
drugstore but yet with a product like
this you're getting a lot of functions
in one another product from the
drugstore that is lasting me a really
long time you're getting a lot of
product is the NYC flushable cream
sticks this shade is I know limited
edition this is wild berry but they have
a lot of other great shades and cream
blush is another one of those things you
put it on the apple of your cheek you
blend it in it's not often one of those
things you're gonna go but go back and
apply more and more and more you know
what I'm saying so you twist this up and
you get all that product that you are
not going to use a ton of like I said
each time you apply so that's a great
value I think I picture that kind of
being smushed into a flat pan you know
the way some products are and I'm
thinking well that's a lot more than
that and now a product that I feel is
the epitome of why I made this video
like I said at the start a lot of
product you're getting a lot of variety
and uses out of it and a little bit goes
a long way
these new pallets from wet and wild my
goodness you're getting eight shadows
and they are you know they're not
skimping on the sides they're not saying
well let's give them eight but let's
make them half the size we would
normally make them no and they're all
the same you know equal size they're not
trying to predict for you which one's
going to be the one you use a lot of and
which one you only need a little bit of
you know they're giving you a full equal
amount of each kind there are a lot of
ways you can use this obviously you can
go mixing and matching the colors it can
go a lot of different ways and this is
the palette I'm wearing today by the way
but also with these especially with
these darker shades a little bit goes a
very long way this is something I'm
gonna have for a long time because I
don't mean to scrub into that shadow and
pull a lot of the product off the pan in
order to make it show up on my eyes
so I am gonna have swatches for you on
my blog at least I was having some
issues with my camera and getting photos
uploaded to my computer the other day so
I have them all taken I just don't have
them on there yet and I will also as I
wear these more be doing a full video
review on these as well but these are
new so I want to just make sure you see
and this is petal pusher comfort zone
which I did the tutorial on most
recently and the one I have yet to use
hold on is called blue had me at hello
kind of a cheesy name there but there's
that one as well so they are outstanding
pigmentation when I was watching him I
was like wow and I'm like Tyler look I'd
have like showing him the swatches on my
finger he's like yeah that's good but
anyways look for more on that also
you're gonna notice on my blog in the
next couple days a lot of information
about makeup for TV news and I'm putting
that on there actually as a resource for
a group of college students that I'm
going to be talking to about giving them
tips for clothes and makeup for
television so that's kind of
specifically geared to them but I
thought I want to make it public on
beauty broadcast so anybody else who
might happen to be interested can see
that too so just so you know if you see
that in the next couple days that's why
that's there so I hope you enjoyed this
video more for your money makeup
products I think it's definitely a
relevant topic right now for those of us
that are trying to save money and trying
to get the most product we can get every
time we go out and shop so thanks again
for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
