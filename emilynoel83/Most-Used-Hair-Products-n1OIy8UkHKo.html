hair products today I know that a lot of
people are maybe really into hair
products and kind of a hair product
junkie and so I'm going to give you some
things that I use all the time in this
video and maybe if you're kind of low on
supplies right now and you're thinking
about picking up some new things this
might give you some ideas and just to
start out to explain to you I have hair
that is bout down to there it's you know
long layers it's fine hair it's not
especially super thick so I'm generally
looking for things that are gonna give
me more volume and also kind of keep
damage to my the ends of my hair to a
minimum so these are things I use a
whole lot so let's get started if I have
just blow-dried my hair or I'm just
going to blow-dry it and I like to use a
little bit of a mousse product or a
volumizing product at the roots just a
little bit to get my hair sort of going
for the day because I do wash my hair
the night before I do the news in the
morning early early early so I try to
save myself time by showering the night
before and then when I blow dry in the
morning it might be just a little bit
damp so I am loving some of the things
from the suave professionals line and
this is the volumizing mousse and it's
neat because on the container it says
salon proven to volumize as well as
matrix so that's kind of cool if you
check out the professional stuff each
one it's like a comparison product to a
high-end version so says for up to four
times more body and I just put a little
bit in my palm and then wrap it between
my hands and kind of work it in usually
sort of around the front of my hairdo
and just kind of really in at the roots
it's nice it has a great scent and I
also like that it doesn't weigh down my
hair in any way I like this heat
protectant this is also from suave
professionals and this is the heat
protection spray it says salon proven to
protect against heat damage as well as
Redken so this is another I'm loving the
sense that suave has come up with on
these products and I these are fairly
new and I just think they're great and I
spritz this on sort of you know where
I'm gonna be using a curling iron or
straightener I really focus it
I'll spray spray couple sprays will do
it on to this part of my hair and I do
feel like have been using it for
probably the past month month and a half
maybe and I usually do notice about this
time you know it's been a little while
since I've had a haircut and I feel like
it keeps my ends my ends have not been
very dry or damaged feeling lately so I
kind of credit this for for helping me
out have some flyaways
so putting that heat protectant on it
kind of tames the hair down gets it
ready for styling makes it a lot more
manageable as I'm styling and afterward
I need a good hair spray this is one I
love I've talked about it so much and I
have jumped around I have tried other
products I just realized I still have my
Easter Bunny back there this is what I
keep coming back to because I look for
hair sprays that are really long hold
and this is the Tresemme tres two
hairspray extra hold it's a number four
this is what the whole you know little
lay out there the can is and this is a
big can and I go through a lot of these
still um but a lot of long hold hair
sprays seem to dry out my hair a lot so
like you know I may want you know what
I've got going on at the ends of my hair
to hold up throughout the day but I
spray that on there and it's like it
makes it really dry crispy and not even
nice to the touch at all and usually
what I'm doing these videos like for
example today I've had my makeup on in
my hair done for ten hours now if you
see me in this position and I'm not
doing a tutorial it's usually a video
I've done at the end of my work day so
this really I think helps the styles
hold up very well and um humidity it's
very humid it's starting to get again to
that time of year where there's a lot of
moisture in the air and you've got to
fight it with something and so this is
my weapon right here I love it
from Redken I know I've mentioned this
before in a favorites video but red can
all soft shampoo I also credit this
along with that heat protectant for
keeping the hair soft shiny and I feel
like more so than it used to be so this
has improved my hair a whole lot and I
think
Denis because she sent me the friend
from Texas she kind of got me going on
this but it says softness for dry
brittle hair and I don't feel like my
hair is naturally that Drive but all the
styling I do kind of makes it a little
more fragile so I feel like I just
bathed my hair in this and it keeps it
in really good condition then for
conditioner I've been using the body
full light conditioner it says
weightless ends detangler and I think
the combination of these two you know
this gives me the moisture this gives me
the conditioning without weighing it
down too much so this has been a really
really workable combination for me and I
have had less uncontrollable static you
know and stuff like that so I'm enjoying
those and don't see any build-up you
don't see any problems and that's
another thing with Tresemme dark haired
girls know that sometimes hairspray can
show up on your hair and you don't like
that so this is this is good you can't
really see the hairspray on my hair
building up and then for a leave-in
treatment type thing if you're looking
for something like that I really like
the Neutrogena triple moisture silk
touch leave-in cream so once you get out
of the shower um you know I'll put my
hair up in one of those Turbie twist
things which I love that's a move to use
hair product too because I use that
every day after I shower but before I
put it up in that I will take some of
this and just kind of rub it between my
hands and work it through the ends of my
hair and it's just kind of a nice treat
for your hair basically it's infusing
moisture it says for all-day
conditioning softness and manageability
so there you go guys those are my most
used hair products let me know if
there's something big and awesome I'm
missing out on but I really think these
things work great I love that a lot of
them are pretty affordable and let me
know what your favorites are say in the
comments section and let me know so
thanks a lot for watching have a great
day and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
