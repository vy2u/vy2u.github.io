me for this video do you know what
holiday is right around the corner it's
Mother's Day I don't know if you've
thought of any gift ideas yet but in
this video I'm going to bring you some
of my beauty related gift ideas for mom
because I think that's kind of just my
area I've created some ideas here on
several sort of individual gifts and
then one is a little makeup gift bag for
mom with some of my favorite things in
there so I'll go through that also this
video is going to be a Twitter tonk
video I have asked you guys just now on
Twitter what are some of your ideas for
gifts for mom for Mother's Day and so
I'm already getting some responses in at
the end I'll share some of those but
first off real quick jumping right into
some things that I think would make
great gifts and one of them is this kit
from laura geller and a long time ago I
mentioned this and I've been using these
products and I still have these products
and it's called the baked basics kit
from Laura Geller now I have a huge fan
of the balance and brighten which is her
um it can be used as like a powder
foundation or if you want like extreme
impeccable coverage you know put this
over a foundation but it's really good
and the yellow kind of swirled
throughout is very corrective so I love
that that's kind of like the star of the
kit and close behind that or may be
equal with that I also love the bronze
and Brighton as you can see they're
gorgeous baked powders with other tones
swirled throughout and this is like a
seriously it's like climbing my list of
favorite bronzers and also you get a
blush and Brighton in berry and so
that's a really pretty almost like a
highlight and blush and one this isn't
like super duper pigmented blush it
gives you a little bit of a globe but
it's more like a highlight and blush in
one these last so long and these are
seriously awesome awesome products so
I'll have all the info in the bar down
below on you know links to finding this
stuff also a little kit that is sort of
another high-end option but a great
value are the set of buxom lip glosses
now the set i have here is what i got
for christmas this is the city slicker
set but there's a new set that I know
QVC just posted
from bare escentuals the buxom lips and
it's more of these little you know short
sized lip glosses and these do have a
plumper in them so if you think your mom
would like some plumped up lips I think
these feel cool they have kind of a cool
tingly sensation it's not overpowering
like ouch to put on you I know they have
again not these exact colors but they
had some really nice shades for spring
and summer so I think that these I mean
I'm loving mine that i got for christmas
i am always rotating these through so i
think that'd be something that maybe mom
might like as well and another little
idea here is from sigma and it's the
travel brush kit I mean think about the
season we're getting into graduations
you've got weddings and things like that
lots of stuff people are traveling for
so you want to travel brush kit that can
go with you and this is a really really
good one I've reviewed this before this
is the basic this is not the premium and
I think this one is actually this basic
kit is really good you get a powder
brush a stippling brush blush you've got
your I just a great little set here of I
brushes you know you're blending brush
12 pack on the color your pencil brush
and your concealer brush and what makes
this brush kit so unique is that most
travel brush kits like things that your
face shrinks when you travel because the
brushes are like this big so here the
brushes are short you know you can see
that but they're a great size for powder
I mean bronzer I love that they didn't
skimp on the size of the brushes
themselves so comes in a super cute
little you know carrying case there so
that's very easy for mom to pop in her
bag next real quickly I want to take you
through what's in this little bag and
this was actually sent to me this
adorable cupcake bag it's a handmade
makeup case and it's from i'm going to
show you the cute little on business
card it's from ghujiya calm and it's an
etsy shop and so she was nice and if she
watches my videos and she sent me this
little bag and i thought oh my gosh if i
would have only known that existed i
would have been on that
a long time ago in here some of my
favorite things and I put him in with
Mike my mom in mind what things I
thought she could might want or need and
first thing again summer in mind as well
translucent mattifying powder from ELF I
love this is kind of like an all-purpose
powder and it reminds me a lot of max
blot powder now that I have that too I
find that this performs out very very
much the same as that does got a great
big mirror so this is an awesome you
know purse powder also EOS lip balm this
lemon one remains my favorite Oh smells
so fresh plus it's got an SPF 15 so
there's another great summer thing you
can't go wrong with getting somebody a
lip balm people can always use lip balms
and all the things I have in here are
universal you know for the skin tones or
whatever goof proof I primer palladia
herbal eyeshadow primer maybe your mom's
not real into the whole makeup scene
maybe she hasn't discovered what an eye
primer can do for her but get her the
palladio one it's every bit as good in
my mind as the urban decay and the Too
Faced shadow insurance and a mascara I'm
loving so much is the almay one coat
nourishing mascara triple effect what's
the benefit of this well it's a brush
that has basically a short side and
alongside so you get length and
thickness I love that it doesn't make
the lashes feel world brittle once you
put them on and it just I mean my lashes
need help and this thickens them up very
nicely also a really long wearing
eyeliner I know so many people had
recommended this to me in the past and I
tried it and I'm like wow this is great
it's from wet and wild and it's their
cream eyeliner in black this is um such
as long wearing eyeliner I love it I
love going all across my upper lash line
going a little bit under my lower lash
line and then cut smudging that whole
lower lash line out with like a dark
shadow on top but this is seriously
great so if you're moms like fed up with
eyeliners nothing last try that one it's
really good and then for an eyeshadow I
have a full tutorial on this but this is
the elf brightening eye color in day to
night beautiful colors in there this
is only a dollar I wish everybody just
had this in their collection because
these shades are super pigmented check
the tutorial it's a review torial on how
to use that and then a couple of lip
glosses love these shades this one is
called beige these are the knicks mega
shine lip glosses this is beige and this
is natural yes natural love these two I
think these are two great basic shades
for a classic neutral and a classic pink
to have in your collection and there you
go you know there are some inexpensive
makeup pics that you can put together
and you can call them Emily's favorites
director do my makeup channel for more
tips on how to use those things but when
you throw it in it doesn't have to be a
bag like this but any bag and that's a
great little personalized gift so since
this is the Twitter top video again I've
been taking your tips on what you should
get mom for Mother's Day on Twitter so
let's take a look at what people are
saying amy is on there and she says my
mom's day gift idea is to buy her red
flowers she likes red and I love flowers
there you go lil miss Laney says cook
her a meal to thank her for all the
meals that she has cooked for you
throughout the years that's a fun
creative idea Amy came back and then she
said I also plan to make a video of me
playing a piece on the violin for all
mothers out there that's a great idea do
is do a special little YouTube tribute
that's a lot of fun next one is teary
ization as she says pampering moms work
so hard a manicure and a pedicure is the
perfect way to allow them to relax and
enjoy their special day and cabin door e
says an Amazon Kindle if they enjoy
reading so some great tips there hope
this video gives you a few ideas if
you're still looking for something so
thanks a lot for watching happy mother's
day in advance to all the moms out there

Mother's Day and i'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
