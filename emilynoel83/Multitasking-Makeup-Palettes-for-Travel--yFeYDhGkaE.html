gloss daily blog this video is all about
pallets and specifically those that can
do more than one thing for you so these
are things that would be great for
travel because they can minimize the
amount of products you take I have five
to tell you about in this video that not
only contain great quality products but
they just take up less room basically
and they packed more purposes into one
small kit I want to tell you about is
from Tarte and this you know might look
like a wallet or a clutch but inside
you've got a great big mirror and also
six eyeshadows and two blushes now these
are the really popular Amazonian clay
blushes including one and exposed which
is one of the brands most popular and
then as far as the eyeshadows go
everything's very wearable this is the
kind of palette where you could get a
little bit more deep look you know with
the dark plum you've got a great kind of
taupey brown here also a really nice
metallic gold so you can still have fun
with this palette but it's wearable
shades that you don't really have to
think about you know and so there you've
got your blush and your eyeshadow
combined you're not having to take
separate power
that's a lot of time that I really enjoy
is from the balm and it is the rock star
palette bomb Jovi really fun names here
I've talked about this one before but
again a mirror the mirror is really
important for travel you've got twelve
eyes shadow sphere in a really nice
variety of shades that work in some
color but are still very wearable plus
you get four entirely matte shades to
work rat-boy blush mary lou manizer
highlighter tried-and-true products from
the brand and then down here you've got
a couple of products that can multitask
for you in themselves these can be your
lip product or it could be a cream blush
everything's really cutely packaged
you've got a little billboard chart down
here that's showing you exactly how to
work all of these products together so I
think it's a great value and look how
flat it folds down this is not going to
cause a problem as you pack for a trip
pallet for me is my Mally more perfect
pallet this is a nice combination of
some basic eyeshadows a couple of
blushes and also you get an eyeshadow
base and an ice cream highlight is what
shadows are highly pigmented and this is
a palette that can really take you from
a very natural everyday I using some of
this these top four shades but when you
shift it down to the bottom Ford you're
gonna get a really dark smoky well I
think the blushes are some of the best
aspects of Mally's whole line the top
one is Mally's glow the bottom one is
romantic so you're getting a chance to
play up more of a pink look or a peachy
look depending on which one you go with
next palette is really different unlike
anything else I own it's the Too Faced
natural face palette and I actually love
this for travel because it totally
eliminates a ton of compacts that you
might be taking with you in this you
have a bronzer a cream blush a powder
blush concealer a cream Luminizer and a
brightener so you think about all the
different things that that can eliminate
in your makeup that and the neat thing
is that you know your concealer and your
brightener can almost take over for a
foundation if you're having a good skin
we have really been enjoying
experimenting with cream blushes and
cream highlights so you have a couple of
those in their downfall for this palette
is that it's going to be most suitable
for light to medium skin tones but
hopefully eventually they could come out
with something that would really be
geared toward tan and deep skin
the ultimate in something that can be
multitasking for you because you can
decide exactly how you want to lay it
out and that's my Z palette I've
actually gone on ad potting spree here
lately to fill up several other Z
palettes that I have but here's just an
example of one I've got a bunch of
single eyeshadows here from Coastal
Scents and a couple of Mac blushes and
it's magnetic so these products just you
know stick right in there they won't
shift around on you you can create any
configuration you want you can take your
little you know trios and quads of
eyeshadows D pop the shadows there's
plenty of online tutorials on how to do
that and then you have them all
contained in one really user-friendly
flat panel we're going to save a lot of
space not only for travel but in your
at-home makeup collection I hope that
gives you some ideas on some great
palettes that can multitask for you and
also therefore be great for travels so
have a great day and I will talk to you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
