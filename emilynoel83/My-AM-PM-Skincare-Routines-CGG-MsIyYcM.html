to be sharing my skincare routine and I
don't talk about skincare nearly enough
on this channel or my Express channel
really I've kind of made that a little
bit of a resolution for this year to do
more skin care related reviews and
videos it's just something I want to
make more of a priority because I'm 31
years old now I feel like I should be
getting serious about the skincare you
know using some things that are really
going to hydrate my skin the way I
should and hopefully fight the aging
process somewhat and what works for me
might not work for everyone we've all
got different skin types I think
skincare is a really individual thing so
hopefully I can just describe my
situation well enough and describe the
products well enough to wear you know
whether or not some of these might work
for you and it's interesting because I
have some total like Holy Grail products
that I would repurchase till I die and
have been using for years type of thing
and then I've got some other products
that are newer to me that are more
experimental and there are certain parts
of skincare that I feel like I tend to
swap things out a little bit more but my
skin type right now is really pretty
normal I have not had very problematic
skin lately it's really not too oily not
too dry if anything it will be a little
combination like a little oily in the
t-zone that'll be the area where like
makeup will tend to show signs of wear
toward the end of the day skin on my
face also isn't overly sensitive either
but like I said I am trying to look
towards some more anti-aging products
these days and just things that will
really nourish and hydrate my skin so
I'm going to start with the a.m. skin
care routine and the first thing I do is
wash my face with this CeraVe hydrating
cleanser I have had this for just over a
year I remember starting to use this
last January when Kristen gave got me
onto this I was going through a really
dry spell and this is just the balm for
washing your skin not over drying it
still feeling like you've got a really
clean slate for makeup application but
it's totally gentle and if you've got
any kind of random dry patch which I do
get on occasion and this does not hurt
that at all I think if your eczema prone
this would be a good cleanser to try it
with
overly strip those areas and this is a
12 ounce container I've been using it
really consistently at the start of
every day and I think it's it's probably
getting toward where it's almost gone
but I will definitely repurchase that
and we're getting into some newer things
that I've been using for about a month
so far just over a month and it's the
Olay Regenerist line and it's
interesting because you go into the
drugstore and you kind of expect
drugstore prices and then you look at
the skincare and you're like holy crap
that's like you know 25 30 bucks for a
night cream or something and so I get
kind of hesitant about those purchases
because you know you're buying a decent
amount of product it's got a pretty
hefty price tag and you know what if it
doesn't turn out to work so I noticed on
ulties website and actually I think I
may have seen a couple of these on
Walmart shelves as well they've got some
smaller sizes of a couple of the Olay
Regenerist products and I have heard
great things about the Regenerist
moisturizer and also this serum so this
is the first thing that actually goes on
my skin after it's washed and this is
the micro-sculpting serum this is packed
with great ingredients no I don't know
them all I will link below to more
details so you can look them up but it's
supposedly good for the turnover of your
skin cells this feels so good on the
skin so silky smooth I just use one pump
it's very easy to get that everywhere
seems to absorb quickly so I feel like I
can kind of move on to the next step
without interfering with what this is
doing but it is really silky soft and
again this is like the $9 small size of
this that I'm trying out and I really
really am enjoying that then I also got
from that line this is the full-size the
regenerating lotion with SPF 15 so the
day lotion from the Regenerist line
again very happy with this product this
is definitely I think a
middle-of-the-road moisture level so
it's really working for my normal skin
you know it's not too thick and heavy
for a daytime under your makeup type
moisturizer but yet it's not so light
that I feel like my skin's looking dry
and cracked you know under makeup like I
didn't give it enough moisture so this
has been great as a daytime moisturizer
I have
I cream by the way that I am NOT good
about using consistently I try to use it
both day and night when I remember I'm
just trying to get better about it but
it's the tarte maracuja see brighter I
treat is it brighter brighter I
treatment and this is really smooth and
I mean it just has a great texture super
creamy but it doesn't remain too like
tacky on your skin so if you want to go
on top of this with makeup I mean I feel
like I can get away with that but I
really should be using it more it's a
great product it's a great level of
moisture but that would be an AM and PM
thing when I can think about it
so then nighttime rolls around my
biggest skincare related question is how
do you take all that nasca makeup off in
late I use consistently these equate
hydrating face wash cloths is what
they're called you get them in a pack
that contains too little like plastic
bags and they're basically a dupe type
product for the Olay daily facial
cleansing cloths and those I use for
years going all the way back to college
I love those things they take off all my
makeup but they can get a little pricey
and not every generic version agrees
with me and the main reason why is
because some kinds will irritate the eye
area and I use these to take off
everything like the eye makeup the face
makeup the whole shebang and the equate
kind sold at Walmart does a really great
job they I feel like they're totally
getting my face clean at the end of the
day they don't irritate and they also
don't seem to over dry and I know that
the packets you know of pre-moistened
face wash cloths are really popular
these are not that I don't really enjoy
those because I feel like they always
leave a residue and they don't take off
the eye makeup well enough and a lot of
them seem to be kind of heavily
fragranced so these cloths are the kind
where the soap is like in them you get
them wet with water and then they kind
of lather up and you can just wipe
everywhere one side of these is more
textured and you feel like you can get a
little more scrubbing action and the
other is totally smooth so I use these
every night to remove every stitch of
makeup on my face another advantage to
these is if you're traveling they're
really easy for travel because you can
just take as many as you
think you're going to need you know if
you need four or five just take the
individual cloths and stick them in your
bag they take up next to no room and you
can also just toss them when you're done
so this is my holy grail
repurchasing everytime makeup removal
trick and also several times a week I
will use my Clarisonic I have a Mia - I
just don't use it all the time because a
I don't always feel like I have time for
it and B I don't think my skin needs it
all that often but I would say an
average of two to three times a week
I'll pull that puppy out and once you
know my skin has been mostly free of
makeup but still has a little bit of the
soapy moisture on it I'll just take that
and run it over my face and so once the
skin is clean I pull out that serum
again that I mentioned at the start and
then I use the regenerist
micro-sculpting cream for my night cream
and this is the small like kind of try
me size as well which I still think is
pretty generously sized but like I was
saying this skin care stuff from the
drugstore it still ain't cheap so if you
want to try them ulties website and you
can find these for like nine bucks to
try them out they've been using this for
about a month solid on about a third of
the way through this cream and this may
be my favorite part of this Regenerist
line that I've tried I just love the
texture of this cream and this is the
cream that I kept seeing as like an
editor's pick in magazines or you know
the favorite of the year whatever for a
drugstore anti-aging type cream and it
really is a beautiful texture it feels
great going on um there is some
fragrance in this I don't really mind it
I don't find it to be too strong but I
think there may be a fragrance free
option in this line nighttime is when I
really want a richer you know thicker
level of moisture on my skin and I think
this has been great for that I also feel
like I've noticed kind of a difference
in my skin just in the fine lines and I
don't know if this is a disappearance of
fine lines due to these products or just
that I'm getting better quality moisture
in there and it's just making them less
apparent you know what I mean my skin
has been really smooth has not reacted
to any of these products with breakouts
and then you know the eye cream when I
can remember it I'll use that too and
one thing I should also mention is I had
during pregnancy it was totally hormonal
II
linked but I had melasma right here on
top of my cheekbones dark patches of
really like super pigmented skin that
has faded on its own after I had Belle I
mean almost immediately it started to
fade the hormones that were making that
happen in my body basically weren't
there anymore and now it is almost
completely gone I'm not treating that
with anything specific it's just like
leaving slowly on its own so that's been
great I mean I feel like that leaving
paired with my skin being in pretty good
shape right now I can get away with a
lot more like lightweight foundation
type products I have a couple of spot
treatment things that I want to mention
one that I've been using for a long long
time if I do get a blemish or breakout I
use the clean and clear person gel ten
this is a ten percent benzoyl peroxide
acne medication just use it right on the
spot it dry stuff up so so quick and
then right around the same time I was
having and we'll call it my dry spell
back when I bought the hydrating
cleanser I also got the CeraVe
moisturizing cream and this is great if
you're dealing with any dry patches on
your face or body for that matter this
is great for sensitive dry areas but
it's a very heavy duty cream this
contains hyaluronic acid it says
moisturizes restores and maintains
protective skin barrier so this is not
something my skin needs all over it by
any means and it's a giant tub I love
the size of this but I'll just you know
if I happen to have a dry patchy area
maybe I've had a cold and under my nose
it's really dry just take a little bit
of this treat it almost as an overnight
treatment and it really clears things up
and lastly a little skincare mentioned
for lips my elf lip exfoliator I put
this in the skincare category in my
finale of the Emily awards by the way
which all of those winners are outlined
on my blog but this is definitely
something that has been vital to the I
don't know health of my lips maybe not
the help of my lips but the appearance
of my lips anyway flaking away that dry
dead skin just kind of running it over
top lip and bottom lip and then putting
any great balm that you love on top of
it really makes the lips look healthy
and nice and ready to receive those
matte dry lipsticks every gear
the Emily Awards by the way I do name
three top skincare products and this
year it was the hydrating cleanser this
lip exfoliator and my equate face
washcloths so I hope this AM and PM
skincare routine was useful to you if
you're looking for some new products to
try and like I was saying certain things
and you kind of saw them as I mentioned
them are really Holy Grail great
products to me the things that seem to
get swapped out more for me anyway our
serums and moisturizers so this is what
I'm on right now this Regenerist stuff
and I really am liking it so far I've
liked what it's done for my skin I like
the way they feel and I think the level
of moisture for my skin is just right so
thank you guys so much for watching I
will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
