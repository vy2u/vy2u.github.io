hey everybody I don't know about you but
this time of year is a real struggle for
my hair particularly my bags because you
know i might have everything styled
perfectly and then i get out some
humidity and i feel like it makes the
volume you know everything starts to
fall flat a little bit for some people
maybe your hair gets frizzy and harder
to compile a little style that I've
developed which is really nothing that
new or strange in fact I wasn't even
going to do a tutorial on it because I
thought it was that easy just kind of a
way to keep your bangs out of the way
it's really low maintenance really
really easy so i'll show you how to do
it your first option of course is to
just take your hair you know no styling
to it and just do this step where you
pin your bangs back because that's you
know totally fine but if you want to
make a little bit more of a style out of
it and have a little more body to work
with here's my suggestion nothing to
have a teasing comb handy and some
hairspray got the handy dandy tresemme
here and i'm going to pull up some hair
in my crown at the top towards the back
of my head and so just pull some of that
up and I find it's easier to build the
body first and then pin the bangs then
to pin the bangs and then try to go in
and work in some body to the hair so
just pulling that straight up there and
then I'm going to take some of my hair
spray a couple spritzes of spray right
behind what you've pulled up find your
comb in my lap of course in and just
gently tease just by getting the comb in
there and pulling down and you want to
keep this kind of close to the roots and
body there and so then I kind of just
gently without really putting my comb
down in my hair too much just kind of
gently um tame that down a little bit
and you'll find it'll just blend into
this side which has not been you know
nothing's been done on our side look at
the front part of your hair and I see
I've got a side part here so I'm going
to take my bangs whoo whoop whoop just
pull them straight back like that and
i'm going to give these just a little
tease as well just right behind
it's like this not I have to be precise
but just to give you an idea if you've
never done this before I'm going at like
an angle off like and then you take a
couple bobby pins now this bobby pin
happens to have a little flower on it
which I like I found this at forever 21
you can find these Claire's other
accessories stores or you can make them
yourself with a little hot glue a fake
flower and a bobby pin I'm going to do
is just pin this over that small section
I've pulled up and there we've got you
know our little pulled up area in place
now now you can leave it at one pin but
if you're like me and you just get a
little paranoid about stuff coming
undone you can take another bobby pin
and just crisscross it just crisscross
it over that section nobody will
probably know it's there but you will
and you'll maybe be more confident that
your style walls so then I like to take
a mirror just kind of check the shape
that we've got going on of the hair as
you can see there's body going on here
but the style you know it's off the
forehead it's out of your face and if
you put a little hairspray on this which
i will put some on that front part and
also the back part that I've teased
you'll find that this will stay for new
throughout the day and you don't have to
worry about and do other cool variations
with this like pulling it into a bun or
a ponytail or anything like works for
any hair type whether you've got thick
hair fine hair long short curly straight
on what finished for any big event or
any just day-to-day activity so thank
you very much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this quick tutorial and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
