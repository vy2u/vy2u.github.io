this video is that this is my biggest
poll ever okay I just know that I can
guarantee you that I have never done a
haul with this many items before and I
have well over 600 videos so that's
really saying something here and this is
not just like one incredible shopping
trip this was just a lot of different
occasions these were these items were
picked up and it's some of these I even
remember getting like a little before
Christmas but they kind of got lost in
the shuffle around that time and I just
wanted to get you up to speed on what
I've got and what I am definitely
interested in reviewing incorporating
into tutorials just things like so I'm
gonna get started and talk about
skincare stuff because as you know I got
Clarisonic for Christmas so that was a
big skincare item that has changed a lot
in my routine and I will be reviewing
that but sort of around that time I got
some new skincare items as well because
I was either kind of running out of
things here and there just wanted to try
something new so I did get a new
cleanser actually this was fairly recent
from Walgreens it's the L'Oreal youth
kowtowing gel cleanser it says youth
regenerating skincare for luminous
smooth younger looking skin it is oil
free it's pink which is awesome wanted
something just a regular gel cleanser
and I use this in the mornings even just
as I give my face a quick wash with my
hands and stuff but one thing I noticed
about this is it's it's very fragrant I
mean it has a strong kind of floral
almost body wash type scent but it
doesn't seem to leave any adverse
effects on my skin in fact my skin has
been behaving quite well lately so it's
not a big deal but if that might just
weird you out a little bit if you try
any couple new moisturizers and they're
both from Neutrogena and one of them I
got because I just really was fed up
with dry skin I've got like little areas
where my skin gets dry and it's just so
annoying like on the tip of my nose
around my eyebrows and I just thought I
want my nighttime moisturizer to just
really saturate I just wanted to totally
hydrate my skin so I got this new
jeanna ageless essentials continuous
hydration night and it's a nice big
amount of product here that reminds me
of the like that Garnier gel cream only
a little bit more on the creamy side I
think this has served the purpose I
wanted for being a really nice
heavy-duty night cream that wouldn't be
so much to where it would leave me with
breakouts and then I also am trying the
Neutrogena Healthy Skin anti-wrinkle
cream this is SPF 15 it's a retinol face
treatment with multivitamins and retinol
it's you know supposedly one of these
things you need if you're into getting
into anti-aging it's just one of those
key ingredients you hear talked about
along not a super hydrating moisturizer
so when I put it on like in the morning
so I'll put this all over my face and
then I might hit a few more spots with
like an Aveeno moisturizer or something
else that I have just for a little added
hydration I'm still using it I'm still
kind of seeing what I think about so
picked up the Garnier a skin renew
miracle skin Perfector BB cream
enlightening basically it kind of
behaves like a tinted moisturizer it's
really creamy the texture is really nice
I think and this has worked well for me
it's not designed to be something that's
gonna cover up every flaw on your skin
this is a light light coverage product I
enjoy the amount of moisture it gives
again it's a dry skin time for me so I
like something that's a little bit
thicker and I could see this being a
problem and some oily skin girls have
told me this was too much for them and
it really broke down throughout the day
but for me I like this and I've used
this under other foundations and I've
used it alone with just some concealer
and I've been pleasantly surprised by
how it's been working so it's number
seven got this at Target and it is the
state perfect foundation and it has SPF
15 says hypoallergenic my shade is
called nude I've it's called new ivory I
thought that was so weird this was like
the second shade and it's dark like I
mean it's just a little dark on me I do
like this it lasts a really long time it
reminds me a lot of Revlon Colorstay and
I think it reminds me of that oily to
calm
conversions so it's definitely not gonna
provide you with a lot of excess
moisture or anything like that like if
you are seeing some dry spots they might
even appear a little drier as you
continue to wear this throughout the day
so just something to keep in mind and
this may be another one of those mixer
foundations for seasons like this I
think this could be amazing
much like Revlon Colorstay is during
warmer when I'm not wanting a lot of
additional moisture in my foundation but
for right now I think it does require a
little extra boost also got something so
I can do finally very soon a one brand
tutorial and you saw me use this in my
Valentine's tutorial as well it's the
NYX HD studio photogenic foundation I
just needed a next foundation so I could
kind of complete the spectrum of
products so I could do a look with only
NYX and it says high definition mineral
enriched talc free paraben free I really
really like this I like that it feels
kind of light on the skin I like how it
wears throughout the day I felt like I
looked at my face at the end of the day
yesterday and I was like it didn't wear
off and in a patchy way like some
foundations can if you get oily in some
spots and not others so that this is a
very preliminary review but I am liking
that so far and then I got a another Mac
Pro Longwear and if you saw my Emily
awards the one I had was just completely
drained so I like to have this on hand
because I'm wearing that one today
actually I feel like it's just an
exceptional foundation for staying
powder and I like the shade I have
because what I'm using sunless tanner
like I am right now like something a
little deeper and so this is NC 35 and I
think that that work I also got a NYX
powder this is stay matte but not flat
powder foundation this is medium beige
that I have it in so this is neat
because I would call this you know a
overall matte finish but then I look at
it on my finger and I think feel like
that powder has a little sheen to it
like like it's not totally matte but
it's not pearly or I don't see flecks of
shimmer so I'm not sure what's going on
here
I haven't even worn this enough to be
sure I am
wearing it today and I like it I don't
have a problem with it but I just think
that's kind of different and it comes
with like a a nice big sponge down here
in the bottom part so there's the powder
on top another thing I wanted to try is
the benefit cha-cha tint and I really
like the Benetint that I got recently in
like a sample size and so I thought how
fun does this color look I was looking
at it in Ulta and it's like it's
supposedly a mango tint and it's kind of
like a little bit orange coral Orange II
blush and a pretty lip to coordinate and
I just like that concept of you know
getting the look on the cheeks and the
lips as well I wore a coral cheek and
lip the other day on the news and I was
absolutely thrilled with the way it
turned out very long wearing too like
this a lot and I think it will be just a
great thing to as we head into spring
you lip products here and the one I'm
wearing now is from Mac and it's a cream
machine in hot gossip loving this talk
about like wearable pink mauve type
color
it's just creamy it doesn't have shimmer
to it it's just like a little bit darker
pink kind of you know and I just I
really like the way that looks I like
what it does to my face my complexion
and I love the cream machine formula so
I'm glad I picked that also got a mac
lipglass and this one is in pink
lemonade this is kind of a pretty it
makes me think peach when I first glance
at it but then I look at it on the lips
and I kind of think it comes off a
little bit more pinky but there's a
swatch of that it's really pretty it's
creamy
it it has a little bit of a pearl finish
on one of the L'Oreal infallible lip
glosses this one is in blush I had tried
the plumping kind of this but and this
is just the regular six hour never
failed lip gloss like these can be a
little bit sticky sometimes but on this
color is really beautiful really pretty
shimmery pink Rimmel has a line of
lasting finish lipsticks now that are
the Kate Moss Collection Kate Moss of
course a supermodel and spokeswoman for
Rimmel and
have this one in zero one it's just
these are just numbered and this is a
red like I needed to tell you this oh
yeah that's that's really red there but
I like the lasting finish formula and I
just saw this in the display and I
thought oh what a pretty red pretty
creamy red kind of reminded me of my NYC
ultra moist lip wear in sheer red this
one's got a little more punch to it
though it's a little bit brighter I also
picked up the lipstick that Sofia
Vergara was wearing in the Golden Globes
can you tell I liked her Golden Globes
look because a couple videos ago I was
talking about the the covergirl
eyeshadow trio she was wearing and then
I found the lipstick I'm like I'm like
her look stop her I look on the blogs
and I see what they used but they said
they used this covergirl LipPerfection
and everlasting it's just it's just the
epitome of Plum I think right here so I
found that to be gorgeous bold I mean
look at these two bold colors here
that's great I don't talk about lip
perfection as much I feel like but I do
really like the formula a couple of new
essence one dollar nail polishes I know
I feel like this haul is just going on
for ages here but um two light colors
and I just really like these nail
polishes this one's called sweetest
candy and it's a beautiful light pink
and this one's called modern romance and
it's a creamy nude color a little bit
smaller but still I don't go through
nail polishes real fast and these are
just 99 so now for eyes another essence
product and I still need to test this
some more to be able to really review it
but this one is one of their stay all
day long lasting eyeshadows and I
instantly thought this color tattoo have
some competition and look at the
packaging it's got like this little dome
and then it's like a magnifying glass
almost there but this shade is glam egos
too and it's just a cream eyeshadow and
it looks like this
see how sometimes it catches the light
and it almost seems like invisible and
then BAM there's a color so um it has a
lot of gold in it as well it's very
pretty I've used it as a base so
far and I like it like that but I
haven't tried it alone to really be able
to tell you the staying power on its own
but I was excited to see another brand
come out with what is said to be a long
wearing cream yet another essence thing
this just really appealed to me when I
first saw it haven't used it all yet and
it's the essence Sun Club glamour to go
I shadow and this one is in Long Beach
it says eight long-lasting trendy
eyeshadow colors and I just thought how
nice is this little you know eight pack
here of shadows they're all pretty much
a little bit shimmery except for I think
this peach and that brand rose rosey
gold pea the matte Brown is even rather
nice so I'm the price on this was just
insane it was like right around $3 or
something and I thought for that for
that amount of color I'm gonna give this
a go so I'll let you know also this is
something I used in my last tutorial um
so I showed it briefly but it's the Too
Faced natural at night palette this is
the you know the new two-faced thing and
I was talking to the girl at Sephora and
she was like oh I love that palette so
much and she was said that the folks
that were just like kind of rushing to
it when it first came in but it says
sexy and sultry neutral eyeshadow
collection here are some cards to give
you ideas of how to wear the stuff your
three larger ones that are your
highlights and then smaller little
pockets of color for the other shades so
what I'm seeing here is kind of like a
classic Brown tone look more of a look
with some some pinky undertones almost
and then an olive look which this one I
haven't experimented with yet moonstone
and nightfever look like really great
olive colors but one of the shades I
love so much already is Eclipse which
has a bit of Burgundy in it and I also
love a cocoa star which is a nice matte
brown glad they have that matte shade in
there they also have a matte highlight
at all of their on my middle finger um
you know just so pretty this palette is
one that I'm loving right now I know I
mentioned in my nude eye palettes video
that one from Physicians Formula and I
have it here this is the the new
is one and they also have a set of nude
eyes liners which are pretty cool so
you've got like three kind of neutral
eye like one is black one is kind of
like a dark grayish Brown and one is
called champagne it's this pretty light
shade these are really long wearing from
what I can tell so far they last a long
time and that's a great thing because I
like that you don't have to sharpen them
and the color variety is better than
Maybelline master drama which is you
know the one that I kind of point people
to because I'm like it lasts a long time
and you don't have to sharpen it now I'm
thinking these go on super smooth and
you don't have to sharpen them and they
come in a lot of colors and anyway these
came in a three pack I like that
lightest shade as kind of like an
under-eye smudgy lighter color and then
you've got kind of like a brownish and a
black to play with so so far so good
where those are concerned again you saw
this in the tutorial covergirl 24 hour
line blast this liquid liner this is
black just comes out like a felt tip pen
here really nice nice dark black color
dries to a matte finish the my concern
has always been with liner pen liners
like this is that they can sometimes dry
up too quickly I've had this for maybe
three weeks now so so far I mean it's
still very very saturated it's got a lot
of juice in there still but I'll let you
know like if that changes if I feel like
it is dry it out too soon or something
but right now I really really like this
and I wouldn't call it waterproof and I
don't think they label it as being
waterproof but it does last a good long
while and I haven't had any issues with
it smearing on me or anything like that
for our lash blast I find this to be
just like regular lash blast only it's a
huge pain to take off it is not fun to
take this thing off and I lost several
lashes in the process same big ol lash
blast brush there but like I said I
don't have much issue with lash blast
original smudging on me I mean I think
that's one of the better smudge free non
waterproof mascaras that's out there but
this one that's throughout the 24 hour
on it it might
we'll be waterproof because I took a
shower and had a heck of a time getting
it off and even with eye makeup remover
it was a bit of a struggle atomic lash
from Sephora maximum Volume Mascara more
than being volumizing I find this to be
very lengthening and it's a rubber brush
style here and it's just kind of classic
it's got kind of a big brush but really
like a lot of little combs I get that
comb feel with this a lot all of them
are super closely packed I mean some
rows are but some aren't and so I like
it so far pleasantly surprised with that
also picked up something I've heard a
lot of people mentioning lately that
they love prestige my blackest lashes
intense black volume mascara so I just
thought hey why not if everybody's
loving it maybe I'll love it too
so I still need to use this it has a
brush that's nice and thick this is more
of the brush I would gravitate toward
than those rubber brush ones typically
um like a nice thickening brush it
appears there are some little fibers in
this maybe to get the lashes some added
length I'm not positive though but yeah
I'll be trying that one for you so that
sums it up I feel like I've been talking
forever but this is my biggest haul ever
so I hope you liked it I hope you're
interested to hear more about some of
these products all of them I mean I did
give a little sneak peek on in my latest
video which was the Valentine's
tutorials so you can see a few of these
different things in action there if you
check that out so thank you so much for
watching look for more blogs and videos
and reviews and all that kind of things
still to come so thanks again guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
