all about matte eyeshadows so those
shadows that contain no sparkle glitter
pearl shimmer anything like that they
can create a nice contrast with shimmery
shades they can also look beautiful worn
alone eyes shadow as can often have even
more intensity than some shimmery ones
do because you're just seeing all
pigment and no mixture of glittery parts
and this and I get questions from people
who are you know starting to get some
wrinkling around the eye area and really
matte shadows if you're going to use
some eye shadow matte colors don't
attract as much attention to wrinkles as
shimmery ones can so I think they're
important to have and also I'm focusing
on drugstore because I just feel like
matte shadows are more prevalent and
high-end makeup I feel like they're
easier to come across I mean I just
think about you know okay what high-end
ones do I like well I've got Urban Decay
Too Faced tart Smashbox Mally you know
I've got all these different high-end
brands that I can point to and say they
make a good matte eyeshadow they're not
very hard to find but in the drugstore
it's like someone will ask me what are
your favorite drugstore matte shadows
and I'm like I really gotta think cuz I
can't just necessarily point someone
toward one brand or one line of Shadows
because they're very hard to come I
haven't tried everything I've heard a
lot of makeup but there's a lot out
there that I have not tried so if you
know of some great matte eyeshadows
after you see what I talked about you
see what I've left out I mean feel free
to share those in the comments section
first thing is from L'Oreal hip and they
actually have a specific line of matte
shadow duos so they look like this
you're getting two shades together this
one that I have is called dashing and
it's where I got it because I thought it
was really big really nicely pigmented
and I liked the L'Oreal hip just the
other duos as well you will find
scattered throughout their line there
will be some duos where there's a nice
matte color paired with a shimmery shade
so if you want to do a little more
digging in that whole collection you
might find there's this duo in
that is Matt Brown and Matt magenta one
of those half-and-half this is showy and
you can see a great matte blue but then
a shimmery turquoise there also with
Rimmel they've got some of their glam
eyes singles that are really really nice
dusk is one that I enjoy and it's like a
nice matte brown and also a matte black
shade called jet black I don't feel like
it's the darkest black I feel like it's
actually more accurately just a very
dark charcoal gray or matte shades that
I also think are really soft easy to
work with easy to blend which is
important with Matt colors I feel like
they can be a little less forgiving if
you're not really getting them blended
out so you need something that's gonna
be kind of soft and easy to work you it
may also find in the covergirl singles a
few matte shades here and there there
have been something I've gone through
and don't continue to have in my
collection but one that I currently have
and I think is really great a great just
kind of essential basic shade is this
one in brown smolder it's a single
you're getting a lot of product in there
and it is just a really nice matte Brown
very deep but it can be that great
contour shade that great smudgy liner in
terms of covergirl quads you're not
gonna find like purely matte quads I
looked at all of mine and I found at
least a little shimmer in some of the
shades I really couldn't consider them
totally Mannix is another brand to look
to for a lot of color variety they have
their singles they have different
palette I find their shadows really
great to work with a little bit goes a
long way sometimes you tap into some of
the shadows and they get a little powder
it all in all if you use them kind of
lightly I think they're they're fine and
I think they have put off a lot of color
and again a lot of color variety of
palettes that you can look to but naked
eyes tell it is nice I would say about
um seven of these shades I think are
matte there's 15 colors totaling like
you know matte cream shades medium
shades there's a deeper Brown and a
black I wanted to point that out because
I think sometimes palettes like this can
be a better value than just buying a
bunch of singles anyway I mention
wet-and-wild although I don't want you
to get frustrated I'm not sure how much
of this is still available in your
stores I know they put out and I love
matte palette I think it was only in
Walgreens stores I haven't like made a
point to check and see if it's still out
in my store but this is an entirely
matte palette for matte neutrals format
um well I guess three matte colors in a
light shade there at the top but I mean
no shimmer and these whatsoever have the
great quality that I now have come to
expect from wet and wild shadows but
again I wish I wish they made something
like that permanent I'm fearing that not
a lot of people are going to be able to
find that but I wanted to give it a
mention in case maybe there is somewhere
that you can find that if you search on
long thing that I believe is a
discontinued wet and wild thing but
there may be some lingering calots still
in your story are the six color palettes
and half of these will be met so like
this is vanity you've got half shimmer
half matte this is the plum II colored
one called
lust I believe yeah half is met here and
there and some other palettes I know
there's a great black in the blue had me
at hello palette but they're just not as
easy to come by as the shimmery shades
are and I wish that could change I guess
what you can gather from this video is
it's not easy to find a lot of matte
shadows in the drugstore and there are
still more in my collection that I I
have but then I don't necessarily think
they're the best or something I could
recommend because the color payoff isn't
good or they're really dry and chalky
and hard to blend and different factors
like that so what I told you about was
what I would recommend to you not simply
what exists but what I actually like I
don't own just a ton of colorful matte
to drugstore shadows but there may be
more out there in some of the lines that
I mentioned so just something to look I
know this doesn't necessarily qualify in
this video because these palettes don't
come from the drugstore but Coastal
Scents has a ton of palettes
and a lot of matte shadows if you're
looking to really stock up the prices
are pretty good I mean you're talking
between 2025 bucks for a pallet with 88
shades or you know just different
variations they have some deals where
you can get like a bundle of pallets
like two pallets and they take down the
price a little you have a forty two
color double stack pallet that has this
whole tray here of matte eyeshadows and
then you've got not only that but a
bunch of blushes and 36 smoky palette
that I've mentioned numerous times is
probably about half matte shadows and
half shimmer and then we're neutrals are
concerned the 88 warm palette is just
wonderful there's a lot of matte there's
also shimmer but if you're looking for
matte neutral basics there's a lot there
too so I hope this video gave you at
least a few ideas of where to turn if
you're looking for matte shadows in the
drugstore I wish I could have given even
more recommendations but the fact of the
matter is there's just not a whole lot
out there there are vastly more shimmery
shades in the drugstore than there are
matte I would imagine maybe with not
adding a lot of fillers and glitters and
things like that maybe it's more
expensive to produce these matte shades
but whatever the case may be this is
what we've got for now right - your
favorite makeup company and ask them to
make some more matte shades I guess but
thanks for watching guys and I'll see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
