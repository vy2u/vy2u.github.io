done a video that is just an eye
tutorial I've been doing a lot of the
one brand looks and I'm still going to
be doing those but this one is actually
a video I've been wanting to make for
you for a while and it's my everyday
smokey eyes so I feel like a lot of
people here smokey eye and they think oh
that's got to be nighttime or that's got
to be you know for this certain occasion
or it has to be dramatic or really
really dark and I mean I think when I
think smokey eye now with the way I've
been doing it lately I think soft
wearable can be used with lots of
different colors if you wanted to so I
hope that's what you take from this look
and it's quick it's not overly fussed
over I mean it's just very simple and
I'm going to be using a fun palette
which as you can see has a lot of nice
shades in it but maybe not a lot of
shades that you think of as typical
smokey eye colors we're actually going
to be using the bronze and the plum for
this and as you watch this I want you to
think about even if you don't have this
palette what could you sub in for those
shady ol blues and you know smokey
burgundy and dark green and different
things like that's something about that
dark and about that medium toned and you
will definitely be able to work with
this look so I hope you'll like it and
keep on watching
set of shades is hope model and we're
going to be going between this pretty
bronzed and the plum so to start off I'm
going to take this for the sparkly
bronze I'm just gonna use a flat
eyeshadow brush and just tap into that
and go all over my lid just a little bit
of that bronze on a fluffier crease
brush we're just gonna take that up
through the crease a little bit more so
we're just pulling the shadow up we're
not doing any drastic outer-v then I'm
going to use that same shade with a
pencil brush and just take this right
under the eye I'm going all the way in
not jut not right around the tear duct
but just almost there for the tear duct
I'm actually going to just take the
lightest shade in here just happens to
be kind of a pearly pink and just tap my
pinky finger in there so there's a
little product on my finger and then
just tap it right on my tear duct it's
the perfect amount a little highlight
there and then you can just kind of take
your pencil brush and blend out the
edges of that next we're going to start
working with this pretty plum shade and
that's just a gorgeous shade these both
have some shimmer to them but I'm just
going to get a little bit of that on my
fluffy brush and just start taking that
in the crease so we're layering it over
this bronzing shade and it's just gonna
have sort of a softer smoky effect you
with that plum is just lots of lots of
blending around the edges and I'm just
taking some of that plum with a pencil
brush about halfway in on the lower lash
line and if you want to just create even
more contrast you can get a little more
also just on the outer part of your lid
this kind of brush gives you a lot of
control to do that for a really soft
highlight just taking that light pink
here with a separate brush and any kind
of brush will do and I'm just lightly
dusting that here so we're gonna work
with some liner I'm using my NYX
slide-on liner in jet black and this is
just going to be our upper lash line
eyeliner so I'm gonna be getting it
right here in the inner corner then I'm
gonna put this liner in my inner rim
I'm gonna be using a purple shade this
is the NYX slide-on liner in purple
blaze and so with this we're just
staying on the natural lash line and
just kind of blending it in right
between the lashes and overlapping that
bronze and it's giving just a really
pretty look then I'm just gonna curl my
lashes and because I want to really like
fanned out look to my lashes I'm using
my telescopic explosion carbon blank
mascara and it has a little applicator
like this so you can really direct your
lashes right where you want them and I
kind of like the look of just the lashes
really encompassing the entire eye so
here you can kind of pull it out at the
edges and really get around to all the
lower lashes as well so there's the
finished look and as you can see it's
just you know it is smoky because it is
nice and deep right around the you know
exact perimeter of the eye and then it
just kind of fades out and it again
doesn't look like something you've put
tons and tons of work into it just kind
of looks like hey you naturally have a
great looking either this is a look I do
on almost a daily basis but I love
switching up different colors really
makes it different from I think what I
used to do is that I'm doing a lot more
with smudging shadows on my lower lash
line as opposed to just doing a harsh
line right there on the lower lash line
but still kind of bringing in some depth
by using a deep rich black right there
on the water my cheeks I went with
something that was just a really soft
blush for me and it was elf studio blush
and candid coral her lips I went with my
revlon colorburst lipstick in petal
talked about this in a haul recently but
it's just a gorgeous kind of peach shade
and then I lined the lips for a little
definition with my Rimmel exaggerate lip
liner in epic and this is just a little
bit deeper neutral so that just gave me
a little extra definition around the
border and the corners and
then I used my elf super glossy lip
shine in goddess just for a little pop
of shine right there on the bottom so
thank you again so much for watching
hope this was helpful to you and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
