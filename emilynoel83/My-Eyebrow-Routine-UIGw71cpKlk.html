about how I do my eyebrows what my
routine is with that so I thought I
would just do a video here to show you
what I do but i do want to start out by
saying that everybody's eyebrows are
different and I mean everybody has a
different way that they naturally grow
in or a different shape so if you have
never had anything done to your eyebrows
never you know had them plucked or waxed
or anything before you may want to
consult like a professional that offers
those services to just kind of make sure
you're going to be on the right track
with that because um I really once I
start if I started advising somebody on
a shape I mean it's never ending I mean
certain people look better with thick or
thinner lashes and it's just really a
matter of individual basis so if you are
planning something drastic if you want
to um I guess you know see what a new
eyebrow look would be like on you then
you probably should talk to somebody
about that because it really does make a
huge difference in the way your entire
face looks as to how your eyebrows look
so um for me I remember the first time I
ever had anything done to my eyebrows I
had them waxed and that was probably
back in early on in high school maybe
junior high maternal but um and because
my brows want to be naturally very very
thick and so I have never had them waxed
again I've honestly it's just been
upkeep really I never let them um like
grow in a whole lot before I pluck them
because I I mean I tweeze them every
single day and so what I use for that is
just this little pair of tweezers and
that's something you can get from pretty
much any drug store and basically like
after like before I do my makeup after I
moisturize and stuff like that I just
get up close to me
here and find any stray hairs and you're
going to make it a lot easier on
yourself if you do just keep it to a
matter of upkeep because then you never
really have to worry if your shapes
getting out of hand you can just see
when new little hairs are coming in and
take care of it that way another good
idea if you are going to start tweezing
yourself and working with the shape of
your eyebrow it can be good to take like
a white pencil and actually draw over
some of the area you plan to tweeze out
and that can sometimes give you a little
bit of our idea how it's going to look
and also keep you on track so you don't
over tweeze so that's that's a tip there
and you're always going to be one watch
for oh I can't you're always going to be
wanting to watch for your natural arch
not create an arch that isn't really
there because you can run into some
problems but anyway as for me just to
let you know i would tweeze um just any
strays and then i actually have it's
already done now but i actually have a
little scar right here in my eyebrow and
so i fill that in and it's that's the
only filling and i do i don't use an
eyebrow pencil because like I said my
eyebrows really are pretty dense um
there's at least right at this point in
my life I'm not doing any major filling
in just because of the full scar and
what I use is um this L'Oreal I shadow
actually it's a really matte brown and
it's broken as you can see but it's
where infinite in deep mocha and it just
looks like this and i would recommend if
you are going to fill in your brows
there's a lot of good pencils out there
but um I just like this powder because
it matches like my hair color really
well and it's just really quick to do
and it's just such a small spot that I
have but I just used a little applicator
and dip it in there and
then my spot is like right about here so
I would go over that and I don't have
issues really with that thing and it's
not like a huge deal but that's just one
other thing I do and then when I'm
getting ready to set my eyebrows and
make them stay put which is very
important because mine can want to get
out of control a lot and what I would
first do is take a clear mascara and I
like elfs which is this wet lash and
brow clear mascara or cover girls and
just use the tool use the little brush
and brush your lashes straight up with
it ok so just brush them straight up and
then put it away don't try to use that
brush just like get your lasted lashes
shape or lashes I keep going and washes
it's um eyebrows but don't use that
because you're doing it too much product
on it too much gel take a separate brush
and comb them up once again I'll pick up
any excess excess gel I guess and then
just Pat them down in the direction
basically in the direction the hair it
wants to grow and then down on either
side and sometimes it helps to put a
finger where you're the highest part of
your arches and there you go and then
just do the same on the other side pat
down the direction it goes use your
finger or something to go around your
arch and there we are there's eyebrows
so I think that's just if that gives you
an idea of like what I do to take care
of my eyebrows I hope that helps but
like I said everybody use eyebrows are
different everybody's got a different
thing going on that they need to work
with and like i said if you've never
looked into this before a good idea
might be too and see like look through
magazines see whose ID
l-shape look similar to yours and you
know talk to a professional that does
this kind of thing about you know what
they can do for you and then as after
you get that initial tweeze or shaping
done and then upkeep can be really easy
but you do have to do it almost daily
and trust me after you do it for a while
it really does not hurt anymore so um
anyway thank you guys for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
