video for so long and maybe now that
it's back-to-school time it made me
think about it again books specifically
beauty books and I have some definite
favourites in my collection my book
collection in terms of beauty books has
actually grown quite a bit lately and I
really just enjoy reading them I find
that they're the kind of book that I
might read through cover to cover first
and then I'll keep going back to it for
ideas and inspiration and just you know
help on certain things and I just think
a book is great it's nice to just have
you know that physical book that you can
grab as good nice as YouTube videos are
and as entertaining as they are an
old-school book is really fun and I feel
like you also get just total
comprehensive information about a
certain makeup artists their style and
it's just nice to always be in that
state of learning you know always taking
in something new I think even if you're
a pro it's got to be interesting to see
what makes another makeup art stick and
kind of what their special techniques
are so I thought I'd share with you my
four top favorites I'm not gonna get too
detailed on each just give some overall
thoughts on why I like each one and who
they might be best for and the first one
is really probably pretty good for
anyone across the board it's the Bobbie
Brown makeup manual this is probably one
of my most loaned out beauty books that
I have I've loaned it to friends that
loaned it to my mom and it really takes
you from beginner to pro in terms of
makeup techniques advice also sort of
the the why behind certain things in
makeup and skincare and things like that
I mean a lot of things I think we just
do because we've always done them but
she kind of gets into you know why a
good nutrition actually impacts your
skin tons of good basic info like that
also selecting shades there's a lot of
great color information and a lot of
great pictures to back at all us a lot
of basic step-by-step not necessarily a
ton of before-and-after in here but you
see the process in picture form which I
like with a lot of different basic steps
feel like well in the makeup industry
Bobbie Brown is known for you know great
natural looking you know makeup that
really looks like a turn person instead
of you know looking completely made-up
she does have a full section on makeup
artistry and advanced makeup
applications that really let you see
what she's capable of and what kinds of
more unique things she's done but if you
are makeup artist or you just start
totally infatuated with all things
makeup like I am developing and stocking
a professional makeup kit she takes you
through everything kind of like a
checklist of things you should have in
your makeup kit and just doing makeup
for all sorts of settings whether that's
magazines or television this is just one
of the books that I've come back to time
and time again I have like three other
Bobbi Brown books like the teenage
makeup and beauty rules and just Bobby
Brown beauty and this is the one that I
think has the most packed into its book
it's called make up is art and it was
fittingly given to me by my artist
sister Kelly aka pup and she got this
for me for Christmas and this is just
full of gorgeous pictures and really
just creative creative makeup lots of
great inspiration in here and you're
gonna see some totally unique
application ideas if you're a makeup
lover and you're gonna be fascinated by
some of these looks whether or not you
would actually wear them out of the
house is just really cool to kind of
look through and appreciate the
creativity the photography and this book
is actually by the Academy of freelance
makeup you're gonna get some different
product suggestions actually in this but
you don't see looks in progress and
photos from beginning to end you do get
some step-by-step you know how to do
certain things how do you add green
feathered lashes you'll find out if you
are professional makeup artist I think
you're gonna have so much fun with this
because they do talk about like
underwater photography and what it's
like to collaborate with other people
and what different tools you need and
how to apply all those crazy little
things do a face that aren't just you
know lipstick and eyeliner I think it's
really really fascinating and I think
it'll take your coffee table up a notch
for sure if you grab this and get it on
there other iconic makeup artist Kevin
uh Kwan has a book called making faces
and I believe
this was the first beauty book I ever
got this is filled with fantastic
before-and-after shots and it also has a
lot of makeup kind of through the ages
you're going to see some really classic
makeup 'la Marilyn Monroe looked to the
1920s flapper to just different iconic
looks that we know of that we can
totally identify they're not
step-by-step photographed there are
little sketches that take you through
the whole thing and I kind of like how
his looks are put together practically
like a like a recipe because he goes
through and he'll list out all the
products you need and then he'll tell
you how to use them just like you're
gonna cook a meal you know it's gonna be
some people you see in here celebrities
that you're very familiar with and
people you don't know but he does go
through some nice basics in the start
and there's some great pictures there
and then I look back at this book a lot
not just for reference for myself just
to pick up new tricks and stuff but also
just to be entertained by the sheer
beauty in these pictures and the
wonderful ways he has captured you know
an entire era in a makeup look I love
that and what I'm currently reading I am
loving so much it's by Scott Barnes and
it's called about-face and this is
really probably my favorite when it
comes to the before and after show you
are one who loves to see a total
transformation happen I think he does a
great job of not only showing you the
before and the after but actual
photographs that take you through the
whole process so you can really get a
feel for okay this makeup product did
that to her skin or you know this is how
he applied this or that it's so used to
get seeing that kind of information in
video form that you know when you look
at it in a book you got to think oh
that's challenging to show a whole
process all the time but he really does
it well a lot of basics addressed in the
beginning and he still manages to kind
of tell you about those things while
showing again more before-and-afters
more wonderful exam as visual as makeup
is those those examples that we can
actually see and remember are great and
I also like how when he's doing the
makeovers on different
you see a little interview happening in
the sidebar and it kind of makes you
imagine like you're just sitting in the
room while he's talking to this person
doing their makeup you know talking
about different things about their
makeup routine or whatever like the
looks in this book the best I mean if I
were looking for some looks that I'm
really gonna put on myself and really
have a lot of take away from this book
it's just great probably my pick for
great before and afters Kevin a Kwan's
making faces great for seeing classic
makeup looks through the ages makeup is
art is again gonna be that one for those
of you who want crazy creative makeup
ideas and just a real feel for what it
may be like in the industry the
different scenarios you may be in as a
makeup artist and then one I really feel
everybody no matter who you are can take
something from it's probably the Bobby
Brown makeup manual very easy to read
but not dumped down at all if you know
what I think those are some of my
favorite beauty books I find that
there's not a long car trip that I go on
that I don't toss one of these in there
just to get some new ideas get some
fresh kind of inspirations so if you
have any ideas for me any great beauty
books that you love and definitely let
me and the rest of us know and have a
great day see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
