me for this video it's been such a crazy
crazy week here probably heard on your
national news we had on Wednesday early
Wednesday morning a tornado rolled
through about 30 minutes from where I
live for it killed six people just tons
of devastation hundreds of homes
destroyed there and we reported on that
we were like live on the air our morning
show went for seven straight hours no
commercials just you know following all
the updates that were coming from this
because the situation was really like
unfolding as we were on live on the air
and then just in the past day I know
more storms popped up from like Indiana
to Alabama you know everywhere in
between more deadly tornadoes and I just
want to say you know I really am feeling
for those of you who are affected by the
lots of people were asking me if my home
was okay if I was okay and I am and
everything's fine here right here but
like I said this tornado that hit
Wednesday was just really um very close
to home literally so um I just want to
thank you for thinking about me and
caring about me as Emily the person not
just Emily the makeup girl asked a lot
about it on my Facebook page and my
Twitter so if you've been wondering if
you haven't gotten the full story what
all this happened that is that's what's
been going on I want to support tornado
victims definitely contact the Red Cross
because they are you know one of the key
organizations that responds to to those
who have been affected to the victims
who have lost everything they have I
just want to sincerely thank all of you
for your concern and just caring about
this because a lot of wives have been
affected by these storms as for the
makeup related side of this video um I
am going to be talking about blush
actually and this is something I
remember when I did my Emily Awards I
gave like a couple of favorite blush
brands
and that was just a couple months ago
and I felt like at that time I had so
much more to talk about you know there's
so many colors there's so many finishes
you know and so it's hard to really sum
up favorites you know when you just
start talking about one or two brands so
I thought I would go through the blushes
I really like and their varying brands
price ranges colors forms everything and
start off talking about some pink
blushes and one that I really really
like is from hard candy and it is the
baked blush and living doll I know I've
talked about this before and this
actually like if yours if you were to
swatch it it comes off as a pretty light
pink with a little bit of shimmer but
this is one of the few light Pink's that
I feel like really looks good on you
know a medium skin tone I feel like
sometimes really light matte pinks can
look a little strange but this one has a
bit of a glow to it and I think it looks
very fresh and usually when I use this I
won't use to highlight because like I
said it does have just that little bit
of luminosity and then for a little bit
brighter pink I'm a big fan of Dali mix
from Mac and you're probably looking at
this thinking oh my gosh that's just
insane but this is a sheer tone blush so
you don't get as much of an impact as
you see here in the packaging it comes
off you know just a little bit more a
little bit less intense but it's really
really pretty and this if I'm looking
for pink if I know I'm going with like a
pink lip and I want to coordinate my
blush and kind of create harmony in the
face and this is a really great one to
go we're not a lot of shimmer in this
one I mean it's not a totally matte
finish but there's not much shimmer
either it's really hard to detect so I
enjoy that pink I want to tell you now
about a super pigmented blush and you're
probably going to think this is how much
is this going to cost you know is it
going to be super high-end it's wet and
wild it is the color icon blush and
Heather silk and this is basically a
matte blush it's kind of like a plummy
color I feel this reminds me a lot this
is almost an exact dupe for me of NYX
mocha so I have that blush as well I
love that one too this one probably
get off just a little more color even so
a tiny bit goes a long way but it is a
very fresh pink look even if you have
light skin I think you can use this in a
very subtle way and still get a nice
pink look and if you you don't want
shimmer on your cheeks if you don't want
to attract any attention to large pores
thing like things like that you know a
matte blush can be a good thing to use
and this one from wet and wild is
probably one of my top picks from that
brand also really like the elf blushes
and I feel like they pack a punch I
don't feel like you have to use a lot to
get the color you want I have used I
have several colors that I enjoy but the
one that has probably been the most
unique kind of like I don't really have
anything like this in my collection and
if this is for you know we talked about
pinky and ma vie kind of looks on the
cheeks but how about something like that
really nice rosy flush something I love
using alongside a red lip and this is
blushing rose and if you look closely um
this one has just oh it a car just drove
by really bad it reflected but it's got
just a little bit of like golden e and
she also want to mention a couple of
like deeper tone blushes that I will use
as a contour of them is covergirl
cheekers which there are multiple
covergirl cheekers shades that I like
but this one is Sierra sands and it's
kind of like a I don't know satin finish
or practically a matte finish but it's
just like a deep bronze e-type color and
it makes a nice contour I've used that a
lot as a cheek contour never random
blushes that you know I'm just wild
about are the Milani baked blush --is
but a shade that I really hadn't
discovered until just recently it's
called Terra Sol so glad I found this
one um this is just lovely it's here
i've swatched too many things on that
finger way it's right here okay this is
pretty warm it can be like an apple of
the cheek type color or this makes a
wonderful contour too because it's not
it's it's really mad I mean I think
you're seeing from the domed effect
you're thinking is that pearly it's no
it
it's pretty much like a matte blush and
it's kind of like a little bit of a
terra cotta type color but it's light
enough to be workable and it can also be
like a contour so Milani baked blush is
wonderful wonderful thing another Milani
baked blush that I'm wearing now and
I've actually layered it with a product
I'll tell you about in a moment but it's
coralina this is probably one of my
favorite Milani baked blush is because
it is true coral it it is not what I
would call peachy pink it is peach coral
it's really incorporating those orangie
tones which I think are really fresh and
I've got that on right now but like I
said I layered it over something and now
we're going to get into some kind of
different blush forms but I'm so glad I
bought this from benefit it's the
cha-cha tint and it is a mango tinted
lip and cheek stain that's the
description they gave but this is the
color it looks like there and then you
know you put a few dots on your cheek
don't wait blend them out immediately
and you get a really pretty coral e glow
so I put that actually under this
because once you blend it in you know
you've got the color but because it's a
stain you know it's not looking
especially glowy absolutely dries 100%
and I layered it with the coral with
that coral a and a blush and I just love
that love it you can use this on your
lips to which I used it on my lips gave
it a great
Coralie look and then over the top of
that I put my Baby Lips in it's the
cherry one and I just got this smells
amazing too but I think it brings out
you know that that kind of brighter
really really a fan of the cha-cha tint
I think it's a fun color I think it's a
great season to try it out we don't have
to layer stuff over it but because I'm
just like that I like to mix stuff I
like to layer stuff so I I do but you
don't have cream blush that I also also
like and if we're talking pop of color
is the Hot Tamale a bouncy blush and
I've heard a lot of people saying like
oh the bouncy blushes don't have enough
color and I will tell you the lighter
shades I've got a lighter shade or two
and they
got this like silly putty or something
but the lighter shades can be really
light and I understand if you know
they're not showing up well they're
pretty light this though this is a punk
not where that concentrated but this is
the type of color we're talking about
and then you blend it out and you're
getting you know pretty pinky coral on
the cheeks that's what that kind of
translates to blends to a smooth finish
it doesn't blend and stay tacky I have a
fan of a lot of the Mallee blushes I
like just the regular blushes she has
her heir bred effortless airbrush
collection but something really great
that she's done and you may find this in
a kit remember I talked about the kits
you should look for to really save money
if you're looking at QVC stuff but this
is the like the 24/7 professional blush
so you've got a cream and a powder so
for long wear I mean that's a great
strategy to take that cream blush like
you might take the dream bouncy blush
and then put a powder over it and it
really seems to lock things in she's got
lots of great shades this is kind of
like a mauve cream blush and then a
really pretty pink that I think is
almost exactly like Mally's glow which
is an individual blush that I like but
this is just a great concept I think
having them together being able to wear
one or the other if you want or wear
them together and I've worn them
together a lot for work and I just feel
like you know nope no issues with
staying power whatsoever so that wraps
up my favorite blushes I feel like there
are other blushes I maybe could have
mentioned too but I try if at all
possible not to talk about discontinued
stuff that's the thing that's so
frustrating about makeup is like you you
find something you love and it gets
discontinued I'm sure we've all been
there a lot of people will probably ask
me if I've tried a NARS blush sorry I
have it I'm not saying I never will but
I just haven't yet I'm very happy though
with the blushes that I've mentioned
they are total total favorites and I
feel like you know anything I'm in the
mood for I can find in that bunch that
I've just talked about so thanks a lot
for watching guys have a great day and
I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
