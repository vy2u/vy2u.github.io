having a good day it's really really
dreary where I'm at right now it's just
been so rainy outside and it just feels
like it's been kind of a long day so
I've been pretty tired but I still
really wanted to do this video for you
because I get some questions about
different categories of brushes like you
know what's a really good crease brush
or what's a really good concealer brush
or whatever and so I thought why not do
a video at this point I feel like I've
tried a lot of different brushes and I
thought it would be fun to just
highlight some of my favorites and I'm
just going to do eyes in this video and
then maybe I'll go back and do like face
brushes and another one but just to run
you through some brushes from different
brands that I think are really really
good so the first one I'm going to talk
about is the elf eyeshadow brush and
this is one of the one dollar brushes on
either eyes lips face calm or dollar
general stores are selling these now or
maybe you'll find it in your target
store and but this is a really nice
brush in that it can pack on a lot of
color the bristles on our kind of
tapered here you can see they're a
little bit shorter on the sides there
than they are right in the middle so
it's very good for picking up color on
your product and i like to use it to
pack a shade all over my eyelid it's not
too big it's not too wide like some
other ones i've tried of this type so
it's also for being one dollar i mean
it's it's very well put together the
ferrule this you know silvery part of
the brush really stays firmly attached
to the actual handle of the brush and
it's just a good one to have in your
collection for only one dollar I would
totally encourage you to pick this up
with your next elf order or if you see
it in a store go ahead and snatch it up
maybe by two you know you can have a
backup or you can give it to a friend or
something because this is just a good
all-around I shadow brush it can also
have a little bit of a dual purpose if
you wanted to instead of putting packing
your shadow on like this you could kind
of flip it over and kind of use it to I
don't know if you can see what I'm doing
here but kind of put a deeper shade
right in the crease like that so you
know it's up to you but this is a really
really good
shadow brush the next three that I'm
going to mention are my favorite eye
brushes from sigma i have the full brush
set I like all the brushes that are in
it but these are my favorite for eyes
the first one I want to mention is the
SS 252 and this is kind of just a flat
and I guess these are sometimes referred
to as shader brushes if you look at the
difference between this and the elf this
one is a little bit flatter and while
this one really packs on a lot of color
this one has more of a defined you know
flatter tips so I like to use that to
once again this is even better for
getting right there in the crease
putting color there but also kind of
pulling that color out just a little bit
obviously I'm using these brushes bear
but I'm just kind of showing you the
method to use it it's also can be nice
to really get you know defined color
like right there around on your lower
lash line this one is going to be a
little thicker at the tip as you can see
and this one comes to a little bit more
of a point like that okay so that's one
of the really good statement once the SS
252 another great one for blending is
the SS 224 so this is kind of one of
those domed more fluffy brushes that you
might use bear to kind of blend out you
know your outer V or maybe you want to
put some color on there like a medium
kind of crew shade for a nice wash of
color you know not to define but getting
the color right there in the crease and
then blending it out very flawlessly
Sigma brushes are very very soft very
dense and just extremely high quality so
i really really like these these are
often compared to Mac and the numbers
correspond with the numbers of mac
brushes now don't ask me exactly you
know how they compare because i don't
have mac brushes but um I think you will
find from a lot of the reviews I've
heard that these are superior quality
from Sigma the third Sigma one I want to
mention is the SS 219 and this is what's
commonly referred to as a pencil brush
it comes to kind of a point there and
you may say this looks a lot like my and
so my essence of beauty crease brushes
think about in a moment but this is
actually much stiffer and it doesn't
make it better or worse but it just
makes it different you know you might
use it for a different purpose I like
using a stiff brush like this to go over
say you've put on lower liner whether
it's cream or powder or whatever and you
can really get this fine tip of that
brush underneath there and practically
just you know use it to smudge out
whether it's your upper lash line your
lower lash line this can also get color
right in the crease and if you can kind
of you know pull color out from the
corner of your eye defining out or V and
then use a fluffier brush to blend it
out that is another function of that
brush that I like a lot now to a couple
of brushes one in particular that I
think I just it's absolutely
irreplaceable in my collection I have
found nothing that can do exactly what
this brush can do and I've tried a lot
of brushes from a lot of different
brands but these brushes come in a set
from their available at CVS the brand is
essence of beauty and they are the
crease brushes one is a crease brush
right here and the other is a fine
crease brush okay the fine crease crease
brush is my big favorite out of the duo
I use this almost every time I do my eye
makeup it's spectacular for creating an
outer V unlike the Sigma one you're
going to notice here it's not quite as
stiff okay like if I were to press these
both sideways see how this one is
getting a lot more flexibility in it
this one's a little more stiff and and
that flexibility is just enough to allow
you to get a really nice circular motion
going when you do your outer V and by
outer V I mean kind of you know if I had
a dark shadow here I would be kind of
going up from the outer corner and over
here and then kind of using this in that
circular motion to really blend out that
color for a small size brush to really
be able to blend that well it's really
impressive so essence of beauty fine
crease brush is fantastic and then the
regular crease brush you can see the
size difference here
this regular sized one is nice for just
laying down the color in your crease um
it's it's going to give you if you
compare that your size differences
increase brushes here's like a fluffy
crease brush the Sigma when I showed the
medium and the very small so this one
can be nice you know if you're in a
hurry so you don't want to mess a whole
lot with the outer view but you want
that control that a smallish brush can
give you in your crease this is a great
size so this is a duo that is unbeatable
to pick up you're only going to spend
maybe around five or six dollars if that
for these two great brushes they're
wonderful quality i have not had to
repurchase these these two are the two
that I've had all along and they've
lasted me you know a really long time so
I love those and the next brush I want
to talk about is from Smashbox and there
are probably other brushes that are made
like this but I only have one from
Smashbox that came in a kit that I had a
while back so that's why I'm going to
talk about the Smashbox and it is the
number 21 brush it's an eyeliner brush
that is not an angled eyeliner brush but
it has that little bend in it and I
really like using this with any of my
gel or cream liners because that Ben
makes it so user friendly to kind of you
know like I can hold my arm up here and
really it's like it's pointing right
down at where that liner needs to go
saying goes for if you want to put it on
your lower lash line this it's amazing
with that tiny angle in that brush I
hope you can tell see that little bend
there it's amazing what that can do in
terms of the ease of application so I'm
not saying that other brands don't have
a great you know bent eyeliner brush
like this this is just what i have so if
you see this for a good value at a lower
price by all means you know smashbox
brushes are going to run you a little
bit more but that is just a great a
great quality for a brush so now in
terms of liner again i I wouldn't want
to only have a liner brush like this one
of those fine tipped you know brushes
like that I would want
an angled one as well I like my Coastal
Scents taklon liner brush so much
because it is the perfect sharp angle
there it's also not too flexible and
it's very fine if I turn it from side to
side it is not thick and you can see
even though I used this a whole lot the
bristles are not fraying out from that
shape one bit and what this is great for
in my opinion is to you can either a
apply shadow as your liner with a brush
like this or say you've already lined
with a cream pencil liner and you want
to go over it with a shadowed either
soften it up or pack on even more
intensity this is just terrific it is
such a fine I mean if you can see just
how how narrow that is you're going to
get such a precise line with this i love
that brush and many others seem to kind
of just fray out a little bit and even
you know having lived in my makeup bag
at one point in time or another it has
kept a very defined shape a couple more
brushes my last two these are both
Coastal Scents ones as well one is the C
2 15 angled brow brush so this is
another angled brush if you compare its
size wise to the one I just showed you
it is smaller the bristles are a little
more coarse and it's a little more stiff
so that's going to be very good for just
kind of filling in any area of your brow
I like to the reason why this works so
well for me is because I used like a
matte brown eyeshadow to fill in a
little area here and a little scar that
i actually have on this brow so this is
very good because it's just a nice
little stiff brush that can handle that
powder put it right where I want it and
just fill in very nicely very very cheap
we're talking about maybe two dollars
for that brush another hugely
inexpensive brush from Coastal Scents is
that mini contour brush here this tiny
little like it's called like a chisel
mini detail brush or something like that
i'll put the exact name in there but
this is a teensy brush if you
look at it compared to like my tear duct
area that's where I really like to use
this dip it in a shimmery shade and
highlight that tear ducts you have so
much control with this brush it's
fantastic even if you wanted to use it
to highlight which I sometimes do
highlight right in here take a bigger
brush buff it out and you will get just
a really really neat finish smaller
brushes you know there's a purpose for
brushes this big and there's a purpose
for brushes this size some you want you
know to use for great blending flawless
application you know just really getting
a nice buffed out appearance but then
you also want to have the control that a
small brush like even these essence of
beauty ones can give you so that's why
it's good to have variety in your
collection i hope this video gave you
some ideas of what some good brushes are
from different brands and even i'm not
saying you have to go out and buy these
exact brands of the specific brushes i
mentioned but this might help you keep
an eye out for different brushes when
you're out in the store and say you know
well this isn't the elf i shadow brush
but this looks pretty close and i know i
need a brush like this so i'm going to
pick it up that kind of thing so thank
you so much for tuning in for this video
everyone I hope you're having a good
week so far and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
