I mentioned in my recent best in beauty
video I've been thinking about doing a
NYX favorites video because this is just
a drugstore brand that I love so much
and many of you said you wanted to see
though grab yourself a snack settle in
this is gonna be kind of a long video
there are lots of things I like from
this line not only do these things stand
out among the other products in Nyx's
line but I also think these products
have really unique special things to
offer when you just look at makeup as a
whole I feel like these things are
really strong start out with lip
products cuz that's what's sitting right
here in front of me and first off a lip
liner that I really love from this line
is the retractable lip liners are creamy
they go on easily and they're really
long wearing and I've gotten like a set
of these off of HauteLook when NYX is
featured there they do a great like 5 or
6 lip liner set there and you can really
say three of the colors that I really
enjoy are nude pink which is a nice rich
creamy pink jewel which is a pink that's
got a little more shimmer it's a little
bit more of a mauve color and then red
because when you're doing a red lip it
really helps to have a nice red lip
liner and this is very long wearing and
then from just the other line of regular
pencils I don't find these to be quite
as long wearing but they're still super
creamy and there are some nice shades in
there a couple deeper shades actually
that I really like are mahogany which I
think works well with your more neutral
lip colors even if you've got like a
nude lip and you just want to make it a
little less you know stark and nude you
can put a little clothes on pull lip
liner on it and like I like to add that
in kind of pulling it inward from the
outside and it can make your lips
actually look a little fuller and it
seems to just put a nice finishing touch
on lighter colored lips and then one
that I love for all these great berry
plum lip colors this time of year is
just called plum talked about this in my
favorites really really nice plum
killeen ice creamy formula from NYX that
comes in a lot of colors are the round
lipstick shade tea rose I think is just
beautiful it's a really nice classic
pink color
it's so creamy it's so full-color and
formulas have some shimmer some like
this or just straight-up cream and they
all seem to give off a little bit of
shock probably my top top favorite
lipstick product from NYX are the matte
lipsticks I think that's really what
they do so well these are so full colors
such great staying power not super
drying on the lips and they've got just
amazing shade selection I really love
this color called Merlot and it's a
great berry also if you like a little
bit deeper red this shade called Alabama
I've recommended this to a lot of you
and you've tried it instead oh it's so
good and I'm really really happy that
you like you may actually find this to
be a little more wearable than some of
the really bright cherry red and the
shade sweet pink I think this is such a
pretty shade you kind of gotta have some
guts to wear this one it is so bright
and vivid and colorful but it's a
gorgeous shade of pink so a newer thing
in the line that I really really enjoy
are the butter lip balms I have a full
review on these and the two that I
really reach for the most are the
ladyfingers one which is a really pretty
pink and then the one called brownie
which is just a nice goes with anything
nutritive that low maintenance lip
product you don't really need a mirror
to put them on they do give off plenty
of color but it's not like near as
saturated as what um the matte lipstick
City they're also not super duper shiny
they don't have a slick or greasy if I
don't they feel pretty moisturizing
actually so I love though NYX makes an
amazing lip gloss called mega shine I
have talked about these for years loving
I think they're a great formula because
they're so colorful um they're really
shiny but not stick you'll hear me say
this probably a lot but just a great
color range a lot to choose from they
just have some beautiful shades in the
light colors and pinky tones just want
to give some specific ones a shout out
and beige pearl really pretty shimmery
color that looks nice kind of popped on
the center of your lower lip looks nice
topping off lots of different lipsticks
and other lip products you might be
wearing just a nice all-purpose light
color gloss to have the shade sweetheart
I have this one on now actually with
that lip liner and jewel that I
mentioned earlier so that gave it a
little bit more of this pinky tone and
then this gloss over the top gives it
that
curly pinky peach color I think that
one's gorgeous and very full color beige
why it's called beige we'll never know
but it's a really pretty creamy classic
pink color love that one can't go wrong
with that Cosmo is gorgeous this one has
the most beautiful shine I mean you can
see as the light kind of hits the
product there it really catches the
light it's got a little bit of shimmer
but yet it's kind of neutral as well
works with you know a lot of different
looks you might have going on on your
face and the shape perfect I'm so pretty
over your nude or pinky nude lip looks
um it is perfect it's a great color the
butter glosses you might say I'm crazy
but I haven't completely fallen in love
with this formula I just find myself
wishing it were a little more like the
mega shine I feel like some of the
lighter shades that I first got in these
go on a little bit streaky like the
formulas just a little bit thin you kind
of make tracks in your lips with that
doe foot applicator if you're not
careful
I feel like if the texture was a bit
thicker um they would be even better but
there is one particular shade that I
think just performs really well one in
tiramisu talked about a great neutral
lip slightly deeper than a nude lip I
think this is beautiful now for eyes mix
has tons of great eye products one of
the things that I really like from this
line that I ran out of and no longer
have to show you right now is the HD
eyeshadow prime now I told you guys in
the past that I can get away with using
the elf one dollar eyeprimer it just
seems to work on me my shadows last I
don't have creasing I also don't have
very oily eyelid but if that hasn't
worked for you and you want another
drugstore option to try
I think the NYX HD eye primer it's kind
the twists often it's got a little wand
I think that works really really well
some other great products from the line
are definitely the slide-on liners these
go on so smooth they're so so comparable
to the urban decay 24/7 liners they're
not retractable you do have to sharpen
them but they come in a great color
range so you know if you need a black a
brown those are great I thought I'd
mention some of the colors that are my
absolute favorites
one that I have snuck into my look today
is this purple called purple bleh I put
this on my lower lash line and topped it
with a little bit of glitter actually
but that's a gorgeous purple for green
lovers if you like kind of an emerald
type green the shade called tropical
green is very pretty been looking for a
true blue liner that's not like a navy
color the shade sunrise blue is very
pretty and then a really really unique
shade I don't think I have any other
liners that are like this it's like a
mauve colored liner and the shade is
called jewel and I'm actually kind of
excited to use this in conjunction with
my Urban Decay Naked 3 palette because I
feel like this color would be so
beautiful tied in with some of those
shades as well these glide on super
easily they have really great staying
power so I would totally recommend any
of these from this line these are just
some ideas also NYX has some really good
single eyeshadows and I was noticing on
their website like some of the ones that
I've talked about for a long time and
really enjoyed seem to not be available
any longer so I'm gonna stick to the
ones that first one is Aloha this is a
really pretty pearly finish I like that
it doesn't have glitter in it like one
of the other lighter on NIC shades that
I have I think it goes on super smooth
and just looks really pretty around your
inner corner highlight under your Brown
right matte basic from this line is
called dark brown I'm kind of a cool
brown definitely something that you
could easily put in your crease it's
very velvety I think it blends out super
easily so that's a nice option shade
called sensual is just gorgeous for a
pretty deep color I would call this like
a dark brownish plums have a little
shimmer to it I wouldn't call it super
metallic looking by any means on the
eyes but this could make a great smoky I
didn't really think about it before I
chose those but all three of those
shades would look really pretty together
to what I'm wearing for my shadow today
I love this palette I blogged about it
maybe not quite a year ago but it's a
great matte eyeshadow palette it's
called matte smokey look one night in
Morocco oh my gosh I'm so similar to the
Urban Decay Naked basics palette
actually it looks like this you've got a
nice little range there of eight matte
colors from black really deep Brown kind
of a medium brown several different
light colors to work with as well
comes with four lip colors and they're
in their own little separate drawer so
if you don't even want to touch those
you know they're out of your way
and then there's a base here as well
that I do use so I use these shades in
my look today I kind of stuck with this
top row basically and did a matte kind
of gray smokey type look and they're so
easy to use nice pigmentation they blend
well this is often on HauteLook I think
that's where I came up with mine I have
not seen this on Nyx's website in a
while but this is on cherry culture calm
if you want to check that as I just sit
here so many other like great eye
products for NYX are coming to mind and
just keep in mind as you watch this
video there are tons more things that I
really really like but I'm trying to
confine myself as I look at like the two
dozen lip products that are my favorites
sitting down there other little
eyeshadow picks here I don't know that
I've mentioned this one very much but
this is a great basic little trio
especially if you want to stay away from
tons of shimmer
it's called barefoot in the sand this is
kind of hard to describe because the
shades are pigmented but it will give
you almost a no eyeshadow look if that's
what you're going what I mean by that is
that this shade gives you such a natural
looking shadow in your crease it's
almost as if that's just the way your
eye naturally is and you didn't even put
eyeshadow the shades are super smooth
and they are pigmented but they just
give a natural effect there that's what
I'm trying to say the center shade you
might notice has a little bit of shimmer
but it's very soft I mean I really feel
like it still comes off matte on my lids
but talk about a great basic trio and
then if you like more browns if you like
the pinky shades oh my gosh I love love
this palette it's called let them eat
cake
it's from the love in Paris line so it
says love in Paris there and it's just
loaded with pretty neutrals I like the
peachy accents I like the pink colors
the deep Browns are beautiful you can do
a smoky eye with this palette you could
get a very very subtle natural look with
this palette I do think I could go on
and on still with eyeshadows those are
three of my top little palettes now for
face I do
mentioned the stay matte but not flat
liquid foundation I have that I like
that however as I've noticed more dry
patches on my skin like it's really
really cold here and I will get more dry
like around my mouth and my chin and
I've got to say I don't love the way
that comes off on my drier areas like if
I'm a little bit oily if it's summertime
I think it looks beautiful but I don't
have dryness to contend with a squeeze
tube kind of lightweight it almost feels
like a mousse type formula and it really
does have a pretty finish I just don't
love it on dry areas so I can't really
see myself calling that a total favorite
but I continue to love the stay matte
but not flat powder foundation just
great powder using as your powder
foundation use it lightly to set any
other foundation it's got a beautiful
finish I've used a lot of it my shade is
medium been wearing that over my
foundation today I just love great
coverage too and I've said this before
but if you see that in Ulta there are
testers you can touch it and you will
just be blown away by the soft smooth
feel that it has dewy finish setting
spray who would have thought I love this
stuff love to finish my look with those
or two spritzes of this is really enough
to keep your look from seeming dry and
powdery and spray this on immediately
after you finish your makeup that's what
I usually do could also just keep this
handy for a little touch-up midday but I
think this is one of my favorite setting
sprays that I've used we're almost done
and I just got a few blushes to mention
I can't believe I only have one NYX
cream blush and let me tell you after
trying this I want more
the shade I have is hot pink I love the
beautiful pigmentation in this shade I
can use it with my ELF small stipple
brush that little brush is a rockstar it
makes any cream product so easy to apply
I am wearing a little bit of this today
I think it's a super fresh looking color
so yay for that and then because I just
couldn't help myself I set it with one
of my favorite powder blushes you liked
NYX powder blushes by the way have been
a little hit and miss for me there have
been some shades that I've tried and
just been kind of like a so-so but there
are two that I think are standouts one
is mocha this is the one that I'm
wearing
like I said just lightly today it's a
really pretty matte pink shade I think
this would look good on a lot of skin
tones even deeper skin tones I think
this would stand out and look nice on
the blush in pinched this is gorgeous I
was wearing this one yesterday and
peachy golden shades got a little
shimmer you may want to skip the
highlight when you wear this just a
gorgeous glow a shade I think it's a
gorgeous summer blush as well looks
great on top of the tan so those are my
mixed favorites um like I said there are
so many things that just kind of barely
didn't make the cut for this that I
still really really love got some
products from NYX that you'd like to
recommend to me and others by all means
tell me in the comments section and
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
