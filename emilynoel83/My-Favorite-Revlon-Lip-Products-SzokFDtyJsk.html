product fan I mean I just gravitate
toward lip products I enjoy using them I
like having a wide variety and I'll try
pretty much any color but if I had to
nail it down to one brand that I feel
like like if somebody told me you can
only use this brand products would
you be satisfied if I could pick Revlon
I think I would they actually have like
a really nice range of lipsticks glosses
everything in between and nice color
selections within those lines and so I
thought it might be really fun to just
do a video talking about my favorite
Revlon lip products
I've got like some of the different
lipsticks and glosses to go through and
I've really tried to pin myself to just
picking in these different lines just
one or two at the max favorites so
that's what I'm going to stick with here
though keep in mind if it's a texture I
talked about really liking chances are I
have a lot of colors in that or I like a
lot of colors so I might have to do kind
of an expanded blog post on this but
just so you get the picture these are
some lip products I really really enjoy
on Super Lustrous lipstick has been
around for a while a lot of these other
lines I've kind of seen develop you know
as I've been a makeup superfan or
whatever but Super Lustrous lipstick is
pretty deeply rooted in the line and
it's just a classic line of lipsticks in
a variety of finishes and I like them a
lot actually I have quite a few of them
one that I really think is great and a
great standard sort of nude neutral
lipstick is called just enough buff it's
number 613 and it looks like this and I
feel like for me I don't feel like I am
satisfied with just any nude or neutral
lipstick I think sometimes they can
detract from your skin instead of kind
of putting something extra out there and
making you glow and I feel like this
shade just works really well also nice
and creamy um there's no shimmer in this
one at all if you like the color burst
line of lipsticks from Revlon are known
for being pretty vibrant that I would
choose a favorite from this line while I
do like a lot of them I
choose one that I felt really did
justice to their highly highly pigmented
formula and it's fuchsia
I've talked about this one before and it
is so bold in terms of being a pink I
mean it's even more sort of pinky
raspberry than then the sweater I have
on right now I really like it I think
that if you are going for a lip that's
not only pink but almost like just a
juicy pink with real depth to it this is
one that you're going to really like
when the Revlon lip butters came along
and they really made me think of
lipsticks with more of a lip balm feel
something maybe a little more low
maintenance to put on your lips some of
the lighter shades we're a little more
sheer and there's still some super
pigmented deeper colors but they're just
something that really kind of ups the
moisture content a little bit and makes
your lips feel like a little and look a
little more shiny a little more hydrated
so a couple of my favorites here and I
really was like going back and forth to
narrow this down as to what I would
really choose as my favorites but I love
red velvet if you're looking for a great
fall color this is one to definitely
look into it's that not only a red but
like a little bit deeper brick red and I
think that does almost make it a little
more wearable than some of the
fire-engine Reds that we see the simpler
neutral eye I could see this being just
a really pretty color as we head into
fall and into the holiday most wearable
kind of across-the-board shades that I
remember identifying it this way when it
first came out and I still feel this way
is a peach parfait this one it has just
a little bit of shimmer while the other
one was creamy this has a little
shimmery glow and I don't really mind
that in a lot of my lip products
assuming that they have enough color and
pigment in them to really back it up and
give you know a good base for whatever
that shimmer or sparkle might be but
this one's really pretty easy to wear
this is the kind that you can really
just throw on without a mirror and I
think that's kind of the essence of what
I think about when I think of these lip
butters just bitten kissable balm stains
I was very excited about this launch
because it reminded me of a favorite
high-end product which are the tarte
lipsurgence
and they're very much the same format I
mean
they're kind of like a jumbo lip pencil
only these I feel like weren't may be
quite as hydrating as the tarte
lipsurgence but they do have the stain
feel especially with the darker colors
now some of the lighter colors I feel
like you might wear them and then you
know some time passes a couple hours
past throughout your morning and you're
kind of wondering where they went but
with the deeper colors that's where the
real functionality of the stain comes
through colors that I really like is
called crush and it's kind of like a
really deep berry and I know it looks
extremely dark here put it on you know
it's got that initial little bit of
shine when you apply it and that may
fade over time but the color hangs
around actually pretty well for me so I
love this I have many other colors I
enjoy this kind of a format for lip
product for lip glosses these super
lustrous lip glosses I love them so much
I've used them for years I think they
are just phenomenal lip gloss texture I
like the packaging I could use even more
of a color selection if they want to put
that out but a couple of great ones I
really just couldn't narrow this down to
just one but one that I think is a
classic that I always recommend is
foiled and this is pretty on its own
it's a pretty kind of shimmery neutral
lip it glows and also use it just to
highlight the lower the center of your
lower lip for added fullness it's
beautiful love the texture love the
color what I'm wearing now is just kind
of a creamy gloss and it's called pink
pop it is the epitome of pink lip gloss
it's not baby pink it's not berry pink
it is just straight-up pink so if that's
what you want this is it those are the
lines that I really like Super Lustrous
lipstick color burst lipstick the lip
butters the bomb stains and the Super
Lustrous gloss the color burst lip gloss
I actually when these first came out I
tried a couple both of them turned out
to be very sheer and I was like I don't
like these these didn't work as well as
the Super Lustrous kind but not too long
ago there was a shade I found that
really appealed to me so I tried it and
I actually think it's really good it
reminds me a little bit of the Super
Lustrous only maybe not
as much like wet shine but just a really
pretty color it's almost like a liquid
lipstick sort of thing not sticky though
I mean it's really easy to wear but the
shade is called rose pearl and this kind
of reminds me of Jordana lovely which as
I understand is not available anymore
and I love that kind of neutral rose mom
packs a little more of a color punch and
less of a metallic puss is a way to add
color that doesn't really shout at you
if you know what I mean so it's very
wearable very easy so I would love to
know what your favorite Revlon lip
products are if you'd like me to I will
I will expand on this and I can talk
about even more colors and swatches of
shades that I think are great I can do
that on my blog so I just bit my tongue
ouch that didn't feel good all right
I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
