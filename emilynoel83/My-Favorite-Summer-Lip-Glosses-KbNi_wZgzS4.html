day I am so excited because I am talking
all about lip gloss in this video all
the drugstore lip glosses by the way and
these are just some of my favorite
glosses for summer I feel like I kind of
have a certain color selection going
here for glosses that I feel like are
somewhat liked some of them a little bit
bright and I just think they're really
appropriate for the season of some of my
favorite drugstore brands and
formulations and stuff like that and
just some hand pick colors by me here
that I'm going to tell you about so I
have one two three four five six seven
eight I wasn't going to talk about that
many but I just couldn't weed anymore
out so I'm gonna start with kind of the
lightest shade that I have this is from
ELF this is a hyper shine lip gloss that
costs only a dollar and the shade is
fairy and I've talked about this shade
before how much I enjoy it now this
twists up and it's got a little brush
applicator that's very good on top of
different lipsticks but it also looks
very nice on its own because it just has
this nice like I think of a light pink
pearl when I see that color see how you
can hardly see it and then it hits the
light and wow from NYC they have kind of
reformulated their liquid lip shines and
I will have a blog coming up on these
because I really do like the formulation
is a little more smooth and creamy and
whereas the old ones sometimes you know
I would run into a shade I liked here
there but I found that the formula was a
little bit drying on the lips which was
kind of strange for a gloss but this is
a little more moisturizing feeling and
the scent kind of like a little bit of a
vanilla scent I it's called nude York
City
oh yeah so I'll make a swatch of that
this has the typical kind of doe foot
applicator it's a little bit longer and
skinnier than some other ones I've seen
not totally erase your lips nude you
know you don't want to be putting on a
lipstick that's making your skin look
like you know okay you know she's lost
all her color she doesn't look healthy
this has just enough of like a golden
kind of neutral tone to it
I really like these mineral lip glosses
from ELF and this one's called
trendsetter
and you can see it's kind of got a
little bit you know tones of mob it's
like kind of like mauve and bronze
rolled into what it's extremely where's
what that one looks like again these are
all light these are all very summertime
appropriate not looking too overdone but
having a nice bit of shine on the lips
and that's the one I'm talking about
here that's trendsetter you got to have
a good pink and one that I think is just
great because I love this formula so
much you know I like the NYX mega shine
lip glosses this one is called beige
this is a straight-up creamy pink gloss
very classic love the amount of pigment
that these glosses have the amount of
shine but that's what that one looks
like this is a wearable classic pink if
you thought most Pink's you know make me
look like a Barbie doll or most Pink's
are just a little too much for me to
handle this one I think is the pink that
even if you don't think you want to wear
bright colors this pink is a very very
nice wearable one I mean it would be a
good workplace pink too this is called
pink pop and it's a Revlon Super
Lustrous lip gloss
I love Revlon Super Lustrous lip glosses
and I have for years and this is just a
creamy bright pink so if you look at it
compared to that one it's got a lot more
this is more of like a fuchsia pave your
got a more simple eye going on or just
at least simple more neutral or smoky
colors on your eye look you know pop it
up with a with a bright pink lip and it
really makes the rest of these guys look
really neutral but it's so pretty
I also like these elf super glossy lip
shines and one that I particularly enjoy
is called watermelon and so this is
think about a little bit toned down pink
with a little bit of a coral E tone
mixed in so pinky coral it's got a
little bit of a pearly Sheen to it you
can see where these were just creamy no
shimmer that's got that little bit of
shimmer and it's very pretty
next gloss I'm going to talk about is
this one and I just want to say if the
pink and this one had a baby it would be
watermelon which I just mentioned
because this is pink with just that
little bit of coral mixed in but a
straight-up great coral shade is coral
reef Revlon Super Lustrous again shimmer
just nice and shiny and this is a great
summer gloss finally one that kind of
gives your lips that look of you know
I've just been eating a cherry popsicle
so a nice
I think wearable read for summertime and
it's the elf plumping lip glaze and this
is in Ruby kiss so here you can where
you know this layer first I think this
is kind of like a smoothing plumping
type thing but I'm just gonna swatch the
color side for you here because this is
so pretty and this is another one of
those you know things you can get for a
dollar that really look great and no one
would know no one would know you only
spend a buck on that but see how it's
kind of sheer it's a sheer red that
still has some color not gonna be like
full-on bright red lip but that's a nice
way to ease into a red lip as well so
really what I feel like I've chosen is
sort of a palette of colors here that I
feel like all of them are nice and
wearable and all of them are great
chances to transition into a color maybe
you hadn't worn before if you haven't
worn coral I think I shared a great
coral with you if you haven't worn
Pink's you know there are some options
and red as well and even with the
lighter you know neutral shades not
everyone is used to wearing a super
light lip either so something to think
about and it will enjoyed my grouping of
my favorite summer lip glosses I think
these are great for this season and
really beyond but they just strike me as
colors that seem light bright they'll
brighten your face and they'll work
great in these summer months so thanks
again for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
