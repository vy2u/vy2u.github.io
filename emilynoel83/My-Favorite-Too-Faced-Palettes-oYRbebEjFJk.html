video it's like once I was asked this
question it was just like do you light
bulb went off in my head and the
question was what are your favorite
must-have two-faced pallets and I have
not tried every single to face palette
known to man but I really have to write
a lot of them and I thought for this
video I would first off only consider
the ones that are available now I mean
we can go back in time and find some
great limited-edition stuff you know it
doesn't have quite as much relevance as
a recommendation if people can't you
know get their hands on so I actually
narrowed this down to just four
favorites this is not the kind of video
I've taken lightly I've been thinking
about this I slept on it I was going to
do it the other day but then realized I
wasn't ready and it really makes it so
tricky is that I love so many of the Too
Faced palettes that I have things that
you don't hear mentioned are still
palettes that I really love but if I'm
just sticking to the top ones I was able
to narrow it down this far as you watch
this or after you watch this if you want
to let me know in the comments section
what your favorite Too Faced palettes
are that would be the first one is a
little more specialized it's actually
the brow envy kit I love this kit this
is my favorite favorite brow product
ever since I got this up in using it and
I do have a full review on it but I just
think it's a wonderful you know
everything you need brow set basically
you're getting a wax in here and I like
to actually start with that get that in
my brows and then you've got to brow
powders and I use both of these every
day I use the blonde and the brunette I
go a little lighter in here and then
deepen it up a little bit toward the
center and outer part of my brow and
then you've got this great like matte
cream it's actually a creamy consistency
highlight in this really pretty like
light pink shade and it gives such a
nice Sun perfected look to the bottom of
your brow and in terms of the tools
you've got a little angled brush which I
happen to know washes up really well it
might seem tiny but it's still just a
great quality little angled brush I use
that for the wax and the powder and you
got a little spoolie brush that you can
brush through them with or
brush your hair with and the thing that
I don't use in this little kit is the
tweezers I really prefer my tweezer
men's I don't feel like these get quite
precise enough with you know pulling out
that one problem hair you know I love
how cool toned these brow powders are a
lot of times I get a brunette brow
powder something labeled as brunette and
it turns out to look too warm too
reddish in my brows just too visible
and here with this stuff I feel like it
just totally blends right in doesn't
look too heavy on me you know is just
the right level of fill-in and exactly
the right tone for me so I love that
palette and a great palette that I
really have raved about for years it has
stood the test of time I continue to
love it it's Too Faced natural at night
palette I mean it's just gorgeous I love
every look that I turn out with this I
really do I mean it does not matter
where my focus might be in this palette
I mean this gorgeous shade called
Eclipse right here but like a warm
shimmery Brown you've got some mats here
to work with you could do a totally
matte look with these two and this one
longest time I had this palette and I
didn't touch the olive grains but these
are just stunning if you like smoky eyes
but you don't so much enjoy going the
like black or charcoal route and you
like to stick more with brownish tones
and more neutrals like this this is just
amazing I believe I bought this shortly
after it came out and just such a great
purchase I really even preferred this
over just the regular natural eye just
because I feel like the shades are a
little more rich and it just gave me
looks that made my brown eyes really pop
number three remember I'm only named in
four favorites but if you were hearing
me describe natural at night you're like
yes yes I love the neutrals give me more
um chocolate bar I mean this just really
takes neutrals to the next level it
gives you a lot of variation in looks
why you might just glance at it you know
some non makeup lovers might look at me
like it's just a bunch of Browns you
know I feel like there's some really
great unique colors thrown in here it's
kind of like the natural I just kicked
up a couple notches with more options
you know it's not that much more
expensive
than one of these smaller pallets but
you're still getting a lot in here got a
great mirror here this is a nice pallet
for travel really love how they fully
loaded this pallet with basic shades and
by basics I mean like the kinds of matte
colors you just want in your collection
you know basic Browns like cream shades
dark really really deep dark Browns but
then you've got fun pops you know you've
got golden a tones Burgundy's something
with a little bit of like a bluish lilac
twist to it so I just think this for a
neutral lover who wants the utmost in
variety this is a great great thing that
two phases put out plus you know it
smells like chocolate and number four my
last favorite I just listened to my gut
on this and I just asked myself you know
what palate are you just so excited to
use every time you open it up and it's
got to be the romantic eye and I know
this is a recent purchase for me but
I've got to say quality wise on these
shadows I just love every single element
of this palette I love the light shades
this light highlight up here I said it
before I'll say it again one of the most
gorgeous highlighting brightening inner
corner type shades yes I'm wearing this
today I went with this kind of pink and
purple row right here for a lot of my
look so lid crease just above the crease
and then my lower lash line popped it
with this great shade called honey moon
I mean what I love about this palette is
that it kind of causes me to look at I
shadow in a different way and that's a
lot of times what to face pallets will
do prompt me to go in different color
combination directions that I might not
have really considered before you know
like taking the plum and how pretty that
green underneath looks with the thing
that's great about this palette is like
the intense contrast that it has you
know you look at this half and you think
Oh light springtime but wait there's
some real depth in here to unveil
first-dance really really rich almost
black brown and then a really dark plum
I mean I've used that dark plum in this
look and when you layer it over this
lack it brings out more of the purple
but if you were to use that shade just
pack it on on its own you would have a
really really dark plum just crazy how
in nine shades you've got a tremendous
variety of looks that you could turn out
from just the super light sweet and
innocent looks to something really
really smoky but you've got fun pops I
mean this is just my kind of palette
that's all I can say it's my kind of
shades I've not seen this on Sephora
site but it is on ulties website and
I'll link to everything below wherever I
found it if I could do just a bit of an
honorable mention because this is
limited edition
but it is available now and it would be
the ala mode eyes this is another one of
those you know kind of color combos
might take you a little bit out of your
comfort zone but gorgeous summery
brights in there paired with some really
outstanding neutrals like these kind of
take a backseat when you first glance at
the palette I think your eyes
immediately go to that row but these are
wonderful as is that deep rich blue so
if you're looking for something kind of
the moment you know I think this is a
great great palette I do have a full
review a tutorial and stuff with it but
hopefully that informs you a little bit
more about some of these different Too
Faced palettes and really let you know
the ones that I love the most so thank
you so much for watching thank you for
requesting this video and I'll see you
again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
