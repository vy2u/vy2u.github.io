with my first-ever colour-pop haul and I
know I am late to the colour-pop
bandwagon it's an online brand and it's
something I've heard about on and off
but I've been kind of swamped with other
reviews first off and second of all I
really haven't quite had the time to
watch as much YouTube as I would like
these days the thing that really turned
the tide was I saw that Jamie Greenberg
had a collection with colour-pop called
in bloom and I've actually worked with
her before she's hilarious and awesome
not to mention you know very talented at
what she does and the color scheme in
this collection just seemed so me so I
really wanted to try it so in addition
to the in bloom collection I also got
some of their eyeshadows and individual
lip products also so this is a line that
seems very focused on the color
cosmetics so blushes lip products things
called lippie stix
so they have this kind of slim design
format to their lip products and also
eye shadows their products seem to be
kind of a cream powder hybrid you can
definitely press your finger down into
them there's some softness not an all
goopy you're not gonna notice like a lot
of moisture with these but it's
definitely not your traditional powder
product it's not a classic cream and
these are the blushes and shadows that
I'm talking about that are this way so
this is the highlight from the in bloom
collection and you can see how it's kind
of got that textured look to it that you
might think oh that's like a powder
imprint but then as you can see I can
rub my finger in it I can press my
finger down into it and it's definitely
like a creamy consistency
- that real tacky feel that you might
associate with just a standard say cream
blush or cream highlight so it's very
interesting very different I always feel
like it's money well-spent when you can
try something that's kind of unlike
anything else that you already have in
your collection
so like I said in my order there were
some cheek products some eye products
and lips and there were a couple of neat
little cards here that gave some
explanations on tips and tricks how to
use them to sum it up
says if you want the most coverage out
of these products like the cheek and
eyes you can use your fingers to apply
them and they give a few brush
suggestions as well if you want to do
that and it says when you're finished
close them up really tightly because I
guess if you don't they'll start to lose
that really unique interesting texture
that they have so I'm gonna start out
talking about in bloom this is the Jamie
Greenberg collection I was talking about
and it's three lip products and three
cheek products and I think it was 30
something bucks and so I thought well
that's a really good deal for all you're
getting and for me as one who hasn't
tried any of this stuff before I thought
it would be a good opportunity to
experiment so the three cheap products
are two blushes it says super shock
cheek and this one is hysterical and
this one is tongue-tied and these are
totally like what you see is what you
get you know to do an opaque swatch of
one of these it looks exactly like the
product in the pan so that's kind of
cool hysterical is what I have on my
cheeks and you can see it's been kind of
sheared out there's no glow coming from
this product it actually applies and
looks kind of matte if you just wear it
on its own so I am wearing the highlight
as well
it comes off kind of like a soft berry
shade I used my ELF small stipple brush
to apply it so I just picked up some of
the product in here just dab dab dab and
then I kind of went in circular motions
with this you could stipple it right on
but I think you get a little better
transfer if you just do a really light
circular motion you could also use your
fingers like they say but I just love
the application with that brush and then
this highlight like I said this is the
one called double dip and I think this
is super super flattering it's not too
much I mean you can see when it catches
the light you might think oh my gosh
that's super metallic but I'm wearing it
just lightly here on the tops of the
cheeks and I just love how it gives that
bit of glow but there's no actual
sparkle that I can pick up on it
actually has a hint of a golden tone and
since I was already using my small
stipple brush for the blush I didn't
really want to go into the highlight
with it so I've just been using my
fingers to apply this I pick up a little
bit just a couple swirls in there and
then I do like a really light finger
buff welcomed it onto the cheeks with
that I just think about applying the
lightest pressure possible to allow the
product to transfer but
nothing more and the reason why I'm
wanting to apply such light pressure is
that I've already got foundation on I've
already got powder on I don't really
want to mess that up so you just want to
apply very lightly and the really cool
thing about it it's like I've said these
are creamy products but they don't leave
your skin feeling tacky you're using
such a thin amount of them and even if
it you were really laying it on thick I
still don't think it would feel like a
cream on your cheeks and it really has
great staying power these do the third
blush that you're getting with this set
is called tongue-tied and it's an
awesome
Coralie shade just like the finish of
the pink one that I'm wearing you know
it's kind of matte until you put that
highlight on top then you get a little
more glow is wearing this in another
video I did recently over on my other
channel so I'll pop that up so you can
kind of see the difference in tone this
is all very like a berry themed look
that I've got going on here but I took
it a more choral route when I put this
on my cheeks so I love that shade this
might actually be my favorite blush
shade of the bunch so super impressed
with the cheek products love them would
totally buy more of them the other three
things in here are the lippie stix they
just love the format on these they're a
skinny twist up stick so you know
regular lipsticks always wear down
eventually especially when they're the
shades you really love you know they
change shape and here you can see
they're gonna maintain a certain amount
of skinniness
with this style of tube so I love that
they kind of smell like cookies I can't
quite put my finger on exactly what kind
of cookies some kind of cookie from my
childhood I can't think maybe a
shortbread cookie or something with
almonds yeah I think a shortbread cookie
my grandpa always used to make those did
I say these are all the cream formula
you've got sweet thing which is a really
pretty soft pink kind of a cool tone
pink maybe a little bit of mauve in that
shade you can definitely tell that this
cream formula has a lot of shine to it
then there's frenemy and this pairs
beautifully with that coral blush it's
kind of like a hot coral lip color kind
of a warm very reddish coral really
liking that and then the one I'm wearing
in this video is called freshman and
it's a great classic berry shade love
this pinky magenta I'm really impressed
with the fullness of color
and also that little bit of shine I
really love this cream formula compared
to the couple of others I tried I think
these are definitely my favorite so from
what I've tried from colour-pop this in
bloom kit is probably the biggest high
point the biggest success I love the
shades that are in here I love the way
they feel they apply great so yay for
that now the other two just random lip
products I selected individually off the
site I just wanted to try a couple of
other finishes so I got Westie which is
this matte shade and it's like a soft
pink almost a little bit more neutral
well a lot more neutral than the other
shades in the kit I won't say it feels
drying on the lips to wear this shade
but it just feels more dry compared to
those creams that definitely have some
shine coming off of them you feel a lot
of moisture this is just a little more
dry but it does give you that matte
finish if that's what you're after and
then I got monkey which says hyper
glossy and this kind of confused me a
little bit because it does seem to have
some shine but it doesn't really seem
any more shiny than the creams it's
pretty I don't love the color I'm not
really obsessed with it I think my three
favorite shades that I've used are the
ones that are you know in this
collection and the staying power with
these it could just be how vivid they
are but they last so well even once the
shininess wears off they really hang
around on my lips for the better part of
a day and then lastly I really wanted to
try some of their eyeshadows so I got
this little foursome that says rebound I
love the little sleeves the fun
packaging they're three super shock I
shadows and one pressed pigment so it's
not a pallet type setup you've just got
your for individual shadows I think
that's because for this formula to stay
intact those caps really need to stay on
there tightly but these are that same
kind of texture that I was describing
with the blushes you know a little bit
cream like there's this one called too
soon and as you can see it's got a lot
of shimmer to it it's not really
metallic when you put it on though it
just has that little bit of sparkle so
it's kind of like a golden peach with a
pinky type of iridescent shimmer this
shade is called one and done
and it goes on kind of Matt I don't know
maybe there's a teeny teeny bit of Sheen
in this we've also got adios which is
like a satin finish kind of brownish
grey very neutral and those are all
labeled as super shock shadows but this
one it says super shot pressed pigment
and this is probably the reason why I
chose this quad this is the one called X
DX not just X and it's a really bright
coral shade I thought that'd be great
for spring so in another video I was
wearing this on the lid and just a
normal neutral powder shadow in the
crease and then I think I blended above
it with a little bit of this coral shade
love the look it had great staying power
that's another thing even though these
are borderline cream products you don't
have to set them with anything they
really do last I noticed the swatch is
on my hand even I really had to scrub
them off in the shower the only one that
came off easily was this sparkly one
called too soon today I am wearing that
one called too soon the sparkly one all
over the lid and I've got some of this
greyish color in the crease and I just
used my fingers to apply the lid shade
but in the crease I used this Real
Techniques shading brush synthetic
brushes like this I think do kind of
well with picking up and transferring
some of these creamy products so I think
this little four pack gave me a good
sampling you know of colors a couple of
neutrals something really bright
something with a sparkly finish I really
like to try more that have maybe a
metallic type finish to them as well I
can see you using all four of these to
create just one look or maybe you know
you just use bits and pieces here and
there like accent type shades but that
is my color pop hull all in all I'm
really happy with what I got but the
ones that really knocked my socks off
and impressed me the most were the
things in the in bloom collection the
highlight the two blushes the three
lippie stix they were just really really
nice so thank you guys so much for
watching my first colour-pop haul I
would love to hear what your favorite
things are from this line please give me
your suggestions your recommendations I
would really appreciate it and I'll see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
