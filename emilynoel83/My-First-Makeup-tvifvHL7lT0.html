of a step back in time because I'm going
to be talking about some of the first
makeup I ever remember wearing and some
of that stuff you know since that time
maybe I've repurchased it or I thought
it was really good and I'd continue
using it and there's some stuff that I
probably wouldn't use again and some
stuff that's been totally discontinued
since that time I'm talking like late
90s early 2000s you know late tune your
high early high school for me when I
first really started using makeup and it
just kind of came to me this idea for a
video like this when someone asked me
you know what were some of the first
products you remember using and I
thought oh my gosh you know there's
there's some of the stuff that I keep
using so I just I get started and let
you know and if as you're watching this
if you want to comment let me know like
what some of the first products you
remember using are and if you're young
and you're just starting with makeup
then you know tell me some of the first
things you've you've bought and I think
it'll be fun to see how things change
between different age groups and whatnot
but first thing that I remember getting
was probably a covergirl pressed powder
and the packaging has changed somewhat
like this is the new packaging not too
long ago I picked up one of these newer
ones but it's just the regular clean
pressed powder and if you smell this
powder oh my gosh that sent that Noxzema
kind of scent really brings back
memories and I don't think it's a bad
powder I mean I did go and repurchase it
and not too long ago and I actually kind
of wanted to see if I noticed much
difference then and now but it seems
like the exact same product just in
different packaging but that was one of
the first things I got and my mom didn't
necessarily guide me through a lot of
these purchases I think I just read a
lot of magazines and just walked through
the drugstore a lot and also got
whatever my friends were probably using
around that time as well and another
thing that I remember getting a lot of
which I have since repurchased again and
I do like these are the covergirl lip
slicks so many things change in makeup
but some things keep hanging around and
I'm surprised that these are still in
the line these are these like basically
I guess the equivalent of like a tinted
lip
but they're really sheer so you put it
on and you get like a really you know
light pink like that or this other one
is the bronze shade and for some reason
bronze got a yellow tube which I always
thought was funny but yeah I have since
repurchase these and I do like them as
you know kind of shimmery light lip
colors but that was one of the first lip
products I think I remember using those
and these from wet-and-wild these were
like the hot item I remember among my
fellow junior high and high school
students it was the wet-and-wild mega
slicks and these aren't the same ones
none of this stuff is the like original
authentic the same thing I used as a you
know as a teenager or whatever but and I
apparently gone out Murray purchased
this I don't know what this orange one
is about I don't know if I've ever used
that but this one called bronze berry
there's another product with a
distinctive scent that I can remember
but I mean I love that lip gloss and I
don't know how many times I repurchased
it but it kind of reminds me of the
Jordana lovely that I talk about a lot
really liking that but I remember these
just you know you just went through a
non-stop everybody wanted them um one
thing that my mom did get me into buying
was blush because she thought blush was
really important and the covergirl
cheekers blush there was a shade called
pretty peach that's not what this one is
that I'm holding up but that was like
the first blush I got because that was
one mom used and she said that was a
universally good color for everybody
this one is rose silk but these kinds of
blushes something I continue to use to
this day I really do like the covergirl
cheekers blush so another lip product
that you just couldn't be without
entering your high or high school was
the lip smackers I mean everybody had
these and you had them in your pocket or
in my school anyway it was like you know
you had them not just in your you know
in your binder or like in your bag or
something like that like you carried
these everywhere and everybody was
constantly putting them on and so I
sometimes use the dr. pepper one these
I guess I've somewhat recently
purchasing today no I haven't Madoff
since high school but I love the lip
smackers I still like them the sense
definitely usit's another one of those
things like the scent recognition you
smell it and it takes you back to that
time another thing one of the first
eyeliners that I remember using was the
covergirl perfect point plus and I've
since like just recently this this one
off my radar radar then again for a long
time hadn't used it much at all and then
like just recently purchased it again
and realized how much I really liked it
but it's the liner that doesn't require
a sharpener so you can just put it on
and then it's got like the smudger tip
so you can like totally smudge it out
and this is a really good liner it's
really creamy it glides on really well
it's not the ultimate longest wearing
but um something I still really do like
so that's for another covergirl thing I
used a lot of covergirl and Oh back to
bunny Belle the lip lights these were
big in high school I remember and this
one I mean I recently purchased that one
I like this for like a really light
center of the lip highlight that these
always have like smells like cappuccino
was one of them and just like a lot of
neutral kind of soft colors and I
remember like all my friends having
those what about Jane makeup oh my gosh
like they had Jane had those lipsticks
and hopefully I can describe this but
there was like a little lever on the
side and like you only needed one hand
to open it it was like um you know your
lipsticks here for example and you pull
down this little lever and a little like
trapdoor opens and the lipstick comes up
and like you only needed one hand to
open it and you can put it on I love
those but of course that went bye-bye
when Jane went away and also the
eyeshadows the icings just before Jane
was taken out of my local Walgreens I
remember picking up this but the icings
usually came individually in little
round packaging's but they were really
really good quality like so probably at
the time some of the first like really
nicely pigmented shadows and another
eyeshadow probably the first eyeshadow
I ever got was the covergirl shimmering
sands trio don't you love that it's
still around I mean my first one I don't
think it was probably I think the
formulation of covergirl shadows has
changed a bit over time but I think
these are probably a little more
pigmented a little more color payoff
than they used to be but basically the
same like you know shades and everything
and I told you that nothing I have here
is anything I've had since I was in high
school but I did find one thing that I
did keep for nostalgic purposes and I've
not used this in ages but I found this
buried in the bottom of like a drawer
that was I was just kind of storing some
stuff in and I found this really old had
it since early in high school I'm sure
covergirl eyeshadow and the shade is
sterling blue and this would have been
something I used when I was in high
school and I used a decent amount of it
I mean I can see where I've used it it's
gosh that's old but that lie do you
remember that light blue shadow that was
kind of like I used that a lot and I
used some blue eyeliner with it and just
as I was thinking about like different
things that I didn't still have or
things have been discontinued but makeup
products that I remember using as a teen
Maybelline illegal lengths mascara I
remember that got discontinued but I
love that mascara and I repurchase and
repurchased over and over again
Maybelline had something I think it was
called Express it was a stick foundation
and I remembered buying that and using
that one and also there was one other
thing
okay covergirl ultimate finish liquid
powder makeup they still sell is this
some kind of like a rectangular
container and it's like a cream to
powder type foundation and I remember
using that like one of the first things
I started using and my skin was like
really fine
but that was kind of a lot of coverage
but I think I thought I okay I've got to
put my foundation on now even if I don't
really need it but that was one of the
first things I remember using
well but I don't have it anymore today
so anyway guys thanks so much for
watching and if you have any fun makeup
memories from when you first started
using makeup feel free to post them
