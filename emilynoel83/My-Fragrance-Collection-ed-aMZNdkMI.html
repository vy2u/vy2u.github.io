for this video this is going to be
something a little bit different but
still focused on beauty I'm gonna be
taking you through my perfumes in my
body sprays and it's not as extensive of
a collection as my makeup is but I still
have some definite favorite things that
I love so much and I've been getting a
lot of tweets lately asking me about
that because I think that was something
that kind of got left by the wayside
where the Emily awards were concerned so
I have been hearing your requests for
tutorials and I have some coming a
little something for Valentine's Day and
something for the college girl Beauty
series that I think everyone across the
boards will be able to take an interest
in so that is coming but for now let's
head to the bathroom so I got a little
area here off to the side of our bathtub
where I've set out some of my things I
normally keep these stored in a cabinet
not a few you know like legit fragrances
and a bunch of bodies for my newest
fragrances that I got is from philosophy
and it's called unconditional love I
love philosophy fragrances and this one
is really unique it's a little bit of
like a blackberry tone to it it's really
fresh it still has that nice kind of
clean scent but I sense a little more of
a berry tone with this one than anything
else I've probably my true favorite
scent that they make and I have this in
a body spray but this is inner grace I
absolutely love this kind of a sense of
warmth relaxation when I when I smell it
it's very fresh very clean but it's just
a really really nice body mist so I used
that quite often in terms of other like
perfumes this was my Christmas gift from
Tyler this year and he totally picked
this one out on his own I did not
specifically asked for them is the new
fragrance from Rihanna and I can't
actually think of the name off the top
of my head so I'll have to post that up
here but this is a really interesting
scent because it kind of has that spicy
and deep almost a little bit of a dark
feel lingering scent of kind of citrus
and grapefruit so it's kind of the
combination of both dark and sort of
bright and fruit and I think that might
like it a little better than the Kim
Kardashian perfume that I've had for a
little while now this one is a little
more on the floral side but again kind
of more of a spicy perfume I consider
both of those kind of like good
nighttime sense although worn lightly I
think any of this could be fine for
daytime the body sprays I've got a lot
from Bath and Body Works but first off
I'll just mention these two little guys
from body ecology I got these from
Walmart I know I've mentioned vanilla
cupcake that's a really yummy exactly
how it sounds kind of cake batter type
scent and then brown sugar vanilla is
one that I've heard people raving about
as well it's a very sweets and also that
light kind of vanilla scent that I know
is appealing kind of across the board to
people here from Bath and Body Works
that I was able to get from an outlet
not too long ago you tell this is the
old packaging but I love parable says
strawberry and pear extracts it is just
so yummy if you love pear cents I think
you'd really like that it's like pear
but somehow even a little bit sweeter
and then Country Apple I think has a
cult following in some areas so this is
really a yummy one too so I was glad I
found those because I remember him from
way back in the day some others in the
newer packaging now I just picked up
into the wild actually a couple weeks
ago these are normally like twelve bucks
and they were selling this one for five
this one smells really clean but it also
has sort of fun
a tropical edge twisted peppermint is a
seasonal one so I've had this one for
awhile but I love that I mean if you
like minty sense you'll like the mist of
this it's very sweet mint also something
I got this past fall which I continue to
use is cozy autumn vanilla and I'm
really mentioning these because you can
still sometimes they pull these out for
sales and if you find them at outlets
you can still get your hands on those
this one cozy autumn vanilla though
where is it it's a lot like the brown
sugar vanilla that you can find
year-round in the body ecology line at
Walmart I have one from Ulta here this
is fresh water mist just a really super
clean scent with nothing else thrown in
a seduction that's a Victoria's Secret
one ultimately
very fruity floral sweet sweets would
have any big rule like when I will wear
body sprays versus perfume before I
leave the house for work I'll just pick
whatever scent I'm in the mood for it
might be a perfume some days it might be
a body spray on other day in terms of
the feedback I get when I'm wearing
these because it's kind of hard to like
really gauge exactly like how do I smell
like I don't were to give me a
compliment I feel like what the
philosophy ones I don't hear so much
people ask me like what perfume do you
have on it's just kind of a oh you smell
good you know and they can't quite put
their finger on what it is because it's
not very strong and I know they talk
about on QVC how those scents kind of
draw people closer to you instead of
pushing them away like some fragrances
do you don't want to be that girl it
walks into the room and suddenly you've
filled the entire room with your sim
that's why I kind of like those
philosophies since I think they're great
for you know an office setting or any
time you're gonna be around a lot of
people so thank you so much for watching
I hope you enjoyed those we join you
again with more videos soon so see you
guys
