people wanting and I look for a certain
occasion maybe it's a date night or
Valentine's Day or a special school
dance or something like that and really
there is one look that comes to mind and
that is the look I'm bringing you today
it's my go-to smokey eye it's something
I've personally been wearing a lot
lately I was wearing it in my last video
and a lot of people wanted to see how it
was done and really it's nothing
drastically unusual it's actually
extremely doable in a few steps and I
hope that through watching this video
you can realize how you can maybe plug
in your own favorite shades to this look
and you can feel like hey I got this you
know in terms of the ingredient list I
guess for this video you are gonna want
three shades of eye shadow in this video
I'm using this trio from it cosmetics
and it's got kind of a light pink a
medium grayish taupe color and a dark
charcoal shinny so using just a black
pencil liner and then mascara false
lashes if you prefer so I hope you like
the look
so I first applied my Fergie
wet-and-wild
eye primer just all over my lid through
the crease up to the brow area using my
it cosmetics trio here this is called
pretty and smoked this pretty taupe gray
kind of color with a flat eyeshadow
brush going to Pat this all over my
eyelid from the inner most part all the
way to the other side next I'm going to
take the same brush and go into this
deep charcoal color and I'm gonna Pat
that on the outer part of my lid and
kind of push it upwards a little bit
kind of into the crease next I'm gonna
get a little bit of that same color on a
more fluffy crease type brush the first
place you put your brush is where the
most color goes so that's why we started
out here and then we're just like kind
of buffing practically like in a
circular motion inward and you'll see
that color really blends nicely and
creates a nice soft crease for us here
next I'm going to take a smudger brush
with that same dark shade and I'm gonna
take this right under the lower lash
line so this is gonna be kind of like
smudgy liner what makes a look seem kind
of smoky I think is when dark fades to
light a little bit so we're gonna do
that in a couple of ways using this
taupe shade so I'm going in with the
smudge brush again and I'm just smudging
it a little bit just below the darkest
shade and this is a really subtle effect
but it just softens it up a little bit
and I'm gonna take my crease brush a
little bit of that taupe gray and I'm
gonna run that right up in here just
soften up the edge of the charcoal then
just grabbing another fluffy brush and
going into this really light soft pinky
peach shade I'm gonna take that just
directly under the eyebrow just dab a
little bit right in that inner corner
just for a little brightness I'm gonna
do all the liner just with a pencil I'm
using my Maybelline master drama in
Midnight Master it's a great creamy dark
black
kleiner and I'm gonna add this to my
water line and I'm also gonna take this
all the way across my upper lash line as
well and whenever you're using a pencil
or really any kind of liner but I feel
like the issue comes up most when you're
using a pencil just make sure to get
really close to your lash line so
there's no gap between your liner and
your eye lashes next I'm just curling
the lashes here I'm gonna apply some
I'll may get up and grow mascara to my
top lashes just kind of wiggling the
brush on through and then using
Maybelline lash discovery with a nice
tiny brush on the lower lash love doing
lower lashes especially when you've got
that dark liner in the waterline it just
creates a nice like soft frame around
the island you can totally stay with
this look as it is if you want but I'm
gonna pop on some of my salon perfect
demi wispies false eyelashes some total
favorites of the year put a little
Revlon precision lash glue right here on
the lash band just go all the way across
let it get tacky for about 30 seconds
and then pop them on your lash line
my little rule of thumb is usually to
grant the lashes in the center then
Center your fingers up with the middle
of your eye and place it right on your
eyeliner about as close as you can get
to your lashes without being on your
natural lashes and then just kind of a
fix the inner and outer corners yeah and
just a touch more mascara just a tiny
bit to make me feel like both my real
and fake lashes are bonded together so
that wasn't so bad not a whole lot of
work for an eye look that could be great
for your next date night or even really
for daytime wear I think this can be
acceptable if you want ways to make it
less dramatic I would say maybe don't
line the inner rim of your waterline and
don't go with the false lashes that's an
easy way to make this even more wearable
for day what I like about it the most I
think is that for my eye color these
grayish shades and that darkness on the
waterline makes my brown eyes appear
just a little bit lighter especially if
I'm right by
light and I've used these kinds of
colors on people with bluish green eyes
and I feel like it makes their eyes look
like even more of an icy blue color I
hope this video shows that it doesn't
have to be intensely dark all around to
get a pretty effect from a smoky eye for
the rest of the face I'm kind of trying
to keep it a little bit lighter and
young and a little bit more I guess
innocent with the cheeks and the lips
I'm using this hard candy blush a great
baked blush and living doll that's
what's giving us the pink glow on the
cheeks and then I use this Too Faced
lipstick in razzle-dazzle rose it's a
really pretty pink shade popped a little
bit of this NYX mega shine gloss in pink
frost on top just too it just lightens
it up just a little bit more you so much
for watching and I will see you again in
the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
