questions about how I do my hair what
kind of products I use and how I get the
look that I have obviously today I have
it until I've done a whole lot with my
hair but I think some of those questions
were stemming from the video of my TV
news looks it's just my hair is actually
a little bit shorter right now than the
way it was in those videos but I still
honestly go about doing my hair the
exact same way so I'm just gonna walk
you through what the products are and
how I use them and if you have any more
questions please ask me because I'm
gonna try to be as complete as I can but
since I'm not actually sitting here
doing it I hope I don't leave anything
out so I'll just start with what shampoo
I use I use the Sammy fat hair shampoo
and conditioner it's just a thickening
shampoo my hair is very fine and
naturally very straight so this works
well as opposed to just a normal
clarifying clean your hair type of
shampoo about $7.99 a piece at Walgreens
and then also in that line I use the fat
hair thickening cream and I know if you
have fine hair like me the sound of a
cream in your hair might sound kind of
scary like it's gonna weigh it down but
I only use a very small like pearl sized
amount rub it between your fingers after
you get out of the shower rub it in at
your roots or any area that you want to
kind of like stand out from your face a
little bit and then after you blow-dry I
swear you'll notice a big big difference
so that's the fat hair thickening cream
from sani and then so just kind of going
a step-by-step fashion here I guess I
would blow-dry my hair and then I
usually use velcro rollers that's
something any time I'm anchoring almost
I used this because you just want that
look of body you don't want the hair to
just be flat when people are just
sitting there and all they have to do is
sit and talk about how you look you know
so I use this set from goody it's real
cheap you just get it from Walmart and
what this has in it
is a bunch of different sizes like a big
roller and then they just get smaller
and smaller just a whole range of sizes
there and that's really useful don't
think you're just going to use one size
because I use a bunch of different sizes
so backing up a little bit you want to
kind of treat your hair with a little
something especially if it's very
straight like mine is before you go
putting rollers in and so what I used
before was something from L'Oreal studio
but I've run out of it it's like a curl
enhancing spray and you want to spray it
mainly on the ends of your hair because
that's obviously the area that's gonna
show the most curl I guess once you're
done but I'm not recommending this
because I haven't tried it yet I'll let
you know if I like it but I got it from
Sally Beauty Supply it's from ion and
it's called liquid mousse and so that's
something you would spray you know you
pick a pick up a strand of hair like say
this much hair and you spritz it towards
the end and then I've got a curling iron
about this big and you just you know
roll it up not really trying to do it
here this isn't even on it but you would
roll it up and then while it is still
hot
grab a roller and you simply would roll
that up and if it's not they you can see
how that is staying in place for me
right now but if it's not you would take
some clips like these I got for like a
buck 50 for like 15 Sally Beauty Supply
they fit absolutely any size it's like
the biggest roller I could come up with
and you can see that that still fits
there now after you get done you want to
spritz it with some hairspray okay use
something that's quick drying to that
iraq would recommend is on the lower end
is this vo5 extreme style they have
changed their look of their products so
many times but honestly their aerosol
hairspray and kind of big can is gonna
be the same no matter how many different
you know pictures that good on it and
now they're one a little higher end you
can get this on qvc.com is the nick
chavez volumizing extra hold spray
they're both pretty
drawing and work really really well
because that is I can't stress it enough
you can't just put your hair in the
roller and not spray it you've got to
have just a light mist I'm not saying
just you know hold it on there but just
a lightness at the roots mainly because
that's the area you in you're doing this
for body you're doing this so your hair
looks a little bit bigger than it really
is so you really need to do that so I'm
going to take you through now basically
the way you should use these multi multi
sized rollers I use this biggest size
like I have right here its largest size
I use those you want to use them on the
side like say part your hair on the side
and start rolling this way like I have
right here use your larger rollers
around your face and then like a couple
here on the crown okay that's the this
area right here okay so you can kind of
picture why you would want some fullness
right in there okay and my hair is also
layered so if you have layered hair like
my no matter how long it's been I've
always had layers in it so you know
listen up if your hair is anything like
mine because this will really work for
you then you've got the next size and
just kind of go think of it this way big
rollers on top to smaller rollers on the
bottom if you got layered hair what's
your longest way or a little it's gonna
be like if I pulled all this up you know
okay this hair down here is my longer
layer so you're going to want to use a
smaller roller like this size on that
hair because here you're gonna have with
your larger rollers it's just going to
give your haircut in some nice body and
out from your face and that way you
could pull it over into a side bang but
you can't do like a side bang with
really curly hair so that's why these
bigger rollers are going to you know
benefit you in that way it's gonna let
you style the top of your hair however
you want to and then this don't plan on
it being super curly but it's gonna have
a nice curve and it's honestly it's all
gonna really work together look at any
of those pictures online this is
basically what I've done
anything that looks more curly than I've
gone with something really small but
majority of time lately I've been using
a roller about this size compared to
this is the larger I'm using about
rollers about these three sizes and big
on top but around the middle you're
using something a little bit more medium
sized and around the bottom something
like this
you're spritzing with some free kind of
curling spray running in your curling
iron while it's hot get it on the roller
spritz it with hairspray put a clip on
it and you're good wait for give it at
least 10 to 15 minutes minimum if you
want a really polished effect with this
leave it on for half an hour allow
yourself that time if you really want
this to pay off but aiming even 10
minutes in the morning you're still
gonna get something out of this so don't
worry too much about that anyway after
you would take this out then you take
them out all over your head and then I
use something called from the Nick
Chavez line called dry volumizing
blocker and this is something you shake
up and spray in your hand and it looks
just really like white and bubbly and I
just run it between my hands with my
head over before I do anything to my
hair and just kind of go like this to my
roots flip my hair up and it is big it's
big now okay so then as I style it I
brush through it brush through it all
with a brush and then I sometimes tease
parts of it like in the crown area let's
say that it was gonna bring over like a
side bang and then I might tease the
crown and then to go through that
because you know what I mean by back
comb use a little rat tail comb like
this and then like you would just go
like that well to get through that see
how that's kind of out there right now
well you don't just rake through it with
a comb again or else it's going to take
everything away so you use one of these
little pins little hair pins you can buy
them like this for like under two
Sally beauty supply and just go through
it and look how now I've still got I've
still got something going on there but I
haven't taken it all away by breaking
through it with a comb so after you've
got that you know take one of these
sprays finish it off you I mean hair
spray can be your best friend sometimes
and that's basically how I do my hair
and I don't do it like I style at
different somedays but that's the basic
look that people been asking about so
hope you guys enjoy this and let me know
if you have any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
