video we did on this channel my husband
does my makeup well we thought we might
rekindle that concept a little bit in
this video with my husband does my hair
it's gonna be extra interesting because
Tyler has never so much as run a brush
through my hair I'm pretty sure he
hasn't styled anyone elses hair either
here's what I've done I've laid out some
styling products some heat styling tools
god help us there's some rollers here
the clips some bobby pins brush comb I
don't know what he's going to do with
this stuff but it's here for him I'm
just hoping nothing gets singed off and
I'll try to keep my mouth shut while he
does whatever his little heart desires
back a lunch we're in for a long day we
should have very low expectations as
long as I don't do damage to your hair I
think we've all won I'm gonna keep
pretty simple yeah be like a wavy curly
kind of thing going on wavy curly yeah
both at the same time any product that
you think will be essential to getting
this look I'm really going to work these
uh not rollers because I think that's
gonna be easier maybe it's not I don't
know less dangerous I've know it I need
probably what this did one time we were
able to use these just for general
touching up cakes here for moral support
a new blast of sexy spring loops alright
let's get this thing going I'm going to
start out with some in route that's
clever
free styling conditioning spray well
with coming out with more direct line on
the dissipating more of them kind of
brush through that you know making sure
everything's we're supposed to be out
know if you did a good enough job
personally I've got some tangles in
there for you some tangles and maybe a
big fan of this pre trick I feel like it
this the nozzle on there should be a
little maybe I was supposed to put in my
hands
work it in that might be helpful mm-hmm
there now we got something going this is
so weird
Kevin you brush my something little
creepy about it thank you something oh
yeah birdie air since you're my
hairdresser can I like tell you all my
problems yeah I'm just I'm stressed
about Christmas a little bit I got all
my gifts wrapped but you know got a
checklist a mile long I don't want to
forget anything we pack thank goodness I
don't have to do any cooking got our all
brushed up view this comb part it
appropriately right one of these big
long bloom hot rollers with Kalista
tools or this is part of the makeup ah
this is the real trial
that's tighter I'm trying I'm happy
today like ever happened - that's right
alright we're cooking with gas we got
some rolled up on the first drive
I'm just gonna let these I can't even
hold it in I'm I'm so impressed by that
one okay I'll shut up now they have been
gradually improving as I've gone through
yeah ain't that wonderful huh nice
symmetry there we got like two on this
side of the head like eight on that side
what do you say we've Bradley amazing
for what 25 30 minutes you tell me boss
go grab something me you just sit here
don't move just kidding all right we're
back
um we actually just used this time to
shoot a video for our other channel so
that's a nice pro tip for you guys out
there when you get your hot rollers in
you know you can get some other stuff
done would be productive you know so
we're just gonna take these out be
careful not to let you well there
we go
that's right that's the effect I was
looking for won't you show it yeah nice
wavy might rolled it both ways and it
happens one of those rolled it both ways
okay
for extra waviness you can you can just
roll it you know counter and clockwise
on there I'll have to try something
maybe with all the salons in New York
it's gonna fit right in make me
beautiful get that one awesome curl oh
yeah get some hairspray on this before
we lose it you see look at look at how
awesome that one turned out
all sales I just feel like that about
people thank you what you're doing let's
check this out what do we think like I
should just go the curling iron laser
this is how you're supposed to school
burning I don't think there was enough
heat on that curling iron that's just
amazing but it all breathe let some air
in there oh yeah she didn't like and
where this is going yeah do you like
over your face for this step just
setting it all in there I have an issue
look wow
let me think okay you really you really
did pretty good like I mean you're a
little heavy-handed with the product for
example this is kind of stringy with the
mousse and all but honestly as far as
the curl goes I don't know what do you
guys think you can get by with a lot of
light beachy kind of messy waves you
know that's in Tulum I knew that and
that's why I did it that way and look I
mean I've got some I've got some decent
curls so I'm awesome at this such
probably pick a good level career I mean
I really think that you felt more
clueless about this than makeup but you
probably did better with this than
makeup I'm gonna fix it
- okay well all I would do basically
because there's a lot of moose in this
and there's a lot of product throughout
I have really fine hair so if I were
going to just do anything to make this
something and we're out of the house I'd
probably just come through that tease
that a little bit and then kind of kind
of spray it and then direct where you
going to go and worry so much thank you
my stylist I appreciate it I'm sweating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
