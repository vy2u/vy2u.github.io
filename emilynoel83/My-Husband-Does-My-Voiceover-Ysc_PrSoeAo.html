makeup I can't wait will fuel here take
care of that unibrow hand underside we
start with some farce all harshly
unicorn Express that looks like medicine
I don't know what I'm doing with this
but I'm just going to start with that
just apply it all over my face and then
we're going to use some hydrating eye
cream I haven't got a lot of sleep
lately so I got to do what I got to do
you know now we're going to apply a
totally lost the name of that one but
get it forehead cheeks and then blend it
in with this brush this is the base coat
is what we're starting with
and then can I get some heart-shaped
tape which contrary to popular belief is
not actually tape it's a liquid
substance that I place in a tribal
pattern underneath my eye and then brush
it in rush it in really good you're
going to want to make sure you get into
that eye crease do not whatever you do
don't let the brush stab you in the eye
because that's going to be painful keep
working it in working and then tell it
starts to look good there we go now
Laura Mercier translucent and OWASA
Laura Mercier translucent get that
underneath your eyes you just kind of
all over the place and I don't know what
we grab there there was something now
we're putting that everywhere we'll put
that in the comments little more coffee
we're going to need some of that so I
can mostly show people what I'm doing
some more on each contour so what you do
is you draw that right along the
the lines that you want to highlight
some assuming and grab your brush and
work that in also right on the forehead
line a couple of stripes and then you
brush it in then what we're going to use
is the bare minimal pure minerals and
visible bronze yeah you know show that
have a brush and then just right along
the cheap wine highlighting something
that's something to do with the way the
light hits your face you guys know that
already though we're in full body makeup
with Jess call so then the forehead and
move into some cabana boy shadow rushing
we've got this crazy little curve brush
what that does is it enables some kind
of angle that is optimal for this kind
of application and we got some Milani
some white spotlight face and I just at
the top of the cheeks it's all the way
back to your ears
well a little bit of a lip then we've
got some Murray old Wild West got oh you
just spray that right in your face and
then you get a ball pencil you just just
fill those brow Zing's get any any spots
where your eyebrows are falling out and
just groom them just kind of comb them
back and it's going going the best you
can there you go
and then I don't know if this is a I'm
guessing that's kind of like hair gel
but for your eyebrows then it's time for
the eyeshadow primer what that does is
it sets a nice base for your eyeshadow
just rub that in with your fingers no
problem then I've got the lorac I love
something about how many sorbet because
I'm getting hungry and that sounds
delicious just why that'll right over
your eyelids now yet
the color smooth yeah
also just right on top of that it kind
of towards the bottom it's a nice effect
there when there's a lavender put that
out towards the edges that's what you
want to do when there's a gluten-free so
you don't have to worry those those of
you with celiac disease you can use that
and then we're going to meet Matt nude
Matt home Wow that is a that's an
interesting name say don't we just right
up in the top corner and within that
hung and then the Matt sing you want to
do that just kind of all over the top
just up on the top net more even up a
little higher than that yeah but it's
more that Matt hung you put that right
underneath you meet Matt folks and I
mess around and then this is this is
gonna hurt I don't know why anyone would
ever do this but apparently it looks
good it just makes my eyes hurt and then
you go a little little uh eyeline and
pencil things just go over this up its
outlines your eyes and then oh look at
that fine-looking gentleman just
speaking on in whoa chipmunk throw your
eyelashes there you go and then the
little black primer for your eyelashes
curl the other one a little more primer
and then there's your mascara I love
extreme we don't mess around we go all
extreme make a funny face oh no now what
do you do now grab a q-tip clean that
off just don't screw it up in the first
place and then you don't have to do that
but if you do describe it you just and
then just just kind of finish it off you
know fix our mistake where we when we
caught a little bit
grab some false eyelashes glue it up a
little bit and then focus lay it on
there press it in there let the glue set
and weepy just getting it now and blink
a few times and then then finish it off
with some clump pressure on the bottom
on the bottom around then you go I don't
know what that I guess that's a I
thought a lip primer getting started
