where I'm having a french toast and some
fruit and there were four slices there
were four there or not it looked
beautiful but we just now remembered to
start taking video I got the croissant
okay I've eaten about half of your bird
is it possible beg pardon
great setup here we're at the Inc 48
Hotel everything is really cute kind of
like a little bit of a retro but yet
still kind of modern seeming but I do
feel like I would see this hotel room in
madmen possibly like this check out this
little couch here madness we are dubbing
his part of the experience die Matt's
not IMATS German guy Matt's hashtag guy
Matt's he will be tweeting hopefully
I've got to nudge him to tweet every so
often you know he's a reluctant tweeter
but I think today he's gonna have
hopefully plenty of things to tweet
about yeah yeah okay well bye do you
know how to work this thing
Oh remember we're getting ready to go to
my bath but finally ready and um this is
my outfit of the day it consists of my
new boots this is my biggest boot
splurge I've ever made these are from
albo or although I think it's Aldo and I
just recently picked these up these
they're flat boots and I think
comfortable jeggings we could go through
the are my jerbs are my jeggings too
tight question today and I basically
came to the conclusion that all jeggings
are tight so going with it I guess and
then white tank top this is from Target
cute little zipper detail goes all the
way around what do you think about this
purse oh my god pop of color
yeah does it work it works no I'm okay
with it as long as you're okay yeah
which is the most important thing came
from Ross and it's Jessica Simpson
little clutch didn't want to take
anything too heavy
Oh
stars
don't any message you want to give to
the husband's boyfriends out there
patient be sure they get what they want
and you always say no problem
and I saw
coming out and they were like
no but for the rottens
here makeup it should not be bigger than
this it's also going to be less
confusing
continuity means you better believe a
particularly look
they do it by maths yes
we're slightly more tired and so we
stayed up in late last night I know with
those crazy girls uh Tracy and Stephanie
and LeAnn and nerve and Jill it was it
was funny ancestry and sister Mary so I
woke up this morning and the muscles in
my cheeks are actually sore I'm smiling
and laughing and yeah I curled my hair
today looks very nice I did the same
thing I always do this is hard
it takes muscles to hold a camera out
like this now you know know those selfie
muscles the dress I showed in the vlog
and it's from Ross and it's kind of like
it's actually got a layer underneath it
you've got a sweater over the top of it
and I went totally mad on my eyes today
any other deets I'm missing bub boots
but hope these boots are more
comfortable than yesterday and they're
probably not because these have a little
bit of a wedge on them and yesterday's
work totally a mile away I'm gonna be
bitching about your feet all day
aren't you it was just amazing meeting
so many people yesterday couldn't have
fathomed really how that was gonna be
because this is our first time s but I
mean it was delightful everybody was so
nice people of all ages moms and
daughters different backgrounds coming
from all over the place and I just it
was it was unbelievable people wanted to
get pictures with Tyler I know that
never happens
right
a really fun incredibly nice people kind
of neat to know that when you're there
at IMATS you're surrounded by people who
feel the same way about makeup that you
do you feel kind of at home I don't get
the chat with people that love makeups
as much as I do
thank you for just treating us like
family you know coming up to us and just
showing so much love we love you too
we thank you for the time you spend
watching videos and just for I mean it
was it was beyond beyond expectations
and to everybody else hopefully we get
to meet them soon as well yeah it's a
strange experience when everything you
do and your connection with people is
formed solely you know over the Internet
so it's kind of like a really really
exciting thing for me to get to like you
know hug and physically see the people
who are watching so much diversity so
much diversity of Ages as well and that
just excited me so much I feel so
motivated I feel so inspired to keep
doing more very touching to see the
reception that we got for you but also
