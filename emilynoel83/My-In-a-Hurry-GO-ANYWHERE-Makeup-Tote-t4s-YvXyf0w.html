me today this video really goes
hand-in-hand with my you know busy girls
makeup routine or whatever I ended up
calling that last video and this is my
little makeup tote and I think it's so
so handy for just anywhere in the house
that you need to do your makeup like if
you're like me you have maybe a station
a room and area where you keep a lot of
your stuff but a new baby comes into the
mix or a new whatever your circumstance
may be that sort of changes things for
you I think it's good to have a little
traveling makeup tote around and yes
makeup bags can work fine for this my
stuff was in a little makeup bag before
I picked this up just very recently at
Walmart I just really like it because
first off it's cute I like the black and
white stripes in the black and white
polka dots but everything is so
accessible and when I come back into my
makeup room and I just flopped this
thing down I'm able to see everything
still you know so I don't feel like I've
got just a portion of my products and
closed in a bag and I've got to empty
that all out if I want to see what I
have I'm a very visual person sometimes
if I can't see something I don't even
think about it you know like out of
sight out of mind and here like I love
the way you can stand up brushes in
there I feel like I'm fitting really a
good amount of product in here but
putting some of your items into a thing
like this is really a huge key to
pulling off makeup in general when your
circumstances change like I said with
the new baby and stuff my days aren't
really predictable yet a full-on routine
that I can count on is not in place
right now some mornings I get up here
like I am now and everybody's still
asleep and I can do some things but
that's not a given every single day so I
love to have something like this that I
can grab for and then when you know a
nap time does start happening or you
know there's a lull in the action I can
grab this out and use some or all of
these products to create a makeup look
and I sent this recently in response to
a comment when you know you guys have
been so kind to me about like take your
time getting back to videos and doing
make up and stuff like that but really
for me makeup is part of who I am like
it's in my soul and doing it actually
makes me feel more normal more
comfortable more confident just happier
in general I like doing it think of it
like you know what if I was a yoga
instructor and I had a baby then you
know a little ways down the road I
started to want to do yoga again I don't
think people would really raise an
eyebrow at that doing these videos does
not work to me and that's kind of hard
to convey because I think so much is
this YouTube universe is about money
money money and sponsorships and you
know work work work but to me I started
this because it was fun and I keep doing
it because guess what it's fun for me
this is therapy for me I don't know how
else I can explain it but I truly enjoy
connecting with you guys sharing info
talking about stuff that is just you
know my thing and I think even as life
changes you get married you have kids I
think it's important to have your thing
still that's unique to you that's
special to you and so yeah that's what
makeup is to me and so anyway sorry I'm
not sure how I got off on that whole
tangent but I know for some people
makeup is like work or makeup does not
feel fun but to me it does feel fun so
if I can you know have some stuff kind
of grouped together and I can grab four
I can always be switching it out
whatever is in here and it makes it easy
for me to pull off makeup during any
part of the day any part of my house
whatever the case may be now obviously
with this bag being so open like this
this isn't going to be the kind of thing
that like you're going to toss in your
suitcase and expect that everything
stays in there this is something that
you know can sit on a tabletop a
countertop I mean it's it's not meant to
be really tipping around everywhere
because it doesn't totally close up so I
want to give you a little tour of the
bag here if this is what it looks like
just all the way around the outside what
you've got on the back this is one big
long pocket and then here's a little
pouch goes from here to here another
little pouch and then there are like one
to three more little skinny holders
right here that could like hold brushes
and oh there's more around this side too
then this handle part is acts
a little unsnap herbal almost basket
type thing in itself it unsnaps right
here and then over on that other side as
well and before I'm done I'll take that
out for you so you can see and how that
changes things because then if you just
wanted a bigger sort of tub type aspect
inside here you can have that and you
can just lift that out and have it
totally separate but with that piece and
here what I end up with is like one two
and then three sort of interior
compartments if you will so well I've
got on the outside I've got some
tweezers there I've obviously got some
brushes stored in here just a variety of
eye brushes that I grab for often some
new face brushes that I'm trying out and
I'm sitting this down on my chair now so
I can seat down into it a little bit
better I'm just not tall enough got an
eyelash curler in here and in one pocket
I've just thrown in you know several
different lip products a little clean
rollerball perfume but I could fit many
more lip products in there if I wanted
to this other side I've got a couple of
compacts I've got my laura geller get
ready and go callous I've also got my
two-faced primed and poreless and then
in the center this is really holding a
lot I've got my eight cosmetics CC cream
I've got another foundation that L'Oreal
infallible total cover them trying my
mascara a concealer actually a couple
different kinds of concealer my NYX dewy
finish setting for a couple of brow
products and then undoing those two very
strong snaps here I'll just show you
what that looks like when you take it
out you know you've got yet an even
smaller little person with them thing
there and then you could just have a big
open area on the inside if you wanted to
so this is serving me so well and I can
constantly switch out what I'm putting
in there but I really love the fact the
brushes can stand up in there and not
get messed up I can pretty much add it
glance just look in here and see what's
happening inside without feeling like
I've got an empty eye makeup bag and
really dig through things so thank you
guys again for tuning in I feel like I
did something similar to this after bill
was born a riot
discuss the fact that I think you know
if you want to actually get your makeup
done and you've got a new baby you kind
of have to make the makeup able to go
where you go you just got to work to
make it convenient for yourself so this
little thing makes it very convenient
for me and I just think it's also super
cute so thank you guys for watching and
I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
