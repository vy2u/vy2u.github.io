out my review of thon with me here on
this video is gonna be all about Mac
eyeshadows I don't have a huge Mac
collection I have 10 eyeshadows and I'm
sure that will hopefully continue to
grow over time but right now this is
where I'm at and I'm kind of at a point
where I've got some shades that I love
reach for often just really would not
want to do without then I've got some
shades I'm kind of like an you know
they're really good but I just don't use
them all that much and then I've got
some that I think really you could go to
the drugstore and probably find
something similar so I guess I'm kind of
doing this review because a lot of
people ask me if you you know it's my
first time going to a Mac store what do
I need to get and I'm not the Mac expert
but I do have definitely formed some
opinions on these products so wanted to
go through and tell you what I think and
I guess I'm inspired by Coldstone the
ice cream place because you know they
have the different sizes like it love it
gotta have it I think are the three and
so those are the three categories I have
here and I only have ten shadows to go
through so this isn't going to take very
long but I'm starting with the like it
so these are shades that I still really
like I mean I like all of all the colors
I have but I don't find them to be
absolutely essential or something you
couldn't find elsewhere so the first one
I'm going to talk about this like that
is Naked Lunch this is one of the first
ones I had I do enjoy the shade as you
can see it's got some sparkle to it but
it's not a lot and it's also somewhat I
don't know it's not the smoothest
texture ever there's another highlight
I'm going to talk about that I'm
absolutely in love with but this one I
mean it's just like it's got some
shimmer it's not entirely why it's got
like maybe a hint of pink or like
another neutral in there but I just
watched it there and I just don't find
to be very intense or like something I
just absolutely need or couldn't find in
the drugstore somewhere so yeah that's
Naked Lunch by Mac I like it but you
know that's kind of how I feel about it
the other one that I have that I
like and that a lot of people have raved
about but for me I just don't know I
think it's pretty but again it's not one
of a kind and it's wood winked and it's
a and this one I don't know if I told
you
legged lunch was a frost this one is a
Velux pearl and so this is what it looks
like here in the container it catches a
lot of light it's very reflective and it
has a lot of gold I mean this is
basically like I don't know I'm holding
up my hand here and I'm thinking how
many times have i swatched a shade from
a Coastal Scents palette like the metal
mania palette that looked like that hate
to say it Mac lovers but I mean this
shade it really I mean what it's got
going for that somewhat unique is just
how metallic it really is but it's kind
of like a brownish gold and you will
find the shade elsewhere I promise you
the drugstore is loaded with shimmer
shades and well I enjoy this one and I
will continue to use this one and it's
nice all over the lid and it kind of
makes the eyes pop this kind of metallic
shade is out there I tell you you look
at the Coastal Scents middle metal mania
palette and I assure you there is a
shade in there that has this kind of
quality to it so yes like it but that's
the category it's informing the other
shade that I have that I really haven't
used a lot and maybe it's just because
it's been found multiple times within
other palettes that I own and it's a
matte shade knit as embark so a dark
brown yeah I mean it's nice I do like it
it's fairly bold but it's actually not
as bold as even some drugstore
colors I think like I'm watching it here
and I'm not getting a very good swatch
on it I don't know why like that here it
is here on my finger but yeah it's just
I don't know I just don't use it that
often and I think it's kind of average
really it's not it's not that it doesn't
have quite that creamy texture as you
swatch it I don't know what the deal is
but yeah embark is just kind of a like
it shade because it's
average for me so okay now we've gotten
through those now these are the Lovett
shades these are shades that I really
really enjoy but they're not my absolute
like can't do without kind of shades if
that makes sense so first one is satin
taupe it is a frost and it's really nice
because it's got like you know it's not
grey and it's not brown but it's neutral
its shimmering and I will my favorite
use for this is if I have a light shade
on the corner of my eye I put this on
the outer part of the lid and it just
deepens it up and it creates a beautiful
kind of like fade into a slightly darker
color so here it is there it's really
pretty
there's a shade called tapestry taupe
from covergirl that reminds me a little
bit of this but it's not quite as dark
um but there it is it's pretty I mean I
enjoy this shade that's why I it's in my
love it category but you know it's it's
not like absolute oh my gosh couldn't do
without it next shade that I really like
but that you're gonna find duplicated
often is called night divine and it is a
Velux pearl and this is interesting
because it has a slight bluish tone but
otherwise may kind of appear to be a
charcoal gray sort of shade just swatch
that for you here's what it kind of
looks like there you can pick up on the
bluish tones and then on my hand there
it is this is nice to wear all over your
lid and then use a darker shade in the
crease and it's a pretty smoky look
while still making the lids pop because
this color has some shine to it so that
yeah this is nice
but if you kit a I mean these days and
might like for example in my ELF beauty
book the smokey kit I mean there is a
shade that kind of reminds me of this
quite a bit actually it goes on well and
I prefer that I really like this texture
but yeah it's it's not one of a kind I
guess you'd say next shade I'm going to
talk about in my Lovett category is
probably one of a kind and it is called
tracks and it's a velvet and I have this
my lid today and I really enjoy this
color I just don't use it all that much
and maybe it's because I can't quite put
my finger on it it's like it looks like
purple at times it looks darker purple
and then it's got gold in it too and I
just I just don't know I I should use it
more honestly because it is a really
pretty color swatched on my finger
there's what it looks like pretty really
pretty purple it's got some you know
gold tones to it and then swatched on my
finger it's right on my hand it's right
here it's like I mean it's it looks kind
of neutral II it packed on your lid I
mean it really is pretty it's kind of
hard to pick up on that swatch but I
like that shade I love that shade I just
don't use it maybe as often as I should
okay these next four are probably my
absolute favorites
they are I mean I've gone through 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 these four are my yes I
would absolutely recommend them colors
first one is shroom this is the shade I
have as my highlight and it looks very
just white there this is a satin shade
I've got to find a bear finger here I
like that this I just it's a fantastic
texture on this color it is right here
and it just has what catches the light
it has an appearance that's practically
like glossy I mean it just it's really
really pretty it's not overboard be in
and there are so many bites that you
will run into in the drugstore that have
like a chunky chalky glittery sparkle to
them this gives you the shine and
highlight you want but is a beautiful
texture so I love shroom for that reason
another shade that I love that I just
used continuously it's also in this look
as my crease shade and that is sketch
and I think this is gorgeous
it's a pretty plum shade it has it's a a
velvet shade and it has a little bit of
sparkle there as you can see really
close in I mean the sparkle is kind of a
maroonish purple and very very f-fine
glimmer I guess
that's in there and I get a lot of use
out of this shade I use this practically
like you know a neutral like I used to
use Browns and stuff yeah I'm using this
so much and you can see it's just like a
nice deep kind of burgundy purple plum
and I mean those shades look great on
brown eyes and really any color I feel
like it's warmer there is a warm a warm
thick two colors like this that really
just make the eyes look pretty and so
that's part of why I like to sketch so
much really really just rave review
about that next one that I really like
is carbon because it is a flat out matte
black it is as black as it gets
I love this color you're going to
probably struggle somewhat to find all
out purely I'm talking purely matte
black rich color I mean this also isn't
it doesn't create fallout for me it's
packed densely enough here that like
okay I can get that cure black color but
it's not so soft you know some as you
stick a brush in something and it's like
shadow is starting to go everywhere and
you really deal with thought a lot you I
don't deal with a lot of fallout with
this okay you get your brush in it you
get the shadow on its it's just a great
black for that smoky eye to use this
liner I mean I like the multiple
purposes that this shade has and that
you can just count on the fact that
there is no sparkle in this whatsoever
so that is a shade that works great
alongside more colorful bright glossy
sparkly shades that you put on and then
this can be your liner your crease shade
your you know contour and whatnot and it
just looks really great another shade
that I love to warm up any look and it
is called cranberry it's a frost and I
love it just love it I mean it is so
pretty it's this gorgeous red here's how
it looks on my finger look at just how
that color shines I mean and it's pretty
with a bigger brush there's a there's a
concentrated swatch of it right there
but what I like doing is
fluffier brush getting it in here and
then applying it like right up in this
area so you've got a darker brown or
black in the crease and then you just
lightly put cranberry there I don't have
it on right now but you know you buff
that on and it just like if you were to
blend that out a little bit more I mean
it just creates the nicest warm look
there I love it I have not found a whole
lot that's like this except possibly
there's a reddish shade in the covergirl
dramatised kit that reminds me a little
bit of this but it's not quite as pretty
or this is a little bit brighter
basically um but I love it so hopefully
that breaks down for you exactly how I
feel about my MAC shadows I think as a
whole quality is great across the board
they're just some shades that I don't
reach for as much that I don't find to
be as unique and special and then those
four shades that I just now mentioned
that I think are absolutely fantastic so
hopefully this guide you a little bit
through your next trip to the MAC store
and that concludes today's review Athan
I will probably do more in the future
and if there are particular products you
want to see reviewed just let me know
and if you want to see more tutorials
with Mac shadows tell me that doesn't
mean I'm going to abandon drugstore
tutorials but if you there are certain
color combos that you would like to see
me kind of show you on camera just let
me know so thanks a lot guys for
watching have a great day and a great
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
