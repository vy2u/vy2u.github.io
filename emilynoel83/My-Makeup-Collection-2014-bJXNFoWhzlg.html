collection video so showing you what's
in all these crazy drawers that surround
me here in my makeup room by the way I
have done a makeup room tour video so if
you want to see all the nooks and
crannies of this space I will definitely
link to that for you but yes since we
recently moved I definitely started to
rethink what I was going to do with my
makeup storage so I moved from having
all of those like different plastic
drawers I had a lot of different sizes
and really it was way more drawers
probably than what I have now but it
just wasn't the most efficient use of
the space the drawers weren't as big so
I have moved toward what I know is a
very popular storage system here in the
YouTube world and it's the IKEA Alex
drawers I have a couple of the wider and
shorter units under this desk that I'm
sitting in front of and then also
several of these taller 9 drawer unit I
gotta say after spending five plus years
with those plastic drawers these seem
like just amazing to me because I really
think the drawer size is well suited to
make a and overtime I may change the way
I've got everything positioned in there
or my little containers within the
drawers but for now this is what I'm
working with it's a big collection I
make no apologies for that it's what I
do I'm proud of it and I'm happy to
constantly be working on new review
videos for everyone and you know this is
the material I'm talking about I hope
you enjoyed this video and let's take a
look around I've got this l-shaped desk
that I talked about in my tour video and
underneath that are a couple of storage
units and then I've got storage to the
side idea for me is that I really like
to be surrounded by the stuff that I'm
using make as many things as possible
just within arm's reach and it makes it
more convenient and I think I'm more
likely to use what I have when it's all
just really really handy as far as
what's on top here I'm trying to keep it
a little more minimal than I once did
this is also where I sit for beauty
broadcast live and set my laptop like
here or here but I've got a couple of
things if brushes there some lip
products that I just think look cute out
a lot of tarte lipsurgence products and
vite lipsticks my brush storage is this
pampered
a little turnabout thingamajig and I've
got brushes from all brands in here I've
got Sigma Real Techniques elf a lot of
random just drugstore brands my mirror
absolutely love it
here's my baby bump love that too oh
hello I love to keep a smaller and very
dirty
apparently mirror right here so if I'm
doing eye makeup I can really get a
close look at what's happening this
great little tray here from caboodles I
was using this in the other house too
and it keeps my skincare products really
handy and all in one place I usually
have this full of q-tips looks like it
needs to be refilled but I've got some
setting sprays and various moisturizers
their bottle sprays brush cleaner sprays
some big old tubs Estee Lauder Double
Wear that my buddy David hooked me up
with and some Kleenex of course and then
up here this is the very non practical
part of my storage this is where I just
put the pretty things that I think look
pretty in the background of the videos
so I've got just a bunch of pretty gold
makeup products they're sitting in a
clear lipstick storage container that I
got from Lady Moss I've got some Tarte
brushes out this is all just randomness
that I think is really cute and I love
that I will be able to switch this up
whenever I want maybe switch it up with
the holidays who knows I'm going to
start with my storage here under the
desk I've got the Alex six drawer units
here and here these do come with little
wheels but if you don't want those you
just don't put them on and these could
stack also I had a little extra space
over here so I went ahead and kept
excuse the toe pointing but I kept one
of those here just for kind of like if
I've done a whole recently I've got some
products I want to make a point to use
real soon and keep handy I've got those
there and my little trashcan also
already here I've got a lot of ice stuff
right in this unit and this is all cream
shadows so I've got kind of some random
brands right in here some motives Mac
Malley
here are a lot of my Maybelline Color
tattoos and the elf smudge pots some
from Sigma here no I love my Malley
shadow sticks I've got a bunch of those
here just some miscellaneous um high-end
pencils laura mercier tarte smolder eyes
drugstore type of jumbo pencils like
Milani Jordana Avon and a bunch of eye
primers right here
the next drawer what we have here this
is all eyeliner 100% eyeliner plus I do
have some more jumbo pencil type things
but these are the ones that maybe don't
have as good of staying power we're
limited edition something I'm not going
to reach for real often got some mixed
ones here a bunch of sharpeners and kind
of nude or brightening eyeliner pencil
and guys I was so eager to like get
stuff in these drawers after we moved I
just took some drawers out of the old
storage and pop them right in here so
totally may not stay like that but I
really do like having a nice wide area
to reach from so these are black pencil
liners Brown pencil liners and various
colored pencil liners and that was the
way they were split up in my old storage
also I've got cream and gel liners and
liquid liners right here and then down
below I've got brows and lashes this is
a great little tray here guess what it
holds silverware and I've got some lash
curlers in here I've got brow pencils
jumbo brow pencils any kind of brow gel
and then like highlighting type pencils
right here I've got brow powders little
palettes the two-faced brow envy is what
I use pretty much every day a larger
brow palette from Sigma back there and
then mascaras traditional bristle brush
rubber bristle brush that's how I've
kind of kept them separated for a long
time now and it seems to work for me
next drawer I've got false lashes
various different brands I've got little
tools for applying little scissors glues
and stuff and then I've got loose powder
shadows here so really random in terms
of the brands I've got some bare
minerals in there some everyday minerals
a lot of elf loose shadows I'm going to
try to make a point to use some of these
more because I think the storage now is
more handy than it was in the past now
down below that I've got
a lot of my smaller size palates and the
thing that's dividing these up you can
see it goes here it goes all the way out
to the edges of this drawer and I found
it at Bed Bath and Beyond I saw Alex
drawers in the picture on the front so
I'm like ooh this might be perfect for a
couple of my drawers so I picked a
couple of those up I may review those at
some point in time because I'm really
liking the size that they give you not
just to separate palettes but really any
kind of organization in a drawer like
this I think they're really great it was
so cool you just pull it out to make it
the width and the length that you need
but I've got some lorac palettes they're
a bunch of Too Faced Bare Minerals Kat
Von D naked palettes
malee palettes then down below I've got
a lot of open space here which is good
to seeing's that I've gotten from Target
or NYX products so when you cash it it's
a place for those things that aren't
like humongous but they're larger than
your average like trio or quad over here
still more eye stuff but this top drawer
just the width of this drawer I tried to
store my concealer in other ways but it
really made sense for me to keep it all
in here together so I've got primers and
concealer these are just a lot of
standard primers these are some primers
that specifically cater to like pores
and pore refining type products some
tinted or illuminating primers back in
here the really full-coverage creamy
concealers liquid consistency full
coverage concealers brighteners
highlighting type concealers stick
format concealers various shapes and
sizes and then these are all like
corrector things that are yellow toned
or peachy tone that are really geared
toward color correcting and then over
here setting powders of different kinds
I've got a lot from ELF a couple of bare
minerals bisque type powders that I
talked about a lot your bag is in here I
think I could conceal issues on my face
and about a hundred other faces for a
lifetime with that stuff down here okay
we're getting into single eyeshadows now
this drawer might look a little chaotic
at first glance but let me explain in
the back I've got various storage
containers here and
I like to split up my single shadows by
color not by brand because I feel like
I'm more likely to reach in and actually
use from different brands when it's all
kind of mixed up and I'm thinking okay I
need a matte cream shadow will I use
this one will I use this one you know
kind of prompts me to make some choices
and look at what I actually own so
here's like the really light beige a
light peachy shades gold any colors rose
gold bronzy type colors warm tones
here's a bunch of topes and here's a
bunch of Browns and then out in front
I've got duo's and trios that
incorporate those same kinds of shades
and I kind of like how it's not too
perfect it's something I can totally
like rummage through a little bit you
know I can pretty much see a lot of what
I have there's not tons of overlap
though there is Sun and then down below
that have done a similar thing but we've
got colors here so Purple's I've got a
lot of those so those are in you know a
bigger container pinks and mobs greens
blues and blacks and Silver's and then
any sort of trio or duo that corresponds
with those kinds of colors next drawer
get ready wet and wild people because
this is like wet and wild city right
here gosh where to begin
I've got trios here and these are trios
that are from the regular line limited
edition lines that's why there's so many
there is some randomness tucked right
back here things I don't use often but
want to keep kind of on hand I've got
the larger palettes here from the Isle
of Matt to the comfort zone more limited
edition type Krios palettes that are the
newer ones that they came out with with
the five colors that here you're looking
at more limited edition type stuff and
some little Fergie palettes over here is
covergirl so these are trios and quads
from cover girls line in that little
basket and then right up here is NYC so
I've got several different trios from
NYC and also some of these little four
color palettes with the cream primer and
highlight really been enjoying those
down in here I've got assorted other
palettes
smaller sized ones like those from Nicks
I've even got some Nicks like remember
when the trio's were made like that I
can't bear to part with some of those so
I've kept those in there I'm in here
I've got tons of these Maybelline eye
studio quads I love them in this little
basket I've got some of these L'Oreal
color riche quads in front is just
really random smaller high-end palettes
like a couple from Cargo tart laura
geller terena Tarantino Benefit Stila
couple of Lancome products there and
then here's some random back to
drugstore a flower Beauty Physicians
Formula those matte palettes are so cool
back here I've got some Revlon quads
also some hard candy and Physicians
Formula and down in the waywe bottom
I've got tons of extra space but I
decided to go with any of my palettes
that i depotted things into or just had
like products in the pan that I
transferred into a Z palette so here
I've got some different makeup geek
shadows I've also got a lot of Coastal
Scents hot pots and a couple of these
here you know random shadows that I've
depotted from Too Faced and urban decay
palettes
there's my Mac shadows more coastal
scents and an English as well between
these two things that sums up all of the
eye stuff and now we're going to move
over here to the toe drawers are you
still with me are you still away up here
we've got more face stuff and this is
blush and this is maybe my tightest
freaking girl may have to change
eventually but I've got things actually
I did decide to divide things by brand
here because it was the most space
efficient so I've got Tarte Estee Lauder
some laura geller
the balm ayane Milani elf NARS just
random other brands kind of wherever
they fit I do have just a couple of
little divider type plasticky drawers
right in here down below this is more
blush but either things that were kind
of large and wouldn't fit up there or
things that I have a specific reason to
separate out like in this little basket
is anything with that like mosaic type
of mixed
we're pattern going on you know what I
mean so I've got some of those there
I've got little like duo palates like
those from elf that combine blush and
bronzer BH Cosmetics flower Beauty any
of the Benefit boxed powders little
malli like duos that have the cream in
the powder blood cosmetics some loose
blushes there some sleek blushes right
here is the bronzer drawer guys can you
tell what happened I took the drawers
out of my other storage and I just
popped them in here for now
basically here's Matt bronzers and right
back here or shimmery bronzers I usually
reach for the matte ones more love this
Milani bronzer excel for contouring but
I've got those just really close and
handy and then if I want something more
glowy its back there next up this is my
highlighting and finishing powder type
of drawers so I've got all kinds of
shimmery highlights right here from the
balm
Too Faced laura geller Physicians
Formula and over here I've got more
lightweight loose powders in some cases
finishing powders are there and then
right up here in front I've got some
things that are more like mattifying
pearl the balm benefit Porefessional
Agent Zero shine now below that I've got
all things powder but more from a
coverage standpoint right back here are
all my bare minerals products in this
little basket a few random things right
here pressed powders and then powder
foundations so things that do tend to
give me a little more coverage like my
laura geller balance and Brighton and
Mac Studio Fix Mac mineralized
skinfinish Milani multi tasker's you
know those powders that just give off a
little more coverage I've separated
those here and I need to be reviewing
these soon but I've got several of the
Ben Nye luxury powders these Alex
drawers you've got five of the skinnier
ones and then you get into the deeper so
that's where I've got my foundations and
in a nutshell I've split these up into
light coverage medium coverage and then
my full coverage right here so of course
you've got like Estee Lauder Double Wear
type products over here my Revlon
Colorstay look a little crazy back here
but I've got cream or mousse type
formulas stick formula found
right there and then in the way way back
I've got any foundations that are like
not the right color for me right now or
maybe something I might use on someone
else those are in the back of the class
next drawer is all about creams I've got
cream blushes cream highlights cream
bronzers try to separate them out as
best I could so I've got like stick
blushes and then in you know a little
compact form you think that could be
used as a cream contour here cheek stain
type products and then all those like
illuminating type of sticks and creams
and liquids next up the drawer of the
tinted moisturizers BB creams etc I
really don't have any rhyme or reason
right now for the way I split up these
two other than these tubes are bigger
these are a little smaller got more back
here that I was not such a fan of I've
got different kinds of compact cream
foundations down here as well as far as
brands go I know I have talked about a
lot of these but I still have more that
I can review like the it cosmetics CC
cream that was in my one brand tutorial
need to do a review on the Estee Lauder
Double Wear BB but covergirl Rimmel
L'Oreal Maybelline lots of drugstore
BB's and there too a lot in this bottom
drawer besides some extra brushes really
large brushes that are kind of a pain to
store or these double ended brushes that
are always a hard thing to store so they
have their own little space there so I'm
a lip product feed you knew this was
coming these products are not packed in
as tightly as they could be I know I'm
taking up kind of a lot of space with
the way I'm doing things right now it
may change but let's just dive in right
up here we've got nude lipsticks and
each of these drawers is going to follow
kind of the same format different forms
of the lipsticks like a lot of jumbo
pencils right in there this front right
basket are things that I've kind of
picked out is like my favorites the
things I'm reaching for a lot right now
and then even more in the back when I
pull out that drawer for nude lipsticks
if I go over here to this next unit
right alongside I've got the nude
glosses so here I've got my longer ones
with the doe foot applicator --zz here's
shorter ones and
those in squeezy tubes so anything nude
lip product wise is going to go straight
across like that same story down below
for neutrals so a little bit deeper
neutrals I've got things that are also
in that like melted type format
definitely like the coverage on your
lips of a lipstick but a little bit
different type of consistency so the
Jumbo pencils like I said those are in
here some things I'm especially liking
right now and then more right there and
then right alongside it are the neutral
gloss there's tons of extra space when I
do it this way so that's why I'm saying
I may not keep it like this but for now
I really love having like everything in
such close proximity and the brands guys
are just really all over the place I
mean drugstore high end it's all mixed
in together
here's Pink's so again the different
consistencies the jumbo sticks the
things I'm really loving the more more
more all in the back and then same story
here pink lip glosses I have a ton of
pink lip glosses it just kind of baffled
me as I was reconfiguring my storage
extraordinary type of lip colors and let
just like with eyeshadow it really helps
me to not divide by brand with these
kinds of things so if I need something
I'm really drawn to look in my
collection and see you know maybe I'm
going to reach for this but oh yeah I
haven't used this one in a while so I'll
grab that you know so it prompts me to
use more of what I have and then right
alongside that all the berry glosses the
bright fuchsia type colors even things
that border on purple a little bit
radiant orchid that's all in there right
down here I've got all the reds so red
lipsticks those in the different formats
the ones I really really am enjoying and
then some more in the back and then over
here I've got my red glosses oops man
red glosses and also I'm just keeping
all my OCC lip tars right there as well
along with my little homemade palette
for them heading into one of the deeper
drawers and this is all of my coral
stuff because I didn't have quite as
much in this drawer just seemed to
accommodate
so this is you know all the coral
lipstick type products the Jumbo pencils
the glosses that are a little bit taller
longer whatever and the squeezy tubes
down from that I've got tinted lip balms
lip glosses all like baby lips type
stuff here
L'Oreal tinted lip balms Neutrogena
here's a little divided thingy with some
of the skinny ones like yes to carrots
and Burt's Bees right back here the
things they're kind of colorless but you
know good for your lips and I love those
philosophy lip shines so I got a little
tub of those down below that we're
looking at lip plumpers right here so
like the buxom ones a little short guys
I'm keeping those there some from NYX
lip stains really long wearing lip
products like the covergirl outlast
maybelline superstay and then I've got
nude and neutral type lip liners and
pink and berry lip liners right down
here in the bottom a junk drawer totally
random I've got stuff that just was kind
of gathered up from the move that I need
to put somewhere some samples some hair
clips you know and then over on this
other side what do we have left for more
drawers for more drawers oh my goodness
over here I've got any kind of like face
palette or combination type palette I've
got one of those domed Z palettes so I
was able to deep pot some baked stuff at
one point I've got a Mac palette with a
few blushes in there contouring palette
from it cosmetics and then any other
like face related palette like things
that came out around the holidays the
Tarte blush palette I've got the balls
how about them apples cream blush
palette and these are kind of combo type
things this thing for Mac that I got it
has like blushes and eye shadows next up
or more eye palettes that didn't fit
right down there so I've got some from
Sigma all of my palettes from the balm
right here and then some just really
random miscellaneous type palettes in
the back and then these two drawers
right down here in the bottom are empty
they can stay that way that's fine by me
you guys so much for watching this
collection video I hope it was fun I
hope it was just interesting to look
through and maybe you got some ideas for
your own storage thing one of the things
I get asked a lot is if you've got a lot
of makeup how do you make a point to
know what you have or to use what you
have and I really think good
organization is keeping things kind of
separated and categorized as much as you
can really helps you know what you have
so have my closet area we peaked into
that in my makeup room tour video where
I've got some overflow products things
that I've maybe been sent but haven't
looked at yet or pallets and stuff so if
you want to see more of what's in that
room I think that would be a separate
video so let me know if you're
interested but thanks again for watching
guys I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
