in for my video today um I apologize if
the Lighting's a little bit different it
actually got really dark and stormy
outside just now so I kind of had to
switch around the way I was sitting here
and changed my light but this isn't a
tutorial so it shouldn't matter too much
I wanted to do a video about my makeup
bag that I take to work um in case
you're not familiar with me in my videos
I am a morning news anchor at my local
station so while I do my makeup at home
I also take my makeup a certain amount
of it to work with me just to kind of
touch up before the show and that kind
of thing so I have certain things that I
always have in my makeup bag that I
think are really good for anyone to have
and then just those other items that you
know apply to that day's look so the
makeup bag that I have is really cute
I've been using it for a couple years
now my sister actually got it for me
from I believe it was Urban Outfitters
and it has a couple of handles here it's
about this big and it has kind of like a
paper doll theme all over it kind like
models and they yeah they look like
little paper dolls with their outfits
and stuff so it's really cute it's by
loop I guess is the brand so really like
this bag and it opens up and it has
several sections to it it's got this big
compartment there it's got a center
compartment thick that holds you know
like say your mascara tubes and lip
glosses and stuff and then your brushes
on the other side and then it has like
two different compartments right here
where you can zip them off I don't
usually sip them but to hold other
products so in my big compartment are a
lot of things that I don't mess with I
will take them to work every day
regardless and a big one is my Tresemme
tray to extra hold hairspray this is not
the super tiny size that I'll sometimes
take in my purse but this gets you
through quite a few uses I don't go
through these too often because I do do
my hair at home as well but the
hairspray is one of those things you
always want for like a finishing
so this is a good size it fits easily in
this bag I love that I can actually keep
my hair items in my makeup bag and be
good to go so I've got that I also carry
with me you know one of these little rat
tail combs something that if I need to
tease up certain areas of my hair again
before I go on I have that and then I
have this little end here where you can
kind of you know boost it up a little
bit so that's super valuable for me I
always carry q-tips and your local
drugstore you can probably find these
little travel packs of q-tips this keeps
them really nice keeps them from getting
all like frayed out you know like if you
just have a random q-tip flow your hook
in your bag and it stops looking like
anything you want to use after a while
so this is nice just a little travel
pack of those my always carry an eyelash
curler because I know you're really
supposed to curl your lashes before you
put your mascara on and I do that but I
mean it's the ultimate perk up you know
once you've already had your mascara on
for a few hours and then you go like
that it's like okay you know you just
got to be really careful about it I
think other things I've got some
band-aids I don't injure myself too
often on the job but the occasional
blister does happen um I've got some
nail glue this happens to be from Revlon
but just you know it's something there
in case if I'm wearing like fake nails
like this on my fingers or toes that I
can take care of that I've got some eye
drops as well gotta see what I'm saying
there on teleprompter um I have carried
these a lot these Listerine pocket packs
and these are so great I don't know if
you've seen these before
oh jeez I just had my last one today
actually this is empty but um they're
just like little strips of sort of a
film basically that dissolves on your
tongue or the roof of your mouth and
it's minty and it doesn't you know stay
there long like I always drink get up
and drink coffee in the morning and I
really hate actually the taste in my
mouth after I stopped drinking coffee
and I feel like I will gross people out
of my breath afterward
so I always want something minty gum you
know I obviously can't chew that for a
long but as I'm getting ready right
before I go on this is nice because it
dissolves super quick and it really gets
your breath you know nice I kind of
don't want to have offensive breath so
another thing I always take is my Revlon
makeup eraser pen I think I've mentioned
this and like my quick fixes video for
summer but this is basically a little
pin with like makeup remover in it so if
any eyeliner or anything is faded before
I go on and I need to correct it I have
that I use that in conjunction with the
q-tips they also always have my
Maybelline mineral power finishing veil
because I find that this is great to use
with a concealer brush and kind of dab
it under whatever my eye look is and
like for example I'm filming this this
is at the end of my day and I don't have
any eyeliner like dragging down on my
face or at all so this is a nice kind of
like oil absorbing good finishing touch
tech powder I also have a Clinique
powder in here as well on that powder
which all sometimes use but I don't
usually have to end up layering that on
too much yeah that's about it oh I got
one of these Mary Kay retractable
brushes if I need a really fluffy brush
for something and that travels nicely
because it's got the nice little cap on
there so yeah that's basically the stuff
that I always take with me so it's gonna
be in my makeup bag consistently no
matter what start putting that back now
and then you know as for my makeup items
that it kind of varies whether or not I
take them I always take a bronzer or two
that I'm using for the day for example
today it was the Rimmel natural bronzer
and the oh gosh drop dead and the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil matte bronzer I
mean this is not stuff that everybody's
going to need to take in their makeup
bag for work but if I'm getting ready to
go on the air these are good things for
me to have for a touch-up you know I'm
not gonna I never take my foundation
with me we're really even a concealer
with me I've already done that and any
kind of touch-up I need is maybe
something to just make me look a little
more vibrant a little more awake on air
so blushes as well for today that was
the covergirl cheekers and golden pink
as kind of a contour and the one in
plumberry glow which is excuse me a
little bit brighter pink for the apples
of the cheeks so that's good
got a few eye shadows I always tend to
touch up my eyeshadow look today I was
using my covergirl quad and country wood
super light and neutral and then I
deepened up the crease with kind of a
combination of CoverGirl's Browns
smolder which is a matte brown and my
makeup forever kind of sparkly black
that looks insane but I promise it's
just kind of like a dark black nothing
going to it didn't other things I take I
take mascaras with me because sometimes
I want to go over it sometimes I don't
but a great like finishing touch mascara
and great mascara all around but I do
like using it as a finishing touches the
L'Oreal double extend this it has the
white end that's like a primer so if
this was all you were using you've used
the wide end and then you'd use the
traditional mascara and is like your
finishing touch but it's super
lengthening and it works really well on
top of like as a second coat to almost
any mascara this black end does it
really lengthens and I like it on top of
about anything naturally I do run out of
that end before I run out of this one
but it's a great light kind of top coat
you know really make your give you give
a wow effect to your lashes so I like
that I usually take a mascara I usually
take my white eyeliner because whether
or not white eyeliner is something you
like to put on your waterline just on a
day to day basis for me it works wonders
on the air because it makes my eyes look
so much more awake there's something
about just doing that waterline is like
I don't think people we're not in high
def right now we're not to the point
where I think anybody could actually
pick it out that it was on there but it
really functions to brighten up the eye
area so I use the Rimmel soft Kohl in
pure white so
really cheap really good product there
I'll always take my lip products that
I'm using for the day so for that like I
was using my MAC lipstick and craving
today pretty berry shade and usually a
lip liner I'll take with me I'm Jordana
easy liner in plush plum and then a lip
gloss Mac lip blast in steal my heart so
that's kind of a sparkly one yeah pretty
so I always take whatever products I
used and that changes on a daily basis
all this stuff that I talked about I'll
use different blushes different eye
products different lipsticks there's a
lady one time to stop me she's like
what's that lipstick you wear on the air
and I'm thinking oh it could be one one
of about 40 but you know I tried to
figure out which one it might have been
based on what outfit I was wearing but
anyway um I take my eyeliners as well
even though I don't generally touch them
up unless there's been some had a major
issue today I took my Maybelline to
final line which is kind of why I do
smudge out a little bit on the under eye
actually trying out a new little mess
little liner on my upper lash line today
it's look at this mini hard candy liner
so walk the line the liquid eyeliner
it's definitely very deep black I really
like it
but I'm trying that out today it came
with an eye shadow I got recently um
what else do I have in here yeah that's
basically and I take my lip products I
take some liners in case I need to touch
up and I switch up my blushes and
eyeshadow on a daily basis so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video hopefully it
gives you a little insight into what I
do when I get ready for the day you
always have to be prepared that's
something I've learned you never want to
be about ready to go on air and
completely missing something that you
need so badly like you don't want to be
with that lipstick you don't want to be
without eyeshadow if you need it so it's
nice to have that bag kind of prepared
so every day it changes just a little
bit but at the end of the week I kind of
get it all put away where it needs to be
for the weekend
and then I start fresh on the next
weekend and switch out products like I
said kind of daily so thanks for tuning
in guys hope you're having a great week
so far and I will talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
