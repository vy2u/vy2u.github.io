so excited to share this video with you
because it is sharing a storage strategy
that I have come up with that I really
enjoy for my mascara I think it's gonna
work well for you if you have as many
mascaras as as I do and by the way I
have so many because as you know I have
this YouTube channel and I review a lot
of products I try a lot of products I
generally throw them away I mean the
policy I guess is sort of like a three
month three months is how long you
should keep a product like mascara but I
mean I will throw them away sooner or
later depending on how quickly the
texture or the scent changes so
sometimes you know it's a mascara you
barely open up very often and you don't
see that change happen as soon as
something you use daily and then maybe
you use it up faster or not as fast so
those are a couple of factors that I pay
attention to if the formula has
thickened so much that it is dry and
unusable you know get rid of that or if
you notice it's changing the smell so
that is kind of a good reason to go
ahead and smell it when you get it see
what it smells like new and then figure
out where to go from there
but anyway what I'm trying to get at
here is that you could store your
mascaras like I do or you could use this
container I'm going to talk about in
several different ways to divide up
different taller eye products and by the
way in case you didn't know I love this
shirt it's my I love makeup shirt so
anyway let's move on let me show you my
little container and I got it by the way
from the containers store and I never
been to one of these before and I was
like shocked at how much stuff was there
and I could have gotten so much more but
this thing is pretty cool and I got it
for $7.99 alright guys you are now
looking at my mascara storage container
here it actually does have a lid so if
you had smaller items this container
actually just fits right down in the lid
there so if you want to use it like I do
you know you can easily keep them
together it just fits right in so what I
have here are four divided compartments
and I do have a lot of mascara I know
but the way I chose to divide these up
was using the primers or double ended
mascaras in the first part lengthening
mascara is here thickening mascaras are
really volumizing mascaras right here
and basically I call these the miracle
workers here on the end the ones that
you know are kind of like my go-to s
that work really really well for me why
do I think this is a good idea to divide
them up this way I think it keeps me
well aware of the mascaras I have and I
mean I am very into rather than keeping
them in a drawer like I did I felt like
I was losing sight of what I had and
therefore you know time would go by I
hadn't used one in a while before I knew
it it was dry and unusable and I really
needed to get rid of it
so you don't want to keep mascaras too
long like I said about three months is
sort of an average I think mm-hmm for a
lot of people but I thought I would walk
you through at least which ones these
that I like and why I divided them up
the way I do it it comes to the
double-ended mascaras one of my
favorites is probably just the regular
L'Oreal double extend this is a non
waterproof version as pretty much
everything else is that I have I just
don't like really struggling to get the
mascara off at the end of the day but I
like the primer and I find that even on
top of other mascaras this lengthening
side the dark side that's black really
lengthens and works nice on top of
almost anything so really great mascara
here a few other kinds that I've tried
that I enjoy I also like the Maybelline
XXL Pro it's a 24 hour mascara so it's a
double-ended thing they're the XXL
extensions kind of just so-so on i
really wasn't a huge fan of the double
extend beauty tubes and then I've got
this primer from Lancome the seals
booster XL which is decent but not like
I feel like I have to use it absolutely
every time I apply mascara the next
category here are mascaras that I find
to be particularly lengthening one that
I have here is from Smashbox it's the
Bionic mascara and indigo Inc it's
actually a navy blue
I think the L'Oreal telescopic is fairly
lengthening too I've also got I think
the telescopic where was it yeah the
telescopic explosion which has that
small you know little circular spherical
brush there I find that to be
lengthening I've got lash stiletto and
lash stiletto volume in there for
lengthening mascaras also L'Oreal lash
out and the covergirl
what is this I like these lengthening
mascara is a couple of my favorites are
probably the L'Oreal telescopic
explosion I think that's a really good
one and great for getting you know inner
lashes that are harder to get you know
other times and also I do enjoy this
covergirl exact highlights the kind I
have is actually black pearl it's it has
a slight shimmer to it but nothing major
but it lasts really long without
smudging kind of a last blah lash blast
type effect
and speaking of lash blast I have the
lash blast luxe as one of my volumizing
mascara so these are ones that I find
the add thickness not necessarily
thickness and length though so I have
lash blast luxe
there and that one has like sort of a
little sparkle or shimmer to it I have
the Stila major lash I also have the
Rimmel volume flash Max which I like a
lot that's one of my favorites in this
category I also really like the falsies
volume Express a friend just asked me
about this today and she was like just
to really give you false lashes I'm like
no but it you know it makes them a
little bit thicker and longer but
doesn't really compete with false
eyelashes volume Express Express turbo
boost not really wild about it but I
still have some left so I'll still use
it from time to time and one of my
favorites in this category but it hasn't
quite worked its way to like an all-time
favorite is the Hypnose drama what's
interesting is that I actually this is
what's sort of known to be like the
upgrade from regular Lancome Hypnose but
I think I like regular Hypnose better
tell me if you are in the same boat as
me I just didn't find this to be quite
as thickening
as the other I mean it gives me some
length and thickness but it's not the
whole package and so therefore it just
remains in this category and the ones
that I really am a fan of here that I
think are just you know I could grab for
any of these and probably be satisfied
with the look I get our regular Lancome
Hypnose Almay is really getting good
with the hair mascaras this is the
intense eye color light interplay
technology mascara and I think this is
the one that is for brown eyes is called
black flash so it's just a black mascara
but it has a big brush kind of like Dior
show and it is really really good very
nice and volumizing and lengthening
another one that is very similar to that
one that I just mentioned is the grow
luscious from Revlon very pleased with
that you've also got the ultra black
volume glamour from Bourjois and this
one I was pleasantly surprised with it
came in a kit and I loved it and the
others that I have here oh my goodness
it's getting a really windy outside
another almay mascara that i really
enjoy is the triple effect nourishing
mascara and this one I mean it really
does two things very well because of its
brush it has long bristles on one side
short ones on the other so you end up
getting a really good lengthening and
thickening effect there and I also love
the L'Oreal voluminous in carbon black
and original I think they create great
thickness they can also give you pretty
good length as well so basically this is
how I like to organize my mascaras it
keeps me posted on what I have and kind
of helps me decide to Bent depending on
the look I'm going for which kind I want
to use this was a really affordable way
to organize them and if you don't have
this many mascaras which I realize a lot
of people probably don't you could
always store them in such a way so maybe
you have mascaras in one or you have you
know maybe two of different types of
mascaras and then you put eyeliners and
like eyeshadow sticks or something like
that you know like the Jumbo shadow
pencils and another so there's tons of
ways you could do it hope you enjoyed
this video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
