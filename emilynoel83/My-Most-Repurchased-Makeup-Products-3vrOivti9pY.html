great day so far I'm really excited to
share this video with you because what
is a better indicator of really loving a
makeup product than trying it loving it
and then going out and buying it again I
wanted to share with you my most
repurchase makeup products meaning
things that I've gotten and that I've
not only repurchased it once but I've
gotten it another time as well cupcake
do you see her what are you doing she's
ready to play uh-oh now she's back here
hi yes oh my gosh I don't know if I'm
gonna get through this video one other
thing I wanted to mention was on my vlog
Channel I am just put up a video called
ask Emily where I took your random
questions on my facebook page and I just
answered him on there and they range
from like all topics like we're talking
about favorite junk food most
embarrassing moment questions about kids
and just personal stuff too so um it was
fun to do and I'll probably do more of
those but if you want to see it it's
over on beauty vlog cast before I get
into the repurchase products I just want
you to know that there may be other
products that I love that don't get
mentioned in this video just because
maybe I haven't had them long enough to
use them up and repurchase or it's just
maybe not the nature of the product for
me to use it you know over and over and
over again goodness I shadow Xand lip
products I find I'm always rotating in
different colors but certain face
products or certain different eye
products I go through those a lot more
so I'm focusing on the things that I
have repurchased the most and so I think
this is a real testament to me loving
something because it's in my nature to
like try something like I'll try mascara
even though it worked fine I'll want to
go test out a different one you know the
next time I buy one so it's really
saying something right go back and make
repeated purchase that is helpful great
drugstore foundations that I've
definitely repurchased one is Revlon
Colorstay the one for oily to combo skin
this works great probably the longest
wearing foundation
I have it definitely isn't too heavy on
the skin but it gives really nice
coverage matte cover and then also
Rimmel lasting finish this is another
super long wearing foundation you can
tell if I'm repurchasing these that's
really important to me is the staying
power um but this one maybe is a little
bit more hydrating than the Revlon and
this is one my mom loves as well but
those are a couple of great foundations
in my book I also feel like I'm going
through bronzers a lot probably because
I do use a lot of bronzers on air to
warm up my skin and from some really
really bright lights but I also not only
put them on my face but I go down
through this area as well so
everything's even so I just use them a
lot and one great one that is promotor
purchased things is the NYC smooth skin
bronzer and sunny this is overall kind
of a light bronzer completely matte
definitely a recommended product
something I'd encourage you to get if
you're looking for a very
natural-looking bronzer and then one
that's just a little deeper than that is
the Too Faced chocolate Soleil smells
like chocolate I mean it's just
luxurious wonderful makes a great shade
for contouring and things like that and
this is one of those things that I just
don't want to be with it another
contouring powder that works well that
is also paired with a blush is from ELF
and it's the elf Studio contouring blush
and bronzer and so the bronzer as you
can see is a little bit deep if you look
really closely at it you might notice
just the slightest bit like it's not
100% in that but I don't feel like it's
sparkly to the point where you couldn't
use it to contour with so I like that in
the blush shade is actually really
pretty too for eyes Too Faced shadow
insurance great great product for an eye
primer as you can see I'm not going
through a ton of eyeshadows but there
are certain eye primers that I just keep
coming back to and I think this one is
great I remember buying it when this was
fairly new on the market and I remember
the girl at the store saying we just
can't keep these in stock because
they're they're really popular and so
that one has been popular with me
personally for a while always buying in
mascaras because mascaras just don't
stay good for long so if you got one you
like chances are you bought it more than
one
and one that I think has been great for
me it's also my mom and my sister's
favorite it's the Mallee volumizing
mascara comes in a white tube it's got a
nice full brush a formula that's not too
wet not too dry and it keeps the lashes
feeling really flexible all day that so
it never gets to the point where you
feel like oh my lashes are so brittle I
touch one it's going to flake off you
know not overly dry but it also doesn't
smudge doesn't flake it's just kind of
like a powerhouse mascara and if you've
never tried Mally stuff this would be a
good place to start on the drugstore I
really love I'll make it up and grow
this is a terrific mascara as I've been
telling more and more people about it
I've been getting like tweets and
Facebook and comments saying oh I really
love that L my mascara and it's
interesting because I feel like mascara
is one of those products that people
don't generally love them all across the
board you see so many differing opinions
about different ones so when it seems
like a lot of people are liking a
certain one I really know you know this
has been good for me but it's been good
for a lot of you as well it's a super
thick brush very thick and dense
bristles the formula is pretty dry and
that combination of a brush like this
and a formula that's kind of dry it
really grabs sparse lashes and makes
each one stand out this is great for
length - it definitely repurchased on
multiple occasions covergirl LashBlast I
think this is the special like Olympics
packaging that maybe you've seen it
Target or Walmart or somewhere but this
is basically the mascara that's normally
in the bright orange tube and it's
interesting because this kind of grew on
me over time it wasn't initially a brush
I thought I loved with the rubber
bristles and really short bristles and
it's kind of big and but yet it really
does get to those little lashes and make
them stand out and one of the things I
love about this mascara the most is that
it doesn't flake doesn't flake and
smudge wears great throughout the day
and yet it's not waterproof so I can
take it off I'm not a fan of
hard-to-remove mascaras because I feel
like it takes my lashes with it and I'm
like that's not fair
I
all the only thing I really want to put
on my lower lashes is maybelline lash
discovery two reasons it wears really
well and the brush is tiny so it's only
going to get the minimum amount of
product on those teeny tiny lower lashes
and that's really all you want so I
would really recommend this if you're
looking for just the right thing on
those lower lashes they do have a
waterproof version as well but I'm just
using regular and I still have no
smudging is another Holy Grail eye
product is my Revlon precision lash glue
to use with false lashes they have a
black tint and then this is just the
regular I've purchased this I don't know
how many times and I like it because
it's a wand applicator
I used to use like the duo glues which
work well don't get me wrong but this
really fine tip applicator gets the glue
on the lashes just the minimum amount of
glue so it's very controlled and it
dries quickly and it's just very user
friendly I think this is sped up my
eyelash application quite a bit so I
love that so quite a few purchases of
the Maybelline definer brow I have this
in medium brown I used to have it in the
darker shade and I realized well all I
really need is this shade and really the
only place I fill in any more is just
right here I have a scar otherwise I
have naturally pretty full brows this is
a very fine tip so it's going to look
natural when you fill it in it's got a
little comb you could either use that to
come through your brows or it can be a
nice little lash comb to define that I
go through lip liners faster than
lipsticks or lip glosses and it's
probably cuz I don't have as many and I
just feel like when I find what a kind I
like I kind of stick to it so for a
great red lip liner because if you're
doing red lips you've got to have that
nice precise line I love the Rimmel
exaggerate and ravish purchase this
multiple times this one is about on its
way out that's all I have left and but
it's the perfect color it's not too
fire-engine bright but it's definitely
not anywhere near Burgundy and you could
just use that alone with a gloss on top
and it's really pretty I also like the
Jordana easy liners and this one in baby
berry has probably been kind of my most
go to one because it works with such a
range of pinks lighter pinks to even
berry colors this is a good way to
define your lips and I like that whole
line of lip line I've lost the gloss
that I'm 100% sure I went through my
collection and I'm like uh pretty sure I
repurchased that but I'm not sure how
many times but one that I know it's been
go to again and again has been Revlon
Super Lustrous lip gloss and foiled this
was just in the shopping list ideas I
think the reason why I use it so much is
because I'll use it alone or I will
highlight like the center of my lower
lip with it for that look of fullness if
the trick works on top of anything so it
can really be a good all-purpose shade -
some of my most repurchase products I
might have to do this video again once
you know some other things have gotten
repurchased after a while but I think
this gives you a pretty good idea of
what some must-haves are from my point
of view so thank you so much for
watching share your repurchase products
down below and I'll see you next time
bye
