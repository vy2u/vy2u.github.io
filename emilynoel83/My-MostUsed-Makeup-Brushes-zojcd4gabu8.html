today's video is all about brushes and
brushes are something I have a lot of I
rotate through a lot of different brands
a lot of different types of brushes but
I thought it would really be useful to
share those brushes that I really use
the most not saying I use every one of
these brushes every single day but in
this video I actually will demonstrate
the face of makeup that I have on
showing each one of them in action so
you can really see what I'm talking
about I also like to say that well I
think brush sets can be a really good
place to start with brushes it can give
you a nice sampling of different types
you might want to use and I think they
can be a great value as well and I'd be
more than happy to recommend some of
those that I like if you have questions
about that or would like to see maybe a
specific brush sets type of video in
this video you're going to see a real
mix of brands and price ranges and it's
just you know having a lot of brushes
and a lot of options these are the ones
that I settle in and use a lot just
day-to-day starting off with foundation
my favorite foundation brush is my Sigma
f80 this is the flat top synthetic style
brush I think these are some of the best
brushes Sigma does really like this
particular cut because I think it works
great for circular motions it covers
more surface area at one time on my face
than pretty much any other foundation
type brush that I have so I feel like
I'm less prone to getting any sort of
streaky look with my liquid and cream
foundations but rather a very very even
application and one for concealer there
is a baby version of that one called the
p80 that I love using but I feel like
the one I've been gravitating toward
more often from that precision line is
the p80 force one is angle but the
bristles are also nicely tapered so I
think it makes blending really easy
whether I'm doing blending right around
my eye area with concealer or maybe
around my nose I also think this brush
doubles really nicely for highlights um
cream highlights all over my face maybe
it's down my nose brow bars that I use a
lot for setting my under eye concealer
is my Smashbox number two
and brush and this is not necessarily I
think the most special brush out there
it's not like there aren't other things
that could do this job this is just
something I had in my collection I
identified this as actually it's a like
a crease or I blending brush that was
just too big for my eye I felt like it
got me kind of out of control and so I
started using it to apply powder really
lightly and to set my under eye
concealer and it works great so I'm not
saying you need this specific brush but
if you've got anything that you feel
like is a brush that's too big for your
ie really nice for applying that setting
powder to your under eye because as
opposed to a flat concealer brush and
this gives you a much lighter
application you really don't want heavy
powder on your under eye area so this
helps keep it light for just an overall
powder brush I am so loving the elf
complexion brush this is from a studio
line so a three dollar brush but the
more I use this the more I love the way
it's cut it's really got some flatness -
it's very pinched in at the top of that
ferrule get you know nice kind of patted
on applications of powder or I can blend
it in more of a circular motion so for
its shape I love using it for bronzers
so where it's pinched in there you can
kind of use it horizontally I guess in
your cheekbone area I feel like it fits
there really well for me use it really
easily around my hairline so I love a
brush that can multitask
cream blush there is something that is
just absolutely unmatched in my makeup
collection I have nothing that does
exactly what this does it's my elf small
stipple brush the size is perfect I have
a whole video actually raving about this
but look at how I can stipple and those
bristles don't even bend so what I'm
using this to apply a cream blush to my
cheeks I can get just the lightest
possible pressure so I can get the blush
really smoothly and evenly applied but
I'm not messing up the foundation
underneath it's not applying that much
pressure you can also buff in circular
motions if you want to or powder blush
I've kind of been working away from my
Sigma f10 I really like that brush but
mine I've had it for so so long and I'm
noticing a lot of breakage in the
bristles
so I've been picking
up this one a little more on this is a
brush that's sold at Walmart I know for
sure it is part of a kit currently a
face brushes but it's called like the
high def brush collection high def base
brushes and it's so so soft and I love
how dense the bristles are it applies
blush beautifully that angle could make
it great for contouring as well so any
kind of face purpose even powder this
could work well my last face brush is my
ELF studio small tapered brush love this
shape I do have a full review on this as
well it's really really nicely tapered
up to kind of a soft point there that
makes it good for if you want to use it
to set your under eye it can fit in
there but what I'm most likely to reach
for this for is my highlight taking a
highlighting powder going right on top
of my cheekbone keeping that highlight
confined to the very you know small
space that you want that kind of a
powder in this is great for that green
shadows I used to be really into just
using my finger to get those all over
the lid
but as I've used more cream shadows I've
realized that it's much easier to create
a blended look with your cream shadows
like some of those really nice long
wearing ones that you wouldn't
necessarily need to set it's really nice
to use a brush for those because you can
actually get a blended out look with
them and one that I love to use for that
purpose is my Real Techniques shading
brush it's a fabulous size it's not too
big it's just flat enough to be able to
really place that cream shadow exactly
where you want it but just fluffy enough
to actually kind of blend it out some a
couple of eye brushes that I just can't
do without I'm going to talk about him
kind of interchangeably are the Sonia
Kashuk medium shadow brush and the small
shadow brush small shadow brush first
off is a great size a lot of times flat
shadow brushes will be really big and if
you've got small eyes it can make your
shadow end up looking muddy getting
powder all over the place this helps me
really confine it to a small area so
it's great for just kind of patting that
shadow right on say one part of the lid
as opposed to the entire lid the medium
shadow brush
great for covering a little more surface
area it's great for wedging shadow up
into the crease as well I mean these two
having both of these they just work
hand-in-hand so nicely and then I'll
maybe come back to the small shadow
brush and use it to just apply some deep
shadow right there in that outer corner
these are all about placement you can
blend out with something more fluffy but
if you really want to think about
exactly where you're placing your eye
shadows these are so affordable and such
great quality I've had them for a really
long time what I'm looking to maybe
blend out what's in my crease or get a
nice soft wash of shadow in my crease
I'm always wanting my Sigma e25 this is
a wonderfully shaped brush because it's
fluffy but it's also kind of pinched at
the top of that ferrule so therefore you
can use it really nicely in a
side-to-side motion and it wedges into
my crease great that way or you can go a
little more vertical and take more
advantage of the fluffiness of this
brush also and I do want really targeted
color in my crease and maybe I'm trying
to build that shade up to an outer V or
some sort of shape on the outer part of
my eye love this little guy all the
brushes I've mentioned this guy has hung
in there the longest and it's my little
tiny been washed a million times essence
of beauty fine crease brush this is sold
in a duo at CVS stores and this just
fits perfectly in the outer corner of my
eye you might find similar brushes to
this maybe even a pencil brush could do
what this does but I think what makes
this one particularly special is the
mobility that it has you know it's a
small brush but it really does move
around nicely and blend then you want to
blend out those edges you want to get
the most diffused look possible with
your eyeshadow if that's what you want I
love just a plain old fluffy brush this
is my Sigma e-40 this is what I use a
lot however this is a pretty common kind
of brush to find out there if you're
looking for something you know in the
drugstore this is a kind of brush you'll
see quite often and I like using it to
go over the edges of more intense ko
I also like using this to apply
highlights right under my brow because
it's going to give you it's so full it's
going to give you a softer application a
more common brush to a brush that's very
one of the kind in my opinion the Sigma
e36
a very very small precise take on a
blending brush I love what this does the
edge of a crease shade I'll take this
just above my darkest color with sort of
a transition or mid-tone type shade and
I love the softness that I get it's so
wispy yet it's concentrated enough to
give you a distinct application of color
you know what I'm saying
but just in the right spot a cream liner
brush creamer gel eyeliner love my Real
Techniques fine liner browse me the
exact width of line that I'm looking for
I've tried some that are even smaller
than this and I feel like I'm spending
way more time going over the line some
that are giving me way too thick of a
line this is just perfect cleans up
wonderfully well I think Real Techniques
just nailed it with that brush not a
brush that serves a very specific
purpose for me is my angled liner brush
from Sigma this is another kind of brush
that you might see quite a bit in
drugstores but at a lower price I think
a lot of brands are able to do this
brush pretty well you know kind of a
stiff brush not too big and I'll use
this maybe just to finish off my liner
like connect up to my winged eyeliner or
if I've got a really nice dark shadow
and I want to turn that into eyeliner
you know you can take this across your
upper lash line your lower lash line
specialized brush though that I probably
use even more than that angled one is my
Sigma smudge brush the e21 I have
several different smudge brushes you
guys and I tell you they have all done
the same thing to me when I wash them
the little bristles will just start
pointing out in different directions
this one has been washed quite often and
everything still hanging together just
perfectly I love using this for softer
applications of a powder shadow on my
lower
I slogan if I'm doing next to nothing
down here I'll often take just a less
soft shadow and go under here for just a
little bit of definition it's just great
forth and finally I love this Real
Techniques lash and brow
groomer this little comb such an unsung
hero doesn't get talked about a lot but
that comb is just fabulous for going
through my lashes after I've applied
mascara particularly the lower lashes it
gets right in there separates them out
that's it I know I mentioned a lot just
then look doesn't always call for every
brush every day but I mean if I had to
say goodbye to everything else in my
collection and only keep a small amount
these would be the ones that I really
feel like I need like I said
all-encompassing brush sets are great
they're a great place to start if you're
wanting to learn about a lot of
different brushes and get a pretty good
value on them it's got a great kit
called the complete kit I think it gives
you a lot of great basics and I review a
lot of different little brush sets over
on my beauty broadcast Express channel
if you're into that kind of thing I have
a whole playlist of brush videos I also
think different brands can put out some
different things and maybe you know
you've got that brush set that you love
but this video gave you an idea of a few
different things to supplement in and
add to it and maybe make your life a lot
easier when you're putting your makeup
on so thanks a lot for watching guys I
appreciate it and I'll see you next time
