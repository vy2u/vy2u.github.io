my skincare routine and I do get asked a
lot about what i like to use for
skincare and to be honest I've been
putting it off for a little while
because I have been experimenting with
some different products and so I was
like you know how will this fit into my
routine that I share and really what I'm
going to be doing it's taking you
through what I do in the morning what I
do at night some products that I use
occasionally like masks and scrubs and
stuff I'm going to share a couple of my
favorite tinted moisturizers and then
some other products that i have tried
that haven't necessarily made it into my
daily rotation but things i've tried
that i do like and would recommend for
times of the year I think you need to
sort of reevaluate your skin care
routine because my skin kind of changes
I have combination skin I feel like if I
get oily somewhere it's going to be my
nose maybe a little bit my chin in my
forehead and then the rest is kind of
like normal to dry my cheeks and stuff
but then around winter time I feel like
I noticed the extremes even more the dry
gets drier the oily kind of stays the
same and in the summer the oily part
gets oily let's get started with what i
do first at the start of the day when
I've got clean skin I grab my cleanser
it's the deep action cream cleanser for
clean and clear so this is really nice
I'm cream cleansers can be good because
they cleanse your skin but they don't
leave you feeling too dry at the end so
I don't feel like I have that real tight
dehydrated feeling to my skin once i get
done washing my face so that's a good
way to start plus it just has that real
refreshing kind of cooling sensation
almost with this so i think that feels
good in the more sit down to my makeup
area I want to first look to my eyes and
see look at my eyes um but I want to see
if I've got any residue of any kind of
any eye makeup still there because
you're just going to make yourself work
harder to cover up something that
and you know all the way gone in the
first place so I reach for these expert
sensitive gentle eye makeup removal pads
and these are from boots I found this
particular product at my target store
for less than five dollars and it's got
60 pads in there and I mean they're just
real good for swiping off the product
and not irritating a really sensitive
area the underneath my moisturizer I use
the olay regenerist daily regenerating
serum this is sort of an anti-aging type
product but I put it on I like the
smooth feel it gives my skin and also
the fact that it's not real heavy so I
feel like okay I'm kind of doing my step
towards anti-aging it's the premises
that olay regenerist double skin surface
cell regeneration rate versus untreated
skin for a younger looking skin without
drastic measures so that last part is
probably what we all like okay I
understand that but I'll put that on and
they'll go for my moisturizer and it's
the aveeno ultra calming daily
moisturizer with SPF 15 so if it's
summertime and I know I'm going to be
out in the Sun a lot i might reach for
something with a higher SPF than this
but this is oil-free this says
clinically proven to visibly reduce
redness soothe irritated or sensitive
skin so I really got into this when I
was dealing with eczema and had some
severely dry patches on my face and this
was one of the few things that I felt
like I could use without irritating it
further and actually giving my skin some
hydration that it really needs this
Garnier skin renew anti dark circle
roller and this is the one I don't know
if you're familiar with this but it's
got sort of that little roller ball then
going on there so it feels very cool
when it touches your skin and then you
roll it on and you can kind of see it
showing up there almost looking like
concealer and it does do a little bit of
concealing work for you and so that's
nice to have you know before you put on
foundation concealer you might realize
oh I need less because they actually
covered up some of my problem area I do
have a blemish or anything like that my
go-to treatment which I have used for
years and years is the Clean &amp;amp; Clear
Percy jealous
ten percent benzoyl peroxide acne
medication and I just you will use this
if I need to as like a spot treatment so
if I got is it you know I put a little
bit on there I will use this morning and
night if I'm dealing with something like
that one of the most frequently asked
questions I get is what do you do to
take off your makeup and if the answer
is very simple because and have been
doing this for years all throughout
college was when I started and it's the
ole a daily facial cleansing cloths and
these you can buy them like in the
refill boxes or this little this is
little official of a container and they
look like this and I've talked about
this a lot but basically when this
little cloth comes in contact with the
water it's going two sets up for you and
you can take all your makeup off with it
I feel like I can run this over my eye
area and not have any problems with
sensitivity or burning they come in
different kinds for different skin types
and usually one side is more smooth and
one side maybe a little more of a
scrubby side at least that's the way the
ones for combo to oily skin art that's
what I had now I have used the sensitive
skin i have used the dry skin once when
i was dealing with more eczema related
issues and really wanted to cater to the
dryness and not over dry my skin i do
really really like this for getting
everything off because i have a lot of
makeup on my face by the end of the day
with doing news and everything like that
so I want it all off the Garnier
nutritionist ultralift anti wrinkle
firming eye cream so long long name I
feel like this works well for me because
it does not irritate the eye area and
it's not too terribly heavy or anything
like that it has kind of a fresh scent
to it I guess you would say and I just
kind of up put that right sort of around
this area here moisturizer that Tyler
uses as well the Garnier moisture rescue
refreshing gel cream I'll use that at
night as well um sometimes I feel like
I've
issues with using something that's too
heavy on my skin before I go to bed I
don't need a ton ton ton of moisture and
sometimes if I do put on too much of a
different kind of moisturizer I'll not
all have be kind of an oil slick in the
morning number one and number two maybe
you have some breakouts as a result so
this is really great because it's it's
an interesting concept gel cream you
look at it here I got some of my finger
I mean it does look kind of like a gel
but in a sense it feels a little bit
creamy it doesn't feel heavy it absorbs
right into your skin and I just think
it's a good kind of nighttime product
has sort of that fresh maybe cucumber
type scent to it
I keep in the shower is the clean and
clear deep action exfoliating scrub this
you know I talked about the cream
cleanser and this is what I keep their
in the shower and I use it maybe a
couple times a week and it's just very
refreshing feeling and it you know
stuffs off those dead skin cells that
are hanging around on your face it just
gives you a really fresh clean feeling
so yeah I'll like take all my makeup off
and then maybe use that real quick
something I would say I used maybe once
every couple weeks you could do this on
a weekly basis too i love this mask from
Freeman it's the facial clay mask the
avocado and oatmeal and this is one this
one says purges pores and it has a great
great smell you might think I'll ducato
an oatmeal has such a nice scent to it
rich clay mask with added oatmeal and
vitamin E draws out excess oil and dirt
purging clogged pores leaving your skin
clean and soft I like the Queen Queen
Helens mint julep mask as well that's a
good one for sort of getting rid of the
oil the excess oil but this one I like a
lot too and I love that smell
cover girl lets EG smoothers this is an
SPF 15 tinted moisturizer I think this
is really good in terms of blending with
the skin tone because this doesn't come
in a lot of shades most tinted
moisturizers don't so it's really good
at kind of being a chameleon and working
with different skin tones you know with
the different ranges it doesn't get you
overly oily if you are a you know teen
and you're looking for just light light
coverage this would be a good thing to
try and then another one that I like is
from aveeno and it's the positively
radiant tinted moisturizer which carries
with it a little bit more coverage maybe
and it's really one of those things it's
going to give you that glowy dewy effect
if you got real oily skin this might not
be for you but if you have dry skin and
want a little more radiant and less
chalky maybe with your makeup on you
could wear this under your makeup you
can get the regular positively radiant
but this has an SPF 30 in it so let's
say you know big outdoor day is planned
and you're going to be out in the Sun
quite a bit this is going to be light on
your skin because it's just a tinted
moisturizer or not a foundation and it's
not that that good amount of sunscreen
No
that kind of wraps up my skincare
routine i hope you enjoyed this video if
you have any questions let me know I
know this was a lot of products to talk
about but many of the things I mentioned
our drugstore products so very
affordable too so thanks so much for
watching guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
