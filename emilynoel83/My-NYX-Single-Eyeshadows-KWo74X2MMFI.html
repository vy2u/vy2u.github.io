and it may be one of the things that i
am hearing the most buzz about whether
it's through messages or my facebook
page or just on the internet in general
and it's NYX NYX it's an affordable
brand of makeup but they carry a lot of
highly pigmented products and a lot of
people love their eyeshadows singles and
I am slowly building my collection I
have five of these right now and I know
that's not a lot I have some of the
trios that I've gotten on cherry culture
calm that's where you can find the
singles as well Ulta I have found a
couple of my singles at but I feel like
this these single shadows have kind of a
special quality to them I don't know if
they're necessarily different than the
ones in the trios but they're nice and
you know we're just talking about
individual shades sometimes you can find
these same shades I think in a set so
anyway just taking you through the ones
that I have and what I think about them
first off I'll go with the one that I
actually got first and it's burgandy
curl and this shade is so pretty this is
the shade that may have gotten me
started on when I like go with like a
slightly pinky shade up above my crease
shade just to kind of warm the look up
such a pretty color it's got that little
bit of a metallic feel to it really
pretty kind of a berry shade for the
eyes there's then I came up with cherry
and I think both of those shades I found
at Big Lots when they were selling some
overstock NYX stuff this is a matte
shade so just to swatch that it's gonna
be a true like red so that's fun to sort
of use for the same purpose I just
described with the burgundy pearl or you
can go ahead and like I've seen the red
used in the crease and then you kind of
just deepen it with on the outside with
put some black and it's actually really
pretty so that is cherry um the other
shade I have I'm kind of going in
chronological order from when I got
these is volcano and this
is kind of a shimmery really pretty
brown this one I really enjoyed it's
very soft and can therefore come off
like a little bit chunky as you can see
as I just watched that like it's a
little like I'm going to tap off a
little bit came off a little bit chunky
there at first but it's got this
gorgeous kind of taupe shimmer so I
think of it as like a brown taupe
metallic shimmer it's very very metallic
that shade is volcano then I got a shade
called rock because I'm always up for a
black shade I feel like I used black so
frequently just with any color
combination to deepen the crease or to
set my liner or something and rock is
kind of like a shimmery black kind of
like a very very deep charcoal black got
that on my pinky there the shimmer
really does come through it's really
pretty I mean that's one of my favorites
out of all of these so far
well actually of everything that I
talked about burgundy pearl and rock are
my favorite two that I have and then the
last one I have ironically it's called
my favorite color but I think it's my
least favorite of these it looks pretty
it looks pretty in the in the palette or
in the container there but of all of
them I think it might be the most like
kind of chalky of them all like it has a
nice white shimmer but you've got to
kind of be careful how you use it you
know I don't know it's just it's not my
favorite but it is pretty I mean it's a
light shimmer but it just doesn't seem
to have the same smooth velvety quality
as these other ones
so in conclusion mix is definitely doing
something right with their eyeshadows I
feel like they're nice nice and
pigmented if I were to swatch some matte
shadows alongside these I mean it's that
same kind of color quality that really
pops that shade I mean that's fantastic
and I was barely like rubbing that on my
finger there but it looks really good
and then burgundy pearl is just kind of
unique I think
shapes that I have are great but I feel
like sometimes people get into this
discussion topic on my Facebook paper
somewhere else you know like what what
are the best ones so I would love if you
would put your favorite but if you had
to narrow it down to one favorite NYX
single that you then that was the only
one you could use what would it be
I'm going to have to go with just four
how unique it is I'm gonna say burgundy
pearl for me but what would you say type
it down below and thank you so much for
watching my review I thought everyone
have an awesome day and I will have more
videos this week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
