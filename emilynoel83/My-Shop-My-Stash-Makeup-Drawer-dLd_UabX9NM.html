different kind of video it's pertaining
to my makeup storage and a little change
that I made to the way I've got
everything set up here and the thing
that prompted all of this was a video
that I found from Jessica Braun she's
great here on YouTube I recently found
her I'm really glad I did she's got
great videos just great useful content
fun to watch like her a lot and the
first video I saw from her was her
showing her everyday makeup drawer I
think she may have called it basically
she took one drawer of her makeup
storage and really organized the things
in there that she wanted to use on a
daily basis I noticed she had some
things in there that might have been a
little bit older products like
rediscovered type things and maybe some
newer things as well and I thought
that's really what I need to do with my
makeup storage because I love shopping
my stash as we say I love going through
my older things and kind of pulling
things out that I haven't used in a
while things that have been neglected
and putting them in a little basket so
I'll remember to use them well that
basket always gets like covered up by
something else or it gets pushed aside
for whatever reason it's become very
easy for me to make a mess especially
with all this holiday palette stuff and
ignore the basket so I thought if I kind
of ship things around in my storage and
open up that top drawer that's kind of
under my desk here put a few little
clear kind of storage elements in there
and I can put the things that I've shot
my stash for in here or maybe there will
be some newer things that I really want
to make a point to use whatever the case
may be I'll fill it with every type of
makeup face products eye products lip
products that I really want to make sure
that I use but I plan to fully swap this
drawer out like on a monthly basis I may
not make a whole lot of sense but I
really want to keep it fresh with old
things so you know I want to put those
things in there they have not yet been
seeing enough use and keep them fresh in
my mind and something about having them
in that drawer it's like that is a
drawer I'm gonna open they have their
own space it's easy to get some of these
new fabulous things and be like oh it's
new I love it you know but we really
want to stay rooted in some of the
things that you've been trying for a
long time and the drawers that I have
these are the IKEA Alex drawers the
wider ones that I have here and I'm just
using my top drawer for the
all right so this is the drawer as you
can see I've got a few little storage
thingamajigs in here this is just a
little random container that happened to
fit that space a long skinny container
and then this whole big thing right here
from like here over is a storage
container that I got at Target and then
this one right here I believe I found
that at t.j.maxx and it had a few little
lift out compartments so I took out some
of the dividers so I would have a couple
of longer areas to put things in but
let's just go through really quickly on
some of the different things that I have
in here that I wanted to try that NYX HD
foundation that was featured in my
favorites and Doug's video again not
really sure what to think of this thing
it's not doing a lot for me but I'm
still kind of playing with it with
different foundations oops that's
supposed to be in here I had a couple of
the infallible Pro matte foundations
that I just wasn't using too much and I
had to have a couple colors because the
first shade I got was vastly dark for me
so I had 107 fresh beige which is this
but this is the one I've ended up
working and that is sorry 104 golden
beige so I've been using those more I
thought they kind of separated a little
bit on me but apparently I've shaken
them to the point that they're not
separated anymore so whatevs
this is my NYX CC cream kind of a color
correcting peach type cream so I've been
playing with that some more I've got my
it cosmetics bronzer type thing because
I wanted to continue kind of blending
that in with other foundations my old
standby Revlon Colorstay been wanting to
use my Estee Lauder perfectionist some
more and also this Jordana complete
cover I still need to grab for this I've
been using some of the other foundations
more and hadn't been using this but I
have this in honey olive so I'll report
back on that I really want to review
that one I've got kind of a variety of
concealers here that it's CC cream that
has sort of the cooling tip really like
that it's a very different texture from
there bye-bye under-eye I think I like
this one better plus it's got quite an
SPF in there and
this wake me up concealer from Rimmel is
like a newer thing that I've been
wanting to use it's something I'm not
using so much for the coverage but more
for brightness wanting to use this
benefit Air Patrol eye primers that just
stuck in there and then this is the
tarte maracuja miracle found sealer
foundation concealer combo really like
that when it came out but didn't
continue using it a whole lot so I
wanted to use it more couple of
concealers here NYX dark circle
concealer which I'm finding is just a
little too light to be very corrective
on me and the shade I have it in is fair
so maybe I need a deeper shade and this
is my Bobbi Brown concealer and powder
duo in the shade and natural so you get
a little yellow toned powder there my
nose itches Oh way back here I've got my
Estee Lauder loose powder which I love
but I've just been I don't know grabbing
for pressed powders more recently so I
wanted that one out and also this thing
which has been untouched in my
collection for quite some time it's the
airspun loose powder in translucent
extra coverage I've been using it
feeling like I can't quite pull it off I
don't know I feel like it's pretty cakey
on me
maybe it's the foundations I'm combining
it with maybe I need to really try to
pair that with some more moisturizing
type foundations will see this Mac prep
and prime CC the shade called
adjust it's kind of a peachy shade it's
really a little more peachy in person
than it looks on camera but I had
thought I was gonna use that to set the
under eye and it would be extra
corrective because it was peachy powder
but it seems to it work better just all
over my face as just a light little
setting powder it's not the most
luxuriously textured powder ever not
SuperDuper soft but I'm still kind of
liking it all over as opposed to just on
the under I got an hourglass powder I
just don't know why I can't get into
these things too much but I've got
diffused light I've had this for a while
I have not used it hardly at all it does
have a little bit of glow to it even
though it's been in this drawer I've
been bad about actually reaching for it
so I'm just being real with you here
this brand is from Ulta kind of a random
brand I think it's called to be
sweethearts blush lollipop just a pretty
standard pink blush to be honest with
you there's nothing ma
think about it there's nothing really
bad about it this is my laura geller
Dreamsicle blush I love this shade I'm
so glad I brought this back total
rediscovered love there these would come
under the heading of new things that I'm
meaning to use I haven't quite used yet
they're the city color cheek stains
they're really pigmented I have to
swatch them but I need to use them on my
cheeks makeup revolution vivid baked
highlighters I have all three shades of
those although only two are in here so
this is peach lights and this is radiant
lights I have the golden lights when I
think that one's my favorite and it
continues to be my favorite it just I
don't know it seems very pigmented it
seems like an even better texture than
the other two
I got this Mac mineralized skinfinish
and give me Sun and I've been using that
on and off it's a really light kind of
warm bronze II type powder and I'm
liking it I'm liking it around the
hairline even softly kind of as a blush
it looks pretty a few little palettes
that I'll point out to you that I've
been using this is when I got recently
off of Haute look I couldn't believe I
hadn't tried this one before but it's
the Too Faced smoky palette really liked
it actually I'm very pretty very
pigmented shades and those shades across
the top are the ones that I found myself
reaching for a lot cloves and up and
smoked very pretty colors this is that
Sephora Pantone universe facets of
marsala palette I think it was called
and I just thought it looked so super
fall-like and I hadn't messed with it a
whole lot since I first did a video or
two on this so I really wanted to bust
this out and use it some more and their
great quality shadows I love this thing
and then the third palette I picked out
I think I mentioned this or showed a
look I did with it on snapchat it's the
Mallee loving life shadow palette and I
have pretty much all of her palettes
like this and this one's a lot of fun
the textures of these shades are
interesting I mean they're really
buttery and creamy smooth but you don't
have like straight-up flat matte shades
it's like there's a little bit of Sheen
in all of these this is a really rich
Burgundy really pretty alongside that
pink also love this bronzy shade here
along with the purple that's a beautiful
duo and an intro
kind of mint green in this palette as
well so a lot of cool colors to work
with and you have the base in there also
which i think is best used very very
lightly you don't want to go overboard
with that base and goodness just a few
other things in here I've got an
infallible single this is the endless
pearl I was using this a little bit
multitasking as a highlight which is
kind of nice especially if you don't
like super girly highlights pulled in a
couple of pretty color pop shadows baby
tee is that blue and cush is that really
like highly shimmery taupe shade this is
a nice little bareMinerals duo that has
not been getting it nearly enough love
but it is fantastic it's called the
promise and it's got this buttery really
yellowy soft shade there on the left
just a total sunshiny type shade and
then a matte taupe color on the right
and it's really great very easy to use
just great for a quick look I also
pulled in this prestige total intensity
shadow it's one of those sort of like a
duo chrome type shade there with the
teal and it almost looks a brownish at
times as well that shade is called
hocus-pocus and then also this sample
duo from bareMinerals called the
epiphany so there's your really shimmery
taupe and matte Brown soft lips cube lip
balm love love love that thing I've been
meaning to use this one that's melted in
melted berry Revlon Colorstay moisture
stains I adored these products so much
why did I not use them more so I put one
in here to use it this is the next
begone lip color remover I've been
reaching for this quite a bit
just as I'm lip swatching and going
between shades it would appear that I've
used a ton of it but I think this was
not super full when I started so these
are the LA girl endless semi-permanent
Auto lip liners I've been wearing these
I would say they're not semi-permanent
they're nice lip liners they're pretty
colorful and I like these particular
shade but they're just not quite as long
wearing as you might expect but there's
dark plums that one this one is natural
and then this shade is wine this is love
that red lipstick from the Revlon Super
Lustrous line heading
reach for this one in ages and I still
haven't used it so this one needs to
take priority now in this drawer if you
haven't tried these maybelline matte
lipsticks from the color sensational
line they're really nice and this is the
shade called lust for blush so I wanted
to use that one some more hasn't been
reaching for pinky shades of that tone
really in general lately too much you
see me go in here you see me doing this
one-handed I got this Tarte Amazonian
clay waterproof brow mousse and medium
brown and I fear it's getting a little
dry for me it used to be super super
creamy and now it's starting to dry out
malee shadow sticks that I want to use
more of love champagne I've talked that
one to death
but two of the shades that I have not
used as much our camo and cobalt and
camo is just this really pretty deep
shimmery forest green I love that shade
a couple of mascaras that I just need to
be using before they dry up and go bad
my benefit roller lash which has been OK
for me it's better at holding curl than
a lot of things I have and L'Oreal
voluminous does not look very well but I
do love the way it builds volume on my
lashes and then the liners I pulled out
a couple of those Smashbox liners with
the twist off caps that kind of self
sharpened the ends I really like those I
like the way they go on I wish they were
a little more long wearing but I have
the blue and black there and then those
are the bombs mr. right now liners I
have a nude and kind of a berry burgundy
shade to try I haven't really gotten to
the ones from the balm yet but I have
been using these from Smashbox and I
love that blue that's a really true
beautiful blue the shade name on that
one is midnight so I hope that was
somewhat interesting or helpful to you
to kind of go through that drawer with
me if you'd like me to do more updates
on this drawer as I swap it out and put
new things in it every few weeks I'd be
happy to do that let me know if you're
interested and I will talk to you guys
again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
