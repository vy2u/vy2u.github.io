is long overdue I've been wanting to do
my general TV news makeup routine for
you guys for quite a while now but as
you may know I anchor for a morning news
program and that requires me to get up
that oh 1:30 of the morning so I have
had trouble getting the motivation
although I love making videos just
getting the motivation to put a big
smile on my face and make a video for
you guys so I went ahead and did this on
the weekend when I had plenty of time to
do it for you so basically um don't
expect this to necessarily be your
typical how-to video because I am going
to kind of go through things quickly and
sort of edit out you know take you
through every step but I might not fully
show everything because a lot of you
were just curious you know what's
different steps I take when I'm on
camera than when I'm off camera and that
kind of thing so um anyway it's just
going to be kind of okay here's what's
going on kind of video so I hope you
enjoy it and if you have any questions
specifically pertaining to makeup for
broadcasting please let me know I'm
really not sure who out there has a real
interest in this kind of thing for some
of you it's going to be kind of an oh
that's interesting sort of video and for
others it may be actually informative
for you in your field so please let me
know if you have further questions on
this and enjoy the vid guys the very
first thing I do every day is I pluck my
eyebrows just remove any stray hairs
doing it daily just keeps anything from
building up and you never really have a
huge problem on your hands on any given
day and then I am apply moisturizer I
usually use for daytime the be luscious
vibrancy day lotion it's got SPF 15 in
it so I like to use something with an
SPF during the for the daytime hours um
and that just kind of you know get your
face kind of revved up for the day and
then I go ahead and I'm going to apply
some Smashbox photo finish primer this
is a good one and so is the UM
Rimmel fixin perfect I'm going to do a
primers video here shortly so you can
learn a lot
but more about them but anyway just
apply that over all over your face it's
going to help smooth out you know any
problem areas
next comes the foundation usually for
work I use the Rimmel lasting finish
it's number 200 and soft beige and I
just lately I'm gonna just for speed
I've been using my fingers just getting
it on my hand dotting it all over and
just rubbing it in and being careful to
get it up to my hairline around my
eyebrows this is a really nice long
wearing foundation it doesn't break down
under bright lights or it's not really
it's relatively unaffected by high
humidity and things like that so I
really really like it you can see I'm
just working it in all around my eyes
yes I will go in there with a concealer
but this can take care of some of the
problems so you don't have to use as
much concealer if you use foundation
first so that's kind of the idea there
after I apply foundation I go through
with a sponge and just make sure that
around my jaw and my hairline everything
is perfectly blended in so around my
eyebrows to my eyes this just helps to
ensure that you know you're not going to
catch yourself with a ring around your
face basically okay and then once you've
done that I go in with my concealer I
used several different kinds really I
like the Bobbi Brown creamy concealer
kit lately I've been using because it's
a little bit lighter and I do try at
least during the summertime season to
keep things a little bit lighter in
terms of the makeup just because I am
outdoors sometimes doing stories and I
find that it holds up better if you
actually do it lighter so I've been
using the Kat Von D tattoo concealer
which is just really an all-purpose
concealer in light and I get a little
bit of that on my finger and once again
you know your fingers can be the best
tools I put a little on the outer
corners of my eye
and then I just go in and around this
whole area that can look a little bit
dark sometimes
and repeat on the other eye um lately
I've been using this powder I found at
Big Lots
it's from Revlon and it's the new
complexion corrective powder and uh it's
an even out and it's a yellow tone
powder which is really great using this
brush I also got from Big Lots and I use
this to set the concealer this yellow
tone powder is just fantastic for
setting concealer yellow tone powder
also comes in the bobbi brown creamy
concealer kit but to kind of save money
and you know kind of conserve that I've
been using this and then we're going to
take some loose powder to set the whole
foundation that we applied I'm going to
use my Mary Kay signature powder in
beige one this just powder just in
itself has a good amount of coverage so
I like that I'm gonna get it on this
random brush that I've had it for a long
time just got it from Walmart works
great for powder though it's soft it's
full it's just a nice oops I don't know
why I got funky there on me for a second
but it's it really is a nice brush for
all over face powders
now that I've got the powder all over
generally next I go for some bronzer I
like to use a matte bronzer all over my
face just to kind of perk up my overall
skin tone I do this winter or summer
doesn't matter this is the powder
bronzer in light from Milani a nice
basically matte powder you might see a
little bit of pearlescent qualities in
that but really overall it is it goes on
very matte so I just put that all over
my face focusing even more product on
the areas where the Sun would naturally
hit me so temples around my forehead
nose chin and then kind of using it for
an added contour here around my cheeks
tops of cheeks just really trying to
warm up the whole complexion and because
I mean bright lights you know you're
sitting under bright lights you need to
do a little more in the way of you know
bronzer and stuff like that and then I'm
going to use a different tone bronzer
which is from Wet n Wild and it is
trying to find out its Bally bronze is
the shade and you can see it's deeper
and it has a little bit of shimmer to it
and so therefore I like to use two tones
of bronzer I would recommend this as a
tip for everyday makeup as well go over
those main areas where you want to
either slim the face or give yourself
even more of that tan glow just a little
I use it with a little bit lighter touch
than I do the other powder but it just
adds something just to you know give
yourself a little bit of contrast rather
than flat you know matte tan everywhere
because while matte is good it's not the
only thing you need I'm gonna grab my
blush here then I want to contour the
cheeks and I'm for that I use my
covergirl blush cheekers blush in golden
pink greatest contour shade ever in my
opinion
sucking and go
this is another step that I go heavier
on for news than I do on every day you
know day to day just kickin it at home
kind of look really helps
I mean gives your face a nice look on
camera when you've got a little more
contour there and may want to contour
the forehead a bit and contour the chin
just a bit go under the jawline another
thing that's very important and I
usually do it more so when I get to work
is focus on the decollete area just
getting making sure that everything
matches up we have some extremely bright
lights where we can do our makeup in
front of and that kind of helps me see
how it's all playing out from head to
neck and all that and then I'm going to
do a blush kind of on the apples of my
cheeks blush is so important and when
you're on camera just to give your face
a look of health this is the Milani
minerals blush in my tie pretty peachy
pink looks great on all skin tones
focusing that on the sort of the knot
right in here because I don't want
redness I don't I don't want any look of
any redness around my nose so keeping it
kind of on the outer portion of that
apple of the cheek area
now all the face steps are done except
for one I like to use some sort of loose
powder to set my makeup with and I tried
it and I'm not talking loose in the way
of like the Mary Kay loose powder which
had a lot of coverage - I try to use
something
SuperDuper light because I don't want to
really add any more product to my face
but I do just want that overall dusting
overall this it just makes me feel
better to know that it's there and for
that I really like to use the bare
minerals mineral veil and it's just
really really light product doesn't put
any added color on my face but it does I
feel like helped things just stay a
little better so I'm using my fluffy
kabuki brush
same one I used for the you know the
bronzer and everything and just getting
that all over alright guys time for eyes
it doesn't ever freak you out when I'm
like coming up on here and one eye is
totally done and the other eye isn't it
it kind of freaks me out to look at
myself that way but the eyes are so
important when it comes to TV I mean you
are delivering the message to people and
it's practically like they you know you
think you're making eye contact with a
news person when you're watching them on
TV the eyes are so important and I'm
going to show you what I typically do
however there really isn't a typical in
terms of my eye makeup I do I don't know
if the viewers ever would notice but I
do switch it up from day to day like I
mean I'll use brown tones if I'm wearing
something creamy or neutral I'll use
shades of grey and black if I'm wearing
a lot of black I'll use purples I've
even used blues and greens at times the
key is just keeping any color you use
very subtle because you do not want to
distract obviously from the message
you're giving us so yeah I do switch it
up on a daily basis I mean I've got a
lot of products to use and I would hate
to just get in a rut and use the same
thing day to day so I'm just going to do
something that is sort of typical I
guess and we'll just leave it at that
but what I've already done is put on my
Too Faced shadow insurance then I'm
going to grab this is a Smashbox trio
and in smokey eyes it was part of the
masters class expert eyes set I'm not
sure if this is being sold individually
or not but you could probably find
similar shades what it is is am sort of
golden a neutral shade a matte Brown and
a plum shade that is very similar to
Mac's sketch so I'm going to use that
lightest shade there the one with sort
of golden a tone and this is very much
just the shade of my skin I try not to
use anything too overly sparkly or
metallic on my lids when I'm doing the
news because it does strangely really
pick up kind of
right on the camera I got a lot of
lights on you and anything with a really
reflective quality will show up maybe
more than you want it to so this isn't
too overboard so I'm just putting that
all over my lid and then what I do is
I'm going to take my essence of beauty
brush the larger of the two that come in
that 2-pack of crease brushes going to
go for that matte brown shade and
basically just work this in all over my
crease and you know some people might
say well you're up that early in the
morning is too much contouring and stuff
like that and dark shades going to make
you look tired well really I think it
gives you depending on how you use it if
you're using these shades right it
you'll get kind of a lifted look I mean
you can tell from one eye to the next
this eye is a little a little bit lifted
seaming so um then I'm going to take the
smaller brush and go into this purpley
shade and I'm just going to kind of do a
little bit of an outer V I don't make it
too pronounced but I do focus in you
know more of that shade right here in
the in the corner and you know that's
pretty typical of what I would usually
do and then to kind of blur that whole
edge and give me a little more warmth up
here like I said no metallic bright
whites up here it will it won't come off
that well and where's my brush okay and
I just held this up this is not what I
was looking for um yeah there it is
found it okay um where was I okay I'm
using a sort of golden e shade up here
as a highlight this is covergirl
cheekers in golden sunset might look a
little bold here in the packaging but I
just use a light touch with the Sephora
rounded crease brush and I just kind of
buff out the edge of the
my outer-v that we created there go all
the way up to the eyebrow with this this
just warms up the whole the whole face I
mean I've got a lot of space here not
everybody has a lot of space between
their eye and their brow so I feel the
need to you know kind of fill that in
with some sort of color there that is
not go you know straight up white
because that's a big swath of my face
there um anyway now we basically got the
shadow done I just go for my liner it's
pretty much always Revlon Colorstay
liquid liner in blackest black for the
top lash line and just go in I keep it
close to my lash line
now I do wing that out just a little bit
but I'm going to connect up to that with
some of my Revlon Colorstay pencil liner
in black brown I mean black Brown is
very close to their black I'll sometimes
use blackberry which is a purpley tone a
plum toned liner that is nice for
purplish looks but either way I'm just
using black Brown today and I just blend
up to that corner just like so kind of
flicking upward and then I just keep it
right in that lashline and for those of
you who think you know liner all the way
around the eye you know is that a little
harsh or whatever well it does see I
mean it seems to work in terms of you
know you're on camera and you really
want I tend to like the focus to be on
the eyes and um you know bright lights
you've heard me say bright lights a
zillion times but it is a big part of
why I do the things I do so you know you
can easily get washed out it's my point
so if you want to show up you need to
you know make it a little darker and
provide a little more emphasis now I
don't know if I even told you what I
just did there just took the matte Brown
here and this angled liner brush and
just went over it to sort of set that
and then something I always do put my
cat back on here I always go for some
kind of setting powder whether it's the
mineral veil or the Maybelline mineral
power just translucent to finishing veil
powder I grab my concealer brush that I
reserved for just dry products and I
apply this right under where I did that
liner to make it stay throughout the day
there are oils in that liner and I don't
want them to run down or seep down in
any way so it's like this is me telling
them to stay put don't go anywhere
and then I go ahead and curl my
eyelashes with my ELF eyelash curler
I really rotate my mascaras this happens
to be the covergirl volume exact it's
honestly I do use more often than not
especially lately I've just been using a
lot of false lashes and it's not always
the whole strip what I'm going to put on
here in a second is just the half strip
that you put on the outside just to give
you a little more fullness there and I
find when I do that you know it kind of
your mascara doesn't have to do as much
work for you basically so you can kind
of use whatever mascara you want really
all right these are the lashes I'm
talking about you can see they're not
the full strip they're just real short
if lately I've been getting a little
faster with this and I'm just able to
work the glue on there and use sort of
the tip to spread it along just like
that okay
then we let that get tacky and then we
put them on alright guys just got the
false lashes on there it's just again
that half strip that gives you a little
fullness on the outsides and I also did
my brows which basically entails just
taking some matte brown eyeshadow this
is from L'Oreal and deep mocha and I
just take my little brow brush which was
sitting around here somewhere but I just
used that to kind of fill in just on the
outsides because I mainly on this
eyebrow I have like a little bitty scar
and I just fill that in other than that
I used a little bit of clear brow gel
and then just brush them sort of down
into place and that basically works for
me for just an everyday routine there
and then in terms of my lips generally I
do like a lip balm or something and I
usually put this on so it's kind of
moisturizer my lips throughout my makeup
application so I'll put this on like
when I moisturize this one is a lip
smacker in raspberry mil and it smells
delicious and then I go ahead and do a
lip liner on this one is from Jordana
available at like Walgreens stores it's
in baby berry and basically
I just line next um I do like I said
with my eyes I will switch up my lip
colors kind of on a daily basis as well
because I've got a lot of lip products
to use so um you know sometimes I will
go with more of a new usually I don't go
entirely nude usually I like to have a
little color there just so I think it
brings some brightness to your face on
camera I'm using this shade from Rimmel
it's the Rimmel lasting finish in
metallic seduction and I will really
like this shade it's kind of like berry
toned with some nice reddish undertones
and I'll apply that kind of money you're
seeing me put it sort of on the outer
portions here of my bottom lip and then
I use like a lighter gloss in the middle
of my lips like this one is from wet &amp;amp;
wild and it is bronze berry it's one of
the mega slicks not exactly my ultimate
favorite but it does look kind of nice
with this lipstick and center it in the
middle of your bottom lip and you got
that nice little shine there guys thank
you so much for watching this video of
my TV news makeup look it is something
that I go through every day it takes me
in reality probably about 20 minutes
from start to finish counting the
eyebrow tweezing and that kind of thing
and and some of you might be thinking
like wow that's fast or some might be
thinking can how in the world do you
stand to put that much time into it but

time into it as well so I hope you guys
