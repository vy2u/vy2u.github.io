but I really wanted to give you an
update on my TV news makeup routine this
is specifically for high definition
television TV news you're not only
working with some of the highest quality
cameras that can show everything but
also really really bright lighting and
there are some different strategies that
you'll see in this video that will help
you kind of work with those different
elements to give yourself a look that
actually comes off natural on TV cameras
but it can cover a lot of flaws as well
I've been fortunate since my first video
I did on this years ago to come in
contact with a lot of fellow
broadcasters across the country who are
also news anchors like me and through
Twitter Facebook various places we've
shared so many tips back and forth a lot
of people don't realize is with me
personally being a beauty vlogger slash
video maker I'm constantly reviewing
product so even when I'm doing the news
in the morning there's almost constantly
some sort of makeup experiment happening
on my face I might be trying a new
foundation or testing out some new eye
makeup or something like that and I
don't think viewers necessarily realize
that but by the end of the day I know
whether or not something has worked so
I'm using a lot of different products
every day switching up the look quite
often but with what I'm doing in today's
video these are some tried-and-true
makeup products that I really feel like
work on camera many of them are from the
drugstore with just a few exceptions
because I know when you're starting out
as a news reporter the money thinking
about splitting this up into multiple
parts but I just figured you know let's
just make this video the whole makeup
routine and then maybe in the future we
do something on makeup for men hair
outfits touching up different things
like that let me know what you want to
see if you're not in TV news this may
still be interesting to you and there's
really a lot that can translate into
everyday life I think you'll
specifically see me point out different
things where you know this is
that really works well for the camera
it's my overall strategy for
high-definition I'm trying to go for
light layers of the heavier makeup and
really concentrate more on code I look
for this is going to be really natural
something that can match pretty much
anything you decide to wear and try to
popular belief many of the news anchors
and reporters you're watching on TV do
not have a makeup artist helping them
with anything if ice are on our own with
this so I hope this is helpful and
here's how to get the low starting out
on completely clean skin I take some of
this I chill this is from Ally beauty
and it has this great little
stainless-steel cooling applicator and
this is just this comes in huge in the
mornings when you're tired and your eyes
you know are actually kind of puffy and
this physically works to de-puff the eye
and it has a lot of good like anti-aging
ingredients as well then I take my ol a
complete moisturizer this is for
combination oily skins really a good
amount of moisture without making me
feel greasy throughout the day next I
use a primer this is my malli perfect
prep poreless primer and it has kind of
a whipped sort of mousse souffle type of
consistency there it's super smooth and
I just put this all over my fingers is a
good barrier between your moisturizer
and your foundation helping your
foundation go on really smooth and
evenly this just takes the texture of
your skin and evens it out everywhere at
this under your eye area too and see
less fine lines after your foundation
and concealer goes on we're foundation
I'm using my Revlon Colorstay whipped
this is a really nice blendable formula
that I think actually has a really
natural finish on the skin so I'm just
kind of going to patch this on certain
parts of my skin here just get it
roughly where I want some of the makeup
to be then I'm using this great flat top
kabuki buffer brush from Sigma to get it
blended all over
I feel like this keeps my foundation
from looking too thick yet it gives a
really nice even application but there
the application of foundation obviously
the less visible look of makeup you have
on camera
so that's what I'm going for here making
sure I blend right up into my hairline
also down the jaw and this brush is real
easy because you can take it down the
neck just a little bit for concealer I'm
using the hidden agenda concealer
palette from Sonia Kashuk this is a
brand available at Target this is such
nice coverage and it just doesn't end up
looking too thick at the same time so
you got several colors here once a
powder these are all creams this is sort
of like a neutralizer type cream for
real discolored areas but I tend to go
between the top two here and I just
begin going in around my under eye area
and you'll notice if you've got any sun
spots if you've got age spots or
anything like that this really attacks
those problem areas nicely when I do my
under eye concealer I try to get it
right up to the lower lash line go do a
little bit around my nose this concealer
palette has a great little setting
powder here and it's really thin and
lightweight so it doesn't make you look
cakey chalky you know on your concealed
areas but what it does do is modify
those areas so you don't see the shine
of like a freshly applied creamy type
concealer because that can make your
bags or uneven texture you know under
your eyes look even more obvious
actually even though you correct color
you don't correct texture so that's what
that powder there helps with I take my
powder this is NYX stay matte but not
flat and it actually has some nice
coverage while still looking really nice
and natural so you can take the sponge
that it comes with and then we're
basically kind of just pressing this
product into the skin it's going to give
you you know the old most ultimate like
kind of flawless appearance it's going
to help with the staying power of your
makeup and like the name implies I feel
like it doesn't end up looking really
bryon chalky on the face like some
powders can and so you're just kind of
pressing that in all over next meet one
of my best friends matte bronzer he's
great and I use him every day and it's
Revlon Photoready bronzer in bronzed and
chic there's really just one shade that
this comes in
and I've actually used this for
contouring on one of my friends at work
who has much much darker skin she's got
a real rich deep skin tone and these
shades even work great for her to
contour with as well but I mean when
you're under bright lights it can wash
out pretty much any skin tone and you
want to perk up the skin you need to
give it a little more life and so what I
first do is I just swirl a big powder
brush in all those shapes so I get what
is basically a medium tone matte bronzer
why do we want met that's because it
looks a whole lot more natural and you
there are some bronzers that are so
glowy and so shimmery and it just does
not seem normal and the camera will pick
up on those little sparkly bits and this
might not be something you always do on
a daily basis but if I'm going to be on
camera I'm absolutely going to do it
going to keep me from looking super
washed out and as you can see you want
to take this on any exposed skin you
want to get it on your ears on your neck
on whatever amount of your chest might
be showing as well it's very important
to be looking the same tone all over now
that we've perked up the skin tone as a
whole we're going to add some extra
definition here by using these darker
two shades and a slightly smaller brush
like a blush brush or an angled brush
and we're just tapping in those colors
and here we're going to contour our
cheeks so where I'm going to start back
at the ear and lay the product down just
like so you can see we're getting depth
there then we're going to buff it out in
circular motions so it doesn't look like
a streak of color it's just been placed
there and you can take a separate brush
as well a larger brush a kabuki brush to
blend it out but here we are applying
and circular motions buffing that out
this is adding definition to your face
this is slimming your face I always go
right here under my chin you're going to
eliminate looks of a double chin you're
going to get a more well-defined jaw
when you just go under this area here
also you may go around your hairline and
really give you a nice finished look
like the Sun was just naturally hitting
you right up here on your forehead like
it
would on trans fat bronzer I do a little
bit of highlighting there are a lot of
great highlighters out there I look for
ones that don't contain too much shimmer
like I said we're not looking for chunks
of glitter just a little bit of glow
this is one from Physicians Formula it's
the happy booster powder in translucent
I just get a teeny bit of that on a
blush brush tap off the excess and take
this on the tops of my cheekbones right
down my nose a little bit maybe even on
the Cupid's bow area here to brighten up
that upper lip area and a little bit
just in the center of the forehead using
minimal minimal product there then we go
to blush and I'm going to use the happy
booster blush is one of the greatest
most natural looking blush shades
actually I feel like it just works so
well and I just pop my brush in there
just for a little bit of product tap off
the excess and I work in a big circular
motion right here on the outer part of
the cheek I'm not wanting to get too
close to my nose because then you can
really get a look of redness we don't
want redness we want pretty just blush
so blush and bronzer are so important
for HD television and lights can suck
the life out of your face
really bright lights so I want to sort
of replace what the lights take away and
give myself a great look of health and
it might seem like if I'm sitting at
home and I'm thinking hmm it might be
just a little too much blush it's
probably about right for HD television
next I'm using some powder from a brand
called it cosmetics and this is called
bye-bye pores powder it's a great little
finishing touch unlike some finishing
powder type products that can really
just look like they're sitting there on
top of your skin looking cakey I feel
like this is actually just one more step
to completely even out the whole skin
tone without any added weight of product
you know what I mean without visible the
visible makeup look you can sometimes
get so that's the face makeup again
overall we're going for light layers of
our coverage products like foundation
and concealer used brushes we used our
fingers to really make sure we got that
pressed into the skin nicely and thinly
applied then we really focused in on
bronzers blushes and contouring products
to give our face definition to make it
glow and make it really have a look of
health even under very bright lighting
all right it's time for eyes and I've
already done one eye for you so you can
kind of see where we're going with this
there are three things I always want to
accomplish with eye makeup especially
for the news and it's to make it look
defined lifted and awake and every step
I do functions toward those goals so
first thing I'm going to fill in my
brows rug store brow product is from
Maybelline and it's called define a brow
and one thing I found is that even with
the darkest thickest eyebrows sometimes
studio lighting can make them look
different you can even get washed out a
little bit so I think the brows really
are the framework to your face you want
to have them cleaned up I generally
tweeze mine before I start my makeup
every day because they want to grow into
a unibrow trust me
but then I just kind of go over them a
little bit with this brow pencil top it
off with some clear gel like this
Maybelline great lash not everybody has
unruly eyebrows but mine can get that
way sometimes just kind of brush them
into shape next I apply a little bit of
an eye primer I use just a small amount
of Too Faced shadow insurance this keeps
the shadow from creasing it helps it
just kind of the look you start with it
helps that last all but very my eye
looks a lot but I'm just going to go
with a basic look for this video and I
do sometimes work in different textures
like shimmer or metallic but this is
pretty basic this is a kind of a
tried-and-true look that works so I'm
using my NYX runway collection palette
here in champagne caviar and bubbles
it's sometimes called champagne and
caviar but I start with this white color
right here it's a matte wine just using
my eye shadow brush I just press that
right around the inner corner and you
see instantly we've brightened up that
inner corner that's huge in just making
you look more awake and then I Pat that
on the inner part of my eyelid there and
I just kind of clean off that brush a
little bit and I go to the matte Brown
in this palette get a little bit of that
on that same flat brush and we're going
to Pat that
shade on the outer part of the lid this
is nice and pigmented and I'm just going
in and overlapping that white just a
little bit light shade suddenly looks
even lighter and pops even more when you
put a darker color right next to it next
I'm going to give myself just kind of a
subtle crease shade I'm going to go up
to this sort of light brown right here
in the corner and get a little bit of
that on the tip of a fuller crease brush
and as you can see I'm looking down into
a mirror as I apply because that's
exposing this whole eyelid area to me so
because I'm not very good at like trying
to weigh and can keep one shot and get
in there it's hard so here I can see the
whole surface of my eyelid area and see
exactly where I want to put the product
so I'm kind of fitting this brush right
in the crease there then you might call
me crazy but for my highlight I'm
actually going with just a light bit of
blush that actually ties this whole look
together I've got a lot of surface area
here between my eye and my brow and it
brightens it up much more makes it look
more fresh than just a chalky white
color up and we're going to go back to I
shadow in a second but first I'm going
to take some black liquid liner this is
from wet and wild it's the mega liner in
black there are live great black
drugstore eyeliners this is just the one
I happen to have right now and I like it
and I'm going to just start at my very
inner corner and go all across my upper
lash line I like liquid liner because it
really doesn't move at all
you don't worry about it smudging and it
gives us really clean definition out
here at the end I carry my line out just
a little bit from my eye then I put my
tip at the very corner of my eye and I
kind of connect and that's how we get
not a major wing here but just a little
bit of a lifted end to our eyeliner then
I take a great long wearing pencil liner
from the drugstore which is Maybelline
master drama it's the black the shade is
called midnight master and I just
connect right to that little wing that
we just made and I go about two thirds
of the way in on
my lower lashline this is really creamy
you don't have to try hard to apply it
but I'm just kind of getting it right
there in between my eyelashes then for
staying power we set that with a deep
colored shadow I'm using this dark brown
again and I just go right over the top
of what we just did with that pencil
liner except with the powder I do go
ahead and go in to meet our lighter
color so this this not only helps with
staying power but it softens the look
now we're going to use that little wing
not only did it lift our eye but it's
going to help us lift our eyeshadow up
as well and almost give our eye a little
template for what to do here so I'm
taking as much smaller brush this is
like a pencil brush or you can use like
a smaller crease brush go into that dark
brown again start right at the corner
right where the end of that little wing
is and build that up into your crease so
we're nice and dark we're carrying it in
just a little bit with my eyes open
I want to be able to see a little bit of
the shadow coming up and that's what's
lifting the eye everything's pointing
back kind of in line with the tip of the
eyebrow nothing's coming down further
that's something I often see is eye
shadow dragging an eye down because it's
coming below that imaginary line between
the corner of your eye on the end of
your brow so we want to keep it up keep
it lifted and then make sure you really
blend that with a bear brush just run
right over that until you feel like you
can't see a harsh line happening there
and an added step and morning news
anchors you're going to like this this
is a product called hello bright eyes
from it cosmetics and it's not a stark
white eyeliner but it's like a little
bit peachy as you can see but that takes
away the look of redness in your
waterline and will expand the white of
your eye a little bit I curl my lashes
and I usually hold this for about 15
seconds I'm going to apply one of my
favorite drugstore mascaras for length
and thickness this is I'll make it up
and grow and just apply that to the
upper lashes then I use some Maybelline
lash discovery on my low
our lashes this is a teeny-tiny brush it
doesn't overload those lower lashes it
gives them definition without looking
like too much you never want to really
get too much on those lower lashes
especially for TV because they can
actually create an added shadow on your
under eye the next step and I'll admit I
don't do this everyday but the days I do
it I really feel I am looking my best
and it is you know a makeup artist
secret in the business really and it is
false eyelashes and I love these this
kind called demi whispies as you can see
there they're flared out a little bit on
the end and they're cut to look a little
more natural they're not quite blunt
it's a mix of long and short lashes so
it adds a lot of thickness to your
lashes got this multi pack from Walmart
and the brand is called salon perfect
you can reuse these multiple times I
have a blog post on that that I'll link
in the extra info section but I'm using
this Revlon precision lash glue this is
the easiest glue to use it has a wand
applicator so you can apply it right
there to the lash band and I weighed
about 3540 seconds or so for that to
start getting a little bit tacky and
that's the moment you want to lay them
on your lash line now I grab the lashes
right in the middle of the lash band and
I want to try to Center that up with the
middle of my eye so I'm looking into my
mirror and I want to place these right
on top of my eyeliner so I'm going to
put them right here
get them centered up in the middle and
then you want to secure them on the
outsides and yes we can still see the
glue now because it's not yet drives
there we go but once that does dry it's
going to become invisible you're not
going to see it anyway after I apply I
kind of blinked down a bit onto my
finger to help those lashes dry in an
upturned way if you're putting false
eyelashes on and they're dragging
downward they're completely defeating
the purpose and having those lashes
there because they're cutting off your
eye they're making your eye look smaller
they're not giving you that lifted look
you want once they are dry that's when I
go in with a little bit more mascara and
this bonds our
real lashes and our fake lashes can see
here on these lashes the ends look nice
and soft there's really not even mascara
on the ends I'm keeping it more at the
base so then on the lips I'm taking this
covergirl blast
flip stick in vixen it's got two lip
colors in one the lipsticks themselves
are a little bit thinner so sometimes I
feel like I can even skip the lip liner
because it can still make my lips look
defined and a little bit of a brighter
lip color will just keep the face
looking alive when you go really nude or
really light on the news um but bright
lights can make it look even lighter
than it actually is then I take the
lighter part of this lipstick and I
focus that in on the center of the lower
lip just makes the lips look a little
more full to keep it from looking you
know to just frosty metallic I just take
a gloss over the top this is the elf
hyper shine lip gloss and flirt just a
dollar and I just read that right over
the top of the lips so that's the look
guys it comes as a result of a lot of
trial and error with different products
different techniques on my part I
continually come up with things that I
want to tweak and change here and there
but this overall it's something that's
been working for me lately let me know
what else you want to say I might just
do something on them on my morning
routine in general just kind of how it
goes because I do wake up at 1:00 in the
morning to get all this stuff started so
it might be kind of fun to take the
camera with me someday but um thanks
guys for tuning in let me know if you
have any questions and
great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
