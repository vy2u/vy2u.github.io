been tossing around for a while I
actually been a couple weeks that I've
been thinking about what I was going to
talk about my top five high-end makeup
products that don't have a drugstore
alternative or anything that really even
comes close in my collection to
performing as well and I know I've
talked about favorite products and my
Emily awards videos both high-end and
drugstore but I still think if you could
just boil it down to a few you know what
really stands out is the top stuff my
first thing is from it cosmetics and
it's called feel the moment anti-aging
primer serum and so this is kind of a
newer thing I reviewed it recently on my
express Channel only been dealing with
some patchy dry skin in different places
on my face and you know I'll moisturize
and feel like I do a thorough job of
that but even then sometimes I feel like
that dry texture on my skin is still
visible under makeup and so I've kind of
been looking for that extra step you
know that extra little thing I can plug
into the routine to smooth out my skin's
texture even more so if you're dealing
with dry areas I think this can be a
lifesaver of a prod texture it's kind of
like a cross between a gel and like an
argan oil type product so it's
definitely a more hydrating primer than
anything I have and it really helps to
put it on your skin and then definitely
let it sink in for like two minutes
before you apply your foundation my skin
just feels like a new level of softness
after I've done that so I really love
this stuff secondly I know I've talked
about this product a lot over maybe the
past couple of years but my Estee Lauder
Double Wear foundation I mean this is
just a rockstar where foundations are
concerned and I've been really excited
to have tried some other versions of
this product to the light the maximum
coverage for face and body and I like
those as well as one though is my
definite favorite because it just is
unmatched as far as staying power goes I
mean it's amazing coverage I can't quite
decide what I like more about this the
coverage or the staying power my ability
to look in the mirror at the end of the
day and feel like my makeup was freshly
applied your foundation is too greasy
for you if it's not a pretty finish on
your skin
thanks like everything else that you put
on top of it so if your foundation is
not only giving you a flawless
complexion but it's lasting you very
well throughout an entire day and into
the night a much better chance that
everything you put on top of that it's
gonna look great as well so I just love
this product and wouldn't be without it
another clear favorite in my collection
are the insane blushes from the ball
they're a powder blush but they stay so
incredible staying power like dab your
brush in apply it the colors are
beautiful there's not a shade in the
lineup that I don't like in fact a shade
that maybe I wasn't as nuts about in
when I first started trying these but
I'm really loving now is houndstooth
it's a really really pretty like kind of
neutral rosy mauve color I also love
lace I'm wearing that one today just the
total look of health and vibrance on the
cheeks and then a really pretty coral is
the shade called 12 and it's got some
more red in it just a really pretty
summery blood with the amazing staying
power that these have the intensity yet
they're so wearable and the colors are
so beautiful just great selection I've
got to go with these from the ball I've
got to give it up to a brow product that
I've become extremely extremely attached
to lately and it's from it cosmetics and
it's the your brows but better skinny
pencil this is actually a universal brow
pencil so there's no color choices to
make but if you press lighter or harder
it determines like how much color you're
gonna get so I love you know doing a
little bit lighter pressure on my inner
most part and then I can press a little
bit more and get just the intensity I
want to blend in with my brows on the
outer part this has amazing staying
power it's able to draw right over an
area where I have a scar and lasts all
day I think that's super special about
this is how find the tip is I'm able to
get the product exactly where I want it
and if it is one of those spots where
okay I need a little more depth I need
to press a little harder it still looks
natural
five-four my favorite high-end products
has got to be my lipsticks from bite
Beauty I mean talk about an incredibly
satisfying makeup purchase because I've
gotten like little sets of these here
and there and I've loved
every a lot of lines of lip
products where they're more hit and miss
these are just so consistent in the
formula it's like a velvety smooth
formula on your lips that stays very
comfortable yet very intense for an
extended period of time saves are just
straight-up creamy and colorful I'm
wearing the one and Rose today a few
other shades that I love her mulberry
for a great deep berry pomegranate is a
gorgeous red loaded with great
ingredients there's the key antioxidant
that's found in wine is also in the you
find a lip product that really has it
all and it's very beautiful but also on
the practical end there's a lot of
things you like about it with the feel
and the staying power you just want to
shout it from the rooftops so I love the
lip products from bite those are my top
five high-end makeup products that I
have in my collection
it could change down the road it
probably will at some point but I just
wanted to kind of let you know where I
stand with those more expensive I'd I
could have named any number of fabulous
high-end eyeshadow palettes that I have
and you might be wondering why didn't
you do that lorac Pro palette was on and
off my list here and there but when push
comes to shove I feel like with even a
lot of my high-end eyeshadows if I was
asked to create like the same kind of
look I've done with lorac Pro or a Naked
palette I could probably do it with some
of my drugstore shadows that I also
really like so I'm really going for
fabulous unique functions with the
things that I named it doesn't mean I
don't love tons of other high-end
products that I've mentioned but these
are definitely my top five so thanks a
lot for watching I hope you enjoyed this
and I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
