for this video this is going to be all
about pallets
I've been asked several times especially
here lately what are your favorite high
end pallets you know what are your top
must-haves that you really think are
worth the money because high end pallets
you know they might be anywhere in the
ballpark of 30-some dollars up to you
know maybe even close to a hundred
dollars so they are an investment in
your makeup collection but one of the
things I like about pallets and kind of
if I'm going to get some high-end makeup
I like getting a pallet because it gives
a lot of options in one place they're
easy to work with easy to travel with
and I feel like some are definitely
better than other and there are some
where if I ran out of that pallet you
know I would probably want to go back
and get another one and so that's what
I'm focusing on here are five of my
must-haves high end pallets that I would
not want to be without a lot that come
and go as sort of like limited edition
items around the holiday kind of trying
to stay away from that for this video so
you can find these things basically if
you're interested in a certain pallet I
talked about so first off this one I've
talked about a lot lately and I used it
a lot this past weekend doing some
wedding makeup and it just worked
beautifully and it's from the balm it's
the nude tude palette and there are tons
of those nude palettes out there these
days but this one I feel like it's
really something special I feel like the
quality of these shadows is every bit as
good as the urban decay naked palettes
but I just like the color selection a
little bit better I like that you get
some wonderful shimmery colors some
matte colors one that even has some nice
sparkle to it a shade called silly that
reminds me of one of my favorite matte
colors which is beauty marked and
they're just also saturated with color
easy to work with not like flakey you
know how some shadows can I love The
Naked palette and I feel almost a little
bit bad not getting it more attention in
a video like this but if I had to choose
and this one is probably my favorite you
know nude eye
I palette out there right now speaking
of Urban Decay I mean they have some
fantastic eyeshadows I've tried a lot of
different palettes that they have and
they're naked 1 and naked 2 are both
great I really have been impressed by
the quality of their colors you know
they have some really kind of nice
unique code I recently discovered that
when I got the Urban Decay Book of
Shadows for I got this at a discounted
price on HauteLook and actually I
believe it's now at a discounted price
on the Urban Decay website but this is
just a really deluxe palette and I won't
get too in-depth on the other features
but it's not like these amazing little
butterflies here it comes with a card
with some QR codes so you can like scan
that with your smartphone and get video
tutorials to follow it has like just
some great little extras in here in
terms of a primer potion which is
actually a nice size there a little
mascara and a great twenty-four/seven
liquid eyeliner which gives a very nice
precise super fine line I really like
that but in terms of the shadows this is
where I really have just fallen in love
with this palette for the fact that it's
got great neutrals but it's got really
nice kind of unique wearable colors as
well I mean Blue Bus is just gorgeous
bender is an amazing green in this
collection like I said tried a lot of
Urban Decay palettes but this is one
where I really feel like a neutral meets
wearable color in some fun colors that I
just think are really easy to pull off
so I would totally recommend that like
step is a palette that sort of combines
some eye and face elements it's from
Malley and it's called the more perfect
palette and I've talked about this one
quite a bit she actually has a perfect
palette the more perfect palette which
came out next which is this one and now
she has an even more perfect palette but
I gotta say the more perfect palette I
think is her best one and it comes with
a nice big mirror there this is great
for travel and you might look at it and
say well what else in there you know
that's not that's not as much as you
know some of these other palettes but
really that's kind of the appeal of this
for me I feel like I grab it I have
exactly what I need there are two
excellent blush colors I love Mally's
blushes you have malli school
which is a great pink and then a shade
called romantic which is a nice apricot
peachy shade there's a shadow base and
also a kind of like a cream highlight
illuminator type thing but these shadows
are really probably my favorite part of
it - outstanding mid-tone shades a
bronzy brown and a taupe
you've got your lighter colors kind of a
pink and champagne and you can make any
look you do with this palette just as
deep and rich and dark as you please
because you've got a great black with
just a little bit of shimmer a little
bit of charcoal kind of feel there makes
it very wearable and a great navy blue
so I just think that go to everyday
palette I have used this so much you
know just getting ready for work but
also taking it on the go because like I
said you have your nice big usable
mirror with this palette one perfect
palette if I ran out of this I would
definitely be wanting to get myself
another one and it's same story for this
palette which has no eye products in it
but it is from it cosmetics and it's
called the my sculpted face palette this
actually comes with a great little
brochure and I've reviewed this in depth
at other times but basically it's how
can you use the powders in this palette
to define your nose contour your nose
your cheekbones your forehead your
double chin whatever it might be that
your problem zone is you have these
great long wearing powders the contour
powders are on that you have one matte
highlight and a shimmery highlight I use
this on a daily daily basis I go usually
between these two colors and they are so
wearable you don't have to worry about
you know if you use a bronzer to contour
which some bronzers I think are fine to
contour with some can get a little too
on the pinky or orangie side and then
there are others that have shimmer which
you definitely don't want to contour
with so this gives you a great range of
colors too you've lasted me a long time
for being something I've used every day
I don't think I've hit pan on any of
these yet which is surprising so from it
cosmetics called my sculpted face and if
you are unsure of how to use it it comes
with a full guide which is
really really used family the mother of
all palates I gotta say this has been a
standout ever since I got it shortly
before Christmas this past year and it
is from Smashbox and it is the photo op
mega palette this has basically every
eye shadow that Smashbox makes in there
trios okay so that you'll go to Sephora
and you'll see Smashbox has trios they
have their full line of those trios in
this palette like they've been divided
up and you can see exactly you know okay
here's dark room here's focal point
here's telephoto it has all the names as
well and they are all full-size so
you're getting all those and they've
recently reformulated their eyeshadows
with this photo op formula which is it's
like creamy I mean these aren't cream
shadows but they go on in such a non
chocky powdery type way they just go on
with so much pigment and color
I think this palette alone has sped up
my getting ready time in the mornings
for two reasons number one the the shade
trios are outlined for you so you know
exactly what to use if you don't feel
like getting too creative on any given
day and also the blend so easily you
don't have to take hardly any time to do
the work I mean you guys probably saw
that if you watched my tutorial using
quick take here it came together so
quickly and then you also have this
middle panel here full of liners and
brow products and two huge blushes and
highlights and lips so it is really one
of those palettes where if you're
traveling you know you throw in your
travel bag this and some foundation and
concealer and maybe a powder and here's
what you've got everything you want so I
am thrilled with this this was one of
the most expensive palettes probably one
of the most expensive makeup products
I've ever purchased however I would do
it again for this this is I mean I was I
remember being skeptical thinking at
first like oh it's just another palette
with a bunch of random shades thrown in
you know what's special about this but
these are signature shades of this line
and you're getting them all and it's
like having them all at your fingertips
every day so I couldn't be more
impressed with this top of the line in
my collection and I have
I have all these different things and
this is one where I would be like this
is the superior color there you have it
guys in no particular order those are my
top high-end pallets that I really feel
like are worth the money I feel like I
with each of those I have sort of a
different purpose that I'm thinking
about when I'm reaching for this one or
that one the Smashbox palette is really
the most all-encompassing overall great
you know but they're all just just
something that I wouldn't want to be
without you to the handful of people
that have been asking for this and
reminding me that I haven't yet done it
and I need to be doing it so thanks for
staying on top of me because I do need
the reminders I mean I'm trying to keep
a running to-do list of requests in my I
keep it in my phone and so anytime I get
one or I see a tweet about one you know
I added in there so I love three more so
much for letting me know what you want
to see because we're almost 700 videos
here and it would not be that way
without the fantastic video ideas you
guys send my way on a regular basis so
thank you so much and I'll talk again
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
