for this video I have just gotten done
working on a pretty big project for me
over the past few days I've been working
on it and now it is complete it's my
video library I now have 275 videos on
YouTube counting this one at least ads
at this point and I just really wanted
to try to get them more organized for
you so you could eat more easily find
the types of videos I've done I don't
expect that everyone who is a new
subscriber has gone back and watched all
275 videos and sometimes when you make
requests you've requested something that
actually has already been done and so I
thought this might be a good tool for
you to just easily browse through see
what I have if there's a certain type of
video that you like you know if you like
to watch my haul videos or my shopping
list ideas you can easily use my video
library to find all of those in one
place and it will be continually updated
every time a new video is added it'll
help you realize what's out there and
it'll also help me in terms of knowing
what I haven't haven't done what maybe I
need to do more of after actually
organizing these videos I kind of
realized oh I should do more of this
kind because I've done hardly any or you
know I've done a lot of this certain
type of video so basically it's it's
serving a dual purpose for myself and my
wonderful viewers and subscribers and
you may notice in this video library
that some of the things are listed more
than once because they may fall into
more than one category it's basically in
two parts once divided up into tutorials
reviews and then random videos in
various categories and then at the
bottom all those same videos or any
video that's in a specific series is
down there so I've done lots of series
like shopping list ideas and bargain
alert and 100 most beautiful and all
that so if you'd rather look according
to series and maybe catch up on
something you missed you can do it that
way or you can just look according to
whether it's a tutorial or review or
whatever so that being said let's take a
look at the video guys we're here on my
blog it's HTTP colon slash slash beauty
broadcast blogspot com and currently my
most recent post is my video library and
basically this is how its laid out I'm
going to try to keep the camera from
shaking too much I've got a little
description here and then it's separated
into tutorials and under tutorials I
have a category for and dramatic I'll
look so you can see all the ones that
are their natural eye looks I've got um
a tutorial there on lips face only so
just something where I'm not showing
eyes but I am showing different face
techniques the full face tutorials
meaning i show you eyes lips and face
and celebrity inspired hair tutorials
and then we move into reviews and
recommendations so under that i have
refused about I products lip products
face products brushes and tools skincare
body products hair nail product reviews
and then I have random so these are just
going to be various categories I've
still Cavin though it just says random I
still categorize them I've got videos
with tyler's so if you love watching
those I've compiled all of those my
halls / collection type videos like it
might showed my nail collection or
whatever it's in there I've got vlogs
and that is probably the most random
category TV news any video that pertain
to TV news TV news makeup that is my job
at work as a news anchor so I've
all those videos chunk together if
you're interested and tips and tricks
just general kind of how to or
troubleshooting makeup ideas some do's
and don'ts just general tips some of
them come up might come off more as a
tutorial but they're still just general
makeup tips any videos that pertain to a
contest I've done whether it's results
or the contest announcement okay here is
where we get to browse by series so if
you have seen certain series that I've
done and have been interested by those
you can see my shopping list ideas /
sort of current favorites videos that's
sort of what those amount to then I've
got best of the brand that's where I
give top five top 10 whatever 100 most
beautiful building your collection that
this was when I started a while back
saying like what some of the best
concealers are eyeliners things that you
need your in your collection if you're
just starting out that's a really common
question so I hope you check this out if
you are wondering my you asked series
which I really need to build up a little
more but that's where i answer viewer
questions my series on every day I looks
my weather styles those are hairdos
bargain alert just good cheap products
where I highlight one in each video
mature makeup and these are great for
say job interview looks or even if you
have aging skin I try to take that into
consideration with those videos teen
tutorials break for all of you heading
back to school laying the foundation I
go through all different techniques of
putting foundation on and yeah that's
basically at anything you would want to
know their question of the week is the
last category and there are lots and
lots of those on some very random topics
as well so another thing that I do want
to mention here is that on this long
list they are all listed from most
recent to least in every category okay
so like on the most recent dramatic eye
tutorial i did with Smashbox glamour
eyes and then the one that I did longest
time ago was smoking avi tutorial okay
so that's kind of how its laid out the
newest videos will always be at the top
of each category depending on what they
fall in and I've created a permanent
link for the video library here on the
side so you go to the top just scroll
down a little bit and then you'll see
the video library link you click that
link and it'll automatically take you to
this page um I will probably provide a
link to this on my youtube so you can
check it out but I just really hope this
will be an asset to you and helping you
find certain videos I have so many I
thought a playlist on YouTube just
really wouldn't cut it for this I didn't
think I'd be able to create enough
different ones so like I said yeah I
will keep this updated so please keep
checking back and thanks for watching
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
