me today first I gotta point out who
else saw Kim Kardashian's like
smoldering eye for the Met Gala the
other night and had to just bust that
out today keeping it completely casual
everywhere else I've got my shorts on my
ladybug shirt from Target I was really
wanting and meaning to wear something
different for this video but it was in
my suitcase and my suitcase was where
Eva was sleeping so I was not gonna
rally at cage no my child doesn't
literally sleep in a cage but here's
what I have for you today it's a whole
kind of a combo of Sephora hulls I guess
it doesn't really matter where I got
each thing but for the purpose of
storytelling I'll let you know um I got
some of this stuff from the Sephora vib
Rouge sale and then I also got some
things while I was out on vacation while
we were in Destin one day Belle and I
went out shopping together there was
like this cute little playground outside
the shopping area one day we went to the
outlets and then I think the other day
we were in the Destin commons area it
was so cute there but that is Sephora we
went in and so I got some things there
some of this stuff I've been playing
with some of this video is also just
gonna be a pure traditional like old
school haul like here's what I got
yeah I'll start off with the things that
I got in the sale first I got this
volition prismatic luminizing shield SPF
50 really pretty packaging on this by
the way and this was featured somewhere
like I don't know the Sephora fines or
like it was featured as some special
find on Sephora's website says daily
protection for sunscreen haters warning
contents may be addictive so the deal
here is that it's a really lightweight
sunscreen and it's glowy in itself so
you've got the SPF 50 but you're giving
your skin this pretty like sheer glow at
the same time so this is the way the
packaging is I'll put a little on the
back of my hand we'll see if it shows
here on camera but it's very very
liquidy you can see it's kind of running
there a bit but it blends in really
quick you know how some sunscreens stay
looking sort of white on your skin this
is super lightweight and thin and the
glow is really just like kind of a
healthy glow it's not a super duper
ultra highlighted look I wouldn't say
it's not incredibly moisturizing either
so I would wear something with this
maybe a little additional moisturizer
underneath
it does look really pretty on the skin I
would say if you're combining this or
like wearing this underneath makeup
you're gonna lose a lot of the effect if
you're using a really full-coverage
product over the top of it you probably
assume that anyway but if you've got
something kind of lighter like a BB
cream or just some really light coverage
foundation that you're putting on top of
it this does I think give your skin and
additional glow but if you're just
planning to put on something ultra full
coverage it's you're gonna lose a lot of
what this is offering if you just want
to wear it alone which I did from time
to time while I was on vacation I
thought it was a very effective
sunscreen I did not burn on my face at
all and it was pretty you know if you're
going kind of makeup lists this is a
prettier look on the skin than most
sunscreens give here's another skin care
type item that I got I got this milk
make this is the watermelon brightening
serum and I want to pull that up on the
website so I can better explain it it's
the same format as all the full-size
milk sticks you know it's gonna twist
off here at the cap and then the stick
twists up from the bottom it says it's a
brightening and hydrating solid serum
stick that even skin tone reduces the
appearance of fine lines and revitalizes
the complexion for luminous glowing skin
it says it diminishes the appearance of
dark spots so this time of year when my
melasma is kind of prone to coming back
with the Sun and everything I thought
this might be a good thing to work into
my routine it claims to be good for all
skin types I don't find it to be like
insanely hydrating somewhere when I was
reading the how-to oh I think I looked
it up actually on YouTube there was an
actual person from the brand saying you
could wear this on its own or just with
a light moisturizer in addition free
vacation I was using this all over my
skin like first thing on clean skin and
then this on top and I felt like that
was enough moisture now after vacation I
feel like my skin is so much more dry
I'm trying to give my skin absolutely
everything hydration wise so that combo
would not be enough for me right now
today I'm actually working in it yet
another product that I got from the sale
that is thick as can be moisture wise
and I still don't feel like my face is
overloaded I got the Far Sally volcanic
elixir and this is the Polynesian Beauty
oil and it says to shake well can be
used day or night and I got to tell you
not all oils are the same I feel like
the Josie Maran
non-oil if you're familiar with that
that seems to be like a straight-up
middle-of-the-road
oil thickness to me and then the argan
oil that I got from the ordinary is a
little bit thinner and more lightweight
and then this would be on the other end
of the spectrum a very thick oil its
yellowy
and you really you know I think have to
go to some effort to get it all rubbed
in but you feel like you're getting very
very deeply hydrated and that's exactly
what my skin needs for whatever reason
on this side of my cheek I felt extra
dry and now finally like after using
this I was sitting down to get ready
before this haul and I was like oh yeah
I've got that really thick oil now is
the time and I think I'm gonna try using
this at nighttime some as well so if
you're a super oily skin person that
stuff might not sound amazing to you but
if you're very very dry you might look
into it let's talk makeup for a second I
got this and during the sale the Sephora
favorites give me some lip kit you guys
know I'm all about trying out these kits
and this one I'm really pretty so so on
I've used everything that's in it and
it's really it's just okay for me I
really was curious about the Grande lips
plumping liquid lipstick and so that is
in the shade smokes sherry and it's a
pretty color on the lips it's a really
pretty reddish berry the product though
is very thick and I find it kind of
actually hard to spread out and get a
nice clean line on your lips because of
the thickness of the cream but I never
really felt like it was plumping so
there's that I've got a Kat Von D
lipstick that came in here this is in
the shade called lovecraft and today I'm
wearing a lot of this but I also kind of
dabbed on top of that this Ruby matte
lipstick from honest ostia now this is a
full-size and I am really happy about
this I think this is a great likes kind
of summery red and I just dabbed it in
to make it more of a reddish pink but
there's the tone you're actually working
with with that shade and I feel like
it's a great kind of like poppy red you
know it's not too deep it's kind of a
little on the warm side as far as Reds
go they give you one of these Urban
Decay - lip glosses which I already had
this so it wasn't really like super
eager to try it it's fine but um the
shade is SPL I guess it's just a sheer
pink with a little bit of like glittery
Fleck in it it's a little cooling
feeling I do like these lip glosses I
just was
like holding my breath to get the kit
because of that because I already had it
there's a Tarte h2o gloss in Bora which
I love what they've done with the cap
there they make it look like little
water droplets and I think that's
brilliant and so cute
but this gloss I found to be very thick
and sticky and not really pleasant to
wear and it's just sheer it's got a
little shimmer to it that's all too
sheer shimmery glosses in one small kit
like this I thought they could have
maybe done something else there's also a
mini prismatic multi stick from bite in
pink pearl so before they were just like
creamy and now they've come out with
these shimmery ones and this I haven't
used a ton this could be like a
highlight on your face this could be
worn on the lips as well but it's super
duper shimmery and this one I need to
play with a little bit more I think I am
gonna enjoy that it kind of reminds me
of those fun lipsticks that Too Faced
came out with in their festival
collection life's a festival lip topper
type stuff but in a lipstick format and
that's what that makes me think of okay
what else here oh we're back into skin
care again dr. Denis gross the
alpha-beta globe had years back like I'm
thinking it might be like 5 or more
years ago on my channel I was really
into these they're self tanners for the
face it says intense glow and I love
these things so much in this box you get
twenty towelettes I first tried these
from QVC they were being sold there
that's how I found out about them but
they're these little individually
packaged towelettes and basically in a
nutshell they call it a self tanning
towelette for the face that develops to
a rich color while providing exfoliating
and anti-aging benefits
I recall these working so so well I know
they have just like a regular pad that
doesn't have the glow self-tanner
happening in there and dude I should
have been using this like right after my
major sunburn but I got this face mask
it's a watermelon after Sun mask and
it's not only for the face but it's for
the decollete as well so there's
something that will go right over this
zone it says enriched with watermelon
extract of natural origin and a tan
prolonging ingredient this after Sun
mask duo instantly smooths over heat
soothes overheated skin and immediately
and durably hydrates dried out skin at
this point it's been almost a week since
my sunburn so I might just hold on to
this in case of any other sunburn
situations I also got this which I I
don't know I was just intrigued
pineapple nose mask has anybody tried to
nose masks from Sephora it says poor
perfecting and smoothing is this gonna
be like a Biore Pore strips as tightens
and minimizes the aspect of pores I got
this Sephora brush tip lash adhesive
just because I'm kind of getting
obsessed with different lash adhesives
I'm comparing the duo to the kiss and
now I'm throwing the Sephora one into
the mix as well I used it today
it was SuperDuper thin one of the
thinnest I think I've used we'll see if
that starts to thicken up with time but
I love you know a good brush tip lash
glue and I want to find the best I also
got the Marc Jacobs iconic palette which
I mentioned this in my last video
generally speaking I think the quality
of Marc Jacobs eyeshadows are fantastic
my issue with this is just purely based
on shade selection and I feel like I
should have picked up on that before
purchasing I should have been able to
look at this and say you know it's not a
lot of options here and you're getting
three tones that give you a very similar
look with that penis and then outside of
those and the bronze it's just a
super-duper basic palette and now I'm
sitting here looking at more like it is
pretty yes it is pretty to look at
that's what drew me in in the first
place but just ultimately as I've used
it I've used it multiple times I took it
on vacation but looks just didn't Wow me
they were pretty enough they were fine
it was just a fine pal it's just a fine
palette for me you know I don't
completely hate it but I wouldn't go
like recommending it you know so when we
were on vacation
there was a Sephora I had to go in I had
to scope it out so here's what I got
there this was right near the checkout
and I have not used anything in here so
I'm just gonna show it's the Sephora
favorites summer Sun on the fly you're
getting a glow recipe watermelon glow
sleeping mask and I've enjoyed the
watermelon glow moisturizer so I thought
maybe that a sleeping mask would be good
there's a keels I think it's called
creme de coeur I'm not quite sure if
that's a body product or what I was
really intrigued by the super group
defense Refresh setting mist with SPF 50
I thought that would be an awesome way
to bump up the Sun protection not like
I'm just solely gonna use that product
but you know I've already got sunscreen
on and then you can add some of that on
top and then there was a drunk elephant
thing in here and I've never tried
anything from that brand but I've heard
nothing but raves and it's the protein
II polypeptide cream
I want to see what the actual sizes are
because I haven't gotten into this yet
okay here's the drunk elephant product
that's 0.5 fluid ounces all this is so
cute the little watermelon glow sleeping
meds here's the little bottle of heels
and then this super goop is all sealed
up right now but that's the little spray
that would be really great to keep in a
purse like I'm glad that's in a mini
also you want to see how cheesy I am
when I visit a Sephora that's at the
beach I buy the shell shaped sponges
these look so cute though it's a little
sponge duo let me pop one out there's
glitter like all over the inside of the
container but it's not on the sponges
okay here's what they look like I have
had some decent luck with little Sephora
sponges in the past so I feel like I'm
gonna have a good experience here it's
got the angled side I'll have to see
once I saturate it like how soft it gets
how much it like increases in size but I
just couldn't pass it up come on what
else I got a couple things from
anastacio that I've been eyeing one is
the foundation stick this is nothing new
neither of these things are really new
but I've been curious about this stick
I've nearly purchased it online several
times but I had the luxury of being in
store and getting to actually test the
shades so I thought I'd go for it at
this point and I got the cool beige
shade and it's packaged exactly like
bobbi brown's foundation stick this all
over my face right at this time might
actually be a hair light but I didn't
feel like I could go any darker I just
thought for the most part this is gonna
suit my skin I feel like it has a really
matte finish on the skin but then again
everything's feeling just a little bit
drier on me right now than it usually
might but I use this as my concealer
today I'm not wearing a full-on
foundation all over the skin I just used
this kind of right in this zone on the
under-eye around the nose a little bit
center of the forehead and I just
blended that out with a foundation brush
and that's the coverage today so it is
really nice coverage and I've been
enjoying it so far I also got a blush
trio these compacts are so pretty by the
way did you realize that there's this
like a logo showing underneath it's
almost like the top is a little
transparent that's cool I got the color
cocktail party I was really intrigued
about this color here because it seems
kind of like a bronzer it's like ultra
rich and intense when it sheers out
it almost see as being this neutral kind
of murky blush but I got that a little
around my hairline today and kind of low
on the cheek and then a combo of these
two shades on the apple of my cheek this
pink is so fresh I love that color so
many times I feel like brands put out
this type of shade but it's just a
little too light and it just ends up
looking chalky and dry on the skin this
is enough pink pigment to look really
fresh and then for summertime a good
coral blush I think you need it so you
pop this on I grab my sugar glow glow
kit and I'm all set on our way through
the checkout I came across these cute
little guys here these are from the
Sephora brand and they're called mini
pallets and there were I think maybe
three different options when I got to
the checkout the girl who was working
there was like oh we have these I didn't
even know I chose this really cool color
scheme because I'm kind of I don't know
I'm kind of wanting to branch out into
the cooler I looks like smokey eyes and
stuff and it was perfect for this look
that I wanted to do today
beware though there's a lot of shimmer
in this palette I feel like Chantilly
and coffee right here don't end up
having hardly any shimmer on the eyes
but everything else really goes there
but the shades are gorgeous and they
blend very easily and they're super
pigmented
I've got like a lot of blackberry and
this coffee shade like in my crease in
outer corner and smudged under the eye
and then I used today I believe it was
praline a lot on my lid and Chantilly
this is Chantilly meringue is highly
shimmery and very like just full-on
white but they're really Pleasant
textures to work with they give you this
little tutorial down here which is nice
but I might have preferred just a mirror
in this kit actually also Belle bless
her heart she was being such a good girl
we were shopping for the stuff she was
like carrying the little basket and just
being a total dream to shop with and so
I let her pick out a lip balm she picked
out the goji lip balm so it does
actually smell really good but yeah I
didn't realize it actually has some
color look how colorful that is mom you
might have to share that with her that's
my double Sephora haul everyone I just
wanted to get you up-to-date share
what's new I feel like I'm gonna be due
for a big like get ready with me try on
I haven't done one of those videos in a
while and I'm like kind of craving it so
thank you guys again

day and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
