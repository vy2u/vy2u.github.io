me today I'm going to talk about a new
brand to me that I found on Ulta
beauty's website and it is called woosh
beauty and the concept with this line I
think is making Beauty very easy it's
taking different techniques that some
people might find very tedious and
they're trying to I think create some
easier ways to go about it so I've
purchased multiple products from this
line and today I'm going to be applying
them for you and just showing you how a
look comes about with these different
things one of the products I got is the
fold out face which is a whole lot of
products in one there I also got their
corner eye Stamper brush which is a very
unique product and also their mascara
and the last shield and I got their spin
on lip gloss as well which has an
interesting little twist no pun intended
so interesting thing about this line I
do watch The Today Show and I'm familiar
with Bobbie Thomas who comes on there
and talked to like Kathy Lee and Hoda
about beauty fines and stuff and so she
is one of the people behind this brand
and I think I'd looked into this brand a
while back that didn't actually end up
purchasing anything and then was
reminded of it again when I saw that it
came to ulties website so as you can see
by the look that was created here it's
kind of designed to be quick easy no
fuss makeup so we'll see if everything
in this line really made life easier so
take a look so the thing I'm going to
start out with is called the fold out
face and it says on the box this is the
complete daily makeup routine everything
you need in one place and I got mine in
the shade medium light so it has a
little magnetic closure here it opens up
and you can see some of the face powders
here there are two things called
blenders just basically face powders and
then two blushes in a highlight and yes
it's the most shiny mirrored palette
ever and then this flap lifts up you've
got a mirror underneath and more product
here your eyeshadows contour and
concealers now I didn't know this was
going to be part of this little set but
it's like a smallish four in one brush
you've got an angled flat top brush a
fluffy brush that could be used for face
powders and then they sort of come apart
and you've got this other little brush
the connector gives you like a smallish
concealer brush and an eye shadow crease
looking brush so at least for my eyes
this isn't going to be everything I use
from this brow
but I just wanted to show you that's
there and I will be reaching for that at
time another little thing to point out
here there is a flat and this came like
as a sticker basically they said peel
this off and put this over the
perfectors so they give you this little
guy here it's not necessarily going to
prevent anything from drying out but I
guess just keep shadows from getting in
with those creamy concealers so I am
glad there was some consideration made
there since you have creams in the midst
of powders and also it was really
important I think for them to have that
flap there so you don't have those dark
eyeshadows budding right up against your
light face powders when this is all
closed so there was some good decisions
made I think in terms of the design it
cost overall on this is $59 and oh it
does show the brush on line I don't know
how I missed the fact that the brush was
included here but it says go from this
to this in just five minutes and then
they do very much walk you through every
step of the process so I've already been
using this a little bit I'm kind of
familiar with what this is going to do
for me so right now my skin is
moisturized and I'm going to be using
these perfectors and just kind of to
basically be my foundation my base I'm
going to start with the darker of the
two and actually start just patching
this around my under-eye area anywhere
where I have discoloration with a creamy
concealer I think you got to be really
careful you know you don't want them so
thick that they're hard to blend
especially if it's something like this
where it may work all the way around
your skin as a foundation but you don't
want them to be so thin that they're not
going to cover anything so these seem to
be a pretty easy to blend product so I
put the deeper one around there and then
I'm going to layer the lighter on top
for brightness so as you can see I'm
focusing on my main kind of problem
areas which would be the under eye and
any discoloration that I might have kind
of out in this area on top of the cheek
I'm also going to do a little lightness
up in here
and then I kind of liked using this
number three brush that's the flat top
it's like not as big as a Sigma f80 but
definitely larger than let's say some of
those Sigma precision brushes that they
have and I just dab over this and it
gives me a pretty dang good coverage
level there on the under eye again
layering both of the shades I think it
kind of brings me to my perfect shade
when I layer them both and yeah
sometimes you can just go to light with
concealers and simply lighten your
discoloration so keep in mind going for
like a skin tone match on your darkest
areas and then layering a lighter
concealer on top can sometimes really
help you out there brush is shedding
just a little bit I didn't notice that
the first time I used it
and there isn't any eye primer that
comes with this kit so I am going to go
ahead and like put the lighter the two
concealer shades on my lid before when
I've used this I've just put on my
Milani eyeshadow primer but we'll see
how this goes here's the trouble with
this brush for me the quality of the
brush heads I think are nice but see how
loose it is like it's kind of wobbly and
they want to come off from one another
so I'm sort of going to detach that part
now I'm going to move on to the powder
brush side and I'm actually going to go
over to the blender and use the lighter
of the two blender powders just to kind
of set my under eye here
so I'm kind of using this kit somewhat
according to my own rules you know the
instructions actually have you starting
with eyes and that's just not really
what I love to do so I'm just going to
use it my way fake so again lighter of
the two blender powders using that
almost like under eye setting powder and
then I'm going to use the other one here
elsewhere on the face
next up we've got this little contour
highlight duo and I'm going to use the
contour color this is a really nice
shade for contouring by the way apply
this to the hollows of my cheek and I'm
trying to go fairly quick with this I
don't want to make the application too
tedious because that's just not what
this product is about it's about like a
quick kind of all in one out the door
type look
and I do think the color tones in here
for choosing the medium light option
they're very appropriate you know like
the concealer shades seem really good
for me and I just ordered this online
you know and the contour colors or the
right depths as well then I'll take a
little bit of this lighter shade with
that same brush give myself a little
added brightness right here on top of
the cheeks and down the nose that's a
very mattifying powder too right there
fill it my bun is just falling further
and further off to the side I'm really
loving these cheek products right here
there's a beautiful pink blush it's
matte kind of a coral II blush with a
little bit of a golden sheen and a
wonderful highlight so today I think I'm
going to go with the coral blush they're
very pigmented so just dab the brush in
tap off the excess and again a nice
brush size here because you know it can
work for blush it's small enough to work
for blush but it did my contour it can
easily do the all-over face powder so
that was a smart size to include I think
and then the highlight is right here so
I'll just stab into that and yeah I'm
going to go ahead and just use the same
brush really really pretty highlighter
they're like totally quality highlight I
love that very pearly but the blushes
themselves aren't too sharing even the
one with glow like isn't too overboard
so you can really control the amount of
shimmer you have with your look
and then they do say these powders over
here which I did use them earlier but
they can be used kind of as a finishing
powder which I don't know that I'm going
to really do a lot of that maybe I'll
just do a light amount of the slider
shade here and just buff over
so I just did my brows and there's not a
brow product included with the kids but
anyways for the eyes you'll recall I put
some of the Perfector shade the lighter
one just all over my lid to give myself
a little bit of a base we'll see how
that wears throughout the day but in the
past I've pulled in Milani eyeshadow
primer and the shadows have stayed fine
I don't really have a concern there but
first off I'm going to go into the
contour shade actually this is the face
contour and I think it makes a great
starting point for the eyes so I'm just
going to use my Sigma e25 brush and get
that in my crease if you even wanted to
skip the actual eyeshadow shades
altogether that they give you in this
palette you would still have what you
needed to do an eye look here because
you got like a light matte shade this
medium shade okay just blend that out a
little bit here with a blending brush
that I'm going to use the color called
base which is the light matte cream I'm
sorry every time I hold up the palette
it's so reflective I feel like it's
really hard to see I'm sorry I'm going
to do some of that same creamy base
shade right here on the inner part of
the eye
and then I'll do a little bit of this
brown the define color right out here on
the outer part of my lid
pigmentation lies on these shadows I
mean they're good I would say they are
probably geared toward the everyday
makeup user and that they're not scary
to use I'll do a little bit of this
color called shine right here I'll dab a
little bit of that kind of on the center
of my lid you know it's a pretty subtle
shade but then again I think about the
purposes behind this and it is everyday
and it's kind of something anybody could
pick up and just work with now I'm going
to pull in another product that I bought
here and it's called the corner brush I
Stamper and this is a really really
interesting concept see that angle right
there on that brush so you stamp that on
your outer corner and then you've got
this just more traditional kind of a
wide angled brush that you're supposed
to be able to use to kind of blend
things out so let's look at the
instructions here here's the step 1 see
how they're putting it kind of where you
might do an outer V with your eye look
so you stamp it and then you take this
other angled side it says use the
smudger brush to gently drag and fill in
words using your mark from step 1 as a
guide so this is not the first time I've
used this product and I'll tell you
right now if you are already really
comfortable with like doing outer V's
and you've got certain brushes you like
to use to bring your shadow upward and
you can do it fairly easily and you're
not looking for a new method this is not
going to make life really any easier for
you I see where they're coming from with
the stamp idea like it really is going
to maybe allow for some really
symmetrical placement of the shadow but
blending it out from there can be a
little trickier it has been a little
tricky for me and it's kind of one of
those things I look at and say well I
probably could have done this quicker
with the crease brushes I'm used to
using but I'm going to show you how this
works so I'm going to go into the define
shade this brown color I've stamped the
brush directly in there made sure to get
product on every part of the brush and
then I'm going to put it right here on
the outer part of my eye see what it
stamps down there then I'm going to use
the other side of the brush which is
just a regular flat angled brush and
this is where I kind of have some
trouble getting this looking all natural
you know
like you can pull the shadow around to
an extent but I still end up having
quite an edge to deal with it I'm going
to try a still in with a little more
shadow here actually with this other
side I mean it just it takes some
finesse honestly to get this done and
you might think of it as you know one
and done stamp it on and you're good but
you it does take a little bit of dealing
list to get it all done so I'm going to
go ahead and do the other side here
there we go there's my little stamp I
think maybe if this other side wasn't
like just a flat angled brush maybe it
would be easier to work the shadow
inward I'm going to actually bring in
this crease brush that was provided in
with the little brush foursome and try
that I think I got a lighter application
when I stamped on this eye because you
can see that's blending a little bit
more this one's still looking kind of
dark out there on the outside see now
I'm finding myself using this brush this
little crease brush going back into the
product and just kind of filling in and
basically doing what I would have done
shadow wise to start with cut just
trying to lessen the edge on the outer
corner separate blender brush maybe else
a little and another technique that I
could do there with this brush they show
it on the other side you could stamp it
like directly on the outer corner of the
eye and not try to do the little listed
outer V so much and then you could use
the angled side to actually line your
lash line because this darkest shade is
probably dark enough to act as a pretty
good eyeliner there but I'm not going to
do that today because I have a mascara
from this line that I want to show and I
think you'll be able to see what it's
doing better if I don't have eyeliner on
but one more thing before I move on to
the mascara I couldn't really show you
this and that I Stamper brush in the
same video because they're both
pertaining to the eye shadow application
here but I got these even ice stencils
I guess these could be eyeliner or
eyeshadow application but I played with
these once before and these are a
i stencil basically that you lay down
here on your upper teeth it basically
can give you this kind of edge that I
was going for here today almost in place
of that tape method but these are
reusable you can put them down again and
again then you can just go hog-wild with
your brush and you know take your shadow
out and just overlap that little stencil
that you've got there and then get a
really clean edge on the outside of your
eye look and get that lifted idea which
i think goes a heck of a lot faster than
this ice Stamper thing and I will try to
show these in an upcoming video just
work it in somehow so you can see them
but for now I just wanted to show you
how that I Stamper brush work I really
don't think it made my life easier I
found myself needing to blend a lot more
than I normally would just to undo the
harsh look of the edge the next thing
that I got from this line is called the
flexing curl mascara with the lash
shield so what comes with this is a
mascara with a wand that actually has
the capability of bending and then
there's also this little eye shield here
and they say you're going to put it like
this and your eye shadow look is going
to be protected as you apply your
mascara and then there's another end to
it and you could use that to comb
through your lashes or your brows so I'm
going to start out and curl my lashes
here and then you could set it this way
if you wanted to protect underneath your
eye but if you're going to go and try to
do your upper lash application this is
how you'd put it on and so here's the
mascara this is a rubber bristle brush
it's kind of thick with bristles but
they're not super long
honestly reminds me a little bit of the
original covergirl LashBlast and then
watch this when I turn the end here that
brush is bending see that straight bent
and I do think vending it does make it
kind of easy to use here but as you can
see the idea is that I can take that
brush and press it up against this
little guard and get my lashes fully
coated without messing up my eye look
which let's be honest that's something
we all do from time to time don't we all
get careless with our mascara and end up
dabbing it right on our eyelid however
that feels I'm trying to get a feel for
which which feels more free and fast and
easy having this
in here and going up against it I could
see that being good for some people
maybe but yet this is where my comfort
level lies I mean I apply mascara to my
eyes almost every single day and I feel
like I can see to get in there like you
see what I'm doing with my mirror here
I'm holding it down here I'm seeing
exactly where that mascara wants going
and that's pretty much how I apply
mascara every single day if you didn't
always do it that way and you were just
really scared about making a mess then
maybe the guard is the right thing for
you but for me I do love the vent brush
aspect I can get to those harder to
reach spots really easily but I'm pretty
much doing it faster and getting a
better view of everything when I'm
holding my mirror down here so that's
one coat on the one eye it's not it's
not really doing enough for me honestly
it's certainly not building up as fast
it's like lash paradises I just went in
for more for a second coat it's
lengthening alright it's just not giving
me that huge lash look now this is not
the worst mascara ever because it's not
clump amia it definitely is lengthening
and again I like what this brush is
capable of doing but that guard just
sort of was slowing me down you know
I'm going to do a little bit on the
lower lashes today will be the first
time trying this on lower lashes we'll
see how that wears hopefully doesn't
smudge on me a lot of things do here's
the eyes and the first time I use that
mascara I actually went on with three
coat it takes about three coats of this
woosh mascara to get me to wear lash
paradise is at one coat so that's kind
of disappointing and I'm already seeing
the curls start to sort of fall from my
lashes someone but the last thing I'm
going to show in this video is the spin
on lip gloss with rotating tip yes
they've even done something with lip
gloss to make it I don't know different
new so this color is called glam taupe
that I got here it's got some shimmer
and it's just kind of a shimmery neutral
I guess here's the product you know look
I'm like a regular doe foot basically
except there's not one side that's kind
of flattened out so it's all just sort
of rounded and I'm going to try to get
in focus here and close enough up so you
can see this is just going to roll right
on y'all did you see that rotating did
you see it now that applies look at look
at what's happening here a lot of gloss
it really gooped up on me there
mmm-hmm see that roll on application is
no joke because that applies a lot
there's a lot on the wand when you take
it out and if you were just to dab it on
your lips maybe similar to what you
might do with a normal lip Lotz
applicator you probably wouldn't get as
much product on your lips as I do right
now
like I can literally see some of the
product catching between the two lips
but it's a pretty color it's shiny it's
got that little bit of nude in there but
I'm seeing some of my natural lip color
through it the gloss feels really
comfortable it actually feels like a
moisturizing lip gloss and when I was
wearing this the other day I thought the
staying power was pretty decent actually
there's a thickness to the gloss that
helps it kind of adhere to the lips but
yet it's not a sticky sickness so yeah
pretty everyday shade and nice quality
on the gloss but I don't know that the
roll-on concept other than being cool
like I do find it very cool to watch
that roll onto my lips I don't think
it's necessary I don't think the world
was really waiting for that you know in
a product I think if you're looking for
a good quality like moisturizing lip
gloss and maybe check out the ones that
Neutrogena has in their hydro boost line
they recently came out with some nice
little oyster icing glosses and you
could get something probably pretty
similar to the shades I'm going to do
guys it's actually give my lashes just a
very gentle and quick recur here because
they are falling and so just finish look
face wise very happy with everything on
the face actually the coverage level on
the concealers was really good and I
feel like I'm rather hard to please with
concealers and that was able to do some
good stuff for under eye circles
discoloration a little bit of redness
around the nose seem to tackle my
problem areas pretty well and yes this
is an actual scrunchie on my wrist here
the powders were nice quality in here
like really nice textures to the powders
the powders actually packed in a little
extra coverage also very nicely
pigmented blushes love the highlight the
eyeshadows were pretty good I think just
for daily wear easy use there's a nice
size mirror in here if you're traveling
and I really can't think of other
palettes that I have that provide quite
this much multitasking I guess the one
thing that's coming to mind is that it
caused
medics most wish for palate but that was
a limited-edition holiday type release
and that had like your eye correctors
and different things but I know how
hectic some mornings can be you know
around here just trying to get a quick
face of makeup on and having it all in
one palette like this definitely makes
it easy and if you are just going to get
this one palette you know what is left
out well you need to grab for a brow
product a mascara and a lip and so those
are three pretty small additions you
know to this kit I guess outside of like
a moisturizer or something that you put
on first so sold out face again I really
enjoy it I think they packed in quality
products and a lot of them the corner
brush I Stamper for me this didn't make
my life any easier I felt like I was
spending more time blending out the
stamped on shape that this gave me and
as far as the quality of the brush goes
it's a very even cut it's able to do
exactly what they want it to do which is
evenly stamp on color you know it can
help you even out the shape on each side
it's just it takes some time I think to
blend it out I'm also not really digging
the mascara it just took me multiple
codes to achieve the same effect that I
get with my current favorite mascara and
this little guard while it may be a good
thing for some people I'm not saying
like nobody would like this for me I
really rely on holding my mirror and
kind of looking up at my mascara
application as I go and this sort of
takes away that ability the lip gloss a
nice quality lip gloss product the spin
on aspect actually I think loads on
maybe a bit more gloss than as necessary
while it is a cool idea I don't think we
really needed to reinvent the wheel so
to speak as far as lip gloss blonde so
guys I hope this video gave you a little
insight on the woosh Beauty line which
is now available at Ulta if you are
curious about it maybe this let you know
how it would work and I will try to
demonstrate these even eyes stencils in
another video so you can see how those
go as well but thank you so much for
watching and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
