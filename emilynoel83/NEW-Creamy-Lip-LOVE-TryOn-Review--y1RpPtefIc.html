wanted to do a video on a new lip
product that really excites me the whole
line I think is just very very
compelling and I do get sent a lot of
products really you know full lines of
lip products here and there or
foundations or blushes or you name it
simply because that happens it doesn't
mean I'm jumping up and down about
whatever I got just for the fact that it
was sent to me these I tried and it was
like love at first application I've got
to say they truly knock my socks off so
I'm talking about the NARS Velvet lip
glide I've got all 13 shades right here
and I've kind of got them popped out of
the packaging so I can more easily grab
for them but in this video I'm going to
try them all on for you and try to give
you my best description of how these
feel on the lips because I'll be honest
when I first got them I thought okay
NARS has some sort of liquid lipstick
out you know it's going to be drying I
just had these preconceived notions of
what was going to happen hug my lips
with these and then I tried the first
one on and I was like oh this is
something different it's really like a
lip cream in the truest sense of the
word before we got it in our heads that
you know matte lip products are supposed
to have this dry down and not go
anywhere and be super long wearing these
are truly a creamy lip product that is
very opaque they're not a gloss though
there is a little bit a very natural
shine when you first apply them they've
got all the comfort of a creamy lipstick
and also the precision and application
that you might get from a really nice
wand applicator something else I've
noticed about these is you also get the
hydration level that a lot of more
creamy classic lipsticks might give you
but in terms of staying power you have
that long wear of a stain so it's not
like you've got a thick layer of product
just kind of sitting there on your lips
throughout the day and it may or may not
flake off with certain things that you
do or eat and all of my experience is
wearing these I have had a very even
like sort of staining effect underneath
them also as you
we describe these you've probably heard
elements of all kinds of lip products
you know that little bit of shine that a
gloss might have the creaminess of a
lipstick the staying power of a spinning
it's really an impressive combination
and something I'm excited to see come
out this time of year because especially
now I feel like my lips are already
starting to feel a little more dry
there's just more dryness in the air and
well I really like the matte look I'm
not wanting something that's going to
give me the matte feel necessarily and
so these just feel so smooth and creamy
after you apply them the hint of natural
shine that I'm talking about I mean can
you see it on my lips just a little bit
little bit of shine but with just an
hour or so of where I feel like even
that small amount of shine kind of calms
down a little bit and for the most part
you're feeling like you've got this kind
of matte finish on the lips but it still
feels extremely creamy and the hardest
part of these lip products to explain is
the application they're called velvet
lip glide and I think that is a
wonderful title wonderful name for these
because they go on with such ease they
don't feel goopy sticky thick like a
gloss you might apply with a wand
applicator they're just smooth and
really soft without feeling dry at all
the way they're described it says
they're laced with NARS oil infusion
complex this hybrid lip color combines
the fluidity and effortlessness of a
gloss with the coverage and comfort of a
lipstick wanting to give you a good look
at the applicator here I love these
flattened out doe foot applicator 'z
because they tend to hold some product a
little bit toward the center and the tip
and it seems like with a lot of products
that have this style of doe foot the
edges end up being really nicely cleaned
off when you take it out of the tube and
I think that allows you to get right out
to the edge of your lips without gooping
on too much product at the outer edges
of your lips and especially with some
darker shades that I'm going to mention
I think it's very important not to over
apply this product now I want to focus
in on the colors because there are some
great colors I've sort of divided them
up into soft I've got like four shades
that I would call the softer end of the
spectrum
about five shades that I would classify
as bright and then four shades that are
very deep first is stripped this is
described as beige pink this is the only
one in the selection that I feel like is
a little bit sheer I feel like I am seen
just a little bit of my natural lip
through that shade
moving on to unlaced this one more
peachy more opaque it's described as
nude pink there's definitely some warmth
in this color and I really really like
it next up we've got play pin I think I
know why it was called play pin because
this is a safe color it's very easy to
wear it's a pink coral it's soft but
it's still giving you that little hint
of color to play with without going too
crazy bold if that's not what you're
into next up we've got bound to me I
think of it as a true mauve I sometimes
think of these shades as winter pink as
well because they don't have that cotton
candy brightness that some other shades
do but it's just a very very wearable
shade definitely one of my favorites
with the whole collection now we're
going to round the corner into the
bright shades like I said I've got five
shades that would put in this category
several of which are Reds but the first
couple are kind of like berry Pink's so
Dan Soteria is described as fuchsia on
my handout I would call it a true hot
pink you know it's kind of what I
envisioned when I think of a hot pink
color very full color easy to apply
not at all streaky then if you're liking
that feel but you want a little more
depth la main blue is described as rich
berry I do think this is a great fall
berry that still incorporates a little
brightness we are going to get into some
deeper shades soon but I just love the
little bit of purple thrown into the
shade definitely a favorite mineshaft
which they call a poppy red is very warm
I sense a lot of orange in this shade to
me it feels like a very summery red
although I know there are certain skin
tones certain people who would love to
wear this kind of red all year round
then the shade called number 54 they
call raspberry red and this seems like
that true bold glam red you know it's a
little more of a neutral red compared to
the last one and I think it's just
beautiful and it really makes a
statement it's def
we bright look Palace they call a deep
cherry red and this is slightly deeper
than the last couple and I think there's
just a hint of brick in this color and I
think it's probably the most wearable
red just a gorgeous shade and a teeny
step down in brightness from number
fifty-four now we're going to get into
the deep dark family I've got four
shades that I would put in this category
the first one is unspeakable and that is
the one that I've been wearing
throughout the video if they call this
garnet it really is a dark berry and I
find as this shade wears I start to see
a little more of a pinky berry come
through but it's so beautiful a really
gorgeous shade with this shade and every
shade to come I think it's important not
to apply too much especially like this
next color toy this is a really deep
dark wine color and some of these dark
shades can look streaky if you get too
much product on your lips so try to keep
it at a minimum I don't find myself
needing to really dip back into the tube
sometimes dabbing your lips together is
enough to get a good product spread and
then just even it out with the
applicator then we've got area for those
of you who like a dark brown this they
call rich chestnut definitely different
for me I do not wear this kind of shade
often but I really really like it I
think that would be a fun fall in winter
color to play with and then deviant
which this shade is exclusive to NARS
boutiques and NARS cosmetics calm they
call this deep burgundy it really seems
to me like a brick and berry mix when I
first started putting it on my lips I
thought oh that's true brick red but
then as I could see it kind of spreading
out I thought it's kind of got some
berry in there as well but a beautiful
shade so as you guys just saw tons of
variety in this line all the way from
the lightest nudes into bright colors
and extremely dark colors as well and as
far as staying power goes I am going to
kind of do some check-ins on this shade
so you can see how a darker color wears
it has been on for about four hours
definitely has worn down a little bit
color wise but there still feels like
there's moisture on my lips my lips are
definitely not feeling dry what you're
seeing now is eight and a half hours of
wear no touch-ups and basically I'm not
feeling moisture on my lips anymore but
this is just like an even stain I think
it's pretty even looking don't you think
yeah yeah okay I haven't been babying
the situation too much I've eaten
breakfast and lunch I've had coffee I've
had water juice whatever so if you
wanted the purest color you know you
would touch it up obviously but I'm just
showing you how one of the deeper shades
wears no feathering outside my lip line
and overall I would say it faded in a
pretty even way so I'm impressed
before I kept really close track of
playpen which was the pinky coral and I
had actually done some lip swatches on
snapchat one morning and I've really
watched that one closely throughout the
day I could see the staining effect
happening by about midday and then past
that point and keep in mind this was a
lighter color it didn't have quite as
much intensity on the lips it started to
just kind of fade down past the midday
point good thing about these products is
as I said they're not like a straight up
layer of film kind of going across your
lips they are a creamy lip product with
some emollient qualities so you will
find like if you feel the need for a
little touch-up you can do that and
you're not feeling an uncomfortable
thickness on your lips like you might if
you are applying more product on top of
a dried down liquid lipstick trust me
I've been there it does not feel
pleasant so again a really impressive
really unique line of lip products they
are going to run you $26 a piece I'm not
sure if there's going to be a holiday
set that comes out that involves these
if there is I would certainly jump on
that but I would also consider one or
two of these as like a real great luxury
splurge or gift idea for the upcoming
holiday season because they are just
tremendous
and this is coming from a person who is
very very like obsessed with a lip
products feel the experience of putting
it on the way it continues to wear over
a period of hours that means a lot to me
I can get easily annoyed by the feel of
certain lip products I can tolerate some
if I love the color but these are just a
supremely comfortable feel and it's
great going into drier seasons drier
months where our skin and our lips dry
out more I would like to point out my
top 5 from this line from the lighter
group I would say my favorite couple are
unlaced that was the nude that wasn't
the sheerest the first one I tried on
but a little bit more of a peachy nude I
really like that one and I like bound a
lot as well which is that pretty mouth
shade I think so many people are going
to be attracted to this color as a
wearable shade that really looks good
under so many circumstances and the
bright family I loved
'la Maine blue and this was that rich
berry that I said was kind of like a
fall berry but still has some brightness
to it a little bit of a purpley thing
coming out in this as well I think
that's so gorgeous and lip Alice which I
thought was the most wearable of the
three brighter red shades that I tried
on and then from the darker family I
have been wearing my favorite from that
selection and it's unspeakable sort of
toward the lighter end of those final
four shades that I tried on but so so
pretty I think it's just a great fall
and holiday type shade and I'm sorry if
I've been looking down a lot I've got
notes all over this little chart here
and I've just been trying to stay on
track but thank you guys so much for
watching I hope this video sorted out
any questions you may have about these
new velvet glide lip products from NARS
