we are going to do a random lip color
Tryon I have been accumulating a lot of
new lip colors from the drug store or
from ulties website which is how I do a
lot of my makeup shopping these days
there are just so many new things out
there and in a lot of cases I've picked
up you know one two maybe three
different colors from different lines
and I thought let's just try them all on
in one video so we can be comparing and
just you know talking about the
differences of similarities this nice
deep purple will be one of them that you
see me try on in this video so I hope
you like it and let's jump in first
thing I'm going to pull in for this
little Tryon is the most sheer item that
I'm working with and these are the
Burt's Bees tinted lip oils and they are
kind of a click up pin style product
here and I've got two shades I've got
caramel cloud and this one is crimson
breeze caramel cloud looks kind of
peachy when it clicks up through the pin
but on my lips I'm seeing pretty much
100% my lip color through this it feels
super thin it does truly feel like an
oil has been put on your lips you know
there are some brands like Milani that
have put out lip oils but they're sort
of a gel mixed with oil and they have
more of a gloss like filled this truly
feels like oil on the lips very slippery
extremely sheer it does offer some nice
moisture back to your lips but the
staying power of these is very
short-lived I noticed that the other day
when I was wearing the red one it came
off of my lips so fast I wasn't really
enjoying that nice moisturization for
very long and I think that has to do
with just the thinness of this a very
thin oil just a little eating or
drinking here or there that's going to
fade away pretty quick as you can see
crimson brief has much more tint to it
and just the style of this product I
really like the brush that's here
because it does give you some precision
it's nice and soft it really feels nice
across the lips and there is just like a
very light just slightly fruity scent to
these but it's nothing overboard another
new thing from Burt's Bees is this gloss
lip crayon and I have it in the shade
Santorini sunrise and it looks very
peachy like this this nice soft coral
shade and it
goes on feeling really a lot like a
standard cream lipstick you know it's
very smooth it does feel like it has
some nice moisture there I wouldn't say
my lips feel overly glossy in fact I'm
not really picking up on a lot of shine
at all and I just applied it but I think
it's a gorgeous color I actually really
like it going into spring and it's kind
of a soft peach shade but it's not too
terribly light I don't really like it
when pinks and peaches just go to this
very very soft pastel place I don't
always think that looks good on my skin
but here there's enough color to it to
where it just I don't know it makes
sense on my face so I do like this
product I guess the one thing that I
kind of question is that it's a gloss
lip crayon how much gloss is there to it
there's really not a whole lot
Neutrogena has come out with this whole
hydro boost line I have been trying out
their foundation concealer they've got
like a lip treatment type product that's
just colorless and then they've got this
hydrating lip shine and it says with
hyaluronic acid let's look and feel
hydrated for 24 hours and I have this in
the shade berry Brown I'm not picking up
a whole lot of berry or brown but this
just strikes me it's kind of a classic
nude gloss it's creamy there's no
shimmer in it not making my lips
hydrated for 24 hours let's just get
that out of the way I mean it is
probably more of a treatment oriented
gloss than most glosses that I own but
after the thing wears off if you're
putting it through any sort of I don't
know a situation where they might your
lips might be prone to drying out this
isn't going to continue to have some
kind of time release effect as far as
the look of this on my lips it's a sheer
gloss but yet I feel like it does kind
of even out my overall lip color its
sheer but it's not as sheer as like that
first Burt's Bees lip oil that I put on
and the applicator is an oval that seems
to hold some product in the center so
you're not really dipping back again and
again for more well I'd really don't
understand how this hydrates the lips
for 24 hours it does feel nice on my
lips there's enough thickness to this
gloss to help it hang around a little
bit longer than some of the really thin
slippery glosses and I have been really
impressed with Neutrogena lip products
for
over the years I'm thinking back to
different like hydrating lip glosses
that they had the moisture shine lip
glosses love their moisture smooth color
sticks I think these are a nice products
as well and I would be definitely open
to trying more shades I feel like I said
the same kind of thing about some of
those peach lip oil products from Too
Faced you know there's a glossy product
that actually feels really nice on your
lip it adds with this it has enough
thickness to hang on there and sort of
withstand some things you might be doing
you might eat or drink and you still
feel like you had some of this on your
lips whereas those lip boils from Burt's
Bees those are pretty much going bye-bye
as soon as they come in contact with
anything okay guys I have four new
Revlon Ultra HD lip colors I love these
I love love love them the formula is
spectacular it's the kind of product I
want to have my hands on in like every
single shade HD desert HD Vineyard would
be the other two shades that I've had in
my collection from the get-go those are
like the first two that real men and
made me really enjoy this stuff and so I
have gotten four other shades that I'll
try on for you here I'm just kind of one
after the other so you can see how they
look HD sand stunning stunning nude
shade I love the opacity to these
products well they do have a lot of
shine and they just feel really smooth
going across the lips they are very full
color they remind me of the Revlon lip
butters infield sometimes I feel like
there's just a little more thickness
like a little more luxurious feel to
this lip product
I love the slim design of the packaging
there is a very strong scent to these it
smells kind of like a tropical like a
tropical drink that maybe a little much
for some people I mean it is a pretty
strong scent but that being said I don't
continue to notice it a whole lot once
it's on my lips it's mainly just with
the application this is HD dawn and this
is some of that your lips but better
kind of mauve color love this this color
has definitely been living in my purse I
think it looks good with like any eye
look anything you got going on on your
face it just really like amps up my
natural lip color and I feel like it has
just the tiniest bit of
like a pearlescent thing going on here
it's not like ultra frosty lip color by
any means and if you were to look up
really closely at my lips I don't even
know that you would identify any Frost
but there's just that tinniest hint of
something going on there that makes this
shade a little more like reflective I
mean do you see how on my lower lip
things just look kind of plumper and
like the lights reflecting off of it and
it's not for the fact that there's a
buttload of shine coming off of my lips
you know it's just that I think there's
something in the shade that's picking up
the light a bit more but I love that
color love it okay this is a deep
reddish brown called HD Arabica and I
think this is beautiful - this really
strikes me as a nice like fall winter
color so for some people you might think
you're heading out of this type of shade
this time of year but I'm all for
wearing whatever color you really like
anytime so yeah this is super pretty and
this would be like the deepest shade
that I've tried so far from this line I
mean HD vineyard was more of a berry
color a little bit more brightness to it
and I do have another bright shade that
I'll be trying on this newer to me in
just a second but this would be the
deepest and something I think you can
pick up on from this is how evenly they
do apply a lot of times mid-tone shades
from just about any line will appear to
look more even on the lips than the most
light shades or the deepest colors in
the line when you see how nice and
uniform this looks on my lips I think
you can tell just the quality wise how
nice this is HD blossom right here
giving you some of that pretty
orchid purplee pink vibe I love this
color so much it really just bounces off
the face I know I did mention this one
in the HD sand in the last best in
beauty video that I did but they are
some newer lip products to my collection
so I thought I'd definitely try them on
here for you as well these are not
colors that you have to build and build
and build with even with the sheer
shapes like that sand color you know it
goes on and you're really seeing what it
has to offer immediately and staying
power wise I mean these are creamy
lipsticks or they call them like a gel
lipstick they're not in it for the long
haul you know they're not going to be
staying on your lips the entire day but
I think they
even get through a meal with just a
slight touch up afterward to sort of
freshen up the look a little bit and it
wouldn't be totally gone gone gone so
Maybelline is now getting into this
jumbo lip crayon game with the Baby Lips
color bomb crayon and I have this in the
shade sassy scarlet and it's interesting
because they're doing the jumbo lip
crayon but it's like they've already
knocked off any sort of a pointed tip
that a lot of these start with obviously
you use those pointed tips like for
example the first piece you know you use
that tip for any amount of time and it
is going to sort of wear down and round
off but with the Baby Lips they're just
kind of starting that way and these are
like full color this red shade that I
have I mean obviously this is the only
color I have so I'm not sure how the
lighter ones might be but this is a full
color red lipstick here it's creamy with
one pass there was a ton of color unlike
a lot of their legit lipsticks you know
this has a sweet scent too it's like a
light sort of berry type scent that I'm
picking up off of it but I was shocked
when I got this because it says baby
lips and that baby lips line your mind
just goes to those scented lip balms
that they've put out you think well
maybe this is going to be that type of
thing just a little stepped-up color
wise well this is a full on lip color so
be prepared for that if you're thinking
about trying these for me this isn't
quite enough precision to be applying a
total red lip shade I mean I struggled a
little bit here on the outside and sure
I think the color is beautiful but for
something this shiny on my lips I would
definitely want to be blotting it off
and maybe reapplying and blotting again
doing that little technique that sort of
helps a creamy lip product adhere and
stay on your lips a little bit better
without all the feathering because this
is pretty darn shiny and for being such
a bold color that does worry me a little
bit wearing it in this totally full-on
sense I think actually quite a few
videos ago something I recorded even
before Eve was born I was wearing this
shade and I was wearing it in that sort
of blotted off mode so Maybelline has
this new line of intimate nude and I got
a couple of these one of them is brown
blush which I've spoken about before and
I think it's a really pretty like deep
very little bit of neutral mixed in
there
- I think this is a gorgeous color the
finish on the lips yeah I would say it
is overall matte but it doesn't feel
drying whatsoever they feel like just a
great cream lipstick going on your lips
and the end result just doesn't have a
lot of shine to it but there's not that
intense dryness that you're going to
feel with matte liquid lip colors so
most of the time if I'm looking to go
matte on my lips I would go for a
formula like this that is really not
going to absolutely suck the life out of
my lips this other color that I have is
called honey pink and to me it seems
just like a soft peach to look at it in
the tube it looks like a light peach
color and I'm not absolutely wild about
this shade just full-on
you know flat all over my lips in a
matte color kind of like I was
explaining what this first B shade this
is a peachy tone that has just a teeny
bit more depth to it it just makes a
little more sense on my face I don't
know maybe some of you guys like this
color on me I'm just not really a fan
going forward if I were going to wear
this I would probably take like a
neutrally colored lip liner and blend in
a little bit from the outside just
because I'm not sure I love this just
flat full-on all over the lips but the
feel of it again like what the berry
Brown is really nice they're the kind of
lip color that you can go
and you know you feel some product
moving in there there's some moisture
still on your lips well we know NYX has
their soft matte lip creams right that
apply with a lawn they are not a liquid
lipstick they are truly a lip cream they
don't go to a totally non-transferable
locked-in state but they are very matte
on the lip now they've got these soft
matte lipsticks and these are totally
fully met on the lips as you can see and
I prefer the feel of this on my lips
over the soft matte lip cream so I found
those to be pretty drying and I just I
don't know I like a creamy lipstick
format these do not have quite as much
creaminess like you know in terms of
really rubbing your lips together and
feeling like there's something there the
maybelline feels a little bit better in
that respect but these are definitely
matte as can be and might beat the
Maybelline out a little bit in terms of
staying power they feel really similar
to me to just mix a standard matte
lipstick line you know they've got those
matte lipsticks one of the shades is
called Alabama you know what I'm talking
about the black tubes that have been
around for quite a while those are great
and those are really pigmented and rich
these I don't know just like there's a
little less thickness going across my
lips compared to those older ones that
squared off in to the lipstick takes a
little getting used to but overall I
think these are some quality lip
products for sure I'm just starting to
take the shade off I didn't even
reference what color was in Bloomington
is this pink that I've had on this color
is called dancin Barcelona and it's a
nice warm red I love this color and this
is a shade I would definitely put into
use compared to like this babbling baby
lips let's say glossy shiny very rich
red here it's a nice bright red but it's
in a matte formula that I have no doubts
about whether it's going to stay in my
lips but yet not as drying not as thick
not feeling like it's a totally separate
layer on my lips like a lot of those
liquid lipsticks feel so this is
certainly a format of color that really
works for a bold shade like this and I
will definitely be getting some use out
of that color
alright this great B purpley shade is
called escape to Old Country I actually
had a little issue with application not
at all the fault of this lip product
because I put it on the
for and it went very easily and smooth
but I had to get out like a special
remover wipe to get that red shade off
and so that was still on my lips a
little bit as I started to put this on
but it is really really pretty I kind of
love this shame else out there like
purple lip colors this is a very rich
plummy
deep color I mean really I refer to a
lot of different things as plum I feel
like but when I see this shade on my
lips and yet that is literally like the
colour of a plum but just like with the
red if I'm going to wear a color this
deep and dark I'm going to want it to be
free from shine and be something I'm not
going to worry about drifting with and
this is the nice like kind of best of
both worlds with I'm not worried about
it drifting but I'm also not worried
about it peeling off in little chunks
like I sometimes deal with with a liquid
lipstick so that wraps up this little
random lip color Tryon I just thought
this would be a fun way to discuss a
whole bunch of different lip products
that I've been playing around with
lately and let me know what you've been
trying what you liked if there's any
shades other than the ones I've shown
you in this video that you recommend
definitely let me know in the comments
section the things that probably excited
me the most from this video you guys
know I love these Revlon Ultra HD lip
colors for a nice creamy rich lipstick
formula and I love the slim format I'm
also really diggin the NYX soft matte
lipsticks incredible staying power with
all of these great great color intensity
as well the Maybelline is really hard to
beat too and that does offer you a
little more moisture but some of the
shades aren't quite as interesting I
mean it's a matte kind of nude natural
line so just keep that in mind with
those new Maybelline ones thank you guys
so much for watching I really appreciate
your time and I will talk to you again
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
