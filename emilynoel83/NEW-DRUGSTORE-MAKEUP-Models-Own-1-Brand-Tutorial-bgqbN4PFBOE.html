this video I am bringing back the one
brand tutorial I remember when I started
doing these it seems like quite a long
time ago I'm pretty sure I was back in
the old makeup room in the old house and
I've actually had a lot of requests to
either redo old one brand tutorials or
feature new brands that I haven't
featured before and in this video I
thought I would bring it back with a
brand that is very very new to me it's
new to old it's called models own and I
believe it's from the UK so maybe some
of you are more familiar with this line
but I did a little Ulta haul and I got
nearly everything for a full face I have
been playing around with most of these
products already so in some cases I will
be able to provide some little reviews
here and there but I hope you enjoy it
is raining outside so it's just this
cozy rainy dark morning Oh before I
begin I did take a picture of the outer
packaging like the boxes that everything
came in and I thought it was really cute
I liked how the face products eye
products and lip products like there was
some continuity in the look of the outer
packaging but they each had a different
color theme it was so cute I thought
that was adorable anyway this is what
the foundation looks like and it says
runway Foundation matte oil free and I
have it in the shade bisque oh - so
squeezy tube foundation if it's not
going to be a pump I do like a tube like
that and for it being this matte like
oil free foundation it certainly feels
like a little bit richer and thicker
than I would expect coming right out of
that - I mean sometimes those kind of
foundations feel very like borderline
dry and mousse like and this one feels
very creamy so I'm just going to use my
Beauty Blender and blend this out I know
from using it before that it has really
good coverage
and I actually kind of like the look of
it right at the get-go but I have not
really had good staying power
experiences with this foundation which
does surprise me because my skin is not
super oily to begin with so I don't feel
like I'm giving it a major oil obstacle
you know but without putting it through
very harsh conditions the other day I
still felt like it was looking very much
like visible makeup
like no sides of the nose I just felt
like my skin was really responding a
very oily way to this foundation more
oily than usual so today I did try a
different primer underneath I used my
Smashbox pore minimizing and we'll see
maybe by the end of the day if I feel
like it's held up better and something I
haven't used yet this would be my first
time is the models own flawless
under-eye concealer and I have this in
the shade pearl and it's actually like a
little concealer pin so you just twist
it up
this actually does seem a little bit
peachy to me and the consistency of it
doesn't seem as liquidy as most
concealers in this format you know it
seems just a little thicker as I'm
trying to swipe it on I'll pick some
down the nose use it for a little
brightening here and there
I feel like I need a little extra
coverage in a couple of areas right here
on my innermost corner and then also
around the sides of my nose I'm going to
use a little bit different brush
actually to get right in there this is
my p84 from sigma and i'm a blend over
that again with the Beauty Blender just
thin it out a bit
it seemed to brighten like it looks
brightening kind of on top of my
cheekbones but in the areas where I
really needed to cover darkness I was
expecting a little bit better coverage I
got some loose powder to bake with and
maybe that will help because see I may
have lightened up the under-eye circle a
bit but I don't feel like I totally
corrected it you know what I'm saying
the powder I got is in this cute little
guy and it says grand-finale loose
powder translucent zero one as a mirror
inside the cap does have a puck and I'm
just going to shake some of that powder
free from the shaker for a second here
at a glance doesn't look as light as a
lot of translucent powders don't you
think it has more of maybe a light
yellow tinge to it texture of it feels
really nice between my fingers like kind
of a creaminess kind of like it's
hanging together I'm going to dip my
Beauty Blender in there and just bake
the under-eye area
any powder I do this with really has big
shoes to fill because I feel like the
laura mercier set such a high standard
for me it does this kind of step really
really flawlessly this powder does seem
to have some major coverage to it
question is how dry is my skin going to
look once I dust aways baking right and
that's a lot of use I'm going to get out
of that mirror okay here's what I got
for brows it's the now brow finale brow
gel and I have it in deep brown and this
is one of those things that is exactly
as dark as it appears to be and it's
very opaque and I use this the other day
and I felt like I had to just incredibly
solid just a really really to thick
brows and it has this teeny tiny brush
but there's a lot of product that comes
out on the brush and it's pretty thin so
what this feels like to me is
practically like I'm brushing a liquid
liner into my brows like it's that
pigment what I'm going to do first is
I'm going to use a standard pencil to go
ahead and get my brows filled in this is
precisely my brow pencil by benefit it's
number 4 and I'm going to go ahead and
do that and rejoin you and find some way
to kind of finish the brows off with
that other product and what I'm going to
do is actually take my little stiff brow
brush here from Sigma and I'll get a
little bit of that product on there too
much and I'm just going to lightly brush
it over my brows and use this kind of
more as a setting type thing although
the hold was not fantastic when this was
all that I had in my brows the other day
I thought man it's a ton of color but
not much hold so if you're really just
looking for a super light finishing
touch to your brows I think this is way
more heavy duty than you might want but
if you do want like a potent color fill
and that's what this seems to be I don't
know just a little more than I bargained
for there now I'm going to dust away
this powder and we'll see what we're
left with on the face and under eye
I feel like it did help the coverage
somewhat it definitely mattified but my
under-eye area is looking a lot thicker
with makeup and it usually does me it
seemed to be a little bit more of a
heavy powder that I needed in that area
I'm just lightly dusting some more of it
elsewhere on the face the next thing I
have here is the sculpting glow palette
and this is a contour palette it says in
light to medium but check out this shade
right here it looks very bronze rich and
even for a bronzer it just seems so warm
and just kind of orangie so I'm knowing
this is not going to be my favorite
thing to do like a really pronounced
contour with so I'm going to do is use
it maybe a little bit more as a bronzer
and I use my ELF complexion brush and
dip into that and start out with getting
it up around the hairline get my skin
tone a little bit of a boost trying to
go still super light with this just
because I don't want a ton of orange
just so you can get the effect of what's
going on here if it was to be used as a
contour like as you can see it's deeper
than my skintone so in that sense it's
providing a little contrast when it's
used lightly there under the cheekbones
but it's definitely warmer than anything
I would usually put there it makes a
little more sense to just be worn like
on top of the cheeks or where the Sun
might hit now it looks like a really
pretty blush blush right here and
highlight in the talent I'm going to
swatch those that blush looks like a
pretty peach with a golden shimmer and
then the highlight is like a very light
peach may use my little defining powder
brush here from Estee Lauder I'm loving
this for blush it just really cuts the
right part of your cheek there for blush
application I love the seaming really
powdery I'm noticing a lot of powders
kind of floating everywhere as I apply
this but I do think it's a really pretty
color it's not insanely pigmented like
I'm wondering if a really deep skin tone
would still see this showing up a whole
lot but next we're going to move on to
this highlight and this is my Moda
highlight and glow brush I love this
brush
and this is the moment where I would
apply some setting spray because my skin
is looking powdery right now I mean you
pair a matte finish foundation with all
these powders on top you're gonna see
some houses I think my Milani eyeshadow
primer is hit another bag so I'm going
to need to use this Smashbox 24-hour eye
primer it seems to work pretty similarly
for me and don't you love it this is
neither a Milani nor Smashbox so what
important video I can't remember if I
just totally missed eye primer from this
line or if they didn't even have one but
I picked out one of the eyeshadow quads
I got the my shadow quad powder
eyeshadow in precious pink you've got a
totally matte shade with this Moss this
cream color has just a little bit of
sparkle and then two shimmers at the
bottom one is kind of a deep bronzy
brown and the other is a rosy shimmer
and I'm kind of in a pickle here because
the lip color is very coral it turned
out to have more orange to it than I
expected so I'm going to try to keep
from going to too rosy with this quad
today what I'm going to do first is go
into this matte color with my e25 brush
and I will just get that going in my
crease it seems decently pigmented you
know
and take this other shade which I was
using it the last time I noticed that it
had that little bit of sparkle in it but
at the same time it applies pretty matte
like you don't see a lot of spark
leanness then I want to take some of
that same shade and Pat it right here on
the inner part of my lid
and then I'm going to build up some of
this bronzy brown use that right on the
outside
rain is coming down out there
then I'm going to use my little mu a
professional brush with that same color
and I'm going to build it up even more
in the outer corner because that's not
really a terribly dark shade especially
with the little bit of shimmer that's in
it it's not super deep and dark so if
you want it to show up with a decent
amount of darkness you've got to just
use smaller brushes and build the color
up little by little
honestly I think it's a really pretty
eye shadow palette over all that
lightest shade could use a little bit
more intensity you know a little more
punch but the other three shades I do
think are pretty strong it's kind of
like a very condensed version of naked 3
I got the eye definer eyeliner duo and
this looked cool to me because I thought
be a chance to try both a liquid that's
a liquid felt tip pen style liner and it
has a pencil on the other side now I
know from trying this the other day the
liquid hangs on and lasts a lot better
than the pencil does used in my
waterline the pencil actually wasn't
that bad but it's like if you were to
smudge over them both the pencil would
come away and kind of lift up a lot
easier I'm going to take the black
liquid across my upper lash line
this liner is doing the wing pretty
easily and it does seem to be a matte
black
then I'm going to take this pencil side
which is also black and I'm going to do
a little bit of that here in my
waterline it transfers on to the
waterline very easily
and I want to kind of smudge some of
this down below too so I'm kind of
feeling like I'm dotting it between my
lower lashes
then I'm just using this smudge brush to
blend that liner a bit
to bring back some of this bronzy brown
over the top too
now in addition to I shadow primer I
also failed on getting the mascara from
this line there's what happened when I
was picking out things from ulties
website it didn't start as a oh I'm
going to do a one brand tutorial with
this look like I just started picking
different items and once I got done I
thought oh this could do like a full
face and I didn't really you know look
any further I just felt like I had
collected the amount of products I could
do a full face and I wasn't really
analyzing it but that's okay we nearly
made it there I have so many mascaras
open right now it's crazy though so it's
probably for the best that I don't crack
open yet another mascara so here's what
I'm going to do for the sake of time I'm
going to go ahead and curl my lashes
apply covergirl super sizer I want to
put on these Ardell whispies these are
just the regular whispies not the demi
wispies so they're really like full and
long in the middle when I pop those on
and then join you back here for the lips
join you back here like I'd be anywhere
else okay we are back got the lashes on
there and going to try on this liquid
lipstick this is in coral fresh 0-3 it's
the licks matte liquid lipstick and I
did wear this the other day it's one of
those that feels very mousse like
instead of feeling like a straight
liquid applying to the lips it has this
kind of I don't know borderline dryness
and smells a little minty and the matte
color of this is very like instantaneous
also I don't feel like it really darkens
up much from this shade you know stays
pretty true to color
now the last time I wore this I use the
lip primer the base lip primer
underneath this is from model's own as
well and I felt like my lips felt very
sticky whenever they would you know kind
of press together today I actually feel
like without the lip primer they feel a
little less sticky because that was kind
of annoying and I remembered feeling it
for like probably the first two hours
that I was wearing it now if you look
closely at my lips I mean I feel like
this is definitely clinging to and
exaggerating any little bit of dryness
that I have on my lips so I don't love
that I still notice that even with the
primer underneath the other day I was
like man I thought the primer might you
know smoothen some cracks you know that
it still looks pretty dry on my lips
either way and it's not totally transfer
resistant like you can rub some off of
your lips but that being said it lasted
pretty well once I had like lunch the
last time I wore this you know it wore
down on the inner part of my lower lip
quite a bit but the shade wasn't totally
gone from my lips and it was definitely
still visible at the end of the day so I
will be checking into that again today
and just the staying power of the whole
look in general
just looking at everything now at let's
see 638 2 p.m. and foundation is broken
down a decent amount around my nose but
doesn't look as heavy I guess after
application the foundation the concealer
around the eye area like it's kind of I
don't know worked its way into my skin
just a little bit more and actually
helped it's um remem seen way more
glitter on my face than I ever realized
was there with that highlights that's
kind of interesting and here's what's
left no touch-ups on the lips a little
remaining lip color on the top lip but
obviously I've eaten and had water and
stuff throughout the day so it's had a
lot of opportunities to sort of rub off
that being said it doesn't look crazy
uneven like it's not the worst looking
liquid lipstick wear down that I've ever
seen but it also wasn't a super dark
shade which kind of helps it in that way
so anyways that's my final chicken I
know I kind of reviewed a lot of things
just as I went through the video I'm not
doing backflips over tons of things
actually from this line I do think that
the foundation is really nice coverage
but just keep in mind it looks pretty
dry on the skin just not all that
impressed by the staying power of this
and I think it can look pretty thick in
certain areas the whole under-eye
situation I thought this is kind of an
odd concealer because it was coming out
so sick from this little pen style
applicator and for as big as it was I
really expected it to cover the circles
better but it was not totally full
coverage and then you top this powder
off just in a baking sense this powder I
think could be better just mattifying
all over the face but it's very very
thick and heavy for the under eye brow
product also way too much for my brows
and for what I'm looking for the sculpin
glow I totally wish this was a cooler
toned powder because I really do like
the blush and I'm not too mad at this
eye shadow quad either I think the white
color or the lightest creamy shade here
is a little bit on the chalky side but
overall the colours applied well and I
find that they last pretty well too one
of my favourite things might be this
double-ended liner and I think it's
really convenient to have the two in one
and the
liquid side of this last better on me
than another product that I've used but
similar to this from Tarte I remembered
really enjoying the convenience of the
two-sided saying with that product but
the liquid always would you know be a
little bit prone to smearing off this
has really good staying power and the
pencil you know worn in the lower
waterline isn't terrible either if
you're a big matte liquid lipstick lover
you might react differently to this kind
of product but I just don't like to see
quite so much dryness on my lips like
right at the get-go you know you kind of
expect the lips to look a little more
Haggard by day's end but right at the
onset you know I don't love seeing so
much dryness in my lip this product
definitely does show that off
so hopefully this gave you some info
some insight on this new brand that
you're seeing on ulties website thank
you guys so much for watching please
leave your requests for future one brand
tutorials in the comment section and I
will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
