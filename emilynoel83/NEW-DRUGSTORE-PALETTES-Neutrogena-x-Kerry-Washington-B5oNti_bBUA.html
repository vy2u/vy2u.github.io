this little chat about a couple of
pallets from Neutrogena Neutrogena is a
makeup brand that's always on my radar
because they have done so many things
that I've really liked so the first
thing that pops into my head are the lip
products you know I love the moisture
smooth color sticks they've got awesome
tinted lip balms lip glosses I've
enjoyed a lot from their hydro boost
line today I'm wearing the foundation
they've got a good concealer even the
mascara is good they've also put out
some really nice eyes shadow quads as
well so when I was just meandering
through ulties website one day when I
saw these I thought yep I'm snatching
those up I want to see what those are
made of so it's the Neutrogena essential
cheek palette and essential eye palette
and their term is that these are curated
by Kerry Washington I love Kerry
Washington I think she's great so it's a
brand I like a person I like and I'm
always up fruit palette so let's dig in
style of this video is gonna be kind of
a talk through try it on and review it
as I go on this is not a first
impressions video because I've been
using these for a couple of weeks now
it's gonna be kind of an apply and
discuss type thing so here we go let's
do it
okay guys I'm first gonna take you
through the cheek palette it says
essential cheek palette there and the
packaging is pretty standard as far as
like small palettes go you probably have
some things that are sort of sized this
way it says love carry it's got our
signature right there and then you open
it up you do have a mirror inside and
here's your three pans of product the
names are grateful captivating and
elegant and it says inspired by your
natural beauty this essential cheat
palette was curated by Kerry Washington
to be your beauty must-have well we have
here with the bronzer and blush are two
matte colors and then this shade here is
like barely there shimmer and it really
I really struggle to make that show up
at all on my skin you know there are
some highlighters that are just so
subtle yet it is a somewhat effective
glow you know I'm thinking of the
essence pure nude highlight it's a
really subtle highlight but yet I don't
feel like I struggle with the product
it's not a lack of pigmentation issue
here I feel like this one you know i
swatch it yes I can see some color there
I'd say it's a little bit on the chalky
side it's light but it's not especially
brightening it's
giving a beautiful Sheen to my skin so
it's kind of surprised that they went
that route with that product also just
in terms of color selection here this is
a pretty light bronzer actually but I'm
guessing since Kerry Washington was in
on the selection of these shades this
was determined to be suitable I suppose
like for her but I am just a little
surprised by that because this is a
pretty light bronzer I can make it show
up on my skin but you know I'm just a
small fraction of the skin tones out
there the blush is the definite strong
point of this whole palette it's bold
it's kind of this bright coral color I
think it's perfect for the season
I've really enjoyed using it I find a
little bit goes a long way so don't be
led astray if you feel like gosh I
really kinda had to build up the bronzer
and the highlight doesn't show much but
the blush is like whew so I'm gonna try
these products on for you and just kind
of talk my way through the way I would
do it I use my ELF complexion brush with
so many bronzers and let me adjust my
mirror here I take this around my
hairline this is kind of a warm bronzer
you know how some verge on a little bit
cool shadowy contour type shades this
one is soft and warm definitely on the
lighter end in terms of like bronzers
that I have in my collection not gonna
be as dark it's like a Bahama Mama
bronzer from the balm you know or even a
Too Faced chocolate Soleil if I were to
do a little bit of a soft like contour
with this you know here's the look you
come out with it's it's sort of there
it's just pretty light if you do have a
richer skin tone similar to Kerry
Washington's I mean I would love to know
if you've tried this like how did it go
for you I always take a bronzer down the
neck and kind of along the jaw line so
yeah it's a very soft very natural matte
bronzer now allow me to show you the
blush this you're just gonna want to tap
in it picks up a lot of product your
brush will as soon as you go into it tap
off the excess colors immediately there
it's just a beautiful springy flush but
you do have to be really careful with it
I'm gonna actually tap it on my hand
first because like I feel like I overdid
it a bit on that cheek but for the
intensity of the blush shade
feel like you know fair skin tones could
be careful with it deeper skin tones
could really see it showing up as well
so I think that was a well-chosen shade
but it is tough with these pallets for
the face because you know you put out
one sort of universal pallet is it
really gonna work for everyone
so this highlight it picks up nicely on
the brush like it it's not an issue of I
can't get enough product or it's too
hard or something like that but it just
doesn't show a whole lot in a
highlighter perspective it's just not
super glowy but I'm really building it
up here I'm trying to show you what the
maximum might be that this can do and I
am getting a little like I can see it
there on my monitor I'm getting a little
right in here but I am applying quite a
bit of product where I was trying to
just barely use any of that I'm trying
to use a lot of this
it's really not a bad finished look
overall like all these products together
for my skintone I felt worked pretty
well you know the bronzer was a subtle
bronzer I did like the blush the
highlight you really got to lay it on to
see it at all I think there are much
more impressive highlighters out there
they're gonna charge ten dollars for
this which I don't think is ridiculous
and I'm just not seeing it as a huge
game-changer if that highlight was
absolutely knocking it out of the park
gorgeous I'm not saying it has to be the
most reflective brightest highlight on
the block but if it was just really
beautiful looking on the cheeks I might
have a slightly different opinion about
this because I do find the bronzer
usable and I like the blush the
highlight I feel like I am applying a
lot of powder to my skin in order to
just get a little Sheen and so that's a
little disappointing now here's what we
have for the eye palette it is the exact
same size as the other palette we just
have black detailing instead here on the
outside it says essential eye palette
and they claim to be giving you five
versatile blendable and buildable shades
now I really do like the Neutrogena
eyeshadows that are packaged hold on
please the ones that are like this the
nourishing long wear eye shadows I think
these are really good so I definitely
was willing and kind of excited to try
this palette even though the shade
selection seems so super basic like cool
brownish topes okay and I do think the
feel of these shadows seems consistent
with the feel of the others they're soft
but not too soft when you stick a brush
in them they're not like going every
which way I find them to be pretty easy
to control and in terms of finishes I
think we've got a matte here we've got a
mostly matte like a 98% Matt here with
just the tiniest bit of Sheen sometimes
in a swatch when I shear it out I can
see just that little sheen I would call
it a barely there Sheen in this shade as
well and then these two have just a
little more shimmer going on this is
more bronze II this has just that hint
of light kind of rose gold warmth
happening so this to me is the one shade
in the palette that does have the
potential to warm things up a little bit
but it's not a crazy warm palette I
would say overall the looks that I
achieve with this are on the cool side
and it has probably been the palette
recently that I've used and thought I
kind of like cool tone looks
my house you know I can go either way I
wouldn't necessarily put it in my head
to have a really dramatic different
off-the-wall like out of control bold
look I'd say you know think office
friendly think big presentation and
think just generally speaking I don't
want to be too distracting with my eye
look we're talking basic here
basic basic now I mentioned this color
right here this is sometimes my initial
like instinct to grab for that and put
it in my crease it does have a little
bit of Sheen to it and I think that
makes the color just a bit light for the
crease for me so I think today I'm gonna
actually take some of this deeper bronzy
shade despite having the bit of shimmer
just the depth in this shade makes it
work really well as a quick crease
Cutler here
in any shades that do have shimmer keep
in mind it's really a soft shimmer
nothing's like screaming at you metallic
okay so we get our crease going very
easily with that then I sometimes like
to take a little bit of this shade that
I would say has just a hint of rosy
taupe to it and sometimes I'll take that
a little bit on the outer edge and don't
worry I'll blend I just think this is a
nice kind of softener shade and then I
take a fluffy bear brush let's go over
the edges
and then this matte shade which works
really well I think it's nicely
pigmented it really shows just take that
under the brow and that can also
function to finish the edge of what you
did in the crease there now the world is
our oyster in terms of what we want to
do on the lid we could go kind of light
and brightened if we want to I think I
am going to use a little bit of this
light shade right in here I'm kind of
thinking work look like we're going to
the office we got a big meeting let's
keep it professional
I'm gonna again pull in that first shade
that I put in my crease but I'm going to
Pat that on the lid everywhere basically
where I didn't just put that lighter
color
I'm gonna take that same color and also
smudge it gently on the lower lash line
and this gives us that undetectable
definition a color of this death it's
not too light not too dark when you sort
of add that is a little smudged out
liner on the lower lash line it's like
nobody can really put their finger on
what they're seeing there because it
just doesn't look made up but you've
given your eye just a little more
definition
and then I would put a light liner on my
lower inner rim
put on a little liner and mascara and
boom I would say this is easy subtle
work appropriate makeup but let's add a
little twist to that now we're
transitioning to nighttime this shade
right down here it's not a straight up
Brown I do believe there's maybe a
little bit of plum in this and so I'm
going to take a small brush this is my
mu a 315 brush the one that I reached
for very often for you know outer corner
crease stuff and I'm taking that shade
and I'm just applying it right here to
my outer corner deepening up the look
I'm sticking the brush right there in
the corner I'm doing small circular
motions and I'm just being careful not
to drop that shape down too low
otherwise we get kind of a droopy look
so we want to keep it going kind of
pointing upward sort of in the direction
of the outer tip of the brow
I mean these shades are easy to work
with I'm not struggling to manage any of
them I'm not feeling like I really have
to be ultra careful and another thing
you can do is just grab some of that
with your flat brush and sort of pack it
a little bit on the outer part of your
lid as well it kind of helps it just
work into the look a bit better and if
you feel like you need to blend anymore
go for it
a little bit of that rich color and now
bump it up a bit on the lower lash line
with that
we did not use this shape which is very
cool this soft brown has a little bit of
Sheen it can be nice on the lid if you
do use it in the crease it's very light
it can work and I actually did come away
kind of liking my finished look when I
did it but I did find myself pulling in
one of these two darker shades just to
kind of deepen a bit more but it's a
natural eye palette it's an everyday eye
palette and while I'm sitting here
saying you know it's nice quality it's
easy to use these are user friendly
shades I think you need to think back to
your own collection and think okay do I
already have these colors all over the
place right now because that would be
one potential con with this is that the
shades are very very common if you own a
lot of natural neutral palettes you
might just look through and if you like
the look I did today say do I have a
dark bronze do I have a really dark plum
do I have sort of this dirty rose gold
color just a classic kind of like taupe
and then a cream if you're finding those
tones within other palettes then this is
not really an essential purchase but
maybe you don't have a lot of eyeshadows
and this is the exact look you're going
for your wanting to steer clear of a lot
of really orange shades this is a very
approachable and easy to use palette I
must say alright guys so here is my
finished look I use black liquid liner
as I said across the upper lash line
gave it a little wing in the spirit of
Neutrogena today I used my hydro boost
mascara which I love how my lips I
popped on something new that I'm trying
it's the Grande Lips plumping liquid
lipstick in the shade
I got this in a little sampler from
Sephora and yeah on top of it all
wearing you know both of these palettes
from the Kerry Washington collection
will call it overall kind of contrary to
my initial reaction seeing these on line
I thought this would be the thing that
definitely worked for me and this was
the thing that I thought looked honestly
kind of boring and I really just didn't
think I loved it but it was sort of I
guess a little bit the other way around
in that I was only really partially
wowed by this palette I thought the most
fantastic thing was the blush and in
something like this where there's three
colors only really feeling attached to
one of the shades kind of makes it a
no-go for me but the eye palette I feel
like has given me some really pretty
really wearable looks I found it so just
easy to grab for the colors are easy to
blend if you're sort of a shadow
beginner
I don't think you'll be intimidated by
this at all because even the
darkest shade is super easy to work into
your look and there's still quality
shadows it's just you know there are
some pallets where it's like only get
the tiniest bit on your brush or else
you're gonna be in a real mess it's not
like that and I think it's really
because the tones were selected in such
a way to be very very user friendly and
just create looks there are the kinds of
things you could wear on a daily basis
for absolutely any occasion you can go a
little bit cooler than I did today if
you leave out this Center shade but
there's most definitely nothing super
warm in that palette and the cost while
this is $9.99 the eye palette is
actually $12.99 five colours at $12.99
kind of kind of pushing it for me but
you buy things at Ulta I mean you look
for a deal on Neutrogena where it's buy
one get one 50% off that can help but
yeah those are my thoughts on these
palettes thank you guys so much for
watching I hope this video helped you
out and I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
