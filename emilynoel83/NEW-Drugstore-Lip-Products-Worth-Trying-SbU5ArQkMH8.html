focused video today it's also all
drugstore as well I've just been
uncovering like line after line of great
low-cost lip products and I thought it's
time to lump them into a video and just
really show off some of the shades that
I've been enjoying kind of interesting
how this worked out I did not plan it
this way but each product is a slightly
different format I've got a tinted lip
balm a classic lipstick a lip liner and
a liquid lipstick to share with you
today are relatively new additions to
the drugstore all like I said really
great formulas so I'm excited to try
these on and show you what I'm talking
about first one that I want to mention
are the Burt's Bees lipsticks I got mine
from Ulta they were $8.99 each and I
think they had like 14 different shades
to choose from so a pretty good shade
selection here and I really think the
packaging is adorable a lot of times I
reference the weight of a lipstick and
how I like you know something that feels
kind of weighty in the hand but these
are actually really lightweight but the
design is such that it doesn't seem
cheap I really love this honeycomb
design on the outside and it does allow
the lipstick shade to sort of show
through on each individual lipstick I
bought several but the two shades that
really appeal to me most are blush Basin
and this is going to be your soft pink
nude type color I think this is going to
appeal to a lot of people it's just very
natural very easy to wear does not have
the longevity of the deeper shade that
I'm going to mention so I'm not seeing
this all day on my lips after just one
application but it does last
surprisingly well after I eat or drink
something so I was impressed with that
but these are incredibly comfortable on
the lips there's a little bit of
thickness to the formula and I always
talk about texture with lip products and
how they feel going on
do they feel thick and kind of
moisturizing or are they too thin and
slippery this is a little more on the
thick side but extremely comfortable I
call it a cream formula depending on how
much you build it up I think that will
dictate how much shine you see on your
lips so not an extremely shiny product
but not all the way matte either but no
shimmer in these these are 100% natural
lip products they contain various oils
that are known to be high in fat
acids which is a great thing to use for
your lips as far as a replenishing lip
product goes so really love that blush
shade and then I also a huge fan of this
color called russet River I think I've
worn this on snapchat a time or two and
it's what you're seeing me in throughout
the video but this is going to be your
deep kind of brownish red I think it's
so so pretty it's super fall and winter
appropriate lately I feel like I've been
talking about how I enjoy having darker
shades in matte textures because I feel
like I'm not as worried about those
slipping outside the lip line or just
getting messy throughout the day and I
find that the matte versions can just be
a bit more low-maintenance but not
everybody likes mattes it's getting
colder out it can be nice to have that
feeling of kind of creamy moisture and
this would be a deep shade that I really
feel like stays put you know where I put
it on I'm not finding it dripping
outside lip lines I always feel like
this color um something about it just
brings more attention to my eyes somehow
which is kind of strange because you
think of you know dark lip color being
all about the lips but I do think this
gives a nice balance for dark eyes this
particular shade okay moving on to
another product it's an elf item that I
know I gave a quick mention to in a
recent elf video that I did but they are
the lip kiss balms these are two dollar
products on the elf website so if you
catch them on a 50% off sale you're only
paying a buck for these little puppies
and they're so cute
I love the shades I feel like these are
totally the feel of lip balm but
stepped-up color there is a little bit
of a minty scent on these and when you
apply them you're going to notice kind
of a cling to the lips I wouldn't really
call it a pull across your lips but
these aren't just gonna slip slide right
across like a lip smacker would there's
a little bit of that thick texture
that's going to kind of catch the lips
and it's gonna feel good I feel like
these are a very nourishing lip product
these are going to be a bit more shiny
than the Burt's Bees lipsticks but not
like a wet looking lip color three
shades that I love bare kissed is going
to be your most natural looking shade
it's kind of like a honey color on the
lips it is going to be the most sheer
but I still think it shows up pretty
impressively color wise then a really
impressive read on the
is ex-ored I think if this is your
bright cheery holiday red definitely
more bold than just about any tinted lip
balm that I've used and then I also love
very sweet if you like something a
little deeper on your lips but you're
looking for a bit more low-maintenance
approach to it I think this would be a
great one to try next up I have a liquid
lip color to mention and it's from
Revlon it's the ultra HD matte lip
colors I only have two of these and I
really think they're both home runs like
I love them both so much and these claim
to be you know a different kind of matte
liquid lip color they're gel based
they're not really along the lines of
say the colour-pop ultra matte lip
colors where you put them on and they
definitely dry down completely they're
not the kind of lip color that's going
to feel like it's solidified on your
lips entirely so therefore there is some
give-and-take with that because it can
have the ability to transfer off but at
the same time I feel a little bit of
staining going on with these I really
love the look of them both my snapchat
fam has gotten a sneak peek of these and
one little application tip if you want
these to come off most matte don't
overload them on your lips I really feel
like I can get all around my lips
without dunking back into the product
and when I do it that way they come off
more matte like immediately if you want
to lay on more and more product I'm not
saying you can't do that but you will
see more shine and if you feel like oh
gosh I've got more shine that I wanted
to just give it a quick blot immediately
and then you will see the matte color
otherwise continue to wear it and you'll
just notice it becoming more matte with
we're getting down to the shades though
I have seduction um this is going to be
that soft nude in the collection I
really like this color because it's nude
but it's not too nude I feel like it's
still giving my lips a hint of warmth
it's like the perfect level of nude that
I enjoy so I think a lot of people would
like that shade and then I had really
good luck with the shade called
addiction and this is going to be their
dark berry in this line still see a lot
of pinky raspberry tone in this but it's
nice and deep and I like it and I really
love the applicators as well it's a bit
more flat and kind of pinched in as
host to the typical doe foot applicator
I feel like I'm really able to get it
easily out to the edge of my lips
without going over and getting a nice
clean line the scent on these is strong
probably a little stronger than I like
and I'm not usually too put off by
strong scents they smell like you just
stuck your nose right down in a bag of
Skittles but if you can get through the
application you're going to be fine I
don't notice that scent as I'm wearing
them on my lips last but certainly not
least these are amazing how long have
these been on the market because these
I've not been hearing anything about
them am so pumped about it like these
are great great game-changing lip liners
those of you who consider yourselves to
be lip liner addicts lovers connoisseurs
I invite you to try these out and tell
me these aren't some of the best lip
liners you've used they're from NYX and
you know how I've raved like years ago
about their slide on eyeliners well now
they finally put out slide on lip liners
now I love a retractable lip liner these
however are not retractable so for me to
still be freaking nuts about them
clearly I think it's a great formula
these glide on so easily and then they
pretty much set when I say pretty much
set if I really want to rub and rub and
rub on my lips after I've got one of
these on there I can pull some color
away but I've got to really be trying I
can swatch these out on my hand and kind
of graze across it and they don't move
so they're really really great if you
want that stay in place lip product they
will have a matte finish
here's what I would say they glide on as
easily as my Milani color statement lip
liners which I love so much I'm very
attached to but they totally last you
can just feel them on your lips like
they are locked in I'm pretty sure I
have close to if not the entire line of
these things so let me know in the
comments section if you want lots more
info on these and I'll give it to you
but I kind of hand-picked the three
shades that I like the most
love nude suede shoes because this is
going to be that kind of near lip color
match and that's just nice to have it's
going to work well alongside so many
different lip colors if you want to wear
it as a base put a gloss over the top of
it dress it
however you want or wear it totally
alone as a matte lip color that's a
great one if you want to go a little bit
deeper a little more of like a brownish
tan in the color go for sugar glass so I
like that shade as well with this
resurgence that we're seeing of all
kinds of 90s kind of brownish neutral
lip colors I think this will be a much
loved shoe and then another one that I
think is so pretty just on its own I'm
sure I will use this alongside some red
lipsticks but just as a standalone lip
color I'm really happy with brickHouse I
could also see this color as being a
great little tool if you feel like
you've got some red lipsticks they're
just a little too loud a bit too bright
you could take brick house and kind of
work it in on your outer corners it
could give you a little bit more of an
ombre effect to your lips that make your
brighter Reds look a little bit less
like Kapow just slapped on there and
give them some more dimension gosh I
felt bare this whole video I don't have
my wedding ring on and I have note your
rings on I like just kind of stayed up
here because bells napping downstairs
and I didn't want to disrupt anything
this morning so I've been completely
unexpected and I'll see you again very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
