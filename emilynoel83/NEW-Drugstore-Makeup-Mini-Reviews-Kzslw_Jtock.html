and share with you some new drugstore
products that I've been trying lately
like I mentioned in a previous video a
few of these things I got from Ulta
recently so I guess this isn't a
roundabout way kind of like an Ulta haul
a little bit of Walmart a couple things
from Walgreens but they are all
drugstore and I'm kind of ready to
review them all so I thought it would
just bring you this video you're saying
Maybelline has is this brow palette it's
the brow drama Pro palette and I got it
in soft brown I ordered mine also off of
ulties website so I wasn't exactly sure
what I was going to be getting color
wise but I know sometimes I like to go
just a little bit lighter with my brow
shape cuz my brows have quite a bit of
thickness to them as is and sometimes
going with the deepest darkest color
that's maybe you know an exact hair
color match for me isn't always like the
best thing in my brows so I am wearing
this brow kit today and as you can see
it's fairly light it's a very cool kind
of topi colored tinted wax powder and
then this is just like a little powder
shadow highlight they do give you a
double-ended angled applicator so that
could be like your wax and your powder
that you use there and then also a
little spoolie that you can use to brush
through how about you guys but if you
try a lot of like different brow kits
and palettes and stuff sometimes the
consistency of the wax can be all over
the place as I'll mention with another
product I'm gonna talk about in this
video but this one is rather thick and
it's not like difficult to pick up with
the brush but you kind of have to make a
point to to press down into it just a
little bit but it does have some hold so
in the past few days when I've been
wearing this I have not felt I
absolutely had to put like a separate
brow gel over the top of my whole look
this does have some hold so that's nice
the brow powder is definitely pigmented
and for me you know it's just a matter
of kind of I don't know evening out some
edges smoothing out some edges of the
brow and just filling in a few little
key places here and there and it kind of
seems like really big packaging for what
you're getting in here considering you
know you've just got these couple
applicators here but they've given like
huge spaces for them and then the amount
of product you get is seems pretty darn
small right up here but there you
in a lot of brow pomade 'he's being
released recently and maybe you've tried
those and you felt like you know just
that whole creamy consistency of
everything is a little much for you and
your brows powders can be a nice soft
way to go and powders paired with a wax
really are what help it cling in and
really last in there with your brows so
in terms of products in this format I
don't love this as much as my Too Faced
brow Envy and that came with I think the
perfect consistency of wax also two
really nice tones of powder that you can
use in your brows and I always found
myself using both the light and the dark
so not a bad product there from
Maybelline but it's not completely
wowing me you know and then I want to
also compare that to this new one from
hard candy that I found this in terms of
what you get is even more similar to the
two-faced brow Envy kit because you are
getting let me open it up here for you
and you're getting the - oops tones of
brow powder there you're also getting
the wax and the cream highlights they
give you these two itty bitty like
rounded kind of funky cut little brushes
they do not really work well for the
application of product I really feel
like I need an angled brush for that
there's a little mirror on the inside
here and then you got your two sections
of product and the brow powders are
really great super pigmented like I'm
barely touching into those really nice
cool tones here I have medium dark and
they're just the kinds of shades I would
want you know one's kind of topi and a
little bit lighter one is kind of like a
straight up medium brown so I really
like those they translate they transfer
like right into your browser very very
easily but the problem with this palette
is this other side the wax is so like
greasy it's it's the most slippery and
thin wax I have ever felt in any brow
kit I've tried it doesn't really give
the brows any hold it's just so so thin
and greasy I'm not into that
and then this cream highlight that they
give you is solid as a rock it's like I
really dug into it to try to pull some
product up but it's just dry you look up
closely at it you can see how you know
it's been difficult to even just pull
product up from it it's just unfortunate
because those powders are like as
pigmented as any matte shadow I've used
you know those are so awesome and then
these are just fails on the other end so
a really weird situation there now you
guys know hard candy puts out some
really good things here and there they
have some total gems in their line and I
was hoping that these new highlight duos
would be along those lines because
everybody loves a good highlight right
and so they've got one that's called
candle lit and then another one that is
twinkle star so this one would appear to
be like a matte or semi matte highlight
duo see how there's just the slightest
bit of sheen there and the twinkle star
is much more metallic looking I have
loved hard candies baked bronzer intiki
it's actually you know it's called a
bronzer but it's a highlight for sure
and it's glowy and beautiful I thought
for as much as I like that I'm sure
these will be you know that same kind of
quality but sadly they're not I mean
that's twinkle star right there there's
one and there's the other you can hardly
see them it's like where's the actual
pigmented powder product that's holding
that sparkle together because once you
swatch it all you see is the glitter and
it applies on the skin with a little
more vibrance I guess than it does in
the swatch but still you see it's so
much glitter now I have just applied a
little bit of the lightest shade here
from the twinkle star and isn't it crazy
how much that's showing up but as I look
at myself straight ahead in the mirror I
just see you know this glitter just
metallic Frost kind of on the skin and I
think really good highlights you know
they catch the light at their peak but
they don't necessarily look like makeup
on the skin and then these are the two
kind of matte options or they're a
little bit like I guess more softly
pearlized they both look very similar
one's a bit more pinky than the other go
for this one
and these I've had trouble to even get
to show up at all I'm applying a little
bit of the pinky tone over the top and
you can see maybe just a little bit more
just very
very dry all of them are I guess I'll
even myself out by applying a little bit
more over here you know they pop on the
cheeks like I was saying but be prepared
for it to have a really kind of makeup
you look so I've been having some odd
experiences with hard candy products but
another thing that I picked up that just
really drew me in with the packaging
gorgeous lipstick here this is one of
their fierce effects lipsticks so a new
line of lipstick and this is the shade
called Prowler you guys might remember I
talked a lot about the hard candy
plumping serum lipsticks those are so so
comfortable on their really long wearing
they have kind of like a staining effect
but they feel like the most comfortable
balm ever on the lips so this line of
lipsticks seems to be a little bit more
focused on really out there type colors
so I got this one in Prowler like I said
it's really really deep and dark it's a
very very creamy shiny pigmented
lipstick there's a look at it right
there in its fullest state it's a
gorgeous color staying power wise it can
be a little sloppy because like I said
it's so creamy and for a shade that dark
I almost like to go a little bit more
toward the matte side of things because
I feel like it's just you can count on
it to stay in place a bit better
these also smell really good like kind
of a strong fruity scent to them I like
them I'm interested to try more from
this line because they do have some kind
of unique colors that you might just be
a little careful how dark you go because
those shades require a little more
maintenance a little more upkeep and
keeping an eye on them like if you're
going out and wearing a really shiny
dark shade and then I've got a couple of
mascaras to give you the heads-up on
Maybelline the falsies push-up drama
first up I thought this was like gonna
be a double-ended thing I'm trying to
like unscrew both ends but here's the
one end it's a rubber bristle brush and
I feel like the little Nubby's on this
thing are kind of far apart because I
feel like raking it through my lashes
first off it's kind of a thick creamy
formula a lot of times that'll be
something that works well for me
but I feel like it just made my lashes
stick together and didn't quite lengthen
them out as much as I would hope so I
was wearing this the other day and I
so they took some pictures on snapchat
because I was wearing it on the lower
lashes as well and it totally
transferred down in a big way and you
should have seen me then like at the
tail end of the day it was very very
smudgy I don't know I almost seem like a
little heavy for my lashes in the
formula and then the brush wasn't you
know Fanning everything out and really
highlighting each lash enough so this is
gonna be one of those that I probably
reluctantly kind of try to use up as I
go along but I'm not loving it and then
I also got the l'oreal voluminous
superstar I got the mascara and the
liner pen and this mascara reminds me a
lot of their original double extend
mascara and I'm talking about the one
with like the white end on one side and
the gold end on the other that was
another one of those mascaras I used
back in the college days and I really
liked it it builds nice length and so
does this you've got your one end which
is a classic white primer which my Estee
Lauder little black primer has spoiled
me a little bit because I'm really
liking a black primer as opposed to the
white and feeling like you've got to
cover up all the little white bits but
then the other end the brush it reminds
me quite a bit of regular double extend
except it's just ever so slightly curved
can you see that but traditional
bristles on these brushes and one thing
that I've noticed I don't like to wait
too long before I apply my top coat over
the primer for whatever reason when that
primer gets completely dry it's like my
top coat is going over something dry and
kind of bumpy I just apply the first
coat wait just briefly like let it just
start to dry down a bit and then go
right on with the second coat but I'm
wearing this today and I feel like I
achieved really nice length with it I've
got to tell you I have not worn this
mascara on the lower lashes yet so I'm
not sure if that's gonna be a smudge
fest on me or what I really just in
general like to wear my covergirl clump
crusher water-resistant down there but
bottom line do I like either of these
mascaras better than my covergirl super
sizer which is just like my absolute
current favorite mascara I would say the
answer is no because I still feel like I
get a very similar effect to this
superstar with this product but it
doesn't
make me the separate steps or you know
having to worry about how long do I wait
between coats or anything like that this
is just very easy very lengthening
separates the lashes great so this is
still my Rockstar from the drugstore
right now now this liner is one of those
liquid liner pins and I have it in black
it's got this teeny tiny like teardrop
shape and I do really like how this tip
is flexible and it really lays down
nicely on the skin I can get a nice fine
line I almost wish that it wasn't quite
so pear-shaped because I really like to
take these liner pins and use them more
sideways like that I end up getting a
thicker line that I'm really after
because of the way this gets so wide
toward the base of the felt tip to
compare that to my Milani eye Tech
extreme see that shape I prefer this
shape because I can lay that down and I
get a much more gradual line and here I
feel like I've got to make it thicker
than I want it to so I've got that on my
upper lash line today and if I wanted as
thin as possible
I just really got to work off just the
tippy tip tip of this thing not so much
take advantage of the whole side of the
felt tip but it is a very juicy unfelt
tip liner it's very easy to apply it's
not waterproof so if you do get some
moisture in contact with this it does
start to break down very quickly so just
something to keep in mind I'm gonna wrap
this up with a couple of lip balms I
found these new ones at Walgreens last
time I was there and I just really
wanted to try them out and I'm so glad I
did because they're seriously such nice
quality I know I rave about the Nivea
lip balms a lot but these are really
great as well if you're looking for
something new to try and it's the
blistex soft and lush this is SPF 15
this is what the packaging looks like
and it has the best sent from a blistex
product I've ever smelled it's like I
don't know it almost makes me think of
like sugar cookies or something baked
it's so good and it's so so softening
I've loved applying this like just right
when I sit down to do my makeup after I
put my moisturizer on it's nice to leave
some sort of bomb on your lips it gets
them really soft before I put any
product on
any colored product and it just is super
rich very creamy love the scent it's
just great and then I got this one
called blissful butters it's also an SPF
15 to me this feels really great it
feels very similar to the soft and lush
except the scent is a little bit more of
a shea butter type vibe a little more
natural seeming whereas this was a bit
sweeter they both feel awesome I would
say the soft and lush is probably my
favorite though and then as if I haven't
talked long enough I've got one more
thing I have not used this yet but I
just wanted to give you guys the heads
up if you are real techniques brush fans
like I am you might be excited about
this I'm really pumped to use it and
I'll let you guys know how it works but
I got this Real Techniques deep
cleansing gel says use weakly dampened
bristles and warm water squeeze a drop
of gel onto bristles and then just rub
the brush clean so I can't wait to use
this five point one fluid ounces my hope
is that this isn't going to be something
I feel the need to wash every brush with
you know because it was a little bit
pricey compared to like the baby shampoo
you might be using otherwise and I feel
like baby shampoo works just fine for
most of my brushes but I do have those
few like very resistant brushes
particularly like my foundation brushes
the really dense ones usually my Real
Techniques once clean up a little easier
than the Sigma ones but my hope is that
I could use this with any of my brushes
like that and just get a much quicker
clean with them so we'll see but thank
you guys so much for watching this
little compilation of drugstore reviews
I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
