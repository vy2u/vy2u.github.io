sitting over here it's like creeping off
the edge of my desk there's so much of
it new drugstore products last week I
did the video all about new drugstore
skincare and now I've got like three
times as many makeup products to tell
you about in this video the good the bad
and the ugly that's pretty much what it
is I don't know if I'll call this video
that but that's the way I feel about
this maybe that's being a bit dramatic I
would say it's the good /great the
average in the ugly these are all things
that I accumulated during or a little
bit before the Emily Awards so I've had
a while to play with these and I thought
you know it's long overdue to just do a
whole on this stuff I'm gonna try it all
out and I'm going to wait till I can
actually do a video and give you some
major feedback on it first thing I want
to mention and we're gonna start off
with the things that I really liked um
so that would be these new covergirl
true naked eyeshadow palettes I was
really pleased with these you guys
remember when they put out hold on let
me find it for you they recently put out
like these quads in this style and it
was kind of an improved formula I think
for covergirl reminds me a lot of those
Maybelline eye studio quads that I
really enjoyed well basically it feels
like that shadow texture and they've put
out several neutral eyeshadow palettes
so if you can't get enough of the
neutral eye palettes they have one
called Golden's they have one called
roses and one called
nudes and I am wearing the nudes one
today for a very like taupey brown eye
and something that I do like about these
is that they're not all the same finish
like there are some highly shimmery
shades in these there's some that may be
a little bit of like very very fine
sparkle but there are also some matte
colors so I appreciate the variety this
is a really nice basics palette by the
way because you've got three matte
shades that are just super you know easy
to use the kinds of shades you'd wear a
lot so I've got the two matte Browns in
my crease I've got this really shimmery
taupe color it's so pretty I've got that
all over the lid I've got some of this
really light shimmery shade on the lid
and around
the inner corner as well blended some of
this dark shimmery brown on the lower
lash lines so end-result I mean you can
go very smoky with this I didn't even
touch the black for this look I feel
like some of the standard covergirl
quads you know not so much this formula
but their regular formula kind of chalky
you know not super pigmented and so I
feel like these are a major improvement
and really thinking about getting a
video more in-depth on all of these if
you would like to see that or maybe some
potential dupe discussion let me know in
the comments section it's kind of hard
for me to pick a favorite between these
I feel like the nudes is very wearable
very classic great for the cool taupe
lovers but I mean for me personally I
love the roses that might be one of my
favorites out of this bunch just because
I love shadows the verge on that berry
mauve look and I also think the goldens
are great because there are some really
nice golds in here both like a true gold
light gold a bronze and then all of the
shades that would coordinate well with
those but the formula is nice if you
decide to try these out I don't think
you'll be disappointed yet another hit
from covergirl that I absolutely love is
this trublend blush this is the medium
rose shade and it's kind of the style of
a baked blush so you might think you
know is that going to be SuperDuper dry
or what's the texture going to be on
this it's so soft this is one of those
things where the swatch does not do it
justice like the swatch is not bad it
can really catch the light it's got a
little luminosity but no glitter shade
is like this pretty fusion of peach
neutral and berry I feel like as I look
at it I can pick out all of those tones
and I just love the way it looks on the
cheeks I think it's very radiant I just
stumbled across this not really in a
special display it was kind of at the
end of an aisle with wet and wild
products some new some old and they have
this mega glow illuminating palette in
catwalk pink does anybody remember when
catwalk pink was like just the size of a
regular compact well they blew that
sucker up and they made it super
shimmery I've got it on it's my
highlight today I think it really packs
a punch and I think this could actually
be a blush slash highlight palette
because I think you could use this half
and blend these two shades together make
that be your blush it looks
a kind of rose gold type blush shade and
then these to make a really intense
highlight and it is kind of powdery it's
kind of light I wouldn't describe this
as a creamy feeling product but yet it
is still very pigmented the sections of
product are actually wide enough if you
really wanted to confine a smaller sized
highlight brush to just one shade I
think you absolutely could I think this
was a good move from Wet n Wild because
they've got some really nice blushes out
they've recently put out you know their
little split pan contour palette which I
love and so I think it was time for
something really really glowy like this
and I think they did a really good job
with it staying on the highlight topic
and still a product I would recommend I
think it works really well I just don't
necessarily think everyone needs this
because not everybody needs one two
three four five six seven shades of
highlight but this is the strobe of
genius palette from NYX and it's just
loaded with every tone of highlight
someone could want as far as the layout
they've got some more like I don't know
maybe unusual shades for highlights up
in the top part and then like it really
rose gold a little bit of a golden e
champagne a really light shade here yes
I've already scoured my collection for
dupes and while some shades you not look
through Beca the balm etc some high-end
highlights are really close to a few of
these but not necessarily exact dupes so
just throwing that out there the
textures on these are awesome there is
one shade that was kind of a dead form
and that's this yellow one like it gives
off hardly any color when I put it on my
cheeks I can't really see it this is a
light lilac color but it has kind of an
iridescent look on the skin it is bright
this palette might call for a whole
video on itself as well but on the top
couple of shades here on either side of
the lilac are both a little bit cooler
rosy type colors and then I would say
things happening down here are a little
bit more warm of all of them this shade
right here has a little bit of a softer
shimmer to it I absolutely kind of
dusted it all over my skin the other day
and was pretty pleased with the way that
looked for deeper skin you know shades
like this and this would make really
beautiful highlights and if you're
lighter skin and you want to use those
shades I mean use them as a way of
topping off your blush or put them more
where your blush placement would be and
they're really beautiful that way too
but unless you're like SuperDuper into
highlighting does one need a full
palette of highlights I don't know if
your makeup crazy like me maybe you do
they do you think the quality is there
with six out of the seven shades so I do
enjoy that palette more things at work
and I'm not going to give a long
drawn-out explanation for this but my
cushion from the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
line I have a full video breaking down
everything cushion cushion foundations a
blush and eyeliner and this was probably
my top pick out of what I talked about
there so loving that more things that
work NYX ombre blushes lip colors I'm
holding the blush in whoops if I don't
stick a nail in it they mix ombre blush
in mauve me and gets a really unique
shade it's got a little Sheen to it it
can look very different depending on how
much product you pack on and whether or
not it's catching the light it can just
have a really unique look on the skin so
loving that kind of similar to the balm
in stain blush and houndstooth if anyone
has that one of my favorite lip duos
from that line is the one in Bonnie and
Clyde that's the one with the warm
tomatoey red and then a very side that
you can blend into it full video on all
these products some people complain that
there's not enough product in these um I
guess I wasn't too shocked because they
are double-ended Stix one end is the
thicker lip color stick one end is the
liner I didn't expect to get like the
full amount you might normally have I
love blending this bright red in with
the berry on the lips I think it creates
the most beautiful ombre effect so I
enjoy that I think quality wise it's
really really good these don't bleed
outside the lips yet they're very
intense they go on easily NYX has just
been on their game with lip liner type
products lately tried this Maybelline
lasting drama waterproof gel pencil this
is in the shade cashmere white and this
is what I've been wearing occasionally
around
the inner corner it is like my favorite
inner corner highlight because it goes
on like buttah
I mean no pressure necessary and it
really catches the light and a lot of
times you'll try to highlight that area
with shadows and maybe it will show
right after application but that's a
quick place for things to kind of wear
off for me
so when I use this it lasts all day and
I kind of pull it upward a little bit up
onto the upper lash line and then just
grab a q-tip and blend out the edges of
it just a little bit just FYI not a
retractable pencil you will need to
sharpen that one new pencil for
Maybelline that is retractable is the
master precise skinny again we're still
talking about things that worked and I
really like this pencil on the shade I
have it in is called defining black 210
and look does this packaging style look
familiar to anyone just like Maybelline
define a brow they took that skinny
Maybelline definer brows like the exact
same design this lasts a really long
time it almost kind of rivals the
staying power of my Milani blackest
black kohl kajal eyeliner but this is a
very fine tip I've been wearing it in my
lower inner rim staying power is pretty
good there but I love how easily this
gets the upper inner rim and the tight
line area in between the lashes really
wedging it in there whether you're going
from this direction or just trying to go
across your upper lash line and get
SuperDuper close to the lashes and
really work it in there this does it so
easily draws on much like the other one
very black but a very fine line minimal
pressure required this one is
retractable so if you like very fine
tipped pencils and you think there's a
place for this in your collection you
might want to check it out I've tried a
couple of these Maybelline Color tattoo
concentrated crayons
did I not say when the color tattoos
came out in the pots that it would be
really great if they would come out with
those that formula in a jumbo stick and
now here we are folks
um the formula really long wearing it is
the kind of thing you know you can draw
on you can rub over it it does stay in
place for me has good staying power but
I do find these to be a bit more sheer
than the regular color tattoos whereas
in
else notice that like if you were to
take these across your lids I feel like
I have to build up the color just a
little bit more whereas if I just stuck
my finger in one of the color tattoo
pots it's pretty full on color right
from the get-go so something has changed
a little bit in the formula it doesn't
affect the staying power but I do think
it affects the application if you really
like both of my shades I use this bronze
truffle it's kind of a base on my lower
lash line not that you can really tell
because I topped it off with a lot of
shadows they're really pretty soft
metallic not too brassy then I love this
lilac lust almost smokey lilac shade I
think that's beautiful there is one more
thing that's in my like pile it's like
half in my like pile for one shade and
half into my so-so pile but it's the
covergirl Oh sugar
lip color in gumdrop this says vitamin
infused balm and it does feel really
comfortable I do think it's nice and
moisturizing on the lips and I think
this shade it smells so much like those
fresh sugar tinted lip balms this is the
one in sugar berry and I do think the
color the appearance on the lips is a
mere dupe for this kind of shade so the
smell is there the textures maybe not
quite as thick and rich as these bones
but the color is definitely on point as
you can see it's going to show up way
more sheer than it appears to be in the
stick but I do think this is a beautiful
shade it's like a pinky berry it's right
up my alley I do kind of like that these
have the formed shape of a typical
lipstick bullet because with colors like
this that show up more it's nice to have
that precision however I was rather
frustrated with the cupcake shade here
which is shade number one and it looks
like this I would expect a nice soft
light pink and I tell you I got a sit
here and swatch this for a good I don't
know 30 seconds before I start to see
any color building up on my hand it's
like so soft barely there does have that
nice feel that the other one has does
have the same scent but I'm not know
waste my time with this if I can't see
any color on my lips we're officially in
the so-so pile now
this is the rimmel it's called the only
one lipstick it's called oh so wicked is
the shade I picked this has pigmentation
out the you know what I mean it is just
so so bold it's rich with one swipe I
mean look at that shade love the shade
but it's also extremely creamy and I
don't feel like this is a shade I want
to wear in a very creamy almost
borderline like little bit greasy
formula that scares me
I think this line of lipsticks has
potential and I would absolutely love to
try some lighter shades because I think
that might be right up my alley for this
kind of formula but this particular one
for as slippery as the formula is and
dark as the shade is that's not a good
combo for me so this is in my soso pile
because I actually probably will
repurchase more of these shades but this
particular one I'm just kind of like an
another thing that like I don't mind
using I think it's a good product but I
have my doubts about it as time goes on
is this Maybelline brow drama crayon
which I have in the shade probably the
darkest one it doesn't say what color I
have here but it's a twist up crayon and
they've kind of marketed this as a
pomade stick that's going to not only
like tint your brows but it's going to
hold them in place as well so it's got
some texture to it and I do like that
aspect I like the thought of a quick
just kind of swipe it on thing I can see
how this would be an appealing product
and I've got some of this in my brows
today
however once this stick which is already
kind of a thick you know jumbo stick
once that starts to wear down how are
you going to keep on using it because it
simply twists up this is not a product
you're going to be sharpening and I
think when this starts to round off it's
going to be way too much she's going to
be really hard to get in there and
confine it to those little areas without
getting more than you need so that's my
concern with this product I do like
where their heads out you know like
where they're going with it but maybe if
they put this out like in a sharpen a
bowl version with a little sharpener on
the side that would be really cool I
think the last thing now from the so
soap
is this covergirl plumpify blast Pro
mascara while I love the word plumpify I
think that's just a great term this is
not my favorite mascara
of course I'm comparing it to covergirl
super sizer which I love the brush looks
cool and I do like how they put bristles
right out to the tip kind of like a
benefit they're real type concepts and
the brush does come off really nicely
cleaned off and I appreciate that as
well but it's quite a bit larger
compared to the super sizer and so
that's been a little bit funky for me I
mean you get in a zone of using a
certain mascara wand and then you take
the size of that times like two or three
you're going to notice it and it's going
to feel awkward also I feel like I've
got to do more work to build up the
product I've got to do a solid two to
three coats to get close to what I get
with the super sizer this does do a
decent job of thickening up the lashes
but I don't think it does as well as
super sizer with length and now we're
going to move on to the stuff that I
really just would not recommend and so
we've got an even worse mascara here
this is from Rimmel it's called the
super curler 24 hour volume and curl
mascara I definitely was drawn in by the
curling claim here because curl is
something my lashes don't want to do so
I picked this one up it is a classic
kind of large curved brush mascara wand
here traditional bristles the covergirl
was rubber bristles by the way the brush
comes off really really cleaned off
almost maybe a little too cleaned off
because when I apply this to my lashes
it looks like hardly anything is on
there and even with multiple coats like
I start building up the little funky
ends going off the tip of my lashes like
I can tell it's really trying to build
some length on itself but it's not
looking normal I think the plan here was
probably to put out a really lightweight
mascara that wouldn't build up too much
product on the lashes so they could
continue to hold their curl somewhat and
I would say yeah this did stay very
light on the lashes but it just didn't
make my lashes look big enough at all
it's just a very natural looking mascara
I don't know some of us here aren't into
natural looking lashes
to eyeliner fails for me from Physicians
Formula one I won't speak about at
length in this video because I already
did in the cushion video this cushion
eyeliner long story short it started out
as a really cool thing that I was super
excited about and then in a matter of
two three applications it started to
really get dry check the cushion video
for all the dirty details on that this
other one that I have this is also from
that eye booster lied and this says two
and one lash boosting economic felt tip
eyeliner plus serum so both of these
claim to have that Sarah minute that
boosts your lashes up I don't know I
haven't been using these long enough to
talk about the kinds of results they
mentioned here which is like after three
weeks I've absolutely loved the eyeliner
from this particular line that has the
very fine brush tip this is what you
want to try but this thing I mean they
claim there's even a little thumbprint
on here that's where you put your thumb
and this is my issue this tip with the
little like notches on it it says
precision felt tip with four ink
reservoir system what why why do we need
that if I lay this down across my lash
line I get this little bumpy look
because that's the way it transfers down
I'm definitely one who doesn't just like
to apply the eyeliner from the tip I
like to actually utilize the length of
whatever the applicator might be so I
don't like the way that applies they
very very teeny tip is just a little bit
bendy but there's no flexibility with
this whole part so I do think that makes
application slow and if you do decide to
lay it down plan on it looking a little
bit uneven I have four contour palettes
in this pile I'm gonna start off with
the one that I think is maybe could have
been more toward my like soso pile you
know it's not that bad but I just
wouldn't really shout from the rooftops
hey everybody needs to buy this because
I don't think it's that great either
this is the Maybelline master contour
palette and I have it in the medium to
deep shade because I just thought there
might be a little more punch a little
more pigment out of this this shade is
pretty warm on tour can be workable but
it's definitely more on the warm side
than I typically like to grab for when I
get out in more
day light I feel like it just shows a
little bit more it doesn't look quite
like a natural shadow the blush I'm
wearing is kind of a shimmery peach it's
okay it's pretty average as far as
blushes go like it would never just
stand out to me if I had a single of
that in my collection and then this
highlight might actually be my pick of
the palette it's kind of a soft golden
shade and it looks really pretty on the
skin I guess my thought was this for as
many great contouring products as
they're on the market for as many
beautiful blushes as there are beautiful
highlights this just doesn't stack up
that great with all of those various
items so I wouldn't really recommend it
although it doesn't totally suck now
Rimmel also has their little contour
trio the blush I could not really get
that to show up very well on my skin I
have this in golden sands I guess it's
the name implies this bronzer part is
just very golden it's very bronzer II
not really so much something I'm going
to want to wear as a contour because it
hardly shows up as a contour the
pigmentation I thought was just really
lacking in this little palette so
overall you know the tones on these two
could have potentially been good if they
were more pigmented this middle shade
though not even close to something I
want to be contouring with and then
L'Oreal put out their infallible Pro
contour duo so this is one of those
situations where they've given you the
brush that you can supposedly sweep
across here and you can just boom put it
on your cheeks and there's your look
remember when they did the one sweep
eyeshadow that you could supposedly take
that applicator and go across the three
eyeshadow shades and then put it
directly on your eyes like it's a really
I think gimmicky idea some people might
think to use a product in this way and
then not really go ahead and fully blend
it out because this brush isn't good for
blending so I don't know it's just a
little misleading I think in terms of
that technique this is the contour that
I'm wearing today and it's the best
contouring shade probably of these three
powder palettes that I'm talking about I
do think it's usable it works well it
seems to have good pigment the highlight
I couldn't really get to have a lot of
good payoff once sheared out on the
cheeks the highlight that I'm where
today is that catwalk pink from
wet-and-wild as I said earlier but the
big reason why I don't feel like I can
recommend this infallible Pro contour is
it for a fraction of the price
covergirl has an even larger contouring
palette with the ideal contour shade and
then a matte highlight which is kind of
nice to have in the sea of ultra
shimmery highlights and this works so
great this is in the shade caramel
toffee I think it's awesome I've done a
full review on this product it's not
brand new
so this versus this I think this totally
wins so as a result this isn't something
I feel like I can recommend NYX has come
out with a cream highlight and contour
palette several of you were telling me
about this when I talked about the elf
cream contour palette and this has I
have it in the shade light first off
you've got your contour and your lighter
shade here which just has a little bit
of a yellowish tone and both of these
are basically matte and then you have a
shimmery accent type color right here my
problem with this I think the tones
could work for me and I've used it and
I've been able to pull it off okay
but the consistency of these it's so
thick like it's really thick it's not
very easy to blend across the skin I was
just really disappointed in the way this
felt and I think you know whether you
want to pick it up with a sponge or a
brush or your finger and put it across
the skin it tugs it just does not mesh
right back into your skin I thought the
elf contour palette the cream contour
palette did a lot better job the mascara
cream compact that I had demonstrated
back in my cream products video I'll
link to that those things just went on
effortlessly they were simple to work
with and this one I mean I just don't
have the time and patience for this so
that wraps up this epic long video on
new drugstore products there are still a
few things that I just hadn't really had
quite enough of an opportunity to deal
with yet and that will probably work
their way into their own individual
video thank you for spending time with
me today if there were any related
videos that I mentioned that would give
you more insight into some of these
products I will link to those below and
have a great day I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
