today is video it's going to be all
about skincare drugstore skin care
products some new things that have come
out lately from a variety of brands I've
got some Burt's Bees some Neutrogena
Garnier several different elf products
as well that are kind of interesting so
I'll just kind of go through and let you
know what my experiences have
experiences have been with these
different products and if you've used
them as well feel free to share in the
comments section how they've worked for
you and as we know there are tons of new
drugstore makeup products actually
drugstore and high-end makeup launches
here lately I've been trying so many of
them I'm actually like sorting them into
piles of worked really well or things
that I didn't like or was indifferent
about still got a few things there that
I'm really formulating an opinion on so
I thought I would go ahead and put my
skincare video out first also just a
quick update on one table I've had some
questions like how did the Box work out
because I did a makeup box first and I
got that in I was thinking I might just
go ahead and review that but now I think
I'll probably be getting my next box
which I chose to be an accessories box
I should be getting that fairly soon and
I thought why not just do a video
talking about both of those because
they're different things and I might
have different experiences with each one
might just make for a little more
informative video for those of you who
are considering that service but on with
the drugstore skincare first thing on
something that did not work for me at
all and I think I snapped about this as
well it's the birds fees peach and
willow bark exfoliating facial cleansing
towelettes so I was totally drawn in by
the peach I saw this on altas website
and I was like I'm gonna love these if
they smell like peach and they really do
smell good and the scent is pretty
strong and I should take that as a red
flag as soon as I smell something like
there's a chance this could be a bit
irritating on the skin it definitely was
for me here's what one of the towelettes
looks like kind of stretchy there were
25 in the package and they do have a
little bit of a scrubby feel to them and
they're pretty well saturated with
product the problem for me was not just
around my eye area but elsewhere on my
face it just felt kind of irritated as I
was using it and then after I used it I
thought
that seemed a little abrasive and I felt
like the scent was playing into that a
little bit well maybe a bracelet is the
wrong word to use because I don't feel
like this scrubbing action from this was
too rough but just the sentiment that
was happening even holding it here it's
like I'm feeling some fumes you know I
take it that way sometimes with really
heavily scented products like I can
almost feel it in my eye area I like the
scent it might make a nice body wash but
like I said using it around the eyes I
wasn't able to really thoroughly get in
there and get the makeup off like really
kind of scrub it off like I would want
to because I was feeling that irritation
as I used it so these are a no-go for me
next thing is this Neutrogena hydro
boost water gel this has an SPF 15 it
says it has hyaluronic acid in it it's
just like a regular squeezy tube here
but it pumps out I find one pump to be
pretty good all over my skin it comes
out it looks kind of like a bluish just
creamy gel it's not a straight-up clear
gel and it's got just that little bit of
creaminess but as you can see as you
blend it out it's a very thin
lightweight product this strikes me as
the kind of thing that would be awesome
for someone with combo to oily skin I
say that because it is so thin it's very
fast absorbing but yeah it's not one of
those moisturizers where you spread it
all over your face and then in five
seconds your life where did my
moisturizer go I don't feel like I put
anything on this still makes the skin
feel kind of nicely hydrated but my skin
right now which is normal
Weber chewing on a little bit dry for me
I feel like I could use a little bit
more hydration beyond what this gives
I've got a few things in this video
there are just really different kinds of
makeup products and one of those is this
Biore and baking soda cleansing scrub
have any of you drive this I thought
this was just the neatest thing first
off it's not going to be the kind of
thing you want to like store in your
shower because you don't want to get any
water going in here or else it'll
totally mess up the product so you want
to keep this in a dry space but you
start off to use this just get your skin
wet and then sprinkle I think they say
like a quarter size
yeah quarter size amount of the product
into your hands
the water starts to activate the
cleanser and you can add more water if
you want a more gentle feeling scrub so
it's very customizable in terms of how
much scrub enos you feel on your skin
and at first when I started just like
rubbing it in I'm like okay you know
this feels like I'm not really sensing a
lot of scrubbing action and I had to
just work with it a little bit like 10
15 more seconds and I was like oh my
gosh what an amazing feeling scrub
because it was the finest scrub ever um
another really great quality scrub that
I love that has itty-bitty teeny
particles in it would be the philosophy
micro delivery wash love the way that
feels
this the teeny tiny bits that are giving
you that scrubbing texture are even more
fine but there's so much of it you feel
like you're able to get a really
thorough yet gentle scrub on the face
and like I said add more water if you
feel like the scrub you're getting is a
little bit too much for you now it does
say avoid eye contact with this I don't
use this as a cleanser in terms of
something that's going to remove makeup
I used it as a scrub in itself after I'd
already taken my makeup off but it just
feels really cool on the skin like
literally cool and just it's interesting
it's fun and different I think this is
really awesome my skin felt super smooth
after I use this so love it now
something that really is going to act as
a makeup remover is this yes to coconut
it says hydrate and restore ultra
hydrating melting cleanser and it says
yes to virgin coconut and Moringa seed
oils to help melt away your makeup it
looks kind of like a gel maybe a little
bit of a cloudy looking gel but it's
very very thick it says there are two
ways you can try this you can squirt it
in your hand and add water to create a
creamy emulsion that thins it out just a
little bit or you can apply it just
straight to dry skin or you know your
skin with makeup on it start rubbing it
around and you will see it strip the
makeup away very quickly
oh I scratch on my back oh I was really
happy with how quickly and how
thoroughly this actually got the makeup
off my skin including the eyes I could
rub it around my eye area felt no
irritation there whatsoever how scented
is this product anyway because I felt
like I was smelling a lot of coconut but
didn't seem to be a problem at all
terms of irritating my eyes and so I
kind of rubbed it around ended up using
it in the shower so I added a little bit
of water as I was going like this all
over an addenda and I really felt like
my makeup was fully removed and I tested
that after the fact with a wipe and I
was able to see okay this really did you
know get all my eye makeup off got my
face makeup off the problem is when I go
to actually rinse everything I still
feel like I have this film of the
cleanser on my skin and it's really hard
to just get off it doesn't just really
rinse away with water even after a lot
of rinsing I could just tell there's
still something on there like as I move
my hands across my skin and it doesn't
feel completely clean it's there's a
little tug especially in certain areas
and that bothered me a little bit I
really like to you know feel like I'm
completely cleansed and to me I think
there's a difference when you're
removing makeup you're just washing your
face and some cleansers will make you
feel like you're completely zapped of
all your moisture others will you know
be maybe a little bit replenishing but
you won't feel residue on your skin I
would put the CeraVe hydrating cleanser
in that bracket and then this really I
mean no matter how much I rinsed I still
feel like I had this residue left behind
branes did it did a really good job of
melting down the makeup as it claimed to
do but to go ahead and get rid of that
residue you'll want to bring in like
another face wash or a face wipe or
something of that nature so for that
reason it's not a love for me but for
somebody with really dry skin it might
be something to try alrighty now I've
got some different things from ELF here
first one I'll talk about and I do have
some elf skin care moisturizers like a
night cream and a day cream and a serum
and I'd use those for a little while I
kind of need to get back into them
because I've been trying so many
different things my initial reaction
with those was that I felt like they all
had a very very similar consistency the
eye cream the night cream the serum the
day cream they just all had a very
similar texture to me that's not like my
final review or anything and I can dig
deeper drive some more if you guys want
more of a full-on review of elf skincare
but some of the items I'm mentioning in
this video obviously I've been trying
more and I can tell you what I think
this one is all wet from being in the
shower it's the exfoliating scrub did
not love this
it was not scrubby enough for me if you
guys are familiar with the st. Ives
apricot scrub it totally reminds me of
that texture and feel on the skin you
know it's kind of thick you do feel some
scrubbies right at the get-go when you
start putting it on your skin but it's
just not quite potent enough and
compared to this baking soda thing I
mean this really worked well this just
seemed like a really average scrub to me
not something I think you guys are going
to be fascinated by because this really
fascinated me it's the hydrating bubble
mask this is a mask that goes through
phases without you even trying to do
anything like it transforms on your skin
and I'm going to try to insert like a
little time-lapses I'm talking about
this to show you exactly what happens as
you apply this but what you do is you
take off this little top first you press
down here on this little plastic thing
and when you press down some of the mask
comes the description says this
hydrating and nourishing gel transforms
into a bubble mask on the face bubbles
foam to remove excess dirt and cleanse
pores for glowing healthy-looking skin
so you put this on you feel like you're
applying a gel and very quickly it
starts to kind of bubble up and you can
feel that happening and then it goes
like a step further and turns into like
a foam all over your face like you look
like maybe you've applied a thin layer
of shaving cream all over your face and
then that foam kind of starts to break
down it's almost like it's just
shrinking across your face to where you
really can't see anything on your face
eventually when that process is over
I've got to say that feels freaking
weird it feels like you've got maybe
some hair on your face or just something
very lightweight like a light scarf was
just dusting across your face and
sometimes depending on how much I put on
the first time I use this I put on a
very thin amount and it wasn't quite as
frustrating to me but then the next time
around I put on more and it just kind of
made me want to each my face you know
it's like something's on there get it
off but I know it's the mess so I'm not
going to touch it eventually it all kind
of disappears to where you don't see
anything on your skin to touch it it's
as if there's like dried soap on your
skin but you don't see the bubbles
anymore
and it says when the bubbles begin to
dissipate which is about five to ten
minutes that was about right for me a
massage with fingertips and wash with
warm water so when you add water
this really bubbles up again like it
becomes a very foamy cleanser I would
say it feels kind of thick foamy takes a
while to rinse off actually and your
skin does feel SuperDuper clean after
this hydrating is actually in the name
and I wouldn't say I feel especially
hydrated after this like I might have
that expectation as I'm going through
the masking process but once it really
foams up and you're rinsing it off and
you're getting just this full-on rinse I
don't feel like my skin has been totally
stripped it doesn't have a tight feeling
like after using some really hardcore
cleansers might but I don't really feel
hydrated especially compared to some of
those other masks that I've loved and
mentioned in the Emily Awards like the
glossy a moisturizing moon mask the
Peter Thomas Roth masks those really
leave my skin after I'm done masking
very soft but also very nourished where
is this I don't so much agree with the
hydrating claim I think it gives you a
really nice deep clean but if you're
looking for added hydration it's just
not going there for me anyway if you
really like to experiment with different
kinds of masking products you might find
this entertaining I mean the first time
I used it I was like what is going on my
face there are bubbles like crawling
across my face it's really weird it's
different it's kind of cool I'm really
glad I did try it because it's so
different from anything I have another
thing elf is selling now and their
skincare lines this little roller and
they say to use this after you apply a
moisturizer to your skin so you just
gotta go you're supposed to go like away
from the center of your face I thought
I'd toss the box but I actually do have
it says massage is the skin to help
relieve tension and help rejuvenate for
glowing looking skin helps encourage
absorption of moisturizers perfect for
using on the face or body and it just
says to use it after you apply your
moisturizers so I've been doing this um
I don't know to the naked eye I guess I
don't know that I'm seeing a result but
maybe it is like internally doing
something better for how well the
moisturizers absorb I've been using it
in the morning after I apply a daytime
moisturizer and then just work for two
other things that
mentioned here that are still very much
I feel like an in-progress type product
that I'm trying out one of them is this
Garnier skin active micellar cleansing
water big old thing so these they're
selling I mean this is a 13 and 1/2
fluid ounce container here reminds me a
lot of my Bioderma and just a similar
feel it does claim to remove makeup on
but sometimes I'll just use this as sort
of a refreshing step as I sit down here
to my makeup area before I put
moisturizer on and again with these
micellar waters there's no rinsing
necessary this pink cap says all skin
types even sensitive and then there is a
blue cap that claims like more
waterproof makeup removal I like that
there's no need to rinse because in the
morning if I don't feel like you know
just washing my face at the sink I can
put some of this on a cotton pad take it
all over I think I'm just going to have
to use it a little bit longer and really
pay attention to the subtleties of this
product to see how similar exactly it is
to the bio durva I've been using and
enjoying even if I've already washed my
face i sweep some of this on with a
cotton pad and it's like okay that was
cooling that was refreshing my skin
feels all like nice and ready to go I
haven't used this to remove makeup yet
in my past experiences with trying to
remove a lot of makeup with my seller
waters I've been kind of frustrated
because it just takes a lot of work but
I will be trying the waterproof makeup
removing one to see if that's leaps and
bounds better in that way so I'll keep
you posted on that another thing that I
just haven't had enough of an
opportunity to use yet I guess that's
fortunately I haven't had a lot of
blemishes to use this on right now it's
the Burt's Bees herbal blemish stick it
comes in a little packaging like this
and this says this wonderfully effective
all natural formula has a tea tree leaf
oil and willow bark a natural source of
salicylic acid to remove to remove oil
and unclog and clean the pores so this
is actually just a little liquid
straight up liquid rollerball that you
can put on any blemishes you might be
dealing with I am also trying out as I
showed in my last video this boo-boo zap
from benefit and they seem like a
similar format just liquidy type
products that you're going to put on any
blemishes so I will use those when
necessary and report back on how
skilling but that's my little new
drugstore skincare wrap-up for you I
hope this and let you in on some new
products that you might not have known
about before definitely some interesting
things on the market now the elf stuff I
ordered off of eyes lips face calm
everything else I got from Oakley's
website I will have those products
linked below and that can be helpful
number one if you want to buy the
product number two just takes you to the
site and you can see what all the
ingredients are in these things as well
so thank you guys I will talk to you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
