new products from ELF
I've definitely run into some hits and
misses and one of the key new things on
the website that you'll notice is this
aqua beauty line so it's kind of some
different formulations of products for
eyes lips and cheeks they have these
creamy eyeshadows that apply with the
doe foot applicator I just ordered two
of those shades I got all of the shades
of these kind of gel type stains for the
lips and then I was really curious about
these blush bronzer duos because I know
ELF has for a long time sold blush
bronzer duos that look exactly like this
but I was curious to see whether these
were just different shades or a totally
different formula altogether and they
definitely are a different formula I got
this in the shade bronzed peach and it's
a very vibrant coral shade right here
and then kind of a deep but still golden
a bronzer what's interesting about this
formula to me and what you'll notice as
soon as you get it is there's no fallout
that these kick up whatsoever they are a
very different texture they almost
remind me a little bit of the color pop
blushes because they do have a definite
like half cream half powder type feel
and because of that while this shade
looks crazy bright and that looks really
dark I feel like they don't really get
as intense as you know some really
pigmented powder might that little bit
of creaminess in these products when you
dip your brush in it's like it keeps you
from picking up too too much I wasn't
wild about the bronzer but I think the
blush is absolutely fantastic they're
kind of like a satin finish on both of
the products in here I just love the way
that blush really popped on the cheeks
but doesn't have any sort of a powdery
appearance at all it was really cool to
experience the different formula I don't
really like it any better than the blush
bronzer powder duo that elf has had for
a long time just because I think those
you know you stick your brush in it's a
little bit goes a long way and in a
sense I can almost find that a little
bit easier to use here there was a
little more work involved to pick up
especially the bronzer product that's in
this compact let's talk about these
eyeshadows here I have them in the
shades molten bronze so that's this
really
warm shimmery bronzer is a little bit of
sparkle going on in that shade and also
rose gold which seems like more of a
champagne like very very soft blush type
color as opposed to a really golden type
shade I dab the molten bronze shade
right on the outer part of my lid and up
into the crease and then I used a brush
from Real Techniques that I think is
just ideal for this texture it's called
the shading brush and you just kind of
dab over it work it into the crease
they blend out pretty easily and I did
find I had plenty of time to blend it
out it didn't set too fast but the nice
thing about these is that they do
eventually set and they don't stay
feeling dewy or tacky on your skin I
also blended a little bit of the darker
shade just barely onto the lower lash
line as well and once that was all
blended out I used the rose gold more on
the inner part of the lid and I think
that shades just really beautiful I
could see that as being a fun kind of
you know spotlight any look that you're
wearing I do really like the way the
look came out it's just kind of an
effortless easy type thing however is it
as easy as just reaching for a powder
duo or even you know shadow sticks that
I think can I don't know maybe be
controlled a bit more easily on the eyes
I don't know about that like I like
these I think they're beautiful I just
don't see myself reaching for them over
and over to create a look I have had
some you know doe foot applicator cream
type i shadow formats in my collection
before and I just didn't find myself
reaching for them a lot I feel like
they're kind of marketed as low
maintenance quick and easy but I still
don't find them to be as quick and easy
as just doing a quick powder eye shadow
look but that's just me they do have
really nice staying power and I could
see especially this shade definitely
being like a one-step look if you wanted
to put it all over the lid and blend it
up into the crease you know it's just
that kind of a shade that has enough
Sheen and you know it's like a one
shadow cream shadow look if you wanted
to do that to me the star of this aqua
beauty line are these kind of gel stain
type products I can't even remember the
formal name though these were given on
the website but to me they are a gel
type stain they're not a totally like
liquid consistency you don't see liquid
running all throughout like you might
see if this were Benetton
or one of those truly liquid stains but
they're all three gel consistencies and
I really like the way they wear even
after I feel like they've set like I've
been wearing this one for probably
twenty minutes now and it doesn't feel
100% dry on my lips and I kind of like
that because I think there's some
comfort with that it's not going to be
the most long wearing like it's going to
look exactly the way it first did when
you applied it after six hours in the
day pass it's going to fade but what
pleasantly surprised me about these was
how they faded really evenly at least on
my lips maybe it was just a day where I
wasn't doing a lot of like licking my
lips are messing with them too much but
the shade just seemed to lighten
across-the-board and it didn't look
patchy and if it shades gonna fade and
do it that way I really don't have a
problem with it it's when they wear off
and that patchy really obvious like rim
around the lips type way that's what I
don't like but I do have a bit of a
question with these shades I have red
orange wash Rouge radiance and dewy
berry there's no doubt that this is the
berry shade right but these two this is
the one labeled Rouge radiance this is
the one labeled red orange wash and I
feel like this one the Rouge radiance
has much more of an orange e tint to it
the orange e1 is kind of in the middle
that's the one labeled Rouge radiance
and it definitely has the most orange to
me I really don't know if these were
mislabeled I took a closer look on the
website and the one that it claims to be
red orange on the website really does
look like the more red orange one but
whatever the case may be my favorite in
the group is the one labeled Rouge
radiance that's the one I've got on
right now that's the one I think is the
warmest read this goes on so full color
I think it's beautiful but it's still
like that gel it feels so light I can't
even explain how light these feel but
they're not quite as drying as some of
the straight-up just liquid stains that
offer nothing added moisture wise to
your lips so I love that color to show
the one labeled red orange wash going on
I feel like it's more sheer than the
other two it takes a little more
building up to show more color but I do
think that's a pretty shade and it's the
one that really
is kind of remind me of benefits
Benetton and then the do we bury is
beautiful as well and it's going to be
more your cool more pink involved in
this shade last I checked on the website
the Dewey Barry was out of stock but
this Rouge radiance is definitely like
my pick there are a couple of new
brushes that I ordered off of elfs
website they've got a new stipple brush
and it looks like this this is the old
stipple brush it might be the slightest
bit larger like if you look at them head
on like that I think there's maybe a
little more surface area involved with
that brush but as far as the length of
the bristles they're pretty much the
same they behave very similarly just to
stipple a blush product on in fact my
original probably stays a little bit
more stiff there's a slight bit more
tendency for these bristles to Bend as I
apply something in my cheeks but my
point here I guess is that if you've
already got the small stipple brush I
don't find this new one to be some major
improvement and it's kind of the same
story with this highlight brush that
they put out there is a little more
difference here with the small tapered
brush because as you can see here the
brush hairs are a little bit longer but
it's still like that tapered kind of
small egg-shaped cut the small tapered
brush because it's smaller and because
there's a little less movement you know
to the bristles and I feel like it packs
on product in a bit more concentrated
way I don't really see that much
difference between these I was perfectly
satisfied with my small tapered brush
but the only benefit to the new one in
wanting an even lighter on application
of say a highlight right up in this area
this might give you a bit more subtle
look now I haven't had a chance to
experiment with every shade in both of
these but there are a couple of new
cream blush palettes that elf has in the
studio line they've got one labeled bold
and it really does have some pop and
shades there and like a really deep red
a dark berry shade a very bright pink
and a bright coral and they have one
labeled soft that I think the lighter
skin tones might really enjoy you know
soft kind of warm Pink's there's a nice
peach in there as well elf really has a
nice cream formula I really liked it
with their cream contour palette I love
the way the shades blended in it wasn't
too much work to blend in they didn't
have some kind of unusual texture once
you've got them blended in on your skin
you know they just kind of meshed with
the overall texture of your skin and I
find these to be very much the same so
I'm really glad that they're expanding
on that formula putting out all these
cream blushes if you're a deeper skin
tone and you want some really vibrant
cream blushes which sometimes you run
across some very vibrant powder blushes
but I guess in my makeup experience I
don't have a lot of really deep and rich
cream blushes so this might be kind of a
unique fine another palette that I did
mention in my best in beauty video that
I'm loving so much so I won't talk about
it too much here but it's the total face
palette absolutely love this now it's a
very soft palette I really like how
there's a pinky toned and a peachy tone
blush in there there's something you can
use for a very soft contour and this
shade is so cool I love that highlight I
just dust it all over the face because
it's not too shimmery it's a little bit
toned down I kind of compared it to the
hourglass dim light but a bit more
shimmery take on that shade so it's a
beautiful little no brainer all in one
palette now you guys remember when elf
first released a bunch of 10 pillar
eyeshadow palettes while we're attacking
onto that line with one called nude rose
gold what does this one look like my
friends very much like The Naked 3 and I
did do some swatches of this I think
there are some beautiful shades in here
I like that there are a few mats with
this color this shade right here and
then we have kind of a deeper way to
create some contrast with that tone it's
good for me but not great because
naturally I am comparing it to the
texture of urban decay shadows and I did
decide to go ahead and swatch out for
you the full Naked 3 palette which does
have two more shades than this one does
and you can definitely see some tones
really matching up certain colors are
very close to dupes but I think it shows
in the swatches how the Naked 3 palette
is just a little more vibrant and one
time when I was comparing like a really
low-cost dupe type palette to a
higher-end palette somebody kind of said
you know how dare you why would you
think that something that cheap would
measure up to something that's three
times the price or whatever and I do
think I
I've found some great dupes that have
been super low-cost and have a really
you know hit it dead on so I do look for
potential dupes in low-cost products
with the expectation that I may find
something that's really really top-notch
quality with this I think it's a pretty
palette I have done a couple of looks
with it that I've really liked but it
just doesn't have the same amount of
impact as the naked 3 some might see
that and think that's ok you know I'll
take a slightly more sheer take on those
shades I just want something similar
this is something similar for sure I got
a couple of these elf double ended
lipsticks they're day-to-night lipsticks
they say but I think they're really
great for creating that ombre effect as
well this one is called the best berries
and this one is called needed nudes so I
did apply these on my lips so you could
kind of see what I'm talking about here
they're very creamy lipsticks they go on
super smooth I love this kind of classic
rosy pink shade and then you can
definitely mix in the darker tone or you
could wear them as two totally different
lipsticks and as you can see you're not
getting a ton of lipstick product in
here for me one who owns a lot of
lipsticks and doesn't go through a lot
of lipsticks very quickly and that
doesn't bother me and if you're into
kind of the soft tan light brownish
nudes I think you'll really like the
need at nudes duo I can't say enough of
how super creamy these are and the
lighter end is just a perfect kind of
tan nude color and then you bring in the
other end it's a little bit of a rosy
Brown I just love the combo of those two
shades last but not least I need to
mention this elf runway-ready
lip palette now this absolutely puts
another lip palette that I spent way too
much money on it puts it to shame like
this is awesome this is a great lip
palette fine if you're looking for
something with a great shade variety and
a palette of actual lipsticks not just
lip glosses this is awesome I really
think there's one sheer shade in here
and it's this super dark one and I don't
mind that being a little bit sheer
because look it's still vibrant you know
it's still got something to offer but
there's a nude a creamy pink a little
bit more of a purple orchid type shade a
warm red a really rich berry red and
then this sheer super
ARC Barry and I just think the quality
is great it's a slim compact palette
it's the size of those eyeshadow
palettes that I mentioned they give you
a totally unusable lip brush in there
you've got the mirror and it really is
the kind of thing I need and want a lip
palette to be because if I'm thinking
okay I'm going to go on a trip I don't
want to load down my bag with a bunch of
bulky lipsticks you know five or six
different shades here look at all the
different shades like you could get
pretty much any look you might need not
to mention the fact that you can easily
mix and blend and create your own shade
out of this and the fact that they truly
are like what you see is what you get
type colors in here I'm sold so those
are the new elf products I've been
trying just wanted to give you a big
round up of what I thought I know there
are even more new things beyond what
I've talked about in this video so you
know an update will probably be coming
but I hope this was helpful and thank
you guys so much for taking time to
watch I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
