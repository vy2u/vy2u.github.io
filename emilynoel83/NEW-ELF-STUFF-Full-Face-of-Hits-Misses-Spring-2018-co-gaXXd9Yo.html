for joining me today I thought if not
now when my little bunny ears had been
here this is one of the two that I got
from Ulta they're selling these makeup
headbands and I got that other one
that's the little blue polka dot bow and
truly you could use any band to keep
your hair out of your face while you're
doing makeup but why not have a little
fun with it in today's video I am doing
a full face of elf products as elf does
they seem to just on a regular basis
roll out a ton of new products and
they're one of the brands that I get
asked about the most to literally have
like a basket full of things here that
I've been playing with lately and I
thought you guys might be interested too
so let's hop in here I've got a prep and
blur stick and this says shear and then
I also got another one that says prep
and glow stick I'm just going to show
you real quick on the prep and glow
stick what this is it's a very slick
slippery kind of stick it sort of feels
like they're prepping hydrate balm
although it's very fragrant smells
almost perfume me there is kind of this
dewy sheen to it but you look closely
and it's just a sheer wash of like a
kind of golden eagle itter I'll be at
very fine glitter but glitter
nonetheless so unless you want that just
all over your face as a prep step I
don't really love that product now the
prep and blur stick looks a little bit
more like a milk blur stick this does
have a very balmy texture it's got sort
of a thicker feel and I'm gonna go ahead
and just kind of take this straight from
the stick especially around the nose and
sides of the nose where pores are kind
of a deal and then I'll also take it
across the forehead as well this product
I feel could use a little more
smoothness because you really do feel
some pull and drag across the skin but
for small targeted areas of the skin I
have enjoyed the effect like right
around the nose but you sort of get it
blended in or you know tapped or pressed
into the skin I think you will feel more
silkiness and smoothness next up we've
got a lot going on I've got an elf
foundation on hand here that I've had
before and this is actually a really
good foundation I mean it's a solid
works for me foundation the shade of
sand it has SPF 15 and I think it's
called their flawless finish foundation
although they don't put that on the
bottle but a couple of new elements that
I have here are the make me
Matt powder which is sort of marketed as
a mixin powder and I have tried mixing
it into my foundation yesterday I did it
just like kind of on my hand and I
really sort of struggled with it like
between my fingers the powder the
foundation got really messy and then I
forgot oh yeah I did order this little
mixing palette from ELF so this is
adjustable here and you can just kind of
slide it on your hand and I'm going to
be using that to mix a little scoop of
this they say to use the scooper that's
in here there is a slider across the
sifter and then in addition to just
little holes that you usually see you
know powder sifting out of there's also
a little well there that little thing
you can dip into with your scoops so I'm
gonna do that second the first thing I'm
going to do is get a pump or so of this
on my little pallet here yeah I think
one pump should do it
so that's what that looks like then I'm
gonna dip in to my powder here get what
probably would level off to be one scoop
dump that huh it's actually just baking
soda it's what it feels like so I'm
going to just mix this with my whoa okay
okay the powder is so light and I
noticed this yesterday like it is a
little tough to mix it because it just
wants to kind of explode everywhere
ultra lightweight silky smooth powder
but you kind of got to find a way to
control it I think I've got it actually
mostly mixed in there so I'm gonna start
taking this across my skin and maybe
I'll have a more effective matte element
to my foundation now that I got it I
think blended in better to the product
today than I did yesterday just you know
using my hand and kind of struggling
with it although the thing is this
foundation is sort of I would classify
it as overall matte on its own but
sometimes this products get more and
more matte that can help the coverage
some so we'll see how this does I'm
going to use my airbrush complexion
brush here from Ecotools yeah I feel
like this is actually a lot more matte
than the other day
the product just to blend it in it does
look a little thicker on my skin right
now than I'm used to this foundation
looking
you know it just feels a little stiffer
to blend out with the brush and that
makes sense because we basically you
know as opposed to diluting the product
we kind of thickened it up with the
powder we added from a distance I think
everything kind of looks quite good
actually very even looking up close at
the skin I feel like it looks rather
makeup II like I feel like I can just
see it quite a bit around the nose and
sides of the nose it's not terrible but
I feel like if my skin were any drier
than it is right now it might be pretty
bad I think the reality is for me that
if I'm looking for a really matte full
coverage foundation I'm gonna be more
likely to just grab for it like as is
find that product put it on in one step
as opposed to really having to mix a
powder into the foundation because this
is kind of messy it's a little
high-maintenance to work with but it
does deliver on I think making the
foundation even more matte and therefore
a little more full coverage but also in
the process a little heavier looking on
the skin - okay
I'm gonna pop a concealer on here I did
not buy a new one I have the lightweight
concealer I think this is from their
beautifully bare line I remember
reviewing this months back and thinking
you know they call it lightweight
concealer but it's actually it's kind of
heavy on the skin like it's you you
really feel some thickness going across
the skin with this the coverage is okay
I'm just gonna take this around my under
eye and anywhere else where I need it
around the nose maybe
yeah it's really interesting they chose
the name lightweight because this is
sort of heavy thick honestly this shade
is probably a little bit on the light
side for me to really effectively cover
under-eye darkness so I won't hold my
shade choice against the product here
but I'm just saying I think it might do
a better job on me if it was just a
little bit darker kind of like what I
found with my makeup revolution
concealer really made a world of
difference next up here's something new
that I just had to try little loose
powder here for the under eye area it is
the peach tone like under eye setting
powder looks like a very standard little
mini loose powder here I'm going to tap
some off into the cap and it looks at a
glance just a little deep not sure if
you're able to pick up on that but it's
just it's it's a pretty potent looking
peach color but what I have noticed it
says I use it on the skin I get it on a
brush and I try to get my brush somewhat
evenly coated so I don't have big chunks
on there once I start dabbing it in I
don't really see that depth of color
quite so much
although this is a step in my makeup
where I really do want to be brightening
you know instead of my concealer being
too light and the setting powder verging
on being a little bit dark I'd like it
to be the other way around I'd like my
concealer to really you know be the skin
tone match and the powder that I put
over - if anything just brighten the
whole situation further I think that's
where it all happens most effectively
and sometimes I have found when I do set
the under-eye with anything that's a
little too dark like if I would have
really heavily applied this and then
checked it out later in the day
sometimes the whole area can look a
little bit deeper as time goes on which
is sort of a scary thing so I'm not sure
what I was expecting out of this powder
I think if it were a little lighter it
might have been a nice little you know
finishing touch step but for me this
shade is just a little bit deep but man
do I look matte right now I got a bunch
of things really all the blushes and a
bronzer from their new primer infused
lines so these are powders but they say
their primer infused I pulled up the
website here to give you a little more
detail this long-wear matte bronzer is
infused with lock-on primer powder to
ensure a full day of bronzed sunkissed
glow this bronzer is smooth and easy to
apply while adhering to the skin for
long-lasting wear basically what we have
here is a powder that feels kind of rich
and creamy you know it feels really
really nice and you know what all this
stuff reminds me of the blushes - and
this bronzer it reminds me so much of
their pressed mineral products back when
they had that remember they had pressed
mineral bronzers they had the pressed
mineral blushes and they were just the
smoothest most nicely pigmented things
this really feels like that formula all
over again as opposed to being a light
dusty chalky there's a real nice
creaminess to it you put your finger in
it and you just feel like you've
actually picked up a nice thickness of
project there and what's also kind of
interesting to me about this is like I
put my brush in it and it doesn't kick
up a bunch of powdery fallout either so
I have forever sun kissed in the bronzer
and I believe this was the lightest
shade I just wasn't quite sure which to
choose so I went with this one and it is
SuperDuper light on my skin like it
bishop or a fair skinned person this
might be just like exactly what you've
been looking for but I'm going to use it
right here see if you can see it a
little bit if I use it in the cheekbone
area kind of yeah I've got it almost
concentrated on certain areas for it to
show up well enough but I would
certainly be interested in trying you
know a couple of the deeper shades that
they offer because I think there's three
so very soft and subtle bronzer but I
love what's happening with the formula
that product then I got the blushes and
I don't know why I had such a hunch that
these were gonna be great but I just
thought they would be really good so I
did get all four in the blushes you know
are pretty big for a blush like that
size for a bronzer didn't really shock
me but these are large pigmented
wonderful blushes and they're all met by
the way and this one's called always
fiery very pigmented kind of orangie
tone I've got this interesting deeper
one called always spicy kind of a brown
mixed with a little rest in that shade
always rosy is probably the safest
option from this line just your classic
kind of dusty rose blush and then
surprisingly enough this shade shows up
really beautifully on my skin scold
always cheeky you might not think it
right I'm gonna go ahead and use that
one so you can actually see like this
color actually shows on my skin this
really light shade it's more pigmented
than you would think that is like the
softest most subtle like baby blush
yeah that shade really excites me it's
so unexpected that it would show up that
well and then because you might be
curious I'm going to take this deep
color here just a little this just give
myself a little cheekbone depth right
over here I just think those blushes
feel fantastic they are a wonderful
matte blush formula so that was a really
great find in my little fall of stuff
then I got the little collaboration
highlighter thing here from that's heart
and that's super exciting for her this
is a really cool little split pan like
glowy bronzer and you know this is
definitely a highlight this could act as
like kind of an all-over face glow I
found that it had more of a bronzing
effect on me than you know that lighter
bronzer that I use but I kind of like
taking that shade and just gently
dusting it all over like even tops of
the cheeks just everywhere gives a nice
just a little bit of bronzer Sheen to
the skin and the texture on these
powders also can't argue with them very
creamy very pigmented frankly they'd be
great eyeshadows too if you want it too
but then I'm gonna take this here
and it'll do a little highlight whoo
very very glowy I'm gonna make sure I
buff it into the skin my look needed
some highlight because I am looking real
matte
really fantastic highlighter there I
love that there's one more thing oh I
almost forgot
I got this power glow highlighter I have
this in rose gold this is interesting I
wanted to kind of describe this you I
don't I might throw a little on but
you've got a pump and instead of this
being like comparable to let's say a
Becca you know liquid shimmering skin
perfector this has an odd kind of it
looks super metallic first off and it
has this sort of oily feel to it when I
first got it I pumped out a good amount
because I felt like maybe the product
wasn't mixing well enough in there yeah
some things come out looking a little
separated so I pumped a lot out and I
felt like I was getting what the product
was truly supposed to be and it's just
this ultra metallic yet kind of oily
feeling highlighter I might pet just a
little bit on here just to let you see
but this rose gold yeah there's a little
depth to it if I were to lay that on my
skin really thick you know it would
actually maybe look a little dark when
it's not hitting the light but you know
really lightly applying it my skin does
not feel real tacky or anything it's
just a feeling that I've never really
seen come from a liquid highlighter
before like if you've got very oily skin
naturally this feels like an oil I need
you guys to maybe use a little
imagination here I'm doing curls with
the biggest moisturizers I could find
okay now I feel I can use the
post-workout cool-down mist that's right
friends they've got a whole line of
things that look like neon yellow I
haven't tried a lot of them but I am
gonna tried this post-workout cooldown
mist just to see you know does it really
cool me down the sprayer felt like it
was spraying out a lot see some droplets
on my skin but not too bad gosh I feel
like I look pretty glowy it smells
smells actually very fresh and like just
verging on a body spray sort of a little
hint of fresh floral I don't know I mean
you wouldn't have to use this
post-workout you could just use it after
you've been you know blending really
hard that's one of those classic don't
hate it
don't really love it I want to know how
much they're charging for that
post-workout cooldown this is going to
be $8 this makeup mist and
that they also sell is only four dollars
we are getting 0.7 ounces more if we're
really taking the purpose of that very
literally like when I post-workout I'm
not Russian for a setting spray I'm
Russian for a water in a couch I got
this thing that says new eye and brow
pencil and I have it in neutral brown
this is what it looks like like it could
not be a more classic pencil although it
does have the little sharpener in the
cap which is cool because sometimes you
know I just get lazy and I loot use a
really dull pencil because I don't want
to look for the sharpener was using this
yesterday and I found it to be a very
very creamy pencil like I normally
expect things in this format to be just
more on the dry side and this was quite
creamy which sometimes scares me a
little because I don't like to deposit
too much product and also this does not
come with a spoolie so usually the
creamier the product that I'm putting in
my brows the more I find a spoolie
pretty important now fortunately I do
have just this little free-standing
spoolie thing from Sigma or you know
many brow pencils do have a spoolie you
could use with anything on the opposite
end of the you know the color product
just something to be aware of here that
color seems really right for me doesn't
it oops I just maybe go in after that
with a little like setting gel
if for your preference you feel like a
lot of like standard classic brow
pencils are way too dry then maybe
you'll like this because it's really
creamy but for me like it became a
little hard to control
honestly like I felt like I was getting
way too much in there I am gonna set
then I'm just gonna grab this little
covergirl Jill here just to set it a
little okay my friends I've got two eye
palettes one is safe when it's not so
safe I think I'm gonna do the not so
safe one but I'll just show you though I
have this chromatic eyeshadow palette
this is in the shade bird of paradise
it's pretty it's my jam it's my style it
looks good on I have worn it before
there's just pretty purple kind of pop
there like soft lilac purple you got a
burgundy and sort of warm neutrals over
on this end so I like that palette comes
with a little brush nice mirror really
no complaints but they've got a new mad
format palette and I want to show you
that's called jewel pop boom got warm
colors you've got blues and purples and
kind of reddish green in there I did a
look the other day with the blue and was
super super impressed with how pigmented
that was so maybe we'll go in a slightly
different direction today I'm gonna
start by taking this Brown getting a
little bit of that in my crease almost
wish it we're a little bit lighter Brown
these mad format palettes so if you're
not familiar with this like range that
elf has done they're really good they've
got a nice like super basic neutral one
I have the one that's got like purples
and a little orange e tone in there kind
of like a sunset eyes matte palette that
one's great I mean the shadows tend to
be pigmented easy to blend out so it's
kind of interesting to see this really
really bright one is color returning
like is is the trend of doing more
colorful eyes like kind of becoming
something more people are more
comfortable with these days because I
kind of feel like I'm seeing more
brights creeping in to the marketplace
the makeup market so to speak
I think I'm gonna blend in weird with
some of this like Grey Poupon mustard
color you know it's not yellow hotdog
mustard Grey Poupon type Dijon
kind of blended the inner part of the
crease with that and also buffing around
the edge there now I would kind of like
to do a nice lid pop and I would love to
see what this shade right here is made
of this kind of you know not true purple
but kind of like a red violet you
remember the red violet Crayola Crayons
gonna start patting this on the lid
that's got some it's got some punch
it's rich you know it's kind of a deep
shade I'm gonna basically go over the
entire lid with that
that is a really gorgeous color tone
then I think I'll dab into this kind of
white color here on the end and maybe do
a little fading around the inner corner
like pulling up to the lid slightly
now we've got this lovely like a deeper
wine color right next to that so I think
I'm going to take a small brush and just
kind of edge that out here into the
crease this is a really an impressive
little palette because like I said the
blue was very strong that I used
yesterday
I'm going to kind of blend over the edge
of that with a bear brush I'm gonna pop
a little bit of the white also as a
highlight up under the brow and then
believe it or not I have not played with
the orange in here yeah so let's do that
you guys know I love the fusion of like
a little orange or purple
I don't know about you guys but I think
that's pretty fun I want to do a light
shade in my lower inner rim this is my
wet and wild ultimate brow highlight
and then I think I'll pull some more
Brown just kind of right down in here
maybe a little bit of the orange as well
not really for the purposes of getting
pure orange but just to kind of warm up
the color tone of that brown a little
bit
I do not happen to have an elf liner or
mascara so I'm going to go ahead and do
those steps real quick and I'll be right
back okay guys ice kind of started doing
this false lash and remembered oh I'm
not recording right now but it's from
elf so I want to show you the other one
going on here
if the lux flash kit in flirtatious I've
worn these one time already I did trim
the the length of the strip up just a
little bit like I took one small little
segment off there but these feel like a
little better quality than elfs earlier
false lashes whirring I had always
complained that their false lashes were
a little bit flimsy and like the band
just always wanted to just kind of blah
just to sit there and be straight and
these the band is a little thicker it
has a bit more structure to it but it's
not so thick that you know I can't work
with it but they are a very lightweight
lash
now for lip products I grabbed one new
thing here it's called prismatic lip
gloss and it kind of reminds me of those
glosses on the Sigma put out it kind of
feels like it - and I have it in rose
quartz so this could be like a lip
topper lip Transformer I'm gonna go
ahead and put it on my bare lips so you
can really see what the effect is that
you get from this you just a lot of like
sheer shiny pink the texture of this is
awesome though nice little bit of
thickness but not sticky thick like you
can really rub your lips together and it
feels moisturizing like a thick moisture
feel I do like that here's what I'm
gonna do I'm going to take a very basic
like kind of nude shade and we'll pop a
little bit of this on top and just see
what it does so I have this from makeup
revolution its elite from the life on
the dancefloor gold lipsticks the elite
is just like a classic nude with maybe a
hint of pink in it maybe I'll add a
little essence soft contouring lip liner
in going steady
now for a little bit of this it's doing
a little something like more than
anything you like I added a lot of shine
but the color from that gloss is just
not very opaque it is a beautifully
textured gloss I guess I'm just wishing
it had a bit more color intensity this
is my finished look you guys I really
enjoy the eye look this matte format eye
palette in the jewel pop I think is very
very impressive I mean for a low-cost
selection of bright shades if like you
watched my Sephora pro video and you're
like yeah I'm not gonna spend 67 dollars
on a bright eyeshadow palette but I
would like to have access to a few matte
pops this is a really fun little
wardrobe of shades my foundation I like
this foundation I don't think it needed
that added like kick of powder mixed in
with it because like just between my
eyebrows different places I feel like
I'm seeing more texture than I normally
would but maybe there are some very very
oily people out there who that amount of
powder added in would actually help the
look and the staying power perhaps of
the foundation so I'm not saying it's an
all-around bad idea plus you could also
just use that powder loosely all over
the skin but for my skin type I just
don't see that as an essential like step
that I'm gonna love doing all the time
or anything completely awesome thing
that's worth checking out are their
mineral infused blushes and the bronzer
you know that particular shade of
bronzer the lightest shade is a little
too light to show up too much on my skin
so maybe one of the two deeper shades
would have been better as far as just
the texture and the blend ability of
those shades on the skin I think they're
super high quality so I am just bouncing
randomly all over what's in my basket
here but this peachy tone under eye
setting powder I would just rather use
something that's a whole lot more
brightening on that area the brows
certainly did the job I just felt like
it was just positing a lot more color in
my brows than I needed the lip color
it's just okay for me dog
yes it's shiny yes it feels good but I
do wish it had more actual color rather
than just being so darn sheer that luck
slash kit and flirtatious
I definitely like really like the collab
product from that's Hart with the split
pan glowy bronzer highlight that was a
really effective highlight
I know what you're all really sitting on
the edge of your seat for is what about
that post-workout cooldown gimmick
basically I mean just use a setting
spray that you like I feel like the mist
and set that's half the price of this
works every bit as well anytime you
missed your face with something it's
gonna feel refreshing to an extent so
just use whatever scent and product you
like I will say the few things are more
refreshing than the Mario Badescu
cucumber and green tea that one's really
just I love that but thank you guys for
inquiring about new elf stuff and urging
me to try more I really like just
hanging out and doing these full face
looks for you I hope you could take me
seriously at all just you know with
these bunny ears on but in the spirit of
Easter I'm not taking them off so thank
you guys for watching and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
