when a new palette comes out we always
wonder do I need that ones that going to
live up to my expectations of all their
previous palettes so these are all
brands that I've had experience with in
the past and I'm going to tell you about
their latest and greatest creations but
first I do want to give you a quick
little reminder I know I've talked about
this on other social media sites and
I've done a lot of like shooting videos
in advance so I wasn't quite sure where
I wanted to talk about this in a video
but I will be having a meet-up
coming up very soon in Chicago it's
going to be on Tuesday June 21st it will
be from 3 to 7 p.m. at Ulta you know
that one Ulta in Chicago it's at the
Ulta at the Shops at Roosevelt
Collection is the area
I'll have the address below and on the
screen and all the info you need but
it's actually part of a physician's
formula event for national selfie day
that's what day it is yes you can come
take a selfie with me or yourself so
yeah I thought was kind of cool but
Physicians Formula is hosting like this
in-store event and they asked if I would
like to do a meet-and-greet as part of
it and I'm like sure I would love to get
to meet people and just get to hang out
and it's going to be a hole for our
thing so plenty of time to drop in at
any point that afternoon or evening let
me know in the comments section if it's
something you can make it to for sure I
would love to get to meet you guys
meanwhile now I'm going to jump in and
talk about these pallets I got four
different pallets that are kind of new
that I want to talk about the first one
and this would be my favorite I will go
from favorite to least favorite in this
video it's the Anastasi of Beverly Hills
modern renaissance palette first off
this velvety packaging it kind of
reminds me of the color and feel of the
it cosmetics naturally pretty palette
it's this gorgeous collection of warm
neutral shades also some really fun
berry type colors some very intense
pinks and I have actually had really
good luck with various honest hacia
Beverly Hills palettes that I've had and
I am one who you know I buy them all I
don't get sent these I'm not sponsored
by this brand in any way but it is a
very popular brand on social media so
you might wonder you know is this stuff
worth the hype and I've got to say the
quality of the
shadows is as good if not better I think
than some of the previous pallets that
have come in we've got 14 shades in here
there's actually a lot of matte
happening in this palette and just
really intense rich pigmented little
goes a long way type shadows and I've
counted five shades in here that have
anywhere from a pretty shimmery to a
just barely there satin type finish
tempera and Venetian red would be a
couple of those that just have the
tiniest bit of a shine to them you've
got Vermeer and Primavera these are
going to be really like spotlighting
highlight type shades one a little more
pinky tone one a bit more golden antique
bronze is awesome I was watching a
Jordan Liberty tutorial I think it was
on the Anastasio Beverly Hills website
Jordan Liberty has his own channel which
is really great but he did a gorgeous
look that involved a lot of this buon
fresco shade which is a gorgeous like
dusty soft lilac and the antique bronze
those were kind of key shades in that
look and it was so pretty I would
encourage you to check that I'll link to
it below I tried to kind of duplicate
that look a couple days ago it actually
turned out really well but I just really
love the richness of these colors you've
got this awesome like pumpkin e-type
Orange at a glance when I look at this
palette I think okay there's one two
three shades that look kind of similar
what sets those apart from one another
but love-letter is matte and it's really
like a very rich saturated magenta
Venetian red looks similar in the pan
but it's a little more reddish a little
bit warmer and it does have a little bit
of Sheen this is love letter this is
Venetian red you can see kind of the
difference there and then red ochre
right down here is even more brownish
than either of those there's red ochre
on that finger so all of them I just
barely touched them there's so much
intensity I think there's a wide variety
of looks that could be achieved with
this palette and well I think a lot of
warm tones really catch your eye
immediately you do have some cooler
things and really interesting things
happening up in here like I said with
the blonde fresco the antique bronze is
kind of a neat cool color it's fantastic
to have a really rich deep matte
around to kind of tone down some of
these looks use it in the crease deepen
up and make your look more smokey but I
just feel like it's a really
well-thought-out palette I love all the
mats that are so so intense and then the
shades where you do get some shimmer
it's like those are the shades where you
want that little bit of pop and I feel
like a lot of these Anastacio palettes
tend to run a little less cost wise than
a lot of different high-end palettes but
the quality is so so there for sure so
this is definitely one of my favorite
anasazi of Beverly Hills palettes if
you've never tried any of these if you
get it I think you'll be really really
impressed I've said this before I'll say
it again I really like the brushes that
they put in these palettes this one is
no exception you can see I've used it
this little kind of smudgy crease slash
lid brush and then a really nice
blending brush so it's not too oversized
this could apply some product there into
the crease or just blend it out that's
definitely an area where with some
brands I'd say and just skip the brush
but with theirs I really do like them
and I often take them out set them aside
get use out of them at other time so
definitely my favorite palette that I'll
be mentioning in this video I think it's
the best buy these shades are really
right up my alley personally but I feel
like you can get neutral looks and have
those fun really saturated pops of color
I'm so excited to start using this one
more now another palette that I really
love and I've probably gotten the most
questions on so far because I think it's
been out just a little bit longer is the
meet matrimony palette from the balm if
you're familiar with their line they do
have a meet matte palette they also have
meet matte nude and this is the meet
matrimony and you've got this guy here
on the palette I remember when Belle was
just first starting to like point to
things and save words she would pull
this palette out of my drawer and say
dad I'm like that doesn't look like dad
dad but that's okay but here is the
little comparison you can see he's all
dolled up here because you know it's
wedding time and then here's a look at
the shade comparison and
I think the thing that stands out to me
most about the new palette is the fact
that they have included a really deep
dark plum a burgundy a pink and these
are my kinds of shades I'm sorry but I
love the color selection in here I love
the warmth happening right here I did a
look one of the first looks I ever did I
was just in a hurry I wanted to
experiment more but I just took this on
the lid and this in the crease it was so
beautiful these shades blend wonderfully
well and dare I say I feel like the
shades in the new palette are even a
little bit softer than the shades in the
original meet matte nude I don't think
these have ever been to the point of
being hard to work with or difficult to
blend but there's just an added softness
that I feel out of these shades so very
very pigmented got several really dark
shades not a lot of variety in terms of
what you might highlight with I feel
like every time I would end up
highlighting with this matte Lin shade
up there in the corner the pans of
product and these palettes are so big so
generously sized and I don't want to
take away anything from the original
because I've used it a lot even though
it may not appear that I have I have
used this quite a bit and I have enjoyed
it as far as just overall tone I feel
like this suits my preference is just a
little bit better plus the other one
didn't have a matte black in there
you've also got a really nice and very
neutral matte Brown and then a softer
brown for the crease these are awesome
like crease or transition colors you
know I'm loving these two puppies right
over here I love that dark plum the nice
burgundy shade that looks so gorgeous
when sheared out and they've got this
nice pink here that just switches up the
tone of the look entirely you know as
opposed to just using a beige type color
if you're going to pop it on the lid or
something so I'm very impressed by this
palette if you're into all matte
palettes if you're a collector of
products from the balm I do think this
is a really fun update on the original
or the meet matte nude palette because
the original is actually a much smaller
palette last two palettes I'm going to
mention here I do like them don't get me
wrong I really don't have a lot of bad
things to say about them I just don't
think they stand out as much to me as
those first two did and so I'm going to
talk about this lorac pro 3 yes
I'm out with the three maybe you've seen
pictures and swatches or a review here
there but this is what it looks like
it's a very very like neutral everyday
soft and easy type of palette I could
see so many people enjoying this it's
like an everyday staple for work or for
school your top row will be all matte
your bottom row is all shimmer I think
there is a nice mix of warm and cool
tones in this palette but it's not too
drastic one way or the other you know
and these shades down here these first
like four shimmery shades you might look
at them you think gosh well they're all
kind of close they're all just kind of
light shades with a sheen but they do
each kind of have their own distinct
personality and I do find that when you
apply them on the eyes they do come off
differently one kind of disappointing
shade actually and here was medallion I
found that to be a little bit flaky it
does have some actual flexib more and I
just find when I apply it I have to go
to a little extra work to pack that on
which is very uncharacteristic of lorac
eyeshadows overall but the exception in
that medallion shade um I feel like all
of these shades are very consistent with
what I would expect from lorac I'm not
taking into consideration their larger
mega Pro palette I would say the lorac
one is my favorite just Pro palette that
they've put out I feel like every shade
just really stands out one from the next
there are a lot of just distinct
differences you know you do get a gold
in there then you go all the way to a
very cool taupe I like the garnet shade
they're just so many really distinct
Basics in this palette and I appreciate
that
and then with the lorac pro 2 you know
that palette I didn't maybe fall in love
with as quickly but I've really come to
enjoy that one as well it's got some
interesting like kind of dusty pops of
color you know shades that aren't super
pure and bold but still really
interesting and I've done some great
looks with that palette this one
honestly is kind of like my third place
behind those two and I know maybe some
of us just shade selection shade
preference there are so many palettes
out there these days I look at what's in
here and I think it's just super super
basic and I like it for as much as I
enjoy the lorac formula I'm glad I got
but it's just not my favorite palette
that they've put out and you might
glance at this maybe you see the Rhodes
bronze shade or some of the different
mats that coordinate with it and you're
thinking gosh I really like rose gold is
this palette going to be for me honestly
it's very important to point out the
lorac unzipped palette that is
hands-down the best of any kind of rose
gold bronze palette that's out there
that palette does it so well it's
probably like right up there for me
the original unzipped not the unzipped
gold the original unzipped is right up
there with the pro one for me
I'm loving amethyst and I was really
pleased with dark mocha my shade Hoops
my look today is actually a lot of dark
mocha on the lid and into the crease and
then I used a little bit of truffle
which is a shimmery black in the outer
corner kind of smudge that under the eye
as well and I thought that was a really
pretty look this shade is so beautiful
because it's dark but it really has an
ability to catch the light as well so
with this one it's not absolutely
knocking my socks off I still think it's
a nice palette one last palette to
mention that I've been playing with
lately it's from bareMinerals and it's
their nudes palette so check this out
this would be there ready eyeshadow
formula made into a really big palette
you know they've come out with some of
those special edition like smallish
compacts but here they've really laid it
out in a full palette you can look at
the top row in the bottom row and kind
of see where the differences lie I feel
like the top row has a little bit more
warmth to it although it's kind of a
subtle warmth you know you're not going
to run into the terracotta and orangie
browns in here but you do have a pretty
like shimmery bronze a light shade up
here I don't know if you can tell but it
edges a little bit on being somewhat
golden and then your lower row goes a
little cooler ultimately ending with
that black shade now I really like bare
minerals ready eye shadow formula you
know they make the quad called the happy
place that's one of my all-time favorite
quads they've also got some awesome
duo's and just great color combinations
great soft rich feeling formula having
just talked about lorac shadows I would
say they are similar to those in terms
of pigmentation but they maybe don't
have quite the amount of
powdery hiccup when I put a brush into
these my favorite shades in this palette
I really like libation down here that's
a gorgeous like look at the way that
shade hits the light but then when it's
not hitting the light it almost has like
a light grayish tone it's so pretty I
love fate up here in the corner that
Brown such a rich shade so pigmented and
if you are going for a really cool look
the other day I used an priceless just
extremely cool maybe it's just in
comparison to the shades right above it
I think it looks bluish but that's a
really strong gray so I don't have
complaints about this in terms of
quality I guess I just wanted something
to pop out at me a little bit more from
this palette maybe a few shades thrown
in here and there that take you just
slightly off of that completely you know
brownish or cool tone spectrum I guess
this is coming from someone with a lot
of palettes maybe it just takes a little
more to like really catch my eye and get
me excited but I look at modern
Renaissance and I think there's some
shades that I'm really going to get
excited about I look at this and think
yeah those are shades I've got you know
several times over in my collection
probably I am glad I got it because I
think the ready formula is spectacular
but in terms of basics if you don't
really like to go very pinky with your
shadows you don't like to take them to a
very warm Brown place you just like to
keep it very natural very professional
classy clean everyday this is a nice
palette to have I could talk about
palettes for like the entire day if you
given the chance I think but I hope this
gave you just a little insight on some
of these newer palettes that are on the
market if there are any that I didn't
mention that you're really excited about
or interested in please let me know in
the comments section and have a great
day I'll talk to you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
