today I want to talk about a bunch of
new stuff from Nicks some things you may
have recently seen in stores or online
some things I know just came out very
recently and there's even one thing that
I know has not been released yet these
products were sent to me by Nicks so
that's why I've had the opportunity to
try them already I just kind of wanted
to outline some of them for you give you
some hits and misses so when you run
across these in the store you'll kind of
have an idea of what you're looking at
so the first thing is the gotcha Covered
concealer it claims to be waterproof and
very full coverage and they come in
little tubes like this I've been using
the shade beige they're a very rich and
creamy concealer you notice like when
you start squeezing it out of the tube
you have to squeeze really hard there's
just such a thickness to this product
they say this velvety concealer indulges
the skin with rich coconut oil while
masking discoloration and imperfections
it really reminds me of the consistency
of the bye-bye under-eye concealer from
it cosmetics you know that thickness and
kind of a glossiness that you notice in
the product as you start blending it out
in the skin and then once you have fully
blended it out there is some tackiness
still on the skin and this can be great
for people with dry under eye areas and
you know just really dehydrated skin
maybe all across their face I really
like the coverage this has on the under
eye area I mean I really feel like it
performs just like the buy buy under eye
from it cosmetics also like that product
I really feel the need to set this with
something at least a little lightweight
something just to take away the
tackiness for example if you like using
that baking technique where you put on
like a really amoliant concealer like
this and then you pop some powder on top
of that like kind of a thick amount of
powder and kind of let the to sort of
cook or bake there together that's
supposed to create really great staying
power and sort of prevent the product
from creasing and a product I like
wearing on top of this is actually the
NYX lavender color correcting powder I
find that to be very very brighten if
you like that really brightened
lightened under-eye area like I've got
today these two are kind of a nice
combination because this does have a
nice matte finish I have said in the
past that I didn't feel like I could
wear bye-bye under-eye like all over my
skin because I felt like it was a little
too heavy
and I've tried wearing this all over my
skin also like where I have redness
around my nose and stuff and they talk
about you know this contains coconut oil
it is a very nourishing concealer I
don't feel like it's been too too heavy
for me in those areas again I'm setting
those places also with powder I've
actually broken out in areas where I
used bye-bye under-eye elsewhere on my
face this hasn't caused that kind of
problem but still texture wise
consistency of the product it feels just
like that stuff this does come in quite
a few different shades for like six
bucks each so I'd say this is a hit
among mixes newly released products
another thing I wanted to point out I
know I have done a review and tutorial
already using this NYX highlight and
contour palette so I use this all over
the face you know for my contouring
bronzing highlighting all that I also
use this on the eyes so I will link to
that tutorial if you want more
information like an in-depth demo but
what I wanted to follow up on there is
that they have now come out with these
shades in their little individual
singles so if you run out of one or if
you wanted to like further customize the
palette and have more of one kind of
shade those individual colors are now
available once you take them out of the
box they're in just a little plastic
tray and you pop out the pan as you may
have noticed if you already own the
palette they're not in like little metal
pans well they are but they're kind of
within more of a plastic pan type
situation there so when they come
they've got a nice little cap over the
top this is not just like a flimsy
little cover there that actually is a
functional cap so if you just wanted the
one or two shades you could still buy
those and use them like that my palette
does not actually say any of the names
on the back of each of the shades that
have come in here all of the refills are
named but if you're not certain like
which one you're running out of you may
want to check the NYX website because I
think they do have it mapped out what's
what on here so you know what to look
for if you need the refill I have really
enjoyed this contour palette I'm wearing
it today
I think the highlight shades are really
nicely pigmented so are the deeper
shades you've got some warm and cool
going on here I know I've really raved
about Nyx's contour kit which is just
four shades so if you still wanted
something a little bit lower price
compared to some of the higher-end
palettes but wanted a little more color
versatility happening I think the NYX is
a great option there for lips a lot of
people have been hearing about the
liquid Suede's
these are a liquid lipstick they do dry
to a matte finish but I got a pool
asterisk by that because they don't
completely completely dry if you've
tried the colour-pop ultra mattes those
completely dry like if you were to touch
them or kiss somebody you know nothing
would transfer off with those with these
while they do dry to an extent from the
liquidy state that they start in they
still can transfer off as you press your
lips together when you're wearing one of
these
you almost might wonder if like the
color from your top lip is kind of
sticking down onto your bottom lip it's
not a really sticky sticky thing but
there's just enough moisture in these
that kind of makes you wonder as you're
wearing them they don't become
completely low-maintenance you know once
you've got them on you're still kind of
wondering okay is anything drifting
outside the lip line I was wearing one
of these the other day it is sandwich
and a salad and I was like oh my gosh
I've got a little mess on my hands here
because the color really moved around on
me and I think sometimes with these
matte liquid lipsticks the assumption
might be that they just completely you
know go Matt you don't worry about them
the colour-pop ones are like that but I
have tried several others including the
NYX that are a little different story
now they are beautiful on the lips I
think the texture is very easy to apply
there's kind of a lightness with these
have you guys noticed if you've used
these it's not goopy or sticky at all
like a gloss might be and I really like
that the applicator has a little bit of
flatness to it I'm loving that so many
lip products are coming out with these
little more long flat applicators
because it really makes it easy to get
all the way around to the edge of your
lips or sometimes the doe foot
applicator would push product out to the
outer parts of your lips and you would
have kind of a rim but I think I was
talking on snapchat how the shades in
this long
like they are each so different one to
the next I mean you don't just have like
a bunch of colors in this range where
it's like oh those are really really
close no I feel like each and every one
has kind of a distinct look and there
are some very out there and really
bright shades in this line like stone
box and then you've got like this orange
color called Orange County this is just
crazy bright orange one of the brightest
oranges I've ever used and then you've
got tea and cookies which is just a very
dainty nice soft pink all in all there
are 12 different shades that this comes
in and I do have all of these shown on
my lips over on my blog so if you really
want to browse each and every one of
these that would be a great way to kind
of compare I've split them up in two
color families so you can look at the
more neutral ones the brighter ones the
Reds the purples there are a couple of
really fun purples in this line if you
want to try these just to experience you
know a different format of lip color I'm
not saying you wouldn't enjoy that I
just want you to know going in that
these are not a totally like
transfer-resistant product and some of
these shades are so so deep and dark you
still have to be a little careful as you
have them on your lips as to you know
where they're going where they're
drifting out of my absolute favorite
shade the shade that I think goes on so
beautifully in this texture is the color
called kitten heels and this is just the
true red I think this is gorgeous cherry
Sky's is pretty if you like a little bit
deeper red you can kind of see how those
compare and really just loving
everything in the reddish vibe of this
line because then the deepest one that
would be more of a brick red almost dark
plum is called vintage and I think
that's going to be a great shade
especially going into fall it just
screams fall to me although I'm all for
wearing these fall type shapes any time
a year you know me but I really think
vintage is beautiful and I wouldn't
stray away from wearing that with like
it all of you type I look or maybe a
dark bronze I would look really pretty
with that one thing to think about as
well with these liquid lipsticks and
pretty much any that I've tried expect
them to go just like a hair darker on
your lips than they might appear in the
tube just something about once you get
them on there and they do dry to the
matte finish even if
use something you know a lot lighter on
your lips it just goes down a step just
a slight bit in depth so the liquid
Suede's I'm not sure if I'd call them an
all-out 100 percent hit for me they're
not a Miss either there's something that
even if I hadn't been sent these I would
definitely want to just try out one or
two to experience that texture and
formula now the other lip product I want
to tell you about actually it's a lip
and cheek product I have eight of them
they're called the NYX whipped
lick lick whipped lip and cheek souffle
and I can't even find any information on
these online I've not seen these in
stores these are basically something to
look out for these are in little squatty
tubes compared to the liquid Suede's and
these as I said are something you can
wear on both your lips and your cheeks
they are such an awesome texture like I
mentioned the liquid Suede's being and
you know kind of a lightweight not not
as sticky as a gloss when you put them
on these are even lighter I feel like
I'm dusting my lips with something so
like light as air in texture and the
scent on these smells like vanilla
frosting like pretty strong so if you're
not into that just a heads up I'm gonna
tell you right now I absolutely love
these every shade that I've tried so far
and I haven't even gotten to experiment
with every single shade yet I'm going to
devote a specific review to these in the
near future on the Express channel but
you've got several you know definite
pinky tone colors so they would
definitely lend themselves to being both
a blush and a lip color a couple of
berry tones I've worn both of these on
my lips I think they're gorgeous got
this light coral peachy shade and
neutral kind of bronzy brown and then a
red as well the shade that I am wearing
on my lips today is called plush and
that would be kind of your very soft a
little bit cool nude pink the applicator
really carries some product it's one of
those more like diamond shaped sponge
tips and if I were going to wear these
as a blush which I have before I would
put a little bit out here on my hand and
pick some up with like my ELF small
stipple brush and then go to town on the
cheeks there and when you put these on
the lips you can really feel the texture
like they go on feeling like this
light as air super whipped type product
but once you really blend them in or
once you start pressing your lips
together you can feel a little more
creaminess developing I don't know if
it's the your body heat kind of almost
changing the texture just a little bit
these are something you know if you
wanted to use your fingers to blend
these out as a blush you definitely
could because they're not hard to blend
oh they smell so good I really like the
scent these are creamy textures from
what I can tell they aren't glittery
sparkly or frosty or anything like that
you may notice depending on how much
product you put on your lips that they
don't necessarily look as matte as a
liquid suede because they don't dry
really to that extent and I know I said
those don't dry down completely a
hundred percent but these are even a
little bit less dry I think they feel
quite comfortable on the lips staying
power particularly with the deeper
shades this shade and called plush I
will have to touch that up eventually
here in the near future probably like
after eating lunch or something like
that they make my lips I think look and
feel so like pillowy soft it's just it's
really these are really worth checking
out these are probably like my favorite
thing that I'm going to mention in this
video and I'm sorry they're not like
available already although I don't know
in a couple days between what I shoot
this and post it maybe something will
have changed I'll let you know a couple
of my favorite shades and also shades
that I think definitely multitask well
as being both lip and cheek would be
plush which I have on now and also berry
tea I've worn this and got so many
questions and I found myself struggling
on snapchat to describe well it's this
new NYX product got whipped it's not in
stores yet and I also love dark cloud if
you like a kind of deep purple a berry
this is so so pretty now something you
may have seen already like in your local
Ulta stores I know I have run across
these before and they're called the
go-to palettes and as you can see they
come in two different color varieties
this one's called wanderlust and this
one's going to be more you know really
classic neutrals here you've got like a
peachy tone blush a bronzer and a
highlight in there as well and then
compare the color scheme to this the
blush is more pinky in this set called
bon voyage and then you've got
some really nice jewel tones here love
the green this really I like them both
at a glance but this is the one I'm more
attracted to because it's just got a
little more versatility to it with that
green color the plum there's a nice deep
rich like charcoal almost makes me think
it's got a little bit of Navy in there
perhaps a highlight in both of these
palettes is gorgeous I'm actually
wearing this palette today this is as I
said the little bit more natural seeming
like would work for absolutely any one
type of palette I had put on a peachy
cream blush that I needed to apply for a
demo for another review but then I put
this blush on top of it and this
highlight and look at that highlight it
is no joke I mean just beautiful I
wouldn't say the highlights and both of
these are completely identical
I just swatch them side by side and the
one in this more jewel tone palette has
a little bit just a tinge more of a
golden a vibe going on whereas this one
is more of like a classic champagne
color but I just I love that look but I
still love them both the same like
finish wise amount of shimmer and glow
to them they're very similar once you've
got them sheared out on your cheeks you
probably wouldn't see much of a
difference that's how close they are
I am also wearing these eyeshadows today
I've got this kind of pinky shade on the
lid this medium brown in the crease and
a little bit of this deep plum II Brown
in the outer corner really giving me
some drama there this is my highlight
right here Oh only truly matte things in
these palettes are the bronzers um and
those could also be used as I shadow z'
but at best as far as your eyeshadows
you're getting a satin finish not really
at best some people might just love
shimmer and prefer them all to be
shimmery but I just want you to know
there's no bad eyeshadows in here a
couple of them are satiny like for
example in this palette you know these
two are kind of a satiny finish but
everything else definitely does have
some shimmer in this palette this one's
kind of a satin finish everything else
kind of glowy I really do like the
pigmentation on these it's definitely a
tap your brush off type of situation you
know because you can really pick up some
product there's a nice softness to these
again my pick out of the two would
probably be this one just because I
think it's more versatile I was wearing
this the other day I'm in love with that
green the blush here is a little more
pinky nicely pigmented very wearable and
the bronzer shade you know not too warm
so that could double as a nice contour
so I do think these are really practical
palettes the thing is they're charging
like 17 bucks for them sorry when I keep
holding products like up to the camera
sometimes my lighting makes a little
adjustment there but here's the thing
these are 17 dollars each for these
palettes which i think is kind of high
you know coming from a drugstore brand
even though I know they're giving you
like pretty generous sizes particularly
of these eyeshadows you're getting a lot
they're nice quality
I like the configurations that they've
given you I think they're both really
wearable and I do think these would
really help anybody wanting to kind of
downsize what they're taking if they're
traveling because it's blush its
highlight it's bronzer and those are all
I think really great really nice eye
shadows as well I wish there would have
been a mirror and that really does kind
of affect my opinion on these because if
I'm traveling like I'm wanting whatever
my big palette is that I'm going to be
using for eyes or face I'm wanting that
to contain a nice sized mirror and this
would have been a pretty nice sized
mirror had they put it in there but it's
going to be one of those personal
preference things you know do you like
these shades you already own a lot of
these shades and maybe this isn't
something you need or is it more the
appeal to you that it's all a bunch of
things in one if you buy it I don't
think you're going to be disappointed in
the quality for me personally this is
the one that's a little more appealing
just for the color variety the other new
palettes here's these are really talking
color variety are the oven pop palettes
here look at that you've got one that's
very safe one that goes out there a
little bit more and then one that really
takes you there with the colors and I
mean this is the kind of thing that
would really prompt some different color
combinations if you're feeling like
you're in a neutral rut like sometimes I
do the shades in here would really break
you out of that for sure these colors I
know you're wondering just how pigmented
are they they're really bold and bright
and it's interesting in this brightest
one this is called art throb and
along with some of these very bright
like kind of citrusy colors they've also
given you this berry shade a light peach
just as this soft white color so you
could go loads of different ways with
this but art throb these shades really
are no joke if you're wanting brights if
you feel like your collection is lacking
some certain pops of color this would
have it now this one called surreal my
heart and the pops of color are a little
more muted you know instead of having
the green that's like this you know it's
kind of a greenish yellow and it's a
little bit softer it's still pigmented
but it's just a softer shade you've got
a shimmery turquoise shade in here again
color payoff is really happening a royal
blue that's very nice now the mattes in
these palettes not as many mattes in
this super bright one we're talking the
peach this blue is kind of borderline
for me but there are many more mattes in
this one and you kind of see when I
cover this up could that be a more
classic neutral quad right there but
then you've got these pops and these are
all matte plus this gray and also this
greenish yellow color up here and in the
fewest pops of color or just maybe
softer pops of color in the Nouveau chic
palette this one I was wearing the other
day and I got to say there are some
things that really remind me of a
high-end quad that I love called the
happy place this plummy shade the peach
I can definitely get that kind of look
going on my eyes which I love this olive
green is really pretty if you want even
more green to show up out of it you may
need to layer it on top of like one of
the lighter shades and then you see a
little bit more green poking through
otherwise that one is so dark it can end
up just looking like a dark shade on the
eyes you don't get tons of green pop out
of it look at this sweet little someone
who just woke up with your Bed Head
there are several like kind of
borderline matte satin finishes though
in this palette and that would be this
one this one and this one here I think
they can perform pretty matte on the
eyes but in a very concentrated swatch
you might see just the slightest tinge
of Sheen in those much like those first
couple of light combo palettes that I
mentioned I think the pigmentation is
really good in these Avant pop palettes
it's just really a personal preference
shade thing because I think whichever
one you get you would try it and be
oh well these are nice color payoff
these are easy to blend you know it's
nice staying power where I'm on top of a
primer you'll have really good results
in that regard but there are some
viewers that I have who would be all
about this most bold ballot others
wouldn't want to touch this with a
ten-foot pole so it's your own decision
on my little Miss cutie oh I love not a
lot of real all-out misses among some of
these new NYX releases which was nice to
see just seems like some things I kind
of personally prefer over others NYX has
also put out a bunch of brand new
brushes as well and I was thinking I
would need a whole video to devote to
those because there's so many different
ones so keep an eye out for that if
you're interested and thank you guys so
much for taking time to watch I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
