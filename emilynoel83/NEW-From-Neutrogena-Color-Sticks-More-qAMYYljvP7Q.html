of jumbo lip pencil I think the best
jumbo lip pencil on the market has
expanded and come out with new shades so
I'm so pumped when I saw these on ulties
website I snatched them up like I got
all of them except for one there was one
that was like already out of stock I
don't know if maybe they didn't have it
to begin with it's the very lightest
shade in this line that I wasn't able to
nab but what's extra exciting is that
they didn't like do some weird change to
the formula they did not disappoint I am
talking about the Neutrogena moisture
smooth color sticks they're all a creamy
formula a lot of the original ones had
like a little bit of shimmer in there
and I still didn't mind them I still
thought they were incredibly comfortable
on the lips but all of these are
straight-up creams I feel weird saying
spring collection already that just
seems wrong to be talking about but I'm
not sure if these will be
limited-edition or not it's a lot of
shades
and to me it seems like a lot of shades
that were kind of missing from the
original line like more neutrals and
nudes and some Reds as well so in this
video I will take you through all those
shades on my lips and I also wanted to
mention two other Neutrogena products
that I saw on the website I'll just talk
about these first get them out of the
way this is not a full review but more
of a whole they've got a healthy skin
anti-aging Perfector and I have this in
the shade light to neutral number 30
it says moisturizing retinol treatment
with SPF 20 and it claims to even out
skin tone but this says it's a
moisturizer and blendable sheer coverage
and it does have a pump on it as well
and I'm wearing it today and I would say
it's light to medium coverage
at best I was able to kind of build it
up to a medium coverage place but it
really is rather lightweight on the skin
it just was my instinct to really blend
it in with my fingers just because it
feels so much just like a classic
moisturizer I would say the surprising
thing about this was that it didn't stay
super dewy and tacky on the skin it
actually seemed to set a little bit and
seemed somewhat matte not a dry cakey
matte but it just wasn't shiny and
sticky which I really appreciate that I
would say if you've got major
discoloration to cover on your face and
you typically rely on a foundation to
take care of some of that this isn't
going to really do that much but if
you're having like a pretty good skin
day and you overall just want a little
bit of light coverage and you feel like
you can use concealer to take care of a
lot of the rest like for me mainly it's
the under eye area so I use this all
over and then concealer was able to help
me out there and I feel like I'm good
but my skin feels just it's really
lightweight if you don't like being
bothered to always top your foundation
step with the powder I don't really feel
like you'd need to set this like I'm
pretty much a normal skin type right now
and this really seemed to work well for
me if you didn't feel like this was
moisturizing enough I think you could
certainly just layer it over whatever
day cream or daytime moisturizer you
like to use that I do like the thought
of a drugstore BB cream type product
with some added benefits from the anti
aging standpoint I really think I'm
going to need to continue using this
over a period of time too
be able to talk about the benefits more
and let you know whether or not it did
anything funky for my skin but today on
the initial application I really liked
it the other thing I have is the skin
clearing complexion Perfector and this
provides sheer coverage while clearing
breakouts it says and I got this in the
shade light so this is a salicylic acid
acne treatment here
so just to swatch it out on my hand it
seems to be a very similar coverage
level to the other I would imagine it
could be built up a little bit but it's
probably not going to take you too far
beyond that light to medium coverage
place
I think the shade system was a little
bit different that's why I'm light to
neutral in this one and light in this
but for me I think I'm going to make
this one sort of my top priority to test
out and then I'll probably move on to
this and pass along some reviews as I
feel like I'm able to but just wanted to
let you know those are out there on
ulties website now but moving on to the
moisture smooth color sticks if you're
not familiar with these these again I
think they are the best jumbo lip pencil
from the drugstore I really think they
are one of the most hydrating lip
products you can use the regular line I
had raved about these going back a
couple years like in the Emily awards
and I think I referred to them as the
sweat pants of lip colors because that's
what they are they're so comfortable on
the lips they're really that kind of
thing you just want to throw on whether
you really are going for big-time color
or not they just feel great these new
ones have the same scent as the old
which kind of makes me think of just
freshly opening up a packet of jell-o
before you mix it up and it's it's kind
of a strong fruity scent it's not
something I go on to really notice or
think about while the products on my
lips but I really do notice it when I'm
putting it on I mean it's hard to miss
that sense so that might be a little
drawback for those of you who don't like
too much scent in your products but they
still they feel amazing I'm so glad like
these weren't a watered down version of
the originals I really wanted to love
these because I wanted an expanded shade
range and these like I said they did not
disappoint these are the colors we're
working with here so you can see they've
put out many more neutral options here
plus there was one lighter shade that I
said I wasn't able to get my hand
so on and then some really nice bright
options too as well as a super dark one
and these are all just smooth and
completely creamy which I really enjoy
and just looking at the swatch lineup do
you see these lighter shades how they
really are showing up I was so impressed
with how opaque those turned out to be
because I think you could easily with
something this moisturizing and this lip
balm like in terms of feel I wouldn't be
surprised if they turned out to be more
sheer on the lips but these lighter
colors really show up so that impressed
me a lot so let's go through and just
show you all of them going on I'm just
going in the numbered order that they
came in so 100 is pink nude and like I
said pretty impressive as you can see
this color going on it builds up quickly
and easily you don't have to throw on a
lot of product to get that super soft
buttery rich feel on the lips these kind
of feel like the Almay butter kiss lip
balms and then number 110 is almond nude
and this is a little bit more on the tan
side when I was wearing this the other
day I thought it might be a little more
sheer than the pink nude maybe just
because it's a little closer to my
natural lip color but I do think that's
a really pretty shade and then if you
like something deeper on the neutral
side berry Brown number 120 is the next
one and with so many like deeper matte
neutral liquid lip colors coming out
this is something that's going to be a
lot more hydrating for those of us who
have dry lips you can see that nice hint
of shine in all of these but very Brown
really nice neutral option here now the
next one is number 130 wine berry and
this is a lot more reddish than I
expected I think with a lot of these the
color on the plastic can be a little
different than what's happening on the
actual colors stick so pay attention to
that if you're shopping in the store I
think this is definitely a reddish berry
it's really beautiful I absolutely love
that shade really brightens up the face
number 140 is pink grapefruit I think
this is your classic pink a kind of a
cool pink it's definitely more pinky
than the pink nude which was the first
shade I tried on it does really feel
like a springy shade to me the next step
is cherry pink this is the shade I've
been wearing throughout the video and
this is actually surprisingly so
- wine berry it's just a little brighter
it's just a brighter take on that
reddish berry shade this is a total
example of what I feel like was missing
from the original line because things
were I think a little bit softer and
it's great to see something bright and
vibrant and then your deepest one is
called deep plum and this is your really
dark wine color it's unlike anything
that I have from this line it builds up
super easily on the lips you don't have
to go swiping over and over again to get
color out of it and it's just a gorgeous
shade so I really I wasn't disappointed
by any of these colors that I tried on I
know I've been raving a lot but just a
few cons to keep in mind like I was
saying when you're buying them don't
just go buy this look a little bit more
at the color in the stick because that's
going to be a bit more indicative of
what's going to come off on your lips
also some of these brighter and deeper
shades these are kind of a shiny lip
product so you might want to keep a
little bit closer eye on those if you're
wearing them out and about sometimes I
feel safer wearing a red or a dark color
in a matte version because I feel like
it's not going to go anywhere it's going
to be a little more low-maintenance like
once I put it on I can almost forget
about it but these four is comfortable
and wonderful and kind of little bit
thick moisturizing and buttery the way
they feel on my lips I might make an
exception for these because I just love
the way they feel on but another point
about these is that they're not an
incredibly long wearing product that's
not in the claims I think you're going
to notice the darker shades have a
little more longevity on your lips just
because they stand out more this
brighter shade if I blot it off a little
bit you can see there's kind of a not
really a stain but there's just more
color left behind I can if I rub really
hard see I can pull off some more color
so it's maybe just a light staining that
happens there because you are able to
still remove it so that's my little haul
slash review on some new exciting things
from Neutrogena thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
