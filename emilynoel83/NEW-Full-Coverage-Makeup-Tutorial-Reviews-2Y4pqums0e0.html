tuning in in this video I wanted to
provide you with a little bit of a
review slash tutorial using some new
full-coverage makeup products a couple
of things in particular that we'll be
talking about today are the floor Geller
cover locks Foundation which I think I
may have shown this in pictures
somewhere on snapchat or Instagram and I
received a lot of questions on it so I
wanted to follow up there and then
another thing that I've been wearing
quite a bit lately is its Physicians
Formula insta ready full coverage
concealer so I thought this would be fun
to show as well with this product I'll
be using a couple of powders that I
enjoy also as part of this look if Laura
Geller foundation is a cream foundation
it does have a little bit of thickness
to it but at the same time it's
definitely not drying on the skin at all
I think this is the kind of foundation
that a person was normal to dry skin
could enjoy but also even if you're in
the combo oily bracket if you apply it
lightly and make sure to set it it could
be good for you as well I mean I have
had fantastic staying power with this
product and then with the Physicians
Formula insta ready we're talking about
it really like concentrated concealer
here it definitely is the full coverage
look that they claim I am most
definitely dealing with dark circles
these days I did not incorporate any
sort of corrector PG corrector step in
this look to counteract the bluish dark
circles that I tend to have and this and
this alone seem to still do a really
good job so here's a closer look at all
these products being applied so starting
out I've dampened my NYX sponge here so
that's nice and plump and really soft
and I've got my Laura Geller cover la
creme Foundation and this is in the
shade light and what I've noticed about
this shade is it is just a little bit on
the peachy side for my skin tone but I
get I would feel like a small pearl
sized amount squeezed out here and then
I just kind of DAB that all over the
face focusing mainly on the areas where
I know I want the most coverage and then
I can sort of blend outward from there
and I like to use the round end of this
sponge to start blending this foundation
all over and you can immediately see the
the coverage is really pretty good with
this and I've tried applying it with
some dense foundation brushes and that
goes pretty well I mean it seems to
really maintain the coverage nicely but
it's a thicker look on the skin it's
like after the fact once the makeup is
completely applied and then you look at
yourself and some natural daylight
you're like oh okay that looks a little
bit heavy but this sponge being damp it
really makes the product mesh with my
skin a little bit better so I'm still
getting good coverage but it's looking a
whole lot more natural
I've also found that this foundation
doesn't set too terribly quick on my
skin so I am able to kind of dot it
around like I did and not being too big
of a rush to get it blended as fearing
that it's going to really lock in color
wise I do have plenty of time to get it
blended but again on my skin tone that
shade called light as you can see once
it's all blended in it seems to work
well enough but when you first see it
dotted around it kind of makes you
wonder now next full coverage products
that I'm going to be adding in is this
Physicians Formula insta ready full
coverage concealer comes in a little
bitty pump style bottle and it does come
with this sponge I've tried this sponge
it's about the size of like one of those
mini Real Techniques find I just a
little loose slant tip there at the end
and I've tried saturating that with
water you know squeezing out the excess
and seeing what I have and it really
doesn't change the sponge much it
doesn't grow in size it doesn't soften
up too much
some people may still like this and it
really is kind of a stiff sponge it's
not super soft to work with but for me I
just don't find that it enhances the
application of this concealer at all so
I just stick with the same Nick sponge
that I've been using if you really want
to keep it simple or if you want to pull
in a separate sponge I like the softness
of a Real Techniques mini sponge a
Beauty Blender micro mini one of those
whispers sponges from Walmart you know
whatever it may be there are plenty of
nice soft mini sponges out there and I
just wasn't too impressed with the one
that actually comes with this concealer
from Physicians Formula but anyway I
have it in the shade light and the one
difficulty you might find with this is
that the pump is so stiff I feel like I
have a hard time dispensing just a
really small amount of product with this
you know it's easily going to go all the
way down but if you're trying to just go
maybe a quarter of the way down and just
get the smallest amount of product it's
sort of hard to control so I'm going to
attempt to just go no more than halfway
down with this pump and you know that
amount of product as you will see is
going to be plenty for both under eyes
and anywhere else on my face that I need
concealer so I will show you that right
now the consistency of it
pretty liquidy I think you'll find this
give better coverage than you might
expect for such a liquid consistency
concealer but I just really cater to the
under eye area first and foremost and
then a little bit around the nose if I
have any left over I kind of hit the top
of the nose where I might want a little
more brightness you know the upper lip
area the chin and then the beauty of
this NYX sponge is I've said several
times I can put my finger right here on
the flat side I've got this nice curve
happening here and then that can really
reach my innermost corner of the eye
area nicely and Pat that product in as
you can see nice coverage and really
bright too
blends in very quickly I think being
more of a liquidy concealer as opposed
to a really thick cream just a few dabs
over it and I feel like yeah you know
it's kind of become one with the skin
and and really doesn't require too much
extra beyond that and just dab it around
sides of the nose here
and just kind of feeling my skin now
that I've applied the cover lock
Foundation and now this concealer
they're not overly dewy I don't feel
like my skin is a sticky tacky mess
after I've applied this stuff but yet it
doesn't all completely set to a finish
that is super dry maybe 100 percent
matte I would say it's a mostly matte
finish but the feel to the touch is just
the slightest bit tacky if that's
bothersome to you at all you'll probably
want to set this with some powder or if
you're oily at all you'll probably want
powder as well but if you're on the dry
side you know that might really work
nicely for your skin same with the under
eye area definitely the kind of thing
I'm going to want to at least lightly
set with powder just for staying power
purposes so I'm going to pull in is a
product that's definitely not new to the
market it's new to me I tried this
fairly recently it's the Laura Mercier
translucent loose setting powder and I
have loved this for setting the under
eye area or just all over the face and
I'm going to do this kind of thick
because we are talking full coverage
here so I'm going to give my powder a
little shake there I'm going to continue
to use the same sponge we've been
working with only I'm going to go to the
flat side of my NYX sponge now and just
dab into a little bit of this loose
powder and we're going to bake a little
bit here on the under eye area so
dabbing it on going for kind of a thick
application then we're just going to let
that sit for a bit
I like to do a little bit of powder on
the chin as well down the nose also as
you can see just the tone of it it's a
it's going to come off a little bit
brightening on my skin tone it's a
little bit lighter than my skin and it
has a definite mattifying effect I think
it does add some coverage even though
it's called a translucent powder I
certainly see additional coverage when
whether I apply it this way or even just
lightly with a brush to just over the
area just to kind of change the
consistency of whatever concealer I've
put on there or not the consistency but
the texture of it the feel I certainly
see extra coverage after I've done that
so what I'm going to do now is allow
this to bake and kind of sit there on
the skin for just a few minutes and
while it's doing that I can go ahead and
do my brows or you could do you know any
other elements of your makeup that you
wanted to now that that powder has had a
few minutes just to sit there on the
skin and bake as they say I'm going to
take a just sort of lightweight loose
brush here this is a spotlight duster at
37 from Sigma and you just kind of dust
away that excess and what I find is left
behind is a really even really
full-coverage effect on the under eye
area skin is looking extra matte now
it's feeling really just kind of silky
smooth after that powder has been on
there but the last sort of thing that
I'm going to do is part of this full
coverage based routine a new thing that
I'm trying is this covergirl outlast all
day it's a pressed powder it says matte
finishing powder fair to light and I've
been using this on and off just as kind
of a light finishing touch as the name
implies you know all over the skin and
I'm not looking really to brighten quite
as much as I did on the under eye area
with that Laura Mercier powder so this
is sort of a nice all-purpose go
everywhere powder going to continue to
have that matte finish on the skin and
my main thing at this point is just
taking away any any tackiness left
behind by the foundation which isn't a
ton but there's another bit to sort of
make me wonder about
staying power and transferring
potentially so this powder I think helps
with that and helps lock everything in
so once I finished with those face
products here are the other things I
brought in color wise I use my makeup
revolution ultra contour palette I just
used one of the matte cool contour
shades and took that around my hollows
of my cheeks and around my hairline and
then as a blush I used my Too Faced pop
adult peach blush for a little glow
little color there on the cheeks then
went back to my makeup revolution
palette and I use that really shimmery
light shade as a highlight on top of my
cheekbones because I just felt that this
really overall matte look could
definitely handle a little extra glow
there oh and I also top things off with
a little hard candy shear and be
hydrating primer mist I think that
really brings everything in this look
together when you're dealing in full
coverage makeup that's it could come
across is looking a little heavy on the
skin I think several princes of this
particular setting mint really helps to
look a whole lot but overall if you're a
fan of full coverage I mean I definitely
am and I really enjoy this laura geller
cover lock foundation the shade isn't
just 100% perfect but I do love the
coverage and when I apply it with a
sponge I really like the finish on the
skin as well because I feel like well it
is matte it's not a natural looking and
it wears really flawlessly throughout
the day for me put it in perspective
coverage wise I feel like maybe it's a
little more coverage than just the
standard Estee Lauder Double Wear and
it's a little bit closer to their
maximum cover version I would say maybe
not exactly as much coverage as that but
its nearing that level but it's going to
have a more natural appearance on the
skin than that product does but this is
the kind of product that I've had on my
skin and I have definitely not touched
up throughout a day and then I'll get a
glance of myself you know I'm changing a
diaper and I look up in the mirror and
I'm thinking wow that has held up
flawlessly with no additional effort no
added powder put on it just looked
really good now this concealer I've got
some stuff I love about it and just an
overall thing that I don't love I can be
okay with the fact that this is a really
concentrated product and you
don't need to use a lot of it but if
that's going to be the case and you're
just going to have this tiny little
bottle I really think the pump has to be
something that can deliver just exactly
the small amount you might need as you
saw in the demo I can do a partial pump
of this and get a smaller amount but I
would like to get even less than that
because I felt like what I had even went
you know beyond the under eye and
frankly it probably gave me more than I
needed for that area alone so I do think
there needs to be a little bit more
control with this product that's just
one small gripe that I have but I think
this looks great on the skin it reminds
me quite a bit actually the look of the
packaging and the way it goes on in the
coverage it reminds me so much of the
mac pro longwear concealer only it
doesn't get quite as much of a total dry
down Matt look happening when it's all
applied not saying this is thick and
sticky but I think it's just a little
more natural looking while still having
a lot of coverage another really popular
concealer these days is the Tarte shaped
tape and I think this is kind of along
the lines of that type of product as
well I think if you tried that you tried
this you would feel like you were
getting really really similar coverage a
similar finish and feel on the skin same
kind of blend ability happening there so
that is kind of nice to see in the
drugstore and what's cool about this is
I have applied this all over and a full
coverage foundation I feel like one full
pump of this is adequate to get all over
the face you blended in and it actually
has a really good look I've enjoyed it
like that so I was really pretty
impressed by this product from
Physicians Formula
it does say full coverage on it but how
many things have I tried that have said
full coverage and they really just don't
measure up at all so I was really
pleasantly surprised by that the Laura
Mercier powder as part of this look I
mean you don't need me to really sing
the praises of this product so many
people love this I do think it works
really well for setting under-eye
concealer or setting all over the face
and then this covergirl outlast all day
I don't know that it's anything super
like must has remarkable I do think it
has helped the same power of this
foundation
other foundations that maybe just need a
little texture health when it's all said
and done you know just a little
something to lightly dust all over it
definitely mattifies and I think it
helps lock everything in all in all it's
doing what a powder should do but a lot
of other powders could probably pull off
a similar job for you so that's my take
on a few newer full-coverage products
that I've been trying out I just wanted
to show them in action and let you know
how they've been going for me so far
really well I'm really impressed with
that laura geller foundation in
particular application finish staying
power it really seems to check all the
boxes for me so I hope this video was
helpful for you thank you guys so much
for taking time to watch and I'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
