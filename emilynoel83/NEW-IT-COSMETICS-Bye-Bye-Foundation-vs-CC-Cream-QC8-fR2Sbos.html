me today we're talking about an exciting
topic here it cosmetics has come out
with something new it's called bye-bye
foundation looks a heck of a lot like a
little something we know called the CC
cream both have SPF 50 Plus this is
described as a full coverage moisturizer
and the CC creams description has always
been color correcting full coverage
cream and I've been a huge fan of this
product over the years I mean we're
going back several years probably on my
channel with me giving the staff high
praise
emilie Awards the whole shebang it
really is a product that does the
two-in-one function really well it can
moisturize the skin sometimes I go
without any sort of moisturizer when I
wear this but it also packs in
tremendous coverage and since this
launched they've also put out like a
bronzer version of this they have an
illumination version as well that I'm
very familiar with and so I had a lot of
prior you know knowledge and kind of
preferences built up when I decided to
try the buy buy Foundation which has
come out more recently in Ulta stores in
this video I just want to tell you like
what are the similarities what are the
differences I will be sharing my
personal opinion but as you'll see it
doesn't necessarily mean that like one
is better or that there's a right or a
wrong choice necessarily there are just
some aspects of a certain one that make
it something that I'll continue to
repurchase and the other will be the one
that I don't as far as the ingredients
on these I did compare down a very long
list of ingredients and there is a ton
of overlap it's not identical but
there's a lot the same in a nutshell I
would describe the buy buy Foundation as
a little bit lighter and a slightly more
luminous looking product on the skin
than the original CC cream I feel like
this falls somewhere between this the
original CC cream and then the
illumination version why does glowy is
the illumination but it does have just a
little more look of a subtle sheen on
the skin whereas the CC cream which
seems plenty moisturizing you know as
you blend it in definitely packs some
moisture in on my skin but what has
always been fascinating to me about this
product was that it wasn't an especially
glowy product on the skin as it sits and
as it continues to wear it's got more of
a matte look to it and I think it's
slightly heavy
on the skin than this bye-bye foundation
as far as the shades I'm holding here I
have the it cosmetics CC cream and light
for a long time I've worn medium right
now I think light is definitely the more
appropriate skin tone match for me and I
have this one in light medium /
foundation just judging by the shade
description on the website I thought
this might better suit my skin because
the actual light in this version talks
about being more suited for a yellow
undertone another thing here though is
the shade range the CC cream is only out
in seven shades and the by-by foundation
is in 12 and some might argue that even
with the twelve shades there's not
enough variety and when we are seeing
foundation lines launching these days
with around 30 shades in the line well
it still doesn't necessarily feel like
enough even though it's an expansion for
it cosmetics the thing about the by-by
foundation is that I do feel like the
shades are a bit more forgiving because
this is just slightly more sheer than
the CC cream I mean I've been using it
I've used it all over the face on its
own and I've done several like side by
side comparisons which I am doing today
I've got the original CC cream on this
side and I've got the bye-bye Foundation
on this side and because this is just a
little more sheer I do feel like you
could be a little off in your shade and
it would still sort of end up ultimately
blending in whereas with the CC cream I
think it's a little more important that
you're pretty accurate with that shade
and so I think that is odd that they
don't have more shades in the CC cream
so you can very accurately get the exact
right tone for you but anyways I
mentioned I have each of these on and
I'm gonna show you the application first
off with the CC cream I'm just using a
little brush from Ecotools here to buff
it in I do feel like that gives me the
best coverage with both of these
products is using a brush and I used
half a pump because all over my full
face I would have used a full pump so
for half the face I'll use half and I
just buffed this in all over the skin
again I'm wearing light in the CC cream
and I think it's a great shade match I
see plenty of moisture you know going in
on my skin at this point in time and I
just have a light moisturizer underneath
but in a pinch I've always thought this
product combined the two functions very
well moisturization and coverage and as
that slightly begins to dry down on the
skin I can see an even more perfected
look to things because it is coming off
with that man
look not a naturally matte not dry flaky
matte but just you know there's not any
additional Sheen to the skin now let's
put on the bye-bye foundation so this
again I used a half pump and I use the
same brush because I think that's
important with consistency in terms of
giving it the chance to have the same
coverage that the CC cream has and I can
immediately notice a slight bit thinner
texture of this product it is very easy
to blend like there's no difficulty
there but it's just a little bit thinner
and I can also see a bit more of a sheen
on the skin again it's not as much as
the illumination version of the CC cream
but it's definitely there and the
difference in the ultimate finish on the
skin is something I continue to notice
more like within hours of where not so
much like right at the beginning and one
other little tidbit here I did make sure
to use a new tube of the CC cream
because when I was making some initial
comparisons like a week or so ago I
thought maybe my other CC cream is too
old and maybe that's affecting the
consistency of it so now I've been
comparing new tube to basically new tube
and I still feel like my newer CC cream
is performing just the same way the
other one did so since putting the CC
cream and the bye-bye foundation on you
might be wondering what else is going on
on the skin well I did do under eye
concealer on each side I use the makeup
revolution conceal and define in c5 I
lightly set that with a little bit of
the lace and luxury baking powder I have
a hint of bronzer around the hairline
and in the hollows of the cheeks and
then I have a little bit of the vibe eye
pores blush in sweet cheeks on my cheeks
this blush might have a hint of a glow
to it but it's not super shimmery and I
did not put on oops
any highlight today just so I wouldn't
confuse myself as the day went on with
like what's giving me that effect on my
skin but again not my first rodeo today
with these products and I do expect to
see similar results today as I wear them
but I can see on my skin with the
bye-bye foundation is a little more
texture and it just seems a little more
apparent around the sides of the nose
around the under eye area and the days
that I've worn this I actually found the
overall staying power like is it still
present on your skin at the end of the
day that surprised me I wasn't expecting
it to be quite as good as it was just
because this product had a hint more
manasa T to it but this looks fresher on
my skin a little more flawless I see a
little less texture on my skin and I
mean they can go on and on with their
hydrating anti-aging 3-d skin flex
technology and there's a whole laundry
list of claims you know on this you can
read for yourself on the Ulta website
and it sounds fabulous and same with the
CC cream too they've got like such a
write-up on these things but in
practical day-to-day use all I can say
is this is going to be the one that I
continue to repurchase and use because I
think it's doing the best things for my
skin I think what always made this
product fascinating to me was that it
could moisturize me and it did have that
coverage better than any other CC cream
product totally on par with various
foundations that I have the claims on
both of these say full coverage and I
don't know that either one is a true
full coverage product you know what I'm
saying
strong strong medium coverage on this
one yes more of a standard medium
coverage with this one is what I would
say both can be built up more but I
don't think it does me any favors to
really wear extra especially with this
because I only start to notice a little
bit more of a sheen and again no offense
to the CC cream but there are full
coverage foundations out there that can
out coverage this product that I've
tried this is still fantastic and like I
said it's combining two functions really
well with the moisturization and the
coverage I can already see just looking
up close at my skin right now I can see
more settling around my under eye area
just more texture right there and I can
also see more right here around the side
of the nose bottom of the cheek like
there's kind of a poor zone and that's
developing for me there and we're only
working on like an hour's worth of wear
right now now this is just my experience
as similar as these products would
appear to be I do think there are
differences and I think there may be a
market for both you know if you felt
like the CC cream original was maybe too
heavy feeling on the skin if you've ever
felt like the CC cream was not in your
proper shade this does have a whiter
shade range if you ever felt like the CC
cream was a little too matte and you
wanted to hit more glow to it but the
illumination was a bit much this is kind
of a middle ground in terms of finish
for my skin type which is very normal
not overly oily not overly dry I feel
like
the CC cream wears best for me I have
overall pretty smooth skin but if I look
real closely there are minor pore and
texture situations and I just feel like
this wears more flawlessly but if you've
tried the buy buy foundation and you
feel like you know wow that works better
on me I could see it maybe meshing with
certain skin types but to me it's kind
of odd because I feel like both offers
about the same level of moisture to my
skin
this one just almost creates the
illusion of offering a little bit more
because it comes off more glowy and
finish you know what I'm saying so to me
that CC cream is definitely the more
foundation like product and this one is
a little bit more like other CC cream BB
cream type products that I've tried it's
really odd but I wasn't in charge of
naming them wasn't in charge of creating
them I'm just passing along my
experiences and I would be happy to know
about yours as well in the comments
section if you've tried them just let us
know like what's your skin type what
types of similarities or differences did
you see and yeah thank you guys so much
for hanging out with me today I hope
this was informative and I will see you
soon bye so I just wanted to show you a
little kind of progress check here on
the way this makeup is wearing and I
have been to the dentist this morning
had some like goggles on that we're sort
of cutting in here and touching also on
the sides of my nose so I'm cutting a
little slack on that as far as the
makeup where it goes but this side I
feel like is wearing a bit more matte
and I can't quite see as much texture on
my skin and here already kind of around
you know the cheek area sort of the nose
crevasse area I'm just seeing a little
bit more wear there although the product
is still on it's just sometimes the
effect I expect to see from different
slightly luminous foundation ii products
so just thought I'd pass that along and
we'll check in again later so I'm at
about the ten and a half to eleven hour
mark for wearing this foundation or
these foundations I should say and I'm
actually pretty impressed by the wear on
both just in terms of overall staying
power like is it still on the skin yes
it is there are a few areas where again
I would say it's wearing just a bit
better if you're looking really closely
at it the CC cream I just feel like the
skin looks
a bit more even over all the under eye
looks a little smoother we're down on
the side of the nose looks a bit
smoother whereas over here I just feel
like I'm seeing a little bit more but
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope this helped you out and I will see
you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
