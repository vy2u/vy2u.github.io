expect to get this video done because
I've been up and down the stairs about
four to five times so far just trying to
get my baby nursed and to the point
where she will actually fall asleep I
think we're there right now and I think
bill is still sleeping too so we're just
going to go ahead and try to try to
knock this puppy out okay I want to tell
you about some products that are
relatively new that just have really not
meshed with me I have purchased so many
new products lately a lot of new
drugstore stuff it's almost beyond the
point where I would do a haul I mean I
have been using this stuff for quite
some time now and I feel like it would
be more beneficial to people if I kind
of categorized things sort of like I'm
doing now and tell you about some stuff
that didn't work and maybe talk about
some different types of products here
and there's more organized like this in
two different videos and since I had
been using the stuff for so long but I
might kick things off here with a couple
of eyeliners because these were the
first things that sort of got my wheels
turning about all the products that I
haven't really liked one of them is this
Maybelline master precise curvy eyeliner
it did surprise me a bit because I
talked about not loving these shaped you
know little eyeliner pins and this one
certainly has a bit of a shape to it
there it's wider like when you hold it
that way and then it gets a little bit
skinnier on the side didn't think I was
going to love that initially but
actually as far as application goes I
thought it applied so nicely and so
quickly it was just really really easy I
liked being able to kind of thin out the
line where I wanted to like right in my
inner corner and then almost thicken it
up as I went out and it did that really
well the only problem with this for me
is the fact that it transfers so badly
with no moisture like I mean I'm not
talking watery eyes crying or anything
it gets down in my inner corner so so
bad and things are looking dark and
gunky it like it transfers basically
onto my lower lash line from my upper
lash line and same thing a little bit
with the outer corner too so I feel like
I can't really use this stuff and that
stinks because the application was
really so easy and so quick with that
there's another eye
liner that I dislike for the same reason
and it's a pencil it's from Physicians
Formula is called light on gel liner in
black velvet and this I think did I
order this I ordered this from Olga's
website I believe it was under the news
section but it is a twist up pencil
liner and the application really wasn't
wonderful with this I felt like it was
kind of skipping a little across the
upper lash line like it was smooth but
not as smooth as it could have been so
that was a bit of a problem and in a
swatch I felt like it was really locked
in like it said it wasn't moving or
going anywhere so I didn't think that it
was going to have a transfer issue but
it totally did on me again under
circumstances that were very normal and
not like I was trying to you know run
through the bank sprinkler with this
stuff on or even had the slightest bit
of eye watering going on I wasn't having
any of that and I was still having this
weird issue of product coming down from
the inner corner down to my lower
lashline I have plenty of eyeliners but
don't do that to me so it's not like
just part of my genetic makeup I think
about my Jordana color nd waterproof
liquid liner you know that stuff is in
it for the long haul it just stays so
beautifully but sadly I was let down by
those couple of liners also some lashes
I tried and these are the are Dell mega
volume and these were another thing that
I spotted under the new section of Ulta
site and I thought oh these might be
just perfect for me and what you're
seeing here I trimmed him up quite a bit
like they were really really long left
to right so to make them even fit my eye
I had to cut off some which is okay I do
that quite a bit with lashes but these
are the mega volume 250 ones and it does
say up here in the corner it says never
flat multi-layered curl technology and I
think this is kind of a cool thing that
you see and sometimes with more
expensive lashes it's like you turn them
sideways and I'm not sure if I'll be
able to really exhibit this here on
camera to see when you're kind of
looking at their profile you don't just
see one a solid swoop of lashes you're
seeing kind of a feather enos there the
problem for me they are so curly I mean
can you see how curled those are like
they are practically turning back
and my life is first off naturally
they're not that curly but most false
lashes can pretty much still mesh with
them and if I kind of prep my lashes
with a little mascara first everything
will kind of like hang together a little
bit these were just curling way off the
mark they're curling over so far and I
couldn't even like go through a day with
these I put them on I looked at them and
I thought these look ridiculous they
look like just a separate set of lashes
just doing their own thing and then
here's my natural lashes like pointing
off in this direction it was so weird
and I know some people have really great
naturally curled lashes so maybe there
are some of you out there some of these
would be good for but I still feel like
it's a really really exaggerated curl so
you know if you've had like good luck
with most lashes or if you feel like
they need to be more curly if you're
looking for like the curliest latch ever
maybe check out this mega volume another
thing here that kind of disappointed me
and I tried a couple of new NYX
eyeshadow palettes and this one is the
one called cosmic metals at the same
time I purchased that I got the lid
lingerie and this one I love this ole
matte palette like I mean the colors
aren't that uncommon but they feel
really good they applied nicely I've
loved the looks that I've gotten and
this cosmic metals I thought well maybe
I can wear this in combination with that
other palette and it is a bunch of
neutrals here or maybe you know these
are designed to just be really pop and
shades all on their own and some of them
are okay like this burgundy wine color
here that's alright the peach beside it
is kind of pretty I don't even mind that
bronze but then you've got some shades
they're just utterly flakey and like
what's going on with those I was hoping
that with this being dubbed it's like a
metals or metallic palette like these
would just be almost like pressed
pigment style shine and with the fact
that you're only getting six shades in
here I would really want every shade to
be able to deliver so you've got the
quality concern there and then I look at
the colors and I think you know the
colors are things that certainly are
great in other palettes that I have so
why do I need this why do I need this
subpar partially good
the color palette that really is just
100% shimmery I want really good
contrast I do have to pull in something
separate it's just not really worth it
to me if I had it to do over again
knowing what I know now I would not have
purchased this okay I've got to complain
about some eyebrows now I've got this
Alma brow pencil I mentioned this in my
best in beauty video at the tail end
when I talked about a couple things that
didn't work and in case you missed that
I just thought I would reiterate that
here because I have a couple browsing
and this is one of those brow pencils
that has a thicker tip it's kind of like
a teardrop shape at the end sort of
reminds me of the goof proof brow from
benefit or make up forevers has one
that's kind of like this too so I don't
mind the thickness and the shape but the
consistency of this brow pencil is so so
creamy and if you've got a lot of brow
hair already and you're just looking for
something for a mild fill-in this is
probably going to give you more than you
want and being as creamy as it is it
kind of makes the brow hairs cling
together in sort of a patchy way I feel
like it's hard to get as even of an
application as I get from the slightly
drier pencils you know something like an
Anastasia brow Wiz or the NYX micro brow
or even that one for benefit that I
mentioned you know they're just not
quite this creamy borderline goopy and
it does have the spoolie on the end and
I certainly use that to help kind of
rake some product through but I feel
like it's just still way way too much
and on the topic of brows getting goofed
up this covergirl easy-breezy brow shape
and defined this is anything but easy
pretty this is just like it's a way way
too much I've got it in rich Brown and
why in the world are they giving us a
curved brush for a brow product I mean I
understand sometimes the curved brushes
for mascaras and sometimes you feel like
they reach all the lasas a little bit
better but why are we needing to do that
with our eyebrows stuff and then you
pull it out there's just way too much
product in the brush to begin with so
the brows get overloaded
I think the brush also is too large I
mean there's not a time that I've tried
to use this that I haven't dabbed some
product outside of my brow and had to
pull on a q-tip to clean up that mess so
it's an overloaded brow
leads to overloaded brows it's too much
brush to begin with I mean if you want
something like this at a great direct
store price look into the NYX tinted
brow mascara look into benefit gimme
brow if you want like an absolutely
micro sized brush those things have
fantastic hold and they don't give you
too much product in your brows this one
the one good thing I can say about it is
once it's in there it does feel like it
helps your brows like stay in place but
that might be from the sheer like volume
of product that's in there that's really
hard to control so I don't like that
another thing I didn't really go for on
was this Too Faced sweet peach glow I
think there are a lot of wonderful
elements of this peach collection I've
talked about liking those peach lip oil
products I like the peach palette and I
also like the Papa don't peach single
blush and I really tried to give this
sweet peach glow thing a lot of shots a
lot of opportunities to work but overall
I just I don't think the quality in this
palette is really that great and I think
the Papa del peach blush it does show up
with ease on my skin this blush seems to
be a little more sheer than that one
that being said that's probably the
strongest part of this palette I don't
really get this color over here that's
kind of like a bronzer but it's not deep
enough to really Bron maybe on the
fairest of the fair skin tones you feel
like you're getting something out of
that but it's shimmery so it's hard to
achieve a lot of debt so it's like some
glow not a lot of color I'm not really
sure what the point is there and then
this is clearly going to need to be a
highlight over here but I don't feel
like that comes off on my skin with much
intensity whatsoever like any time I've
used this I feel like I'm going dipping
back in adding more adding more anymore
and even in broad daylight
I don't feel like it looks like there's
much there at all packaging is adorable
I mean I like the layout I just wish the
quality of the product was a little bit
better I wish this was an actual like
little bit deeper really usable bronzer
the blush you know if they want to make
that something more subtle than Papa
don't peachy
it's still
workable that's still usable but the
highlight needs a little more power to
it as well lastly I want to throw in my
two cents on a couple of lip products
that I didn't really like one is from
Burt's Bees and Burt's Bees we know
makes fantastic lip balms like the
standard do I have one up here so what
bumps that are in this kind of packaging
I generally really like them this one's
the ginger spice that I got around
Thanksgiving and these days they just
make so many flavors of those and they
go on really smoothly they're nice bulbs
right and so I was kind of interested in
this flavor crystals line that they put
out and I got the tropical pineapple it
says 100% natural and you just twist it
up like this it's a different style of
lip balm and it does smell really good
like a strong really sweet pineapple
like more like pineapple candy than real
pineapple but the flavor crystals thing
all that does for me is make this feel a
little bit dry and gritty as it goes
across my lips it's not nearly as
moisturizing as the other lip balms that
they do not really delivering a ton of
flavor on my lips either it's just
giving me some grit to have to deal with
and then Ulta offering a new line now
called Bronx colors and I've gotten a
couple things from there I've got an
okay eyeshadow palette and I got one of
these matte lip tints and I'm not seeing
a shade name on here the closest thing
might be this ml to4 maybe that's the
shade name but what we've got here is a
wand applicator basically ooh
oh no did you see that it like little
little droplets just went somewhere I
think they went on my pants okay
well there's another drawback here but
it's an applicator like a liquid
lipstick and it is very liquidy as you
can see when you pull the wand out like
we're talking droplets here not like
even a lip cream or something a little
bit thicker
I like the pointed applicator I feel
like I was able to get really precise
application right out to the edges with
this but it is so drying it dries down
pretty quickly and it almost feels like
chalky on my lips and when I move my
lips I feel like I'm pulling product
apart you know like it becomes really
obvious
have a cracked thing happening there and
then if you run your tongue across it is
just dry like I said to the point of
feeling chalky
one complaint I don't have about this I
have about a lot of liquid lipsticks is
that they change color so dramatically
when they dry down this one really
seemed to stay this sort of hot pink
like true pink shade it stayed that way
even after it dried but I just can't
handle the feel it's like to the extreme
end of drying liquid lipsticks so those
products guys are the things that I have
tried recently new products to hit the
market that I just can't get on board
with not a fan I think it's really
useful to share that kind of information
now and then in videos so you have an
idea of what things you might want to
steer clear of if you have preferences
like mine but thank you guys so much for
watching I'm glad I got this video done
today because it's just able like one of
those days I will talk to you guys very
soon in my next video
