recently on Milan ease website Milani
cosmetics calm just looking around and I
noticed that there were some brushes
hiding on there
where did these come from there's like a
$60 brush set on there and then all of
the brushes are also sold individually
six different brushes so once I looked
him over I thought okay I'll go there
I'll get the full set and try them out
and let everybody know what I think it's
three face brushes and three eye brushes
so we've got a foundation brush which is
like a flattop buffing style brush a
powder slash bronzer brush I'm just
reading what you know they're labeled as
here on the brushes themselves a blush
brush this is called the all-over shadow
brush you've also got a blending brush
and the crease brush and basically they
just all come to you in their little
individual thing of a jigs and that was
fine with me they all arrived in good
condition plus all of these have like
the specific claims on the back in this
video I will be showing you like a
makeup application with all of these
because I think that's absolutely the
best way to demonstrate how a brush
works but first just to talk about the
construction of the brush I guess and
we're working with synthetic bristles on
all of these they are very very soft I
don't notice anything in terms of like
wonky looking cut to the bristles or
something already seeming loose I also
as I've applied my makeup I have not
experienced shedding with any of these
so that was good to see I don't really
love how lightweight they feel I don't
know if you can hear it's a very light
lightweight hollow plastic feel to the
handle not that it really has an impact
on my makeup application but it's just
the feel in the hand you know what I'm
saying so specifically talking about
this foundation brush if you were to buy
this alone it would cost $16 so we're
looking at a flat top brush here it is
as I said very soft but the density of
the bristles I notice a big difference
like say compared to my Sigma f80 brush
if you're familiar with this brush I
mean you can look at them head-on and
they seem like you know the same
circumference basically around the
bristles but this one is very very dense
this one when you start buffing in
circular motions look at
the give that the bristles have there's
a lot of movement and I do think that
affects just the coverage level also if
you're using this to blend in a little
bit thicker foundation you just kind of
feel it pulling a little bit more across
the skin a brush like this just really
takes control of it and you know you're
really getting that blend it in another
quick comparison I'll pull in here this
is the Sonia Kashuk number 4 brush we're
talking about the same cut this one's a
little smaller than these two but it's
more dense than the Milani as you can
see you go to buff it in the brush
really hangs together it doesn't get all
loosey-goosey as you blend things out
and even though this is a different cut
this is the complexion brush from up and
up and it's just an extremely dense
brush for the fullest coverage on
foundations I feel like I get a better
more controlled application with any of
those three compared to this one I've
used this with some thicker foundations
and I've struggled a little bit more
with the blending like I said I feel
like it kind of pulls it across the skin
kind of rakes it unwillingly across the
skin and it does a little bit better
with a more thin consistency foundation
so today I used it with the it cosmetics
CC + cream and it did alright in terms
of blending it out but I just didn't
feel quite the control I have with those
other kinds of brushes one way that I
might continue to get use out of this is
with like a powder foundation you don't
necessarily have to really work as hard
with it as you might certain cream or
liquid foundations so it might be better
suited to that kind of step but $16
brush I was a little disappointed for
how this work for liquids
now the next brush is this big powder /
bronzer brush and I do really like the
size on this it is large I mean you look
at it next to the foundation brush you
can see it's a larger brush it
definitely feels absolutely as full and
dense as I would need any powder brush
to be and sometimes when the brushes are
too oversized for powder you just feel
like you got powder going everywhere and
it's just hard to control this one I
thought you know gave a very easy
application of the powder I used in my
t-zone I actually use this new prep set
and go Milani
transparent face powder that I also
purchased off the website so I didn't
get in there with a ton of powder for
today's look but I also did use this to
apply some bronzer I used my Too Faced
chocolate Soleil and
very easy to get this up around the
hairline it's not so small to where
you'd get a streaky application of
bronzer but it's not so large that you
feel like you're out of control this
brush just like the foundation one is
going to cost you sixteen dollars for
the brush itself if you really like a
full powder brush that might even be a
little fuller than this one and the one
from up and up it's cheaper it works
really well it's a synthetic bristle
brush also I've loved my little elf
complexion brush this three-dollar brush
is a great multitasker for powder
bronzer can do contouring in a pinch
granted it's not the same shape as this
it is pinched in at the top of the
ferrule but I don't mind that this has
been great for me also more recently I
talked about this in my recent elf new
elf brushes video but they've come out
with this brush that's a little more I
don't know egg-shaped to the cut but
it's still pinched in at the top of the
ferrule a little bit smaller than the
elf complexion brush and I love that too
so I just can't see the sixteen dollars
for this when I've got so many other
powder brushes that do a fine job as you
would expect as you start getting into
smaller sized brushes the price is going
to go down a little bit the third face
brush that's part of the kit or you
could buy individually is the blush
brush so on its own this is a thirteen
dollar brush this brush I really like
it's really a terrific size you can see
at the top of the ferrule here you've
got a little bit of a pinch in so it's
going to flatten that brush out just
slightly and I think it's perfect it's
just a great size for blush can see it
in comparison to my up and up blush
brush this one even more pinched in here
at the top so that flattens out the
bristles a bit more I still love this
brush but I think I actually it prefer
the application that I get with this one
as soon as the bristles hit your face
there's just enough spread to them to
get a nice even diffused application of
blush it's a little bit easier I guess
this applies blush a bit more
concentrated I've also like my Sonia
Kashuk number 29 blush brush but it's
considerably larger than this one from
Milani and I just don't really need that
size another thing I love about this
brush in application it's definitely a
multitasker I mean I think that really
ups its value a lot you know so I could
apply contour with this easily I just
contoured with the chocolate Soleil
bronzer
very easily was able to get that in the
hollows of my cheeks and make it look
natural
also it worked great with my covergirl
trublend blush I raved about this in my
last video this is in medium rose I
think it's a gorgeous blush and then if
you want to use it with highlight I
pulled out my next stroke of genius
palette I used the lightest highlight
shade in there just dip it in straight
down so only the tip is picking up
product and then you can get that
highlight exactly where you want it it's
almost taking this larger brush and
giving it the illusion of being
something smaller because you're just
picking up the product where you want it
not all the way down the side of the
tapered bristles so a great multitasker
and finally a brush in this collection
that I think is worth its individual
cost price tag these three eye brushes
will run you eight dollars each which
doesn't really cause as much shocked and
surprised us the sixteen dollar price
tag did on those first couple brushes I
mentioned so we'll jump in and talk
about this all over shadow brush first
and this may be my least liked brush in
the whole set I would have loved if this
was something even more flat that could
really lay down the product like really
Pat it down across the lids my Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush does that
flawlessly you just really need
something flat that's got a nice taper
all the way down the side where the
bristles are tapered where the bristles
are cut that's what's going to actually
grab onto product and apply it to your
eyes so with the cut of the bristles
here you can see note a porno tape or no
taper it's not till the tip that it
starts to get kind of fluffy can it put
shadow on your lid yes again but it
doesn't do it as effectively or is
packed on so that being said I'm gonna
back things up a little bit in terms of
the demo because I thought well maybe
this could be a decent concealer brush
so I did use this to blend out my
benefit erase paste and that little bit
of fluff at the tip does make it halfway
decent for that kind of thing I would
prefer it to be a little bit larger but
I feel like blending concealer is a
little bit better function for this
brush for me then an all-over shadow
brush but in terms of the eyes I did
prime my lids first I pulled out this
tartlet T's palette which is still kind
of new to me and I used the shimmery
shade in here called crush and
I just did not feel like this brush
packed it on as well as my Sonia Kashuk
small shadow brush does so enough said
about this brush but I just was hoping
for better the blending brush absolutely
love it I think it's so so good it will
serve you in a multitude of ways and
really get excited about the brushes but
not only do one job well but they can do
a lot of things well so this can
actually apply product to your crease it
can do a diffuse kind of transition type
color really well it could apply your
highlight or just use it their blend out
it is so soft it's not too oversized it
will blend the areas that you want to
blend okay you don't need a massive
massive crease brush to come in and just
start raking all over the eye look that
you carefully please lunch out here
yanno there your one chana there you
just want to blend where you want to
blend am i right so this is just
absolutely great for all of these things
so in terms of this palette I used this
first kiss color I use this brush to
apply it in the crease thought it did a
fine job there kind of taking that
crease shade just above like I said
making it kind of a transition type
color sheering a shade out a light
application for example I would often
use this ether t-6 brush from Sigma
which is tiny it's my little white wispy
brush I still love you in 36 this is
maybe maybe two and a half times the
size but it gives me the very same
effect as this one does but faster you
know it just takes a shadow and sheers
it out to nothingness and I love that
and you want throw some highlight up
there under the brow this can do that
too so I did that with the shade called
whisper I'm a fan of this blending brush
I really like it final brush that we're
talking about is this $8 sold
individually crease brush so it's a
rather short pretty dense brush I for
one really like having a brush this size
in my collection because I love having
control with my darkest shades so for
example with this tartlet teased palette
I use the shade called BFF it's kind of
a wine color and this worked great for
putting it exactly where I wanted it I
do like this brush I think it's the kind
of brush people do need in their
collection but I actually found an even
lower cost dupe for this in my
collection it's practically identical in
the cut in
just the feel the way the bristles kind
of bend on the skin and it's the elf
contour brush it's what it's called from
the elf studio line and it's like this
brushes long-lost twin but also if I'm
really being picky about a small crease
brush I've been loving this mua makeup
academy professional brush the 315 that
I got from CVS as you can see this is
going to be even skinnier a tidbit more
length to the bristles just a little bit
but this is even smaller and can really
go there if you want to absolutely just
mark out where you want that outer V
this does it flawlessly so that's my
take on these new Milani brushes $60 for
the full set I mean you saw what they
did my descriptions of them don't let me
turn you off from this if these are
something you think you'd like to try
maybe a certain quality of these brushes
that I talked about not liking maybe
that's something you really do like
overall I look at the set and I think
and this is what I thought when I was
ordering off the website it's a pretty
good selection for just six brushes if
you were gonna use only these brushes on
your face you know you would have a lot
of bases covered but when you really
start getting picky about it not every
one of them is a home run for me
especially considering these comparable
brands thinking about up and up Sonia
Kashuk elf brands that are putting out
brushes that are at or below this price
point per brush and in some cases
putting out a cut or style that I prefer
more than these I would not recommend
like the full $60 brush set here as you
saw there were two brushes that I'm
really wild about that I think are
really going to become favorites of mine
and that's the blush brush and also this
blending brush I don't think you have to
be like some special face shape or some
special preference to enjoy either of
these I really think they're no-brainer
good brushes to have for anyone so thank
you guys so much for watching if you
enjoyed this video I'd love it if you'd
share it with a friend or give it a
thumbs up and have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
