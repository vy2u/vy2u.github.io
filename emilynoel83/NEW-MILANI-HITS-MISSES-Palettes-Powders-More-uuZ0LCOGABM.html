me today my voice is a little weak
because I have kind of a sore throat
it's not as bad as it was last night but
it's definitely still there but I wanted
to do this video on some new stuff I got
from Milani I ordered it from Milani
cosmetics calm it came very quick
actually shipped faster than I expected
and they have just come out with so many
new things I've got new like larger
eyeshadow palettes a couple of those
they've come out with loose powders
concealers so I thought I might just
show it all to you sort of full face
Milani style even throw in some things
that aren't new and one thing I don't
have are any Milani primers and they
actually came with a couple of samples
my order did so there's the prime
protect with SPF 30 and also prime
correct it says diffuses discoloration
and pore minimizing I think I'm gonna
try that one today it's this real peachy
orange e color so I'm just gonna spread
that out on my skin oh it's super silky
Wow insanely smooth like very similar to
Smashbox photo-finish
original formula I really love the feel
of that primer and that is my one first
impression in this video everything else
I've been kind of playing one thing I'm
pretty familiar with that I've had on
hand for quite some time is the
concealed and perfect two-in-one
Foundation plus concealer it's kind of a
thick really good coverage foundation
actually and I have medium beige but
more recently I purchased the creamy
vanilla because I feel like medium beige
is just a little dark for me right now
it says medium to full coverage which I
agree with
and it says lightweight oil-free formula
long wearing water resistant and sweat
proof I don't find this to be
lightweight I feel like this is a pretty
heavy foundation and definitely compared
to the full coverage foundation from the
drugstore I'm loving right now the
maybelline superstay I feel like this
kind from Milani is pretty heavy but
okay creamy vanilla is very yellowy
I'm gonna do is do a small little pump
here of the medium beige and kind of dab
that throughout here just sort of help
the tone of this some what I'm thinking
you're painting on my face I did ask on
Twitter you guys for great sore throat
remedies and you had so many things and
I tried several of those I did gargle
some salt water it didn't immediately
help me um maybe I should have done it
longer I don't know I did a couple
rounds of it though
but what honestly really helped me so
much was taking a motrin and then taking
a really hot shower about as hot as I
could stand and I put some of that dr.
teals and cold and allergy salts just
sprinkled those in the bottom of the
shower and it caused me to you know
inhale a lot of good vapors I guess and
I came out of that shower feeling really
good
an interesting thing to note about some
of these new products now is just the
price like Milan ease prices are getting
up there for example this can conceal
and perfect all-in-one correcting kit
that I'm about to use this is $14 and a
lot of the things are either real close
to $10 like $9 products if not more than
that and I got this in fair to light and
I think I perhaps could have gone a
little bit deeper it's sort of hard to
tell when you're ordering online but I
think this shade is kind of pinky here
this corrector shade and it might have
been just a little deeper in the next
palette but it says use correcting shade
4 which is this one to diffuse
discoloration and brightens skin and
then you can mix any of these other
shades to get your proper tones so this
ends up looking really brightening on me
the other day when I used it even this
pinky shade I thought did help some of
my discoloration right around here I
think if I was dealing with melasma or
really really dark circles I would
definitely need a deeper corrector for
that and I'm putting that soft like
pinky peach shade right there and then
I'm gonna mix in some of this bottom
skin tone color I kind of work that down
into this zone something really unusual
about this little quad is that it
doesn't feel like it's all the same
formula what's here and down here feels
like a little bit thick like not too
thick to work with it's creamy you know
but it's thicker and then this one right
over here seems very very thin it's like
all these three are the same formula and
then you've got a really thin one here
and what I kind of liked about that was
that the thin one really spreads easily
across like broader surface areas of
your face you know so it was really easy
to blend out so I'm just putting this on
everywhere I want to brighten this is my
Sigma P 80 brush and it really you know
targets those areas where you're putting
the concealer and see how that brightens
really well
it's truly really nice to have a
workable corrector shade plus some
concealer shades all in one palette I
may still at some point try the one
that's one shade darker than this just
to see if maybe the corrector shade is
just like my perfect thing because like
I said this is a little light but it's
actually really still getting the job
done I feel super brightened all
throughout this area and I must say it
wore well yesterday like the concealer
didn't look too heavy I felt like I kind
of applied a lot of it
so yeah for a sick person who is woken
up at 4:30 by their baby I think this
did some good things for me ok I can't
complain it now yelled these loose
powders there are things to know about
these loose powders first off you're not
getting a lot here you're getting four
grams and or 0.14 ounces in each of
these actually this one's 0.12 ounces
this one that says translucent light to
medium and this one is 0.14 this is the
radiant here's what I thought I was
getting with the translucent lights and
medium I thought this would just be like
a matte setting powder this actually has
just a little bit of shimmer in it I was
not expecting that but that's what it
has I definitely saw it in a
concentrated swatch and then I applied
it the other day to my under eye area
and I thought oh I'm not really seeing
it that much anymore went and some
different lighting could totally see it
you know it seemed strange to me this is
an area of my face that can kind of fade
to the background you know I'll have my
eyes be eye-catching I'll have my lip
color be bold Xander I didn't need any
shimmer to get anyone's attention you
know what I'm saying so that had that
and the radiant turned out to be really
shimmery like I thought that was just
gonna be a loose powder with a hint of
sheep you know I thought it was gonna be
basically with this ended up being but
this is like a loose powder highlight
very important to know that but just
back to comparisons on the amount this
is $11 okay for the loose powder from
Milani you're getting 0.12 ounces or 3.5
grams and then maybelline fitme you're
getting points 7 ounces or 20 grams
compare that furthermore to Laura
Mercier where you're getting 29 grams in
one ounce I do not think that this
translucent light to medium Milani
powder is worth it at all I'm gonna use
a little bit for you to show you and I
really do though enjoy the radiant
you'll see that going on my skin in a
moment um it gives like almost a wet
dewy look to the skin it's really cool
and it's something that I generally
wouldn't use as much of so I don't mind
the smaller size and it's a unique
product to me you know this I've got
loads of loose powders that do a great
job so I'm not really looking for one
that contains some shimmer but the tone
is good and it has a little like sifter
slider here so you could twist that
around and block off any product from
coming out I'm not gonna really full-on
bake with this today because I was not
really a huge fan of the way that work
yesterday but I'm just gonna dab some
powder
on this area just to set
on the website says it's infused with
light reflecting pigments to diffuse
fine lines and imperfections for a
subtle soft focus effect me personally I
don't fight to be that special I don't
need the glow in that step of my makeup
I would go if I was looking for a
drugstore one you know the Maybelline
fit me in fair works really well for me
and like I said we'll get to the radiant
version of that powder in a second but
another powder they have a press powder
is their new conceal and perfects or the
same lineup as the conceal and perfect
foundation but this is conceal and
perfection proof powder and this did
come with a little sponge that just sits
on top here but it feels super smooth it
feels to me so much like the multitasker
powder so I feel like they just sort of
brought multitasker back to life this is
a really nice I think high cuff Ridge
powder it could operate like a powder
foundation and I'm just gonna brush this
on basically everywhere on my face
outside of the under eye area and t-zone
where I used that other powder I have
this a natural light and it works really
well for me any I do find it to be very
mattifying the texture is very smooth
it's every quality that I remember from
the multitasker powder I don't think
they still make that but I'm gonna
double-check now on their website they
do still have the multitasker listed
that's interesting because I don't think
I'd been seeing that in stores this to
me honestly feels a lot like it very
matte could definitely be like a powder
foundation but it is gonna be $11 and
for about half the price of that if you
look into the LA Colors mineral pressed
powder that's another one that has a
very similar texture to this one you
don't necessarily have to pay $11 to get
a great drugstore pressed powder now
Milani didn't have any newly released
bronzers or blushes on their website so
I'm gonna use things that I already have
here I've got the bronzer Excel in fake
tan so this has been around for a while
but as you can see it's kind of a two
tone bronzer really nice tone right here
for contouring it's matte and this color
is a little more warm and sunny it has a
little hint of glow to it so I'm just
gonna real quick do a light bit of
contouring with this I'm trying to bring
my contour up just a little bit because
I think maybe I was dragging my you know
cheekbone area down just a hair by going
in like the full-on hollow of the cheek
and now I'm going a little bit more up
and I feel like that looks really good
but yeah if you're looking for a good
like bronzer contour duo I'm just gonna
blending the two here going around the
hairline this is a really good option
from the drugstore I've had this for
quite some time and I would definitely
recommend it and then maybe a little bit
of just this shade alone kind of resting
across the top of the face I needed a
clip I didn't find a clip today okay I
love love love the Milani rose blushes
the powder blushes that have the Rose
imprint here really nice quality nicely
pigmented gonna last you for a long long
time and this is the romantic rose shade
so kind of a dusty rose and these are
nine dollars and I do think they are
worth the cost really just exceptional
quality I think for a drugstore blush so
I'm gonna apply this to sort of the
outer part of the apple of my cheek and
this again not a new product this has
been around for quite some time in
Milani line and I know it's been a
favorite of a lot of people see putting
that blush on I just became like a
little less sick right now for
highlighters before I get to the radiant
powder that is what I'm gonna use today
I want to mention this because I was
wearing this yesterday this is the
hypnotic lights highlighter they've
created sort of this prismatic look to
it and this is the one called hypnotic
lights zero one and when I saw this on
the website I thought maybe this is
gonna be like milania's version of the
becca prismatic amethyst which I've
loved so much I think this is such a
gorgeous super brightening highlight so
that's what prismatic amethyst looks
like it's almost got the same type of
design in there right and by the way
these highlights are gonna be $13 from
Milani which really like man they're
getting up there with the cost of just
like one product but here's what I
noticed the thing that I know and love
about the becca one is that it does have
that little bit of lilac in there but
it's also very pinky and that shears out
on your cheeks it just looks so extra
brighten and lovely and unfortunately
what this Milani one looks like is more
blueish when that sheers out on your
skin see the Milani versus the Becca
they look like they're coming from two
different worlds these highlights do and
this one just it looked like a bluish
sort of streak across my skin really
didn't make sense with my skin tone so
again I was hoping for a dupe there but
unfortunately it's a no so
now we're gonna move on and use this
loose powder in the radiant shades so
this is really like I think a loose
powder highlight I gave the sifter cover
a little spin there I'm going to tap
some into my cat and it has just sort of
a peachy beige look to it but I tell you
this sheers out on the skin it's so
pretty and it gives like an instant sort
of do eNOS isn't that gorgeous
I am all about this look I'm looking up
really closely at it I'm not seeing like
real big flex if shimmer like this is
something I guess a loose powder
highlight you can kind of achieve that a
normal press one maybe can't but you're
not seeing like that trail of highlight
it just looks like sort of dewy skin
that's the only way I can describe it
but of course there's no tackiness on my
skin right now it takes some down the
nose take a little bit up here on the
forehead I just think this is so super
pretty I think this is something that
would look really good on my mom you
know next up I'm just gonna use some of
my make it last setting spray again not
a super new thing to Milani slime I
definitely gave this a long period of
time where I tried it and I had really
good results they do make one called
make it do a that I want to try let me
know how much impact that has this is
more a little bit along the lines of an
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray so
I'm just gonna as far as the face stuff
goes really pleased with the overall
look I'm getting here again that
concealed and perfect foundation I don't
think it's the best in the drugstore
I think the maybelline superstay gives
even better coverage plus it's a little
bit thinner and more lightweight but if
you're looking for that concealer
corrector combo I thought that little
quad actually did a pretty darn good job
on me the loose setting powder just the
regular like fair to light one or
whatever that one was not super
impressed with don't need it to have any
sort of Sheen to it or translucent
lights and medium I'm sorry that's the
one I had a radiant version I thought
was stunning of course the bronzer and
blush I've used those for some time and
those are really nice products and the
pressed powder was really good but like
I said there's a cheaper alternative in
the LA Colors mineral press line now I
don't think I have a Milani brow product
right now so I'm gonna just use my
makeup revolution brow pomade this is in
the shade medium brown I love it so much
I'll do that and then I'll join you for
an eye look okay I just put on some
Milani eyeshadow primer
thought I'd be allowed in this video I
know I've been trying to kind of step
away from that one and try some other
things for an all Milani video it is
appropriate so the two eyeshadow
palettes that they have here one is
called bold obsessions and one is most
loved mattes and guys they are doing a
great great job with these these are
phenomenal shadows I won't even say like
they're great for the drugstore no
they're just generally good they are
really and truly fantastic so you're
getting 12 shades in each they are gonna
cost $20 apiece which does make you stop
and think a little bit but I think about
other drugstore shadow palettes that are
priced that way and one of them that's
near $20 are those L'Oreal la palette
nudes and these are leaps and bounds
better than those and plus this is a
total dupe type palette for the visi art
golden hour guys that comparison
absolutely jumped out at me when I first
saw it you're getting three more shades
but the whole theme is very very similar
to what's happening in my busy art
palette right here and I've loved this
palette I haven't talked about it a
whole lot but it's got a great little
grouping of shades there but this is
kind of everything that's happening in
this palette plus Sun except for the
deep plum e color so bold obsessions is
a mix of matte and shimmer you're
getting like five matte shades and six
shimmers including really metallic
shades they absolutely killed it with
the gold like these show up so nicely on
the lids and Milani has a history of
doing really strong eyeshadows like
thinking back to even the days do you
guys remember when they sold little pans
of singles that were the size of like a
Mac eye shadow and those had like a cult
following before YouTube was even a big
thing people got on makeup talk comm and
makeup alley and we're loving on that
stuff and this palette of mattes these
are beautiful textures they've got their
classic kind of neutral Brown row plummy
row and a really warm Brown row it's
truly wonderfully done and these are so
basic so easy to use and you'll find
some shades give you a little bit of
fallout but it's nothing major the blend
ability here is great the tones are all
things that I would use quite often the
way I see it is this palette while it is
a twenty dollar drugstore palette your
other options from higher end brands are
gonna run you I don't know more like
forty or fifty dollars so this is kind
of a nice way to go right so
I love the maths but today I'm going to
use the bold obsessions because I think
it shows a little bit more of what the
brand is doing just overall matte and
shimmer so I'm going to start out by
using my Sigma e25 brush and going into
this sort of light to medium brown and
get that going in my crease and I really
like the size of these palettes - I like
that they didn't go overboard with some
like super gimmicky packaging you know
it's just very handy very user friendly
and I know wet-and-wild has come out
with some new stuff but as it stands
right now I'm a whole lot more impressed
by this texture of shadow compared to
what I used in the new wet and wild
palette not that they didn't have some
tremendous really good quality mattes so
like the mattes are good in here and the
shimmers are just downright amazing okay
next we're gonna do some of this red
because I know a lot of y'all are
probably curious how's it gonna go on so
I'm very lightly building up some of
that in my outer corner really warms up
the looks so nicely I did a look the
other day with the golden shade and it
was just spectacular so I'm kind of
tempted to maybe play with one of the
other tones maybe that copper really
sharing that color out or my highlight
I'm gonna use this kind of soft it's
sort of somewhere between a matte and a
shimmer I guess satin finish might be
the description use that up here under
my brow then I'm gonna Pat some of this
copper shade right on my lid tap off the
excess this is so beautiful
it's just I feel like shimmers have kind
of been failing some brands these days
and it used to be like a drugstore brand
just which would struggle to get a
really pigmented matte shadow right now
I feel like they're regressing a little
bit in the quality of some of the
shimmers but these turned out really
soft and you know those everyday ice
pellets that Milani puts out those are
still available and those are great too
if you're feeling like I don't want to
spend the $20 I don't really need that
whole shade range get one of the
everyday eyes palettes although I think
this is a little better by just four
varieties sake if you're more
comfortable with just sticking to one
look day in and day out you might check
those out but oh the shimmers are so
full-on and pretty I'm gonna take a
little bit of this light champagne tea
shimmer and this is going to go around
the inner corner
and then I really want to show you how
intense the black is to so I'm gonna
pick up some of that and just Pat this
in my outer corner I know not the most
earth-shattering groundbreaking eye look
I just really want to show you what the
shadows do in a very like standard
everyday type application oops sorry
about my phone just being loud
and the black even is surprisingly easy
to blend you know so I'm just kind of
buffing that in here outer corner like
that is so easy to work with I can't get
over it and then heck with it let's just
do a little gold and you don't have to
use your finger to make this shade work
I'm just dabbing a little bit of that
right there now I don't have any new
Milani like eyeliners or mascaras so I'm
just gonna finish that part of my look
and join you back for the lip product
okay so to finish off this look I put on
some black liquid liner my hooded Beauty
lashes and also I smudged a little bit
of the dark brown just on the lower lash
line kind of just gently work that
inward and the one new lip thing I was
really interested to try is the keep it
full nourishing lip plumper I have this
in the shade soft Rose looks like this
comes in 9 different shades and they're
all kind of soft
they say it's multi tasking high pigment
luxurious lip gloss and nourishing
treatment all in one designed to fill in
lips and smooth over time this
lightweight non sticky plumper boost
collagen production to plump lips and
hyaluronic acid to seal in moisture so
they say it's high pigment and then in
the last sentence they call it creamy
sheer finish to me this is just a really
soft color although you'll notice it
going on like a little bit opaque so it
looks kind of nude here this shade see
how it does seem opaque on my lips I
really like that it smells ever so
slightly of mint chocolate although it's
not like a super minty tingle on the
lips just a slight bit of a cooling feel
now I only use this like three times so
far so I obviously can't comment on
whether this is plumping my lips over
time but I do think when you put this
gloss on just by the nature of it being
a gloss it sort of fills in the lines it
blurs the look of any lines that you may
have and it does just make the lips
appear a little bit fuller the gloss
itself is super comfortable definitely
non sticky doesn't go on streaky at all
which is something that I was kind of
surprised to see out of a color this
light not one of those prickly kind of
painful lip plumpers whatsoever and I'm
not at all concerned about it running
outside my lips it didn't wear a very
long time granted this is a very light
shade and it's not gonna stain your lips
at all either but I could see this being
really beautiful paired on top of some
sort of lip liner matte lip liner that
you really like and you could get some
sort of base color and long-wear going
that way and then top it off with this
because I do think this is a pretty
shade and it went on very opaque so as
far as Milan 'is new products go I think
the biggest hits for me were definitely
the eyeshadow palettes I was so
impressed but I also did really
like the radiant powder the loose powder
that kind of came off like a highlight I
just think that gives a beautiful look I
also did like the concealers they pursue
the next shade deeper from this but even
this color like really did some good
stuff for circles and darkness around my
inner corners of course you know I like
their bronzer and blush but those
weren't really new products that make it
less setting spray not super new but I
did like the lip product as well and I
might even look in some other shades
that they have so guys I hope this was
informative for you thank you so much
for taking time to watch thank you for
bearing with my little weak feeling
voice today it just feels different
coming out I so appreciate your time and
I will talk to you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
