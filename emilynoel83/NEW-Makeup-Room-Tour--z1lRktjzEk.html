this tour of my new makeup room there's
so many exciting fun new things that I
want to share with you that are in this
room this won't be a collection video I
definitely am going to do one of those
very soon but I just thought I would
save the storage in the collection
aspect specifically for another video
because there's so many little details
to get into with that but as for this
room I am so enjoying it I've just been
in here for now a couple of weeks and
it's been painted loving this paint
color and any little details that I have
you know specifics about the room or
certain products that I mentioned that
are in here I will link to those in the
info box if you want some more
information on that I totally love the
hot pink color that I had in the old
makeup room I thought you know if we're
going to be painting this room anyway I
would go for something a little bit
different so the color scheme in here I
would say it's like light pink black
white and gold lots of gold accents I
just love the way Gold's look up against
this particular paint color and a lot of
aspects in terms of the layout of the
room really remained similar to my old
room I have windows that face the West
so I definitely wanted to take advantage
of every bit of natural light I could so
I wanted to point my makeup desk toward
those windows definitely kept certain
furniture pieces and stuff like that but
I've also integrated a little office
area into this room which the extra
space allows me to do this room is
definitely wider longer this has a
little more space in here to work with
and I think you're gonna see that as we
go throughout the tour so first off
here's a little 360 degree look at the
room we've got some storage this is that
l-shaped desk that I had in the other
room pretty much surrounded by makeup
storage got a painting there between the
two windows from my sister cords that
still need to be worked with and hidden
there
but this great little stand was actually
something that I'd had since my
apartment days got that for free from
our landlord then and I've continued to
use it ever since using it in very much
the same way as the other room that I
had the old makeup room lives on my
sister had done this portrait of me in
my old makeup room and so that has a
place on these walls for sure and then
I've got my little zebra print bench
that made it here and then in this
corner this is what's new this is kind
of like can you tell it's a pretty much
like a square room with like a little
area that Jets back in here and so this
is my office nook this is where I edit I
keep my equipment I've got some books
and stuff but that's just been a great
little spot to keep everything all in
one place and then we've got a closet
right here this little area here is just
kind of like a background basically if
I'm sitting right at my makeup desk and
kind of Center it up at it this is sort
of what you'll see in the background I
actually made this e I got a cardboard
Ephraim Hobby Lobby taped on some
glittery like scrapbook paper so that's
totally a little DIY project anybody can
do there but really playing off of the
soft pink and the gold when you turn
over here here's another area you might
see in the background and I grouped
together I kind of have this going on in
my other room too some gold lipsticks I
love the look of gold makeup packaging
so I have that there some gold brushes
most of those are tart this fun little
piggy bank I've gotten just some really
girly pretty looking pieces there that I
will probably switch around and do
different things with but I just think
they look so lovely they're all together
and this cute little bottle I just came
up with at Hobby Lobby one of those
really like old-school looking beauty
items this was the missing piece of the
makeup room for awhile this really cool
gold mirror I was wanting either a clock
or a mirror or something on this wall
space that I've got here for the longest
time I couldn't find anything and then I
found
this just yesterday at Kohl's half price
so whoa so happy about that
another big item is this light fixture
up here this is new this used to be a
ceiling fan up top and this was
something we found at Lowe's I honestly
thought it was gonna be like half the
size and I was gonna put it over the
Nook area but then when we saw how big
it was shaping up to be we thought let's
make that you know kind of a centerpiece
so it's great I love it it's so fun and
just I think really fits with the room
nicely I've got three Aleks drawer these
are the nine drawer systems right here
so I'll go through those in a separate
like storage and organization video got
my trash can down there and then two of
the short but wide
ALX drawer thingies down below the desk
they really fit nicely with just a
little bit of clearance right here under
my desk which came from staples this is
the one I've been using for a while now
the 27 soon to be 28 week baby bump
saying hello - yeah but this mirror this
is my vanity girl Hollywood makeup
mirror I have had this for going on in
like three years now love it haven't
even had to change a bulb since I've had
it and you know this has been getting a
lot of use you need to store my brushes
in this thing that I think is from
pampered chef found that randomly left
over in the old house and have been
using it ever since as brush storage
it's great because it rotates and it
separates so that's really nice so from
the desk I get to have this lovely
painting from my sister in view she gave
this to me for Christmas this past year
and you can get prints of this by the
way this is the original but you can get
prints if you're interested in having
something like this in any number of
sizes in your room back here I've just
got a little area with my empties been a
couple of extra like overflow storage
the items train cases Bibles etc I
mentioned briefly what I've got over
here but it really hasn't changed much
since the last time some smaller books I
got a little display area here that was
from Elle magazine
back in the day that was really really
cool to get to be in that all my nail
polish here stored in some layered spice
racks I have a blog about how I did that
and where I got those from and then just
more nail supplies in the bottom
love-love-love that bench got my laptop
bag there a long black cord that once
again needs to be hidden this bookshelf
actually used to hold my makeup like all
those plastic drawers in my old makeup
room it was sitting like right behind me
and a lot of my videos right kind of off
to the side so I was glad I was still
able to use that and have the space for
that in here despite having the new
makeup storage that you see there my
thought with the whole makeup area is
that I want to keep as many things
within reach as possible so I love just
being able to sit in that chair being
able to turn around and basically be
surrounded by any makeup item I might
need you know the eye stuff the lip
stuff the palettes it's all been kind of
stowed away in there and it's great to
have that kind of access that's
definitely something that I had in the
old room and I'm having it here but I
think with much more efficient like
better separation and storage and stuff
my office nook I just stuck some flowers
up there that I had my EOS lip-balm Bowl
lives on I've got these cute little lip
shaped makeup bags that I think are
adorable my big makeup books here on
this top shelf
my sister has gotten me most of these
and I just think the cover that one
particularly is gorgeous but I've got a
few more there as well as for the space
isn't super worked out yet just a space
for some equipment some stationery and
stuff a little filing box that I have
this little table used to be in the
corner of my other room I just put it
here with a lamp on it so if I don't
want to use both of these overhead
lights which come on at the same time so
if I don't want the room fully lit I'm
just sitting over here I have this
little lamp and then this white desk is
a new thing that we got from Ikea and it
was a matter of buying both the desk and
the top part so you had to get those
both separately but
it's a really really nice fit for a
compact area I mean that is not a large
desk at all but it fits me well it's got
a small drawer over here also a little
cabinet II type thing with several
shelves and then like your standard kind
of office you hurt right there and then
the top part gives you this top shelf
which could be great for books and then
three little cubby holes down the side
so I just really am enjoying this this
fits my iMac just great for my editing
and then last but not least is the
closet so we kind of like a walk-in type
of closet here I've got lots of storage
up top from Train case type things to
extra decorations and bags and
Technology various thing in my old
closet I had these drawers and
bookshelves and I was just able to
really transfer them right in here
I've got like overflow of older makeup
makeup samples I've got some extra
palettes going on here a lot of my
Coastal Scents palettes up in here now
I've been sent something for review and
it's kind of waiting to be looked at
I've got that in here not more seasonal
like limited edition type palettes in
here is why I don't have everything
filled in here I've definitely got ways
I could condense things but so far I
basically just took the way I had it in
my old room which was more just straight
across left to right and now it's more
so in this square type shape and I've
just got this little cart right here
with some extra you know tech stuff but
really happy about this closet it offers
a lot of nice extra space another thing
that I love is that this room is so
close to the nursery it's right around
that corner and I could totally see pop
and open a play pin in here on some of
this floor space for Miss Belle and by
the way I definitely will do some
updates on the nursery as we add to it
right now there's not much more than
empty boxes in that room at the moment
but I will be doing some more stuff like
that more home related stuff on the vlog
channel so that's Beauty vlog cast if
you want to go there and subscribe and
be ready for whatever's to come hey did
you just miss the tour so thank you
much for joining me for this room tour
I'm really excited to explore some of
the different areas that I have in this
room to shoot my videos and I think
that's going to be a lot of fun and
definitely keep your eyes out for a
collection video coming in the near
future totally new configuration as far
as my makeup storage goes here so that's
gonna be really fun to share I had a lot
of fun filling up all these drawers from
Ikea so thank you for watching and I'll
see you next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
