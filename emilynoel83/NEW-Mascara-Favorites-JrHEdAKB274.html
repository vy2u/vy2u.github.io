video sharing my favorite mascaras
because things have changed a little bit
where my favorites are concerned so I
thought an update was in order I know a
lot of people start their hair videos
and their skin videos sharing their skin
and hair types well for this I'll share
my last type it is not good naturally I
have short lashes I have not a real good
amount of thickness in my lashes I feel
like without curling them when they're
just you know started the day I'm
starting to put my makeup on I feel like
they practically point down just a bit
so I always curl them for a good 15
seconds before I apply my mascara also
what am I looking for in a good mascara
I want it to be thickening lengthening I
want it to not make my lashes super hard
and brittle if possible if it could
nurse my lashes a bit and sort of put
some some good things back into my
lashes that would be we definitely want
it to wear really well throughout the
day not be flaking or smudging
underneath my eyes or anything like that
so I've got a lot of needs where my
mascaras are concerned I've got some
very high standards part lights camera
lashes mascara now this one and my other
mascara have actually taken out my
former one of my former high-end
favorites which was Lancome Hypnose
still think it's a great mascara but I
found two here that I just think are the
bomb
so Tarte lights camera lashes I have it
on right now and just to let you know I
have no false eyelashes on today and
this mascara has been on all my makeup
has been on for 11 hours went through a
full work day came home wanted to shoot
this so badly so yeah this is a foreign
one clinically proven natural mascara
claims to increase lash volume by 424
percent so I could go through and read a
bunch more but what I want to tell you
is this this mascara is a great
combination of a fantastic formula and a
really great brush when you put this on
your lashes your lashes actually remain
so lightweight and flexible so they
don't feel like sticks which mean
they're less likely
to just be brittle and break right off
so I feel like my lashes are being
nourished with this master really love
this brush I love that it is a really
thick brush it's not the most gigantic
brush in the world so it's fairly easy
to control it has a small tip that
allows you to get into the very inner
corners very nicely and I just love the
way it goes on and it stays because I
put this also on my lower lashes and I
tell you guys what I'm not kidding I
didn't even have to go in with a q-tip
before this video 11 hours my makeup has
been on nothing has come down here that
I've had to correct the other high-end
one that is actually really similar to
this one in that it doesn't give you
those brittle really hard lashes but
it's the Mallee
volumizing mascara and this also comes
in a fantastic waterproof version as
well but it has a kind of similar brush
the only thing I mean it's similar in
size and just kind of the way it is it's
a little more spiraled around and the
tip is not quite as tapered but still
this is a great mascara for getting that
volume it might thicken even just a
little bit more than this one does but
maybe doesn't provide quite as much
definition as Tarte so I've maybe put
Tarte here and malley like right about
here also a great long wear even the non
waterproof version the one I'm holding
here does well on upper and lower lashes
good for volume good for length and it
wears just all day just fine first one
that I love a lot is the almay one coat
nourishing mascara triple effect one
side of this brush has longer bristles
that's the top part that I'm showing you
and the other side the bottom part there
has very short bristles so you're
getting a lengthening effect and a
thickening effect
I love the formula on this it actually
reminds me a lot of these two and that
the formula is not super wet it's
actually borderline just a little bit
dry maybe a hint drier than those other
two so it really really builds volume on
each and
mascara is that what I want a big lash
look I'm gonna reach for one of these I
don't mess around with natural-looking
mascaras cuz that's not what I want so
this one is fantastic if I wanting you
know just to get a really nice thick
look or a lengthen look I can achieve it
with that one voluminous carbon black
there's one little catch with this one
and it's that sometimes you know how
with certain mascaras you hear people
say well you use it for a while and
after a couple of weeks you know it
dries out just slightly and then it's
perfect
well I still like voluminous even though
it comes into that category for me it's
really good after a couple of weeks it's
not so good fresh out of the tube the
brush is very similar to the brush from
the Mallee mascara a little bit similar
to the Tarte lights camera lashes you
can get some mega big lashes with the
voluminous carbon black just keep in
mind if the formula might be a little
wet when you first get it so you have to
work with a little while before it gets
to be just just right for you sometimes
when people are asking me for drugstore
mascara recommendations the request is
very specific and it's something that
doesn't flake or smudge throughout the
day generally what I hear people toward
is the covergirl LashBlast because I
think it wears so well throughout the
day I really have not had any smudging
or flaking issues with this kind of
mascara I mean it's gonna really stay on
there until you take it off and the
brush while it is big I still think it
separates nicely it might not do as much
for my lashes as some of the other ones
that I've mentioned but it wears
wonderfully and you don't have to feel
like oh I have to get a waterproof
version for this to last it will still
last a really long time now I happen to
have lash lash blast fusion on hand
which is in the purple tube some people
swear by this some people say the
regular lash blast and the orange tube
is best frankly I've said this before
and I'll say it again
I think it comes down to whether you
like purple or orange better in terms of
the color of the tube because these
don't really perform any differently
from me one from the I think it provides
some nice length and definition not as
much you know thickness and volume maybe
but it will be a workhorse for you and
last
out the whole day I think it's great to
have a lower lash mascara and Maybelline
lash discovery has worked great for me
the brush is teeny tiny so you're
dealing with a very small brush that's
going to reach out and grab those lashes
whether it be in the inner corner of
your upper lashes or right down in here
it can take multiple coats I do not have
smudging issues with this mascara and I
also don't have issues with it getting
clumpy you no matter what mascara really
appealed to you out of what I talked
about this is a great one to have as
well because you can use it on the lower
lashes and it performs very well so
those are my current favorite mascaras
feel free to share in the comments
section below what your favorite mascara
is right now what worked for me may not
work perfectly for you but these are the
ones that I look to to really plump up
my lashes make them big and bold and
also get me through a work day so thanks
for watching and I'll see you next time
some reason whenever this drying rack is
out cupcake feels the need to climb it
and she usually gets herself into some
kind of trouble</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
