video is going to be all about these new
Kat Von D shade + light eye contour
quads so this is really exciting for
those of us who love the original shade
+ light eye palette so we're talking
100% matte today because if you remember
you know the regular shade + light eye
palette is a 100% matte neutral palette
you've got 12 different shades in there
it probably is the most versatile
neutral matte palette that I have just
because it goes from so light to so very
dark and just quality wise I love the
way they blend I love you know kind of
layering one shade over the next they
are all so pigmented from dark to light
so when you find yourself like blending
over a deeper shade with a medium to
light tone color there's so much pigment
with that it really creates this
flawless like gradient effect from dark
to light you know what I'm saying
because that light shade has enough
punch to really overlap and still make
an impact
so I've loved this palette so very much
and I was really excited to see when
they came out with these quads which
sort of play off of different specific
color tones in addition to these I have
a new primer and a double-ended eye
brush that we're also sent to me along
with these eye palettes so I'll
definitely cover all of that in this
video so these quads are going to run
$26 a piece on sephora.com I've got this
one here called rust and they say matte
brownish Reds for blue eyes so I think
they're kind of trying to give you an
idea of what I color these make
compliment and I do think this would
look great on blue eyes personally I
don't think you should ever feel boxed
in by those kinds of color suggestions
so if you want to wear it go for it the
color that ends up being here in the
large spot is not always the lightest
shade it's kind of like I don't know the
most versatile sort of blended out type
shade maybe you'd put it all over the
lid maybe you'd use it as a transition
color but I really love the colors that
have gone in this slot in these palettes
because they tend to look I don't know a
little deeper than they even appear to
be in the palette they go on very
and like this was a really handy shade
it's a little bit pinkish and you got
your warm brown you're rusty shade and
this kind of soft creamy ivory color and
I have done looks with all of these
pallets so I'll pop those up along the
way too and I really like the way this
one turned out it really gives me a
summary vibe with just how warm these
shades are now as soon as I got this it
did make me think of this end of the
original palette and you can see that
the shades aren't identical I mean that
is a much more orange shade than that
deeper kind of reddish rust color the
dark brown is much warmer in this
palette you also have this kind of
different pinky shade going on there are
some kind of rough similarities to this
palette this goes I think definitely a
step warmer than anything here but it's
kind of close in some aspects and then I
want to talk about the smoke palette and
they identified this one as being for
all eye colors on the website you've got
your very dark I would call it near
black because it doesn't seem quite as
dark as the black in the original shade
and light palette this kind of cool
shade almost hint of blue in that gray
and then a white over here and then I
really love this shape because it's kind
of like a grayish taupe and I think it
really helps the blending process of all
these cool tones when you've got
something like this to kind of buff
around the edges I loved the look I got
with this I mean this just really shows
how smooth and seamless your look can be
when you're using all of these matte
shadows they blend so nicely one shade
on top of the next and just makes doing
eyeshadow more fun when it's that easy
or hey so making a little comparison
here to the original palette here's the
thing I definitely have gotten looks
with this kind of cool sector of this
palette and I've gotten looks that are
very much like what I did with this this
is the palette where there are probably
the most similarities back to the
original just outside of this shade
that's that little bit cool almost hint
of blue in it now the last two palettes
work in a little more color we've got
sage which says matte greens for brown
eyes so here's a look at sage really
only one very greenish color in here
this was the only quad where I just felt
a little disappointed after I did the
look I
still thought it was pretty but you've
got basically one green shade in here
and it's really really dark so it's easy
I think to lose some of the impact and
it doesn't quite look as greenish as I
was hoping it would because this shade
while it might have just the tiniest
hint of olive in it there's not much I
mean if you're looking for the darkest
forest green Matt I look possible you've
come to the right place with this
palette but for me I just I wanted a
little more green to shine through and
not that I really need to hold these
side-by-side because you know there's no
green in this original palette and I was
really prepared to want to love this
because I do love some dark greens on
the eye like maybe if that shade could
have had a little more green in it it
might have been spot on and the last
palette and the one I'm wearing on my
eyes today is the plum palette and this
says matte purples for green eyes this
palette I love it I love it it's
probably no big surprise here but it's
definitely different in so many ways
from this original palette this pink is
so awesome here like that is the
underdog of the whole palette because
you look at the plum and you're like oh
that's pretty and a lot of people like
these dusty lavender type shades but
this pink goes on the eyes so much
deeper it's such an interesting shape
for a matte like sometimes shimmery
shades will be the ones that really
surprise you and mattes are more like
okay I could predict exactly what that
was going to do but this shade I just
that on the border of the look I just
love it now one thing that I ran into
texture wise and it seemed to happen a
lot with this shade even more than
probably any other color in any of the
palettes is the powdery kind of
dustiness that kicks up when you put
your brush into it so I guess my word of
advice for that would be definitely
there's no need to run your brush back
and forth across a shadow just gently
tap it in tap off the excess and go on
with your look but the pigmentation is
totally there the blend ability so I do
want to show you how I did this look
first off I put that pinky shade right
in the crease and you can see how it's
deeper than you might expect right isn't
that so cool and then I use some of this
lightest color it's like a barely there
lilac and I used it up under the brow I
used a little bit on the inner part of
the
lid also and then on the lid I use this
kind of deep in lavender shade and I
just love that color that's so pretty
and kind of unique as far as my
collection goes I ended up blending that
up into the crease just a little bit too
and then I had to bring in some drama
with this darkest plum berry type shade
beautiful sheer doubt you get a whole
other element to this that looks even
more pinky berry ish when you sheer it
out and I use that you know in the outer
corner I pulled it up into an outer V
type thing I smudged that a little bit
on the lower lash line and I also used
some of that medium lavender on the
lower lash line - it's a beautiful
palette for the plum lovers there's just
no getting around it if you watched my
Natasha de Nonna video last week and you
saw me talking about that beautiful
palette that had some Purple's in it too
but it also had some really really
flashy and shimmery shades and you're
thinking gosh I wish there was a great
plum palette that was more matte well
this week here it is now a couple of
other little nuggets of info here there
is a Kat Von D color correcting
eyeshadow primer I have it in light I
need to look into whether this comes in
multiple shades but it's a stick like
just a jumbo twist up stick and it works
fine I really have no problems with it I
do think it has a little coverage to it
so if you've got a lot of discoloration
on the lids you know you can just kind
of swipe this on quickly blend over it
with your finger and it seems to do away
with some of that and I haven't had any
staying power issues with the shadow on
top of this however I don't know that
it's in real essential you know when I
look at other things in my collection
like my Milani shadow eyes an almond
cream and the Jordana brand has a jumbo
shadow stick in a nude matte shade that
would also work as nice bases for this
if you didn't want to use some other
kind of primer and then there's the
shading light brush that came in this
beautiful packaging I mean that's so
cool and it's a dense really nice
feeling brush that has a very pointy
pencil side to it and then there's this
really thick blender for the crease I
don't necessarily want to put a really
densely packed tight brush
into that kind of a formula because
it'll be more than I need I kind of wish
it was just a flat brush on one end of
this because that would have been really
handy I think this pencil brush is fine
it's more pointy than I'm used to but if
you wanted to use one of those dark
shades as liner I could see that working
out but bottom line with these palettes
I think it's a great idea I think you
know some people might be like I'll
never use the plumb shades well you
don't have to buy the plumb palette you
know or you don't have to buy the green
palette so you can really kind of
specialize in to the tones of shadow
that you like most but that being said
if you're already one who owns the shade
+ light eye palette there are a couple
of these that maybe are slightly less
essential you know if you're trying to
minimize your purchases or save your
money like I said the smoke palette I
have gotten looks that are so much like
what I get with this you just have that
one kind of different shade in here but
beyond that there are definitely other
colors that can mimic the look you get
with this the other one that I would say
is in the ballpark it's not identical to
the original but this rust palette you
know that you could get a similar look
for sure with some of the shades that
are already in the original shade and
light this sage palette is definitely
different from the original shade and
light but like I was saying earlier it's
the only one that I really wasn't
totally satisfied with as far as the
finished look I just wanted more of a
greenish thing going on there my most
favorite is the plum palette and it's
definitely the most different from the
original so if you've got this this is a
nice little tacit on I'm excited to do
some looks that don't necessarily
incorporate this darkest shade because
these other colors like I was saying
before you could go with this in the
crease this on the lid and have the most
beautiful soft like barely-there blush
look on the eyes and I think it would be
gorgeous so thank you guys for watching
this video I hope this look at these
palettes and the analysis of these
ballots against the original shade +
light eye palette if you're having a
great day and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
