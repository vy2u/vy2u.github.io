this is super exciting this doesn't
happen often but I got something that
nobody else has got right now this is so
cool Maybelline's PR company reached out
to me and said we've got a new
Maybelline palette with 12 colors in it
coming out this summer and we want to
know if you want to be the first to
review it and I said uh yes please I
would love that opportunity thank you so
much fuller reasons why I'm interested
first off if I ran across this in the
drugstore I would pick it up in a
heartbeat because it's just right along
the lines of the types of things I like
to review it combines drugstore and
palettes which is always cool and I feel
like these major drugstore brands like
Maybelline L'Oreal Revlon they never put
out large palettes so it's gonna come
out June or July
you know how stores always you know
summer heads some are a little behind
but um keep an eye out for it and it's
gonna sell for $11.99 so I'm going to
review it I'm going to show you several
different looks that I've done with it
in the time that I've had it and also do
an actual tutorial on one of those first
off packaging wise very sleek nothing
overdone with this it's not huge and
bulky I love that it's about the size
maybe just a teeny bit wider than my
iPhone it does not have a mirror and it
would have loved to have seen a mirror
in a palette like the yonder shadows you
are getting a sponge tip applicator a
lot of people like to just toss the
sponge tips I've always been one to try
to use them in some capacity especially
cool though this really narrow side is
actually really nice for smudging if you
like to smudge out eyeliner or something
it's kind of a handy tool to keep around
for the shadows you're getting twelve
and here's what makes this palette kind
of interesting it's all mapped out on
the back here but you can divide these
twelve up into quads trios and duo's
it's all about the way they're placed in
this palette that kind of gives you
ideas on where to go with them and how
to use them I know some people would
look at a palette like this and maybe
have an instant plan of how they're
going to use this I know from a lot of
the questions I get a lot of people who
buy palettes want some direction
then so what you're getting here this is
a quad this is a quad and this is a quad
when you look at it that way can't you
totally see that here's like you're you
know you're cool Browns here's your more
bronzy neutrals and here's your smoky
set and then they furthermore said these
could be trios as well so here here here
and here and then they could also be
duos so look at them two at a time two
by two as far as the concept of this
palette I think that's great I love that
you're getting you know the creativity
the options that we want with palettes
but at the same time you've got a little
direction if that's what you want the
practical part of my brain likes the
thought that there's some rhyme or
reason to the way these are placed there
and it's just a well-thought-out concept
so how effective are they from that
standpoint of say just using part as a
quad or just breaking them down into
duos for quads
I think they're great because you are
getting some truly nice deep shades in
each of those quads some mid-tone shades
some mattes
I mean there's good variety and finishes
and color in terms of trios I can see it
working it's a little bit more of a
stretch because you are kind of crossing
out of the designated sort of color
groupings so you use these three
together and these three it's like yeah
I can see it working but maybe not being
as pretty as if you integrated the full
quad four duos I think this is fabulous
when you look at each of these paired
together the more contrast you have
between shades I think the more dramatic
your duo shadow look will be but some of
them are more natural and it's totally
sandwich method all the way I'll link to
that video but it's like you know you
put one shade on your lid you put your
deeper shade in your crease and then you
continue to blend out and or highlight
with the lighter of the two shades and
it works so well but how good is the
quality of the shadows actually if
you're familiar with Maybelline's
shadows they'll give you a little frame
of reference they have the expert where
quads they also have the eye Studio
quads I think these are two distinctly
different textures here you ten
to have some Matt mixed in with some
shimmer these are like velvety plush
always shimmery eyeshadows and I would
say the shadows in this palette are much
more along the lines of these kinds of
shadows I find it to be a little hit and
miss with the pigmentation the biggest
critique I would have on it would be the
lighter shades the lighter shades will
work beautifully for the light sheer
type of highlight that I want but I find
that they're a little bit challenging to
build up to a color that looks you know
that intense on your eyes even with a
primer I mean the primer helps but it
takes a little more packing on with the
shade the shade the shade and this one
that being said about the light shades I
do think the balance of light medium and
dark tones in this palette is really
good I think you're getting you know
your dark matte brown and black you're
getting deeper shimmery shades mid-tone
shimmery shades mid-tone mattes that
make your blending a little bit more
easy so I think that's very well put
together in that respect and the balance
of matte and shimmer is good your matte
shades in here are these two so this
matte cream this matte dark brown the
matte black and then to mattes up here
kind of like a grayish taupe and then a
little bit deeper gray so now that
you're keeping all those things in mind
and take a look at the swatches first
off know prime some are absolutely
creamy and wonderful some like I said
the lighter shades a little more powdery
a little more work to build up now the
next picture is with a primer
specifically I've got the Milani
eyeshadow primer underneath this and
every shade pops a little more with the
shades that needed the help pop a lot
more with that underneath so I would
totally recommend some sort of eyeshadow
primer if that's not something you use
all the time are some really really
standout textures in this palette as
well though for example like these
shimmery Browns they feel like creamy
pigmented I don't get fallout when I put
my brush into them I mean I couldn't ask
for more with those shades I'm like a
light
that shade like this it has a really
nice silky smooth texture to it when you
put your finger into it and also again
not a lot of flaky fallout business my
favorite eyeshadows from the drugstore
are wet and wild
I love how incredibly intense they can
be I mean they're just some of the most
pigmented shadows out there and
extremely comparable to high-end stuff
you know I could get a similar look with
a wet and wild palette that I could get
with a lorac palette you know they've
got that really buttery smooth
consistency but the one fault you could
find with those is that maybe if you're
a beginner with eyeshadows or you just
don't like having to use a super duper
light touch with everything they can be
a little hard to control with this well
you know I can't complain about a couple
of the light shades not being as
pigmented as I'd like at the same time
none of these shades give me a lot of
you know kicking up a lot of dust or a
lot of fallout or anything of that
nature the exception of the couple I've
mentioned I think very very impressive
textures on these shadows from the
mattes to the shimmers one thing about
the black you know that looks black as
night here in the pan that is not like a
pitch-black black shade just so you know
it comes off more of like a deep
charcoal color I do want to talk about
several of the different looks that I've
done with this first one um this was a
little more dramatic land I went with
this more dramatic quad but then I also
pulled in this bronze a shade to do a
little bit of the blending and kind of
soften it and make it a little more
earthy you know on the edges of the look
and I really was happy with the way that
turned out I found I was able to build
up the black to my desired intensity
it's kind of an example of how you have
the freedom to you know focus on one
quad but then pull in something else the
next day I just wanted a quick look so I
went for these two and chose to just use
them as a duo it's a satin finish taupe
shade and then you got a matte Brown
they worked beautifully together
I put the taupe shade all over my lid
I put the brown in the crease you can
also use that as a little bit of maybe
some smudgy liner down banana and you
know blend out the edge of that Brown
with the dope again it's that sandwich
method that works so well so easily and
then today I used yet another part of
that pallet so here's that mini tutorial
all right so the quad of shadows that
I'm focusing on so to speak within this
pallet is the center most part so here
we've got some kind of bronze II golden
shades and I've already applied a primer
all over my lid and I'm going to go to
this matte cream shade here and I'm just
going to take that right around my
innermost corner next I'm going to take
the golden shade this is a very light
gold it doesn't come off with quite as
much like golden intensity or really
looking like a metallic color as I would
have expected it's like a very sheer
wash of a little bit of gold and shimmer
is what this amounts to so I'm going to
build that color up as much as I can and
apply that all over my lid then I'm
going to take this pretty deep shimmery
Brown I'm applying a little bit of this
on the outside part of my lid I always
like to go a little bit on the outer
part of the lid because I feel like it
just kind of flows nicely into the
crease when I've got like a little bit
of lead in there and then with that same
shade but a smaller detailed brush I'm
getting that shadow placed exactly where
I want it building it outward just a
little bit kind of thinking about
roughly pointing the edge of that shadow
kind of going back toward the tip of my
eyebrow and then this brush is just bare
but a little more fluffy brush is what
I'm using to just buff over the edge of
that soften that darker color out a
little bit next I want to bring in this
pretty bronzy shade applying that right
over the border of the deeper Brown and
so it kind of fades up and in a pretty
way I think and then for a highlight
going back to the matte white and a
fluffy brush just under the eyebrow and
this is what's giving us a really
nice finished look to the different
shades we've been layering out there on
my lower lash line I'm just going to use
an angled brush with this shade and I'm
applying that right here on the
outermost corner and you can see how
deep that can really come off when
you're using a really like concentrated
brush like this a very precise brush and
then with this smudger brush I'm going
to go to the gold and just apply this
all across my lower lash line here going
to kind of overlap the brown and give
ourselves a little light down there and
then I'm just going to finish this look
with a little bit of nude liner in the
waterline some liquid liner on the upper
lash line and some mascara so just want
to throw in a little mini tutorial there
to show you some of these shadows in
action and all in all I'm impressed with
the nudes I must say - you've been
skipping you know the naked palettes and
various other high-end palettes because
of their cost and now I think it's
really cool there's something available
the drugstore level you know 12 bucks is
not ridiculous by any means and you're
getting great variety not only in
neutral shades but also finishes
textures of these shadows are definitely
more hit than miss if that makes sense I
think some of these mats are going to
totally impress you when you get your
hands on it and then as I said some of
the light shades a little more sheer in
their application sometimes that's what
you want that's pretty much always what
I want when I highlight with the shadow
but if I'm going to pack it on I have to
go to a little more effort to get the
fullness of color that I'm after if
you're saying I'm up to my ears in
neutral eye shadow palettes I don't need
another one then that's cool skip it but
if you want I think a really
cost-effective way to get some great
variety of neutral looks plus some good
direction on how to use every shade in a
really simplified way then this might be
right up your alley so thank you to
Maybelline and Maybelline's PR for
letting me have an exclusive sneak peek
at their really appreciated I hope the
review was helpful to everybody there
and all of my viewers of course as well
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
