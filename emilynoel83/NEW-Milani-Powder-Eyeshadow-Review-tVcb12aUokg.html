exciting video for you on some drugstore
shadows that are new that are amazing
that I just love so much and I'm going
to tell you all about them I'm going to
show you swatches I'm gonna you know
show you them even a little tutorial
thrown in on how I got this look it's
gonna be excited you love Milani and if
you've been using it for several years
you might remember when they had these
singles these are were a very popular
thing in the makeup community people
thought these were amazing quality
eyeshadows and they were and then they
got discontinued have been out of stores
for a while now and then Milani came up
with their baked shadows and you know
these are great and these have their
place I mean if you like the really you
know ultra metallic look you can get
when you wear something wet which is
what baked products are great for
wearing wet or dry so they had these but
these really weren't anything like these
and now a new powder eyeshadow has
surfaced in the Milani world I have
twelve shades to show you um the company
sent me these to try and I would like to
say that the last Milani review I did I
reviewed a bunch of their new products
that they sent me for just new 2012
things and as a whole I mean it wasn't a
lot of positive feedback that I was
giving on some of those products but yet
they sent me more to try which I thought
that's interesting that they would you
know sit possibly subject their stuff to
another negative review but it's not the
case here because I really truly love
these eyeshadows and I'm glad I'm going
to get the chance to show you the
collection in its entirety in this video
I'm just trying to map out how to do
this I sort of divided up these shades
into three different segments just for
swatches and talking about them and
whatnot one is gonna be kind of like
overall matte neutral shade shimmery or
pearl neutral colors and I've got bright
colorful colors
you're getting a lot of product here
you're getting 3.1 grams if I compare
that to a Mac Shadow in a Mac Shadow you
get 1.5 grams so there's the comparison
lots of product that you're getting the
thing I initially noticed you know when
you get something new and you'd want to
dip your finger in it and swatch it um
it's incredibly pigmented matte shades
are shimmery shades are not overly flaky
powdery like you stick your brush in it
and excess product is going everywhere
it's like could you just stay on the
brush please think shimmery shades you
may have a little bit of extra I won't
say dustiness but it's a little extra
product there when you tap your brush
because the pigmentation is so fantastic
that doesn't bother people to see a
flaky shadow they're like am I gonna
just put that on my eye and it's all
gonna fall all over my cheek that's not
an issue with the staying power with
these is impeccable I went out to a
graduation party last weekend and I was
it was kind of an outdoor thing and I
was sweating sweating sweating it was in
the 90s outside and I had these
eyeshadows on and I mean I was like
getting sweat coming like from my
eyebrow I don't know in my eye you know
that stinging feeling when sweat gets in
your eye yes I shadows held up and I
knew I was like I'm putting them to the
test
on this day and I've worn them multiple
times but I mean that was the situation
or I thought I can really you know see
how this goes they still lasted
wonderfully well so blending application
is great with these something I noticed
was that you know you put on a matte
shade and sometimes matte and shimmer
don't always live together well in the
same I look just because one doesn't
always blend flawlessly over the other
and you're gonna see when we get to the
tutorial it's its absence spot-on
first off these shades that I sort of
dubbed the matte neutrals we have a
white shade called white lie it's very
very pigmented it's a very full-on
opaque white and then we have french
vanilla which is as you look at the two
side by side you can see it's just a
little bit more off-white it's gonna be
more like your creamy shade just a
little less of that stark white
intensity with French vanilla then this
next one it kind of got looped in with
this bunch for me just for the purposes
of doing this video but it's called
brownstone and I would say this is maybe
more of a satiny finish you can just see
as I hold it here see how the light kind
of catches it a little bit more but this
is a great Brown and it's overall I mean
it's not gonna look shimmery on your eye
whatsoever so you're talking kind of a
medium to deep brown I would call that
and then you've got pitch black this is
an amazing black this is as black as
black gets this is a black that goes on
much easier than Mac carbon this I would
say if you want that one matte black
shape and that's all you want and you
don't want it in a palette which I know
wet-and-wild will give it to you in
palettes and I love that and I'm not
knocking that in anyway but sometimes
you just want that one color and I would
say this is the go-to matte black from
the drugstore hands-down this is dark as
night I just love this roll with these
matte colors they go on beautifully I've
done a full kind of matte look and I
thought oh this looks so classic or very
opaque very pigmented and I can only
imagine with the amount of pigmentation
like this black one has I can only
imagine how long this is going to last
me anything onto the shades that are a
little bit more like your pearly
shimmery neutrals got a shade called
pearl and this one's just gonna have you
know that little bit of luminosity it's
not like you know iridescent or anything
like that but this would be what I would
call a classic highlight shade it's not
overly shimmery but I mean it does have
just as the name implies a pearly
quality to it I love love this shade
called tickled pink
because it looks pink but the light
starts to catch it and it has the most
beautiful golden shimmer in there it's a
wonderful pink color it's great to work
into any look just for you know
something a little different than your
typical cream brown you know golden
neutrals and things like that on this
shade called gold dust is gorgeous I am
wearing that in my look today and it's a
nice beautiful non brassy gold one's
called caramel brown your classic kind
of shimmery brownish taupe type color I
would say definitely a must-have this
could be a standalone color I mean you
put this all over your lid and into the
crease and you're out the door kind of
shade or you know you combine it and in
within this little chunk on something
I've three that I've put together often
have been purl to kind of brighten up my
brow bone in my inner corner the pink
tickled pink shade all over the lid and
then caramel brown for a soft crease
these are the types of shades that can
be great overall shadows because they'll
catch the light where you want it to
like on your lid but then when it's
shaded it looks darker Brown just like
that how the colors and for the colors I
have let's see I have a couple they're
shimmery and a couple that are met first
one is called just perfect and I love
that name because this color is
absolutely gorgeous wore this not too
long ago and what I love look how it
looks blue and it catches the light
totally like a jade green so it's it's a
it's a really pretty shimmery bright
pigmented color that I love one is
called purple shock and this isn't going
to be the most bold purple you've ever
seen just by the shade I mean you're
looking at the shade here this is like
kind of almost like a soft medium violet
color but what's interesting about this
color is that it has kind of an
opalescent shimmer to it not flecks
Apsara in them if I say shimmer it's
just kind of like a pearly Perlina
Stefan Utley hangs together you know
it's not like flecks and chunks of
glitter flying out but this is a very
pretty soft purple next two shades are
your power
bright colors and we've got one that is
a hot pink called shocking pink
appropriately named this is just a
beautiful matte bright pink I mean if
you are in the market for something like
this here it is if you've been wanting
that one you know bright pink eyeshadow
 you got it there it is as intense
as that you would think it would be by
looking at the packaging and Olympian
blue this is a shade I experimented with
today and it is flat out matte beautiful
blue but don't let it fool you don't see
this shade and think how can I possibly
wear that because I will show you
exactly how you can wear this and make
this a wearable blue eyeshadow for you
in its of course I want to tell you what
my favorites are and this is totally a
personal thing because I know you may be
sitting there thinking okay well I just
need a matte black I'm not really into
the colors I you know I'm very
interested in having that black or you
know you know what's missing in your own
collection so I'm not trying to like
push these off on you or to say you must
have these because I like them but I
just tell you what one that I think are
great really like white lie just for the
fact that it is a drugstore white matte
shadow that looks exactly like you think
it should look like totally matte white
and I've used that actually around the
inner corner where I've been kind of
strictly shimmer for a while and it's
actually kind of cool to go around it
with the matte so that's nice black is
absolutely phenomenal off-the-charts
blackest night as I said I mean it's
Wonder of tickled pink for the fact that
it is unique if you've kind of thought
maybe I want to try pink but I'm not
quite sure if I can do it completely
wearable guys because it shimmers to a
Golden State that is very flattering and
very very pretty also really really
enjoy a caramel brown because it is a
brownish taupe that's extremely wearable
and can be worn on its own and of the
colors the one that I think I like the
most has got to be the one just perfect
because it is kind of shimmery it could
be blueish it can be greenish it can
look beautiful this time of year for a
summery fun look and I got to say this
Olympian blue is growing on me as well
due to the look that I created with her
so I did this just real quickly to show
you how these perform I took Olympian
blue with kind of a small flat brush
and I just applied that on the outer
part of my lid and you can see the color
packs on beautifully to see you know
really put it to the test how does a
shimmery shade kind of overlap and
interact with a matte shade and so I
took gold dust and I patted that on the
inner part of my lid and sort of just
slightly pulled it over on top of the
Blin I just took Olympian blue into my
crease a little bit more smaller crease
brush you've got a lot of control with
this overlapped the blue with this
caramel Brown when you do that it's kind
of like the brown is the more visible
color with just as you look forward with
just your eyes open but then you have
that peekaboo effect when you look down
and you've got the blue then finished it
off with gold dust as the highlight just
lightly under the brow line my eyes
liquid liner on top a little bit of
Urban Decay 24/7 on the outer part of
the lower lash line smudged it a bit and
then went over that with more of the
blue just to kind of tie it all together
from top lash line to bottom but on some
mascara and you've got your finished
look there so that pretty much wraps up
my review on these shadows guys again I
think it's an outstanding product that
Milani has put out it reminds me a lot
of those shadows that we we knew and
love from years ago that got
discontinued but these really have great
quality you're getting a lot of product
in there it's gonna last you a long time
I like that you know they give you some
colors for the people who want some
great colors but you've also got some
wonderful classic basics that I think
are well worth the $6 price tag to throw
in your collection or fan of drugstore
shadows more in pallet form that are
great quality look to wet and wild the
thing about these is that they're a
little less a little less powdery a
little less flaky even though wet and
wild is highly highly pigmented these
are just a little less flaky as you as
you stick your brush in them so that's
my observation there I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thanks so much for
watching and have a great
