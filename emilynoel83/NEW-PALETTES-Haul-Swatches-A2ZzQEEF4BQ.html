me for this video do you ever do makeup
looks where you're like you know this is
just my look this is exactly what I like
to do is my makeup and I don't really
care if it suits anyone else that's kind
of what I've done with myself today I've
done like this very sort of smoky eye
I've got this rich berry lip where I
actually took on max rebel use one of
these lip toppers I've been curious
about these from Shoei and skinny-dip I
used a little bit of that in the center
anyways I'm enjoying this makeup look
today we're talking palettes in this
video I've gotten quite a few new ones
lately I'm looking at a stack of six
right in front of me and I just thought
before my makeup use in life goes any
further I just want to show these I want
to swatch them out I want to just chat
about these with my viewers so you guys
can get a closer look because in some
cases these palettes that I have are
like they're not what they appear to be
on websites where you may shop for these
things you know some of it's in a good
way some of it's in a bad way but I just
wanted to share the swatches with you
and in some shots I'm like showing
close-ups of the palettes and if I look
different or look like I have a
different makeup look on I do I did that
on a different day and time and babies
just didn't allow that video to get shot
that day so I'm finishing up today but
everything I have to talk about here is
kind of random a little bit different
but I think this will be fun so the
first one I want to mention is the bare
essentials
palette it's from bare minerals bare
essentials so I kind of like to play on
words there was very sensual so it's
kind of like their whole you know
company name there but what this palette
is doing is packing itself full of warm
shades and kind of plummy purpley shades
and that's a combo I freaking love and I
think the bare minerals shadows are
great I really enjoy different duo's and
quads that I have and this palette I've
got to say I've been more impressed by
this palette than probably any special
edition type of palette that they've put
out it's a really nice mix and it's not
what it seems because you take a glance
at it and you're like okay a bunch of
light shades and in so many palettes
it's like the first few light colors
that they put in a lot of times say
all end up looking the same it's kind of
like what was the point in giving us
this many shades of this general tone
but everything here is unique and a lot
of these light shades end up going on
deeper than what they appear I mean
you've got your absolute lightest ones
here at the end they look light and I
promise you those are light but as you
get just into this zone right here
there's some very interesting things
happening like indulge that's a really
great color and there's more depth and
more richness to these as you swatch
them and put them on your eyes so I love
to find that that's a happy surprise for
me with an eyeshadow palette and the
textures are really nice and varied as
well masks over on this end
Matt Matt some are really just kind of
walking the line with just a little bit
of Sheen like hot spell that kind of
performs like a matte but it's got just
a little satin finish some gorgeous
shimmers a couple of shades with a
little sparkle here including catalyst
and mystify catalyst is a little bit dry
to the touch but I find it still applies
fine on my eyes but I just love what
they chose to do with the palette as I
look back at my swatches I think wow
that top row so warm so surprisingly
coppery with shades like cloud9 right in
there in the center and then the bottom
row is plummy and beautiful and can give
you you know as deep of a plum smoky eye
as you could possibly want but you also
have some kind of light things almost
borderline pastel things to work with
there too and then the one at the very
end called upgrade very interesting
shade here my taupe lovers out there I
mean we're talking a mixture of taupe
and charcoal a taupe and charcoal had a
baby it would be that kind of color and
again the feel of these shades they just
have a really nice richness to them and
just a surprising amount of color payoff
to shades they even you know like Shazam
right over here indulge they look deeper
actually in use than they do in the
palette itself I went ahead and put
waltz on my lid I've got in the crease a
little bit hot spell a little bit of
catalyst in the crease also a little
ensemble which is a nice rich kind of
like mix of black and plum a little bit
of that in the crease and definitely
smudged on the lower lash line also and
I use
mystify somewhere in there as well I
can't remember where I put that but
that's the fun of palettes you know you
can bounce around do it however you want
I think it's really cool that you could
stay in like one color tone is known up
here with the top row and you know very
plummy and topi on the bottom or you can
mix them and they play so well together
when you mix shapes like cloud nine and
with this deeper color like ensemble or
something like that you can get some
really pretty looks so this is right up
my alley I'm very glad I got it and the
quality is just spectacular next thing I
got is from Tarte and this is the make
believe in yourself' says eye and cheek
palette so there is a highlighter in
here I wasn't sure actually that
highlighter at first was supposed to be
face highlight or just work with your
eye shadow look I think it can go either
way but this is kind of an unusually
colorful palette for tart because so
much of what they put out in terms of
eyeshadow palettes seems to be browns
and plums Browns and plums over and over
again in various formats and here they
really went bold with shimmer so there
is only one matte shade in here and it's
this color called myth and it's this
light kind of fun rosy nude brown type
of color and it is nice it's definitely
the kind of thing that many of us would
instinctively like put that crease brush
in there and just get that laid down in
the crease but really for me to be
satisfied with this palette as a
standalone palette I think it needs one
other dark matte shade just saying
because there's so much shimmer in here
and the shimmers are not just like kind
of shimmery some of them are absolutely
like wet looking there are colors like
crystal or pixie or you know dream they
feel like kind of standard shimmery
eyeshadows you know there's a nice
texture to them they're kind of buttery
and smooth but then going down this side
like magic and wings and this color down
here called Tran it's like those
actually feel almost creamy and they
don't necessarily pick up so well with
certain kinds of brushes like they can
pack onto your lid really nicely so much
of what's in this palette is like a pack
on your lid statement shimmer type of
shade but if you want
to kind of blend into the crease with
one of these or if you think you're
going to dip a pencil brush into one of
these and smudged on your lower lash
line I found that colors like magic here
where I was relying on it to be just a
little bit darker than the other thing I
had on my lid it didn't apply so well
with brushes that weren't just going to
absolutely pack it on like a flat brush
so I just feel like a lot of what I'm
talking about in this video is do you
like a standalone palette that can have
everything you need in it that you can
think I'm going to travel I'm going to
put one thing in my bag and that will be
all I need to create a full look if
that's your mindset that's what you want
some of these palettes that I talked
about this video won't be that
necessarily I don't think then some of
them like the bareMinerals palette that
I showed you
they've got absolutely everything you
need but different people value
different things and I feel kind of
ridiculous saying you know well maybe
they just need another you know dark
matte color well I've got unsweetened
dark matte colors here you know I
totally have what I need to finish this
palette but that all being said you this
is still going to have a hefty price tag
some people might want to thank you I'm
getting absolutely everything I need in
there but looking back at my swatches I
mean the shine on some of these shapes
is just absolutely intense it's nearly
full of shades that are intense pops for
the lid probably not going to be a
must-have palette for everyone but I
will say I like to see Tarte doing
something a little bit different with
their eyeshadow palettes because I feel
like so many of the things they put out
I shadow wise end up looking very
similar to one another and this color in
the center by the way I didn't really
focus on that too much a little chunky
you know it can be smoothed out a bit at
first and it can be a very intense
highlight so that will highlight crowd
that's probably not going to be one of
your faves but if you really want a
statement type thing on the cheeks that
actually kind of picks up the light in
different ways sometimes I feel like it
looks more golden sometimes it actually
looks a little bit peach and interesting
color and that can be eyeshadow or face
highlight next thing that I got and this
is not like a brand new palette but I
guess BH Cosmetics is new to Ulta and I
just went ahead and picked this up
because it just appeal to me for some
reason
I want to try this this is the wild
child palette and it's full of like
baked style eyeshadows but you guys know
why I wanted this if you're familiar
with my videos you probably are picking
up on what I like in this which is the
peachy colors and the plums love that
color combo and this was really
affordable and I thought let's just go
for it and in a lot of cases in in baked
type palate more often than not I end up
feeling like they're too dry and they're
just not that easy to work with they
take a lot of work to build up on the
eyes and these actually I wouldn't say
and they feel especially rich or creamy
to the touch but they're all very
consistently smooth there's kind of a
thinness to these shades but they're
still smooth and they're pretty true to
color and you could apply these wet and
get even more impact out of them so I
I'm aware of that method but even dry I
was actually really impressed with the
look and I watched these very closely
for staying power and I had an all-day
wear out of these being Center I
wondered about that but I kept a close
eye on them and they lasted really well
now I use Milani eyeshadow primer very
consistently very religiously under
pretty much any shadow and I do not have
staying power problems I just really
don't unless the products I'm putting on
is some kind of a cream consistency that
might be prone to creasing or just
something really unusual like that then
I might have issues but with powder
shadows generally speaking I put them on
top of that primer and I don't have
concerns anyway while the packaging is
this palette is kind of like cheap and
tacky looking and kind of like uh you
know it's what's in here it's actually a
very pretty
shadow spread you know you got your
neutrals you got a little bit of an
olivey like a golden olive in there that
I really like a couple of purpley plum
shades and I would just say I was
pleasantly surprised by this and talking
about standalone palettes you know
everything in here is shimmery but the
deeper shades can create enough contrast
for me to feel like I could wear this
alone and buy deeper shades I'm meaning
this purple and this deep kind of taupey
color up there
those seem to be good enough for me
actually in the crease so yeah I thought
that was a nice palette and I know it's
nothing brand-new but I just wanted to
talk about since it was new to me next
thing this is something you saw just
briefly in my husband does my voiceover
video I pulled out this lorac Pro I love
brunch palette it's just shot full of
pastels and I held off on buying this
for quite a while it wasn't grabbing me
it wasn't pulling me in and making me
feel like I needed this but curiosity
got the best of me and I decided to go
ahead and order it and what you got in
here are a lot of maps and anything that
shimmery is kind of like a soft shimmer
so nothing really what I would call
metallic and all of the shades unlike a
lot of lorac palettes where the shades
are literally like their names are what
they are everything in here is kind of
fun like gluten-free hot sauce pancakes
it really feels like kind of an Easter
egg type palette to me I mean they're
couple of kind of lilac purpley shades a
soft blue you've got a mint green there
are some peachy colors as well sorbet
might be the deepest shade actually in
here and so with this palette full of
South pastel shades you obviously don't
have a lot of things to create contrast
you may need to bring in another palette
to be a little bit of a buddy to this if
you want more darkness or you can just
use these colors for like a pastel wash
all over the lid let's say and just keep
it really simple like that which is
probably how this palette was designed
to be used and it does a softer color
palette and they probably created some
shades that maybe they just wanted to be
more subtle colors but I feel like
texture wise maybe these aren't quite as
soft and rich and pigmented as all the
shades you would run into in the lorac
pro 1 palette or the pro 2 or whatever
like jelly doughnut here for example
just to touch it it feels a little bit
more like thin and powdery compared to
some of the really like rich and creamy
mattes that I know this brand can make
how it actually made me think of another
palette that has some pastels my dose of
color ice cream palette I love this one
and I loved it because it gave me my
little taste
pastels but it also had all these great
deep tones to pair with it totally
standalone palette if you want it to be
this gave me just enough little pops of
color to keep it interesting you know
and I look at this one from lorac and I
think it's almost more than I need of
that kind of shade some people might
absolutely love exactly what's happening
in this palette but for me and I knew
this when I bought it and I'm just not
craving this many pastel colors and the
practical side of me says I'm probably
not going to do a full look that I'm
going to be really happy with with just
these shades I need a little more dark
brown I need a little more something in
there just you know just in the corners
a little bit over there I like when a
palette has at least the potential to do
a full look for me I have really been
loving the all Matt looks lately and my
last couple of palettes are all met and
this one is from the balm and it's their
meet Matt adore palette or said the way
it's probably supposed to be said meet
Matador and it says absolutely adorable
Noble vegan the meet Matt franchise from
the balm has been going on for a while
now they have like a little meet matte
palette I was the first thing that came
out and then they went with a bigger
style like this type of format for their
meet matte nude meet matrimony was this
kind of look except it had more of a
plummy and burgundy vibe in it and now
we've got this top part of the palette
very very basic with browns and kind of
peaches warm Browns and then down here
some really deep shapes that could act
like you know your contrast shadows but
also liners Matt Soto down here it's
hard to tell but that's a very dark
green this blue actually has a little
sheen to it I did a look with that on my
eyes and it can look very light
especially if you sort of pair it with a
lighter shade and overlap and Matt Lee I
would describe it like a near black like
a very dark charcoal I kind of wonder
you know has the whole meat mat thing
almost played itself out because in
terms of neutral matte palettes how far
do we need to go how much do we really
need and I felt like there were some
similarities from this palette to the
meet matrimony which might be my fave
of all the meat mats and I look at and I
think yeah they've given us some you
know medium colors some kind of peachy
light warm shades I absolutely love
their kind of pinky color in here that's
dark rusty burgundy a plum absolute dark
black a dark brown interesting taupe
with a hint of purple and I don't know I
find myself just loving what's in this
palette a little bit more not saying
this is a bad palette I don't know
unless maybe you're just a fierce
collector of the balm stuff you might
think you really want that but if you've
already got meet Matt and also meet
matrimony
this one I'm not feeling so like this is
an absolute month and I can't complain
quality wise or texture wise with these
I love working with shadows from the
balm I think their powder is just in
general be it blush or eye shadow are
really really good and I love just the
smoothness the evenness the very
perfected type of look I got on my eyes
using these top two rows the other day
but if you got a lot of their shadow
palettes in this matte family I just
this is not my favorite one that they've
done and then I'm going to wrap up this
video with a palette from hard candy and
this is something that I just found in
at Walmart and it's the look Pro matte
eyeshadow Pro palette so in here we're
getting 5-10-15
eyes shadows and it really kind of runs
the gamut in terms of match you've got
warm you've got cool you got a little
splash of purple a little bit of red in
there the value of this palette just
looks really good you know for what's in
here but I have spent so much time
lately playing with shadows from the
ball playing with my shadows for visi
are and just feeling and understanding
what really amazing matte shadows can do
and these are definitely down a notch
from that stuff you know down a notch in
terms of smoothness pigmentation the
ability for each shade to uniquely stand
out on my eyes I don't really see that
with this palette they kind of stand out
one from the next in swatches certain
ones but when I get them going and
shearing out on the eyes I don't
necessarily see like that every shade in
here it has a real purpose for being
here especially the light shades across
the top a lot of these you know we could
have just done with a couple of those
and been fine there's a little more
uniqueness happening among the shades in
the bottom two rows this palette can
give me looks that are okay looks that
are just fine really and if you don't
want too much pigmentation or if you
feel like sometimes you dip into
palettes and you're like whoa that was
way more than I need or you have trouble
controlling certain shades maybe this
would be a softer palette or a nice
palette for a beginner to start out with
I don't really want to knock this
palette because it's nice to see
something of this size and that's all
matte coming from the drugstore that's
kind of rare and unique but at the same
time I can't sit here and tell you that
it's every bit as good as you know the
quality of the shadows from the foam or
visi are time to really trying to say it
visi art because I know that's how to
say it now it's not visored like I said
I mean I've done a handful of looks with
this palette I feel like I'm pretty
aware of what it can do but I will
continue to play with this and my others
as well this video I didn't really
intend for it to be a full on palette
review but more so just kind of showing
you what's new to me showing you the
swatches and you know as always you
decide for yourself what you like what
you need but thank you guys so much for
taking time to be with me today for this
video I hope you enjoyed it and I hope
it was informative and I will see you
again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
