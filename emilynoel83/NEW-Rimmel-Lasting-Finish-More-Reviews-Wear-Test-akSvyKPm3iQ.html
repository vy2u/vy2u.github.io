me today I am so excited to do this
video in fact like I really had to keep
myself from hopping on here right away
you know the first day I was trying this
stuff on and do like a first impressions
video just cuz I needed to remind myself
that's not really the best information I
can give it's not the best I'm capable
of doing especially when it comes to a
foundation there's not just one method
of application for a foundation there's
not just one way to wear it in terms of
how you pair powder or primers with it
after playing with these things for
almost a week now I feel like I have a
lot more information a value to share
with you just a lot more confident in my
review you know you use something for a
while you're more likely to know what
you really think why am I so interested
in this well it's the Rimmel lasting
finish 25 hour breathable long wear
foundation so this is the new version of
Rimmel lasting finish which that's a
foundation like that is one of the very
few products that takes me back all the
way to the start of my channel when I
think about things that I loved and used
then it was the foundation that I
definitely used a lot on the air doing
news in my earliest days especially I
felt like it made my skin look good
number one and number two it lasted an
entire day and seemed to look fresh and
that was back when it was in a squeeze
tube then more recently they went to
putting it in a glass bottle with a red
cap and that's the thing that you saw me
use in that video where Bell chose my
makeup but now they've got it again in a
glass jar packaging but it's lasting
finish breathable it's described as long
wear foundation high definition finish
and medium coverage and I again have
this in 200 soft beige this comes in 16
shades and from what I remember at least
from what I saw displayed in my Walmart
store you know where they had the old
Rimmel lasting finish this seems to be
an expanded shade range granted 16
shades isn't gonna cover everybody
necessarily perfectly but from what I
remember just seeing it in the display
from the last time this is more but it
says it perfects your skin with medium
buildable coverage and has breathable
skin technology that doesn't clog pores
moisturizes for up to 25 hours now I'm
going to get into the foundation more in
a second as I apply it but I forgot we
have a primer here we had the lasting
finish breathable primer it says plus
eight hours makeup wear so reading
the back I guess what they mean by that
is that it extends your foundation wear
by up to eight hours while letting your
skin breathe they say it's ultra
lightweight this was just one of several
in the lineup of Rimmel primers I have
loved their fix and perfect primer and I
thought I haven't tried that in a while
I haven't tried a Rimmel primer in a
while period so I have this this is a
white looking primer and you smooth it
on your skin and it does feel actually
kind of hydrating it's not really one of
those silicone II like super silky
smooth primers but yet it is smoothing
if that makes sense I would say it
overall makes the feel of my skin just a
little softer like kind of once you've
given it a chance to dry a little bit
you feel some added softness some more
evenness and texture and some more
hydration so if you classify yourself as
super oily this may not be like the best
for you because it's just adding extra
hydration you know but I've got to
honestly say this I have worn the
foundation with and without this and I
have not noticed a difference in the
wear time it's more of like a helper in
terms of your skin's texture not so much
the way this wears I mean I really was
looking close at it and I just couldn't
tell a difference like I wanted to be
like oh yeah the primer that's making
the difference but I really didn't see
it so take it for what it is you know
it's a primer that's offering definitely
some hydration and I think as a result
of that a little added softness to the
overall texture of your skin now moving
on to the foundation and the application
here instead of just having a glass
bottle with an open top they do have
this big old doe foot or the buck flips
I like to call it in here and this I
don't love I would have just gone for a
squeeze tube you know that's the one way
that you can really ensure you're
getting everything out and plus with
this some people might have an issue of
the fact that they're dotting it on
their skin and then storing it down in
the bottle there a lot of foundations
are choosing to do it this way which
kind of surprises me but I'm going to go
ahead and dab this across the skin again
I'm wearing soft beige which is the same
shade I've always worn since way back in
the day and it is I think a good shade
match while being just a little bit on
the yellow side which I kind of don't
mind because especially early morning
hours when I wake up I can see that bit
of red
this in my skin and this is just yellowy
enough to I think really effectively
reversed that but the texture of this
reminds me a lot of the old Rimmel
lasting finish also the scent of it not
that it had like a super strong scent
before but I would say it had an
identifiable scent before and it still
has that same scent but it reminds me
texture wise of just you know a really
classic liquid foundation it's not too
liquidy it's not too thick at all but I
do feel like using a brush is the most
effective way to get the most coverage
out of this because I do think it's a
straight up medium coverage no more no
less honestly like it's just right there
in the middle if you're wondering what a
true medium coverage looks like I think
this is it to a tee even when I build up
I don't think it builds to a full
coverage at any point the other day I
was testing that claim and I added some
more you know in some little problem
areas where I thought I could use some
extra coverage like kind of right in
here and it really it may have added a
little more but it still wasn't like
moving mountains you know
so there's your one layer of this for
medium coverage I can still see like
freckles through there I can still even
see a little bit of like very pinpointed
redness but has a whole like just
looking over larger parts of my faces I
think is doing a lot of what the old
Rimmel lasting finish was doing I really
don't think it feels especially lighter
like you know you see that breathable on
there anything am I getting a totally
different foundation here and I feel
like the coverage is pretty much the
same and also just like the feel on the
skin this is a foundation that I think
normal to dry skin might enjoy the most
and I'll get into this more when we talk
staying power and stuff and I don't know
if maybe this is changes in my skin or
whatever but that wouldn't make a whole
lot of sense since I'm generally getting
on the spectrum of like oily - super dry
I'm walking a little closer to dry all
the time but this seems a little more
hydrating than I remember like going
through the entire day and just kind of
feeling my skin I'm thinking you know I
don't feel dried out at all I feel like
there's plenty of moisture going on here
even when I didn't use that primer and
that might be why you know the original
version was something my mom enjoyed
using too
it was something that managed to stay on
the skin and we're pretty well but it
didn't like like suck the life out of
your skin you know it still offered
moisture all day so normal to dry skin
may want to keep your eyes on this now
we're gonna move on talk about this
lasting finish breathable concealer I
got this in the shade fair and this says
lightweight medium coverage concealer so
they're coming right out saying this is
only a medium coverage concealer which
sometimes I feel like do I want to waste
my time but some lightweight concealers
like the Loreal Pro glow for example
have done really well for me now by the
way when I first opened this I could not
get it open I had to pry the little top
off there with some scissors it took me
forever but I finally got it open and
then we've got this little cushion top
here a Milani not too long ago released
a concealer with this very same top and
when I squeezed it out the first time I
thought okay I don't feel like there's
too much in there and then the second
day that I used it guys I practically
felt like I was squeezing you know when
you get to the end of your toothpaste
tube and you're squeezing for dear life
to get any out it was almost like that
and it was my second day of using this I
thought what's going on here it's like
you shouldn't be squeezing your tube
this much on one of your first weeks of
application and feeling like you've
really got like you're pushing through
some sort of an air bubble to get
anything out I honestly feel kind of
ripped off by that
and speaking of value this is a pretty
good value this is a less than $10
foundation in fact I think I spent maybe
around $7 for it at Walmart this
concealer guys I mean it is a medium
coverage concealer it's somewhat
brightening I guess because I did buy it
in a shade that would perform that way
for me but every time I squeeze it out
it's like I've got to work it up from
the bottom already you know it hasn't
gotten that much use yet I'm gonna use
my flat foundation brush to blend this
out and you'll see what I'm talking
about here it's brightening enough but I
just I don't feel like they packed
enough product in the tube it just feels
a really strange that I had to work that
hard to get anything out and it's fairly
new
kind of like using a flat foundation
brush sometimes to blend out concealer
because I feel like I couldn't really
get it right up there to my lower lash
line I got a question on Twitter the
other day why do you do concealer after
foundation or why you do correctors also
after foundation and that's because
foundation always handles some level of
coverage and so when you put your
foundation on first I feel like then I'm
able to see okay how much did the
foundation do now how much work is left
you know and it can keep you from maybe
using as much concealer because you can
assess like how much your foundation did
beforehand so that's my logic and doing
foundation before concealer but here's
what we've got a decent amount of
brightness it doesn't look too heavy I
can still see a dark circle through
there because like we didn't really
correct but I'm like I'm seriously upset
at this I'm mad at this product for the
fact that I have to squeeze this thing
things so hard and I feel like it's
about out I did blend this out with a
Beauty Blender the other day both
products actually the foundation and the
concealer and you can definitely achieve
more coverage if you go with the brush
so now the primer the foundation and the
concealer these are the three lasting
finished breathable products that I
found that I picked up so this is the
look you're getting when you're using
those three there are a couple of other
like kind of bonus products that I
wanted to throw into this review because
I thought you know if you're seeing
those things in the lineup you might see
these this I think has been out for a
little while and I just hadn't laid my
hands on it yet but it's the instant
conceal and contour and I have it in
light and so here you're getting what
they call a highlight shade a concealer
shade in a contour type color and these
I do feel add quite a bit more coverage
I can take the shade that they intend to
be a concealer and dab it over this area
and the texture is really nice to
actually it's got a real nice creaminess
to it it does pack in some coverage so I
put that shade there and then I just
continue outward with this highlighter
color it's a little more brightening and
yeah if I were going to choose between
the two concealer options I would
definitely choose this one because it's
creamy yet not too heavy
this since I've already kind of brighten
this area I'm not gonna do a turn here
but you can see where it would be pretty
brightening to use that highlight shape
in different spots and then I can take
my brush in here blend this out granted
I already had a layer of concealer on
but just so you can see even when I've
used it on its own this product packs in
more coverage part of it I think is
about tone part of it's about texture
but you know I can come away feeling
pretty alright about the way I look on
the under eye area there now this
contour thing I'm just gonna go ahead
and show you that I like to stick a
brush a synthetic sort of domed type
brush Real Techniques has a great
contour brush that's like this exact
same size but I just had the Tarte one
handy here so I just a dip into a little
bit of that just following that little
area where you might kind of start to
see a bit of a shadow and I do find this
shade to be rather orangie it's just
pretty darn warm as you see that going
on there before it gets blended don't
you think it blends easily it does not
set immediately but it strikes me more
as like a cream bronzer type thing which
is probably why I'm finding it to make a
lot more sense like when I put it on
around my hairline up in here it just
looks a little more right yes because I
just often times will put more of a
sunny kind of bronzer a shade up there I
just wanted to show you the addition of
that product and also the last new thing
that I wanted to try is this Rimmel stay
matte mattifying loose powder so this is
in the shade transparent they just had
this one there and I thought maybe just
maybe this could be a good thing for
baking so that's what I'm gonna do it's
kind of like the same color as the fair
option of the Maybelline fit me loose
powder and I'm just dipping into that
with my Real Techniques sponge and just
dabbing this all along my under eye area
the idea with baking is that you're
gonna put it on there kind of thick and
let it sit and it's gonna just create
this really smooth texture out of your
under eye area and you know I do have
some fine lines in that area I can't
speak for everyone to say like this is
the best method for concealer because
some people are gonna try it and maybe
it's just not gonna work at all but for
me I generally come away from this
feeling like my under eye area looks
smoother
and I actually see less of a line thing
happening I may not feel that way for
the entire rest of my life but for right
now it's really working for me and I
feel like it adds coverage it adds just
this level of flawlessness to that area
and I also kind of like to put this when
it's a really brightening powder shade
like this I like to put it in other
areas that I like to brighten like the
nasolabial folds is that what they're
called the chin and whatever and then
while that sits I'll do my brows and
I'll come back when I go to dust this
away so now my brows are done and I'm
just going to just sort of gently I use
this sort of sweeping motion here and
sort of easily dusts away some of that
powder obviously some powder is you know
hanging on here to the skin but there's
some of the excess that can kind of be
blown away here now considering the fact
that if I really wanted the best
coverage on my under eye area and to
really cover the circles best I would
have used a corrector but I'm trying to
show you these products and these
products alone I do feel like that
powder added a little bit of evenness
and it definitely made the texture super
nice and smooth and here's the thing on
the days that I use this powder or did
not use this powder I noticed a huge
difference in the staying power so there
were times where I only baked and then I
wanted to assess you know how did the
foundation do all over my skin and I
wouldn't say it's that the foundation
disappeared or anything because there
really wasn't like an absence of
foundation on my skin but I was noticing
more shine and just a little more like
look of doing this if you will and when
I didn't have this all over my face and
even when I do put this all over it's
not like I'm a flat matte as a pancake
or no it's flat as a pancake not matte
but it just doesn't have that feel about
it that feel like gosh if I touch my
hand to my skin it's feeling so dewy I
could practically pull product off when
I said it you know it feels more locked
in and it just doesn't have that semi
creamy on the surface of the skin
feeling this is not groundbreaking
information here this is just what
generally happens when you set a
foundation versus when you don't and
when it's a foundation that goes a
little bit more
the moisturizing hydrating side it
really makes a difference that you can
feel so that is my foundation face look
all completely set now this is the
circumstance in which I feel like I have
the best staying power that will take me
all day no part of this seems to fade
from my skin yet it still feels like
hydrated even touching my skin now that
I've lightly powdered it doesn't have a
dry texture if you'll smooth and soft
and still just like healthy yes so I'm
gonna go ahead and finish my face of
makeup and I'll join you with some more
thoughts and then later on we'll do a
wear test check so this is the finished
look once I've added my little bit of
bronzer some blush some highlight lip
color eye shadow I guess I'll share in
case you were wondering on my face I'm
wearing this becca lightwaves palette
and I've got this on as my blush the
center shade some of this is my
highlight and a little bit of this color
too in a few places but I love that
palette I am experimenting with a bunch
of different palettes from shop hush
that website that's doing all like the
dupe palettes and just really affordable
stuff and I got this metals palette and
I don't know that this is necessarily
like a dupe for anything it just looked
interesting to me so I've got that on my
eyes and some of the rusty shades and a
few of the plums as well and then on my
lips I'm wearing this Lancome gloss
number 272 it's kind of a warm like rosy
shade with a little bit of shimmer in it
some of these shimmery glosses are like
changing my life but yeah overall
thoughts on the Rimmel stuff I'm not
finding this foundation to be really all
that different from the original it
seems to be that kind of foundation that
is going to wear a decently long time
like it gets me through an entire day
still feeling like it holds up but yet
it doesn't feel mask like on my skin
because I think it is a little bit
hydrating and I think this can
contribute to the hydration the primer
but I don't think it's a must-have it's
a nice enough primer but I don't feel
like this really tips the scales in
terms of making it wear an extra eight
hours like it's gonna do that I
questioned that the concealer I'm just
mad like I this I was really having to
work hard to squeeze product out of it
on the second day I used it I feel like
this is a tube packed full of air
honestly and I think they need to do
better the product itself like it's not
too thick it
does brighten it claims to be medium
coverage and I feel that that's exactly
what it is if you've got a super dark
circle if you've got a really big like
problem spot on your skin to cover up
you may want to seek out something
that's more coverage but I would just
seek out something different in general
because I don't think this is a great
value if other people are experiencing
this as well where you just feel like
the tube is not full this little
concealer palette actually I thought was
a lot better coverage and a really nice
creamy texture I'm not wild about the
contour shade that's in there but if
we're saying which concealer is best
this one definitely good texture and
good coverage but my little disclaimer
as always if you've got really dark
circles you're going to be better off
using a correct or a peachy tone
corrector possibly paired with a
concealer like this if you want to do
that stay matte powder really I think a
fantastic powder I think I definitely
discovered another great drugstore
option here because that has been
changing the way the foundation feels
like I can start to look a little oily
around my nose and my forehead but
having this on and putting it on all
over it does make a difference in that
and everything just looks a little more
even as I wear throughout the day and
I'll be doing a wear test so you can see
like on this day what it's doing too but
it's done great on the under eyes as
well like for baking everything feels
really smooth as I look at that area
even later in the day it doesn't look
overly dried out so I'm really proud of
this powder I gotta say so thank you so
much for watching and I will talk to you
later
bosses no touch-ups after almost eight
hours and I do feel like things are
still looking pretty good overall you
know I feel like the under eye area is
looking really nice just the feel of the
skin having put the stay matte powder
everywhere I think that does help it
actually feels quite nourished but to
the touch it doesn't feel tacky so
that's kind of a cool thing
even around the nose that's a prime
place for me to look to see where from a
product and everything still looks
pretty even I'm not seeing a big
splotchy we're down now in the times
when I've worn the foundation and
haven't set all over with the stay matte
powder that's when I've had visible
oiliness on the skin but I still am
pretty proud of the foundation and I
think it's wearing a lot like I remember
Rimmel lasting finish just original
versions to wear on me after twelve
hours we are now looking at the face and
I don't
think it really looks that bad if I
really look up close I can see like just
a little breakdown around the nose area
but overall things are really hanging in
there I do think the loose powder is a
huge factor in this although even when I
haven't used it you know the foundation
has still been there but I've just been
a little more dewy so that's all guys
I'll talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
