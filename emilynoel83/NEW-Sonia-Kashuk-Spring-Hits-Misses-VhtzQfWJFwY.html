dressed kind of exotic and my leopard
print because I'm very inspired by this
collection we're talking about
don't drop the terrain don't drop the
treasure here are the new items from
Sonia Kashuk it includes the tray
actually and some different makeup items
some brushes really brightly colored
beautiful stuff I mean I just love the
whole aesthetic of what's happening with
her new collections in fact in order to
review this stuff I've had to mentally
like take myself away from how pretty
the products are and really think about
whether or not they truly work Sonia
Kashuk is a line sold at Target if
you're interested in any other videos on
this line I will link to them below not
all that long ago I did sort of a brand
guide video where I outlined a lot of
the different hits and misses for now
this is focusing on some of the new
spring and summer stuff and it's
actually a couple of collections the
Sahara sunset collection includes a lot
of new makeup products really like warm
glowy hot looking makeup stuff and then
there's the art of beauty collection
which the things that I've been trying
it includes like more accessory type
items some brushes and in this video
it's kind of a sampling of new things
that have been sent to me to try but
there are more things that go beyond
this that you'll probably be coming
across in stores as well okay I need to
get this tray off my lap or I'm going to
spill it I first want to talk a little
bit about my look today because I've
incorporated some of the Sahara sunset
stuff and as you can see it's a very
monochromatic look going on with the
coral in the eyes on the cheeks and on
the lips and I'm definitely a fan of it
but one thing I wasn't loving so much is
this bronzing blush stick in Marrakesh
and this is one of those really jumbo
stick type things Sonia Kashuk came out
with like contouring stick in this kind
of format not too long ago but this as
you can see is kind of a glowy bronzy
look and see from the swatch here
there's a lot of glow to that product
but I'm not a huge fan of the texture I
actually found it a little bit difficult
to blend out because this is the kind of
thing I'm going to be taking on top of a
foundation most likely or a BB cream or
some sort of base type product and to
draw
directly onto the skin and then blend it
out with your fingers I think is kind of
difficult I have to press too hard and
even it was a little difficult for the
elf small stipple brush to blend out so
while it does have kind of a pretty
Sheen I would have preferred the texture
to be maybe a little more of a cream to
powder style product kind of like those
Maybelline master glaze blush sticks
those are a great great formula to work
with because if you're going on top of
anything they'd only require the
lightest touch to blend them out so this
took a little too much and it was just
kind of average for appearance something
I've really really enjoyed is this
arabian dream sahara sunset highlighter
and it's gorgeous packaging i love the
black and the gold very exotic looking
and then this is the highlight inside i
mean we're working with corals peach
golden e-type tones in there as well and
it creates such a beautiful peachy
golden blush that's the thing it's
called a highlighter but for me this
completely performs as a blush because
there's just so much peach in it i think
if you've got light skin medium skin
it's definitely going to be like a blush
on you so the color you're seeing on my
cheeks and the glow on my cheeks is
coming from this and i just kind of
dabbed a blush brush across all of it
there's no need to dig in or really do a
lot of swirling back and forth because
you're just gonna kick up a lot of
powder but just dab across the different
parts and then sweep it on and this is
the kind of look you get so i really
like that while there is a separate
eyeshadow palette i think in this whole
collection this is not labelled as an
eye palette but i used it like one today
if you wanted you know a little quick
tip on how to pull that off I took a
matte Brown in my crease this is from I
got this from Sally Beauty Supply it's
the real color singled out I shadow in I
like it a lot a and I put that right in
the crease and also smudged it down
below I put this peach right on the lid
gorgeous peach love that and then I
blended just above the crease with this
orange e shade and that's coming from
the outer edges of this palette so
that's what's giving me this really
really warm
I look corals and peaches and stuff on
the eyes or the cheeks are not
everyone's
but I really really like that and I'm so
glad I have it my most loved thing of
anything I'm going to talk about in this
video is the new shine Luck shear I'm so
glad that came out with another one
there's actually two of them new to this
collection and I have the one in Eden
and the packaging again beautiful love
the black the gold these lip colors are
like a hybrid lipstick and lip gloss
they don't feel sticky or goopy like a
lip gloss might on your lips some feel
that way it feels like a lipstick but
it's just got a tremendous amount of
shine I see myself wearing this so much
during the spring and summer and don't
be afraid to pair this with a red lip
liner it actually gives really nice
definition to a quarrel a shade like
this so I'm wearing my Milani color
statement lip liner in true red just
lightly you know I didn't lay it on
thick or anything but it just gave a
nice kind of finishing touch to this
type of shade now some of this really
fun colorful stuff and there are some
new nail polishes and good Lord do I
need a manicure I really need to do my
nails I actually haven't ever used any
Sonia Kashuk nail polishes before so I
can't really talk about the longevity or
how they go on how they apply drying
time or anything like that but I just
wanted to show these to you if you were
interested and maybe once I do actually
get one of these on my nails I can
follow up and let you know how it went
but this is pika blue this is a really
beautiful classic just royal blue shade
so wouldn't it be a fun toe color and
none of these have any sparkle or
shimmer in them but this pink is called
show me love then there's this radiant
orchid type shade called a violet I love
how it kind of fuses the worlds of pink
and purple together love that kind of
 in the art of beauty collection
there are some more kind of accessory
type items one of them is this vanity
tray look how artsy and fun this is I
like the black and gold accents so
you've got black down the sides and gold
across the top and bottom and this
artwork is by Linda Mason who
leave and what I was reading is kind of
a mentor to Sonia Kashuk in some phase
of her career so well I do like this tre
I think it's going to be something very
easy to wipe up some spills you know
it'd be good to maybe either have down
here or I might put it back here I'm
gonna do some rearranging back here as
the seasons change but I really don't
see it as a must-have for every person
and this may fit some people's color
schemes like my color scheme in this
room really works nicely in here but
it's not gonna be something that works
for just everybody so I don't know just
a heads up what I'm really loving in
this collection is actually the storage
cup here look how it's got the gold rim
it's got the lips it's very abstract
looking and I think it's gonna be
beautiful in this room I really was
needing another cup to store some
brushes I had bought the Sonia Kashuk
15th anniversary brush set and that
actually all fits in here along with
some of these new brushes I'm going to
be talking about and I just I love the
appearance of this now to talk about
this brush set this is one of several
new brush sets that are coming out and
this is the ABC set the brushes are
actually labeled a4 accentuate b4 blend
and c4 contour oops
which handily and these are the blue
brushes and they look so vibrant and fun
I mean like who has bright green makeup
brushes right it's just a really unique
touch to your whole collection my first
question with these was when I wash
these is the color going to bleed from
these brushes and it actually did not I
didn't notice any bleeding from the dye
on any of these what I did notice when I
watched was quite a bit of shedding from
the purpley ones and also quite a bit
from this big green one granted this has
a lot to lose it's a pretty big full
brush that even as I run my finger
through it here I'm still noticing a
little bit of shedding so once we get
past the fact that these are gorgeous
brushes love the gold love the white
again a fun pop in my particular room
here and I'm really kind of split on
this collection there are three brushes
that I really like and three that I
could do without and honestly these I
have a
their brushes that do what these do in
my collection already so while I like
them it's not really a must-have thanks
contour brush cut flat and kind of
angled this is actually pretty decent
for applying foundation you could use it
to contour as well it can do some
circular motion buffing it's very soft
as are all of the brushes in this
collection but I definitely don't like
it better than that up-and-up complexion
brush that I mentioned recently in my
last video it's one of the better
brushes I think in this collection but
it's not blowing my mind compared to
other things that I have also there's
this accentuate brush and this is
actually a duo fiber brush bristles
actually get really light and wispy
toward the ends and I actually have
enjoyed using this to blend out large
swaths of concealer or you know
highlight here on top of the cheekbones
it really does well with cream product
and not over blending so I do like that
dress also I like this blend brush this
is a nice size for a buffing type
concealer brush so getting right in here
sides of the nose anywhere around the
face really that you want to blend out
your concealer this does a good job of
that but again it's one of those
situations where it's nice for this set
but it's not necessarily better than
everything else I have and then you've
got these three brushes first off this
big old powder brush I mean I feel like
this should be great for something but I
just haven't figured out what yet
because when I put powder on top of
foundation to set it I really anymore
try to use a very light dusting of it
not throw too much on my face and with
this this is a very dense brush and so I
feel like it can apply a lot of product
at one time and also it's kind of stiff
it doesn't have quite as much spread to
it as I would like for just a light
application like I can get with my ELF
studio complexion brush I mean that just
glides over the face really really
lightly this I see it almost more as
something you might use to buff in a
powder foundation because on top of an
existing liquid foundation I think it
kind of interferes you know with what
you've got going on there oh I forgot
one other way I had used this was for
contouring you know a little bit in the
cheekbones and around the hairline and
it does
right there it's not going to be as
precise and as targeted as some other
brushes might give you this brush that
says contour this is just like the baby
version of the larger blue brush I can
see people may be using this wedging
this into the crease it's cut blunt
which I don't love in AI brushes but
maybe somebody might use this
I don't know down the sides of the nose
as a contour brush I really just haven't
found a great purpose for that also
really just don't even like this
accentuate brush this small one because
it's again a duo fiber brush if it
weren't that way I think it would be
able to grab a hold of some product
better and really apply it nicely to
your crease I really just can't get into
this style of brush for the eyes I've
had another one I think from Real
Techniques that was a duo fiber I brush
and it just can't pick up enough product
and you know when you go to put it on
it's like where did everything go
because the bristles is just the nature
of the brush there so kind of spread out
and wispy towards the ends it just can't
lay down the product like you want it to
is this a great brush collection just to
look at yes I think it's gorgeous it's
super fun I like that the colors didn't
bleed on me when I washed them but is it
a must-have just in terms of
practicality and functional brushes and
being better than all these other
different brush sets that I have I
really don't think it is now this is not
the only brush set in the new Sonia
Kashuk lineup I know there's one you
know different set of brushes they're
hot pink those look kind of cool but for
this particular set I don't think it's a
must-have run out and buy it type thing
and the last little thing that I got
here that I wanted to mention is this
little makeup bag and I really like how
Sonia Kashuk does this totally different
front and back here and also there are
two zippers and the zippers keep your
stuff separate actually so it's kind of
like here's your pouch on top here's
your pouch on the bottom and they can
stay separate I just love the bright
pops of color here don't be surprised if
you see this hanging out in the
background behind my videos because I
think it brings a lot of fun life and
energy to you know my light pink wall
Sonia Kashuk just has some great makeup
bags from her larger ones to these
smaller sizes I mean that's a great
thing to check out from this line so to
bottom line this whole video
for you to sum it up my favorite parts
of what's happening new for Sonia Kashuk
love the new shine Lux sheer and even
really enjoying this peachy blush
palette really operates as a blush for
me again it says illuminator highlighter
but I think it's definitely a blush also
the super fun cup for brush storage
great for some overflow brushes I think
it's just whimsical it's gonna add a
nice little touch to the room and also
love the makeup bag so thank you guys so
much for watching I hope this was useful
to you and I'll see you again next time
