admit I've had better video shooting
experiences than this morning because I
just got into my camera and I was
deleting some clips from other videos to
make a little more free memory card and
guess what I deleted the one that I just
set here and shot so we're doing it
again on the bright side of things I bet
I'll have like a bunch more valuable
insight we're talking about a two-in-one
review for this video here new concealer
new palette from Tarte now there's also
that new like fairy dust situation the
new palette and if you saw in the
unboxing but opened up that big like
sparkly package if you're interested in
that collection let me know because I
think that might be a whole separate
video but for now I thought I'd discuss
this palette this Aspen overed
collaboration palette here that I hadn't
yet discussed it's a combo palette it's
not like a blush highlight and some eye
colors and then this guy they've brought
back the creaseless concealer not that
it was ever really taken away but
they've repackaged it so this is the
Marc huija creaseless concealer now
packaged with a doe foot applicator you
know the wand and everything I've been
playing around with both of these
products and I felt like I was ready to
you know share a review with you and a
demo as well so this concealer $26 now
at Sephora and the big thing about it is
they've released it in 30 shades like in
the PR package that was sent to me they
had three of these full sizes and then a
full spectrum of minis showing their
shade range it's described as a vegan
full coverage creamy skincare concealer
now with the 30 shades again and they
say it's the same formula you love but
in new packaging so do you remember the
little tube that used to be in it's been
a long time since I've used that product
so I thought this might be a good time
to reappraise concealer completely
covers dark circles hyper pigmentation
redness pimples and tattoos they say
it's a waterproof formula it does have
the maracuja in it which is rich in
vitamin C and so that's generally good
for brightening firming and smoothing
now even though they say you can use it
on all those different problem areas it
is called creaseless under-eye concealer
that's the title and it came in the
package with a special brush and in the
how to use section of the website you
can see that they advise using this
brush with it
it's very interesting that this brush is
in here I don't think I would have
thought to use this style of a brush
with this product but I must admit it
does work pretty well there's one small
issue I have with the brush but we'll
get there but they say use less than you
think you need a little goes a long way
and I hope the entire YouTube community
that slathered on shape tape is hearing
that
for best results pair with tarts
creaseless concealer brush like I said
for dark circles apply three dots to the
inner half of the under eye area
focusing on where the darkness is then
blend outward if you're covering a
blemish use your finger to dot concealer
onto the blemish or for redness apply
directly to the redness and blend
outward so I do not have any of this on
yet what I do have on my skin is just a
light coverage product here this is the
Velvet Matte skin tint from NARS sort of
a rediscovered thing in my collection I
wear Alaska light too I wish all
coverage products were named after
States that's kind of fun and then
Neutrogena skin clearing concealer I put
this around my little breakout zone here
because I didn't really want to put this
on there I know this is a very rich
concealer and I'm just trying to like a
hold balance situation I'm trying to
keep it from becoming more of a
situation that's the concealer with the
salicylic acid in it so with that light
coverage I am left with some under-eye
that I can conceal and also some of my
melasma here and I can show you what
this does for it I have the concealer in
20 in light and if you haven't tried
this yet I should probably point out how
is this different from shape tape
because shape tape is a much-loved
concealer it's very full coverage it's
got that doe foot applicator but there's
a real difference in that that is more
liquidy and this is more rich and creamy
there's a much more emollient quality to
this concealer I see why they're calling
it an under-eye concealer in the title
because it's very under-eye friendly I
think it actually gives a lot of
moisture back to that area whereas with
the shape tape I feel like well it's
great coverage I have to take maybe a
few extra precautions so with that like
make sure you've got a good you know I
cream underneath everything and only use
the minimal amount of product otherwise
there's sort of a dry down that happens
to that concealer and for some people I
think they've found that it's too drying
on the under-eye this is gonna feel
almost dewy right after you apply it and
it really
it's kind of stay that way I would say
it becomes a bit more one with the skin
after like maybe an hour of wear you can
tell it's not quite as tacky as it was
right after application but it just has
a really really creamy quality to it and
the other day when I was wearing it I
didn't set it and I actually thought it
lasted quite well even though in my mind
I was kind of concerned like you I can
kind of feel my concealer I don't want
to lift it off or like have it come off
on something but I think the
apprehensions were only in my head
because it lasted fine today I am gonna
lightly set the product just to see what
it does under that kind of circumstance
because I know a lot of people do like
to at least set their concealer somewhat
and this is a very very creamy one so
you got your doe foot applicator I'm
gonna do what they say and give myself
three dots there and then I'm also going
to cater to a little bit of
discoloration right out here the melasma
and then I will use the brush which like
I said I wouldn't have necessarily
chosen this kind of brush I wouldn't
have thought oh that's gonna be perfect
but I do feel it works really well and
here's why I think it maintains a lot of
coverage with this product it doesn't
move it around too much like at least
the way I'm using it you know I'm just
kind of dabbing over where the product
is and maybe giving it just a gentle tug
in the direction I want it to go and I'm
not over blending I'm not buffing in I'm
just kind of pressing and maybe giving
it just the slightest bit of pull and as
a result I feel like I've got fantastic
coverage there yes I know there's
another dot that would be the little bit
of a flaw to this brush at least for my
bone structure here it doesn't quite
make it to the innermost corner backup
brush where are you here's the Sigma p84
coming in saying I got you and we're
just gonna go right here and a little
does go a long way with this product I
can confirm I feel like this color is
just perfect my whole area here seems
you really brightened up but not like
fake bright you know it just seems like
okay that looks nice on the skin I
really feel like that looks fantastic
actually very full coverage and this is
a product I'm kind of kicking myself
because this is a product
used before I've used it plenty of times
in the two but I didn't have my specific
skin concerns at that time like I don't
think I was trying to cover any melasma
with it and I probably didn't have kids
at that time so my circles likely
weren't nearly as dark I thought I had
dark circles and then I had babies let's
just press give it a little spread but
I'm just not really like pulling hard
across the skin and I think that's
what's making it still have such good
coverage now I'll turn myself a little
bit hopefully so you can see what's
happening right there on the side
I mean I'm like I'm really impressed
I even kind of managed to get right in
there to the innermost corner with that
brush this time I feel brightened I feel
perfected
I don't feel dried out at all like I
said to touch it you just feel this
little bit of tackiness and it did last
well on me the other day with no issues
but I'm gonna give it a light bit of
setting powder today and we're just
gonna try it under that circumstance so
I'm gonna grab my Maybelline fit me in
fair got my ELF small taper to brush
just a little bit like the brush barely
has any on it
I'm also gonna hit my t-zone as well
with a little powder a little more
probably than I'm even putting on the
under-eye just to help the makeup last
today I am getting a crown replace today
not my princess crown but my tooth crown
I got in a crown months ago and then
when I went back for just a regular
dentist checkup they were looking at it
on an x-ray and they're like oh that
doesn't something about that doesn't
look right they're redoing it it no cost
to me normally they make the crowns
in-house at this time they took the mold
or whatever and then they sent away for
it to be done somewhere else there's the
story nobody expected to hear in this
video or needed to hear so I'm all set
at the point of me telling you the
dentist story was the fact that I know
I'm probably gonna have some sort of
like big massive pair of glasses on okay
this is gonna probably set right here on
my face and I'm still gonna hold it to
this staying power check-in so we'll see
how it does after that and just as the
day goes on right now guys I'm gonna go
ahead and do my brows I'll put on a
little eyeprimer and we can jump in then
to part two which is the Aspen palette
I'm back I put on some bronzers and it
cosmetics bye bye pours bronzer actually
in the shade beech and it does smell
kind of coconutty but that worked well
I've got that on just kind of right in
there around the hairline I used some
eye primer this Tarte shape tape eye
primer stick I've used this before but I
don't think I ever really like used it
enough to get a good feel for it and
then I've also got my wet and wild
ultimate brow highlight in the lower
inner rim and my ELF instant lift brow
pencil isn't my brows but now here is
this palette and it's very shiny it's
the Aspen over I think I hope I'm saying
her last name right didn't realize how
hard this would be the show but
hopefully you can get a good sense there
without too much glare that we've got a
kind of neutral a little bit rosy blush
there a highlight and then these nine
eyeshadows that are in a very very just
neutral classic color scheme nothing's
going to terribly dark nothing's going
super warm either I feel like we have
kind of a warm shade here and this shade
in the middle not sure if you can tell
it looks a little Toki just to glance at
it but sort of a rose gold but we're not
seeing any like real flashy orangie
warmth in this pal
so I think just the general neutral
lover that's who this is gonna go for
I'm gonna start with the little blush
here and this is a matte blush I really
like the color although you have to be
kind of careful picking it up because it
doesn't take a lot but look at that just
kind of soft flush it's giving the
cheeks it's an interesting mix of like a
little peach a little pink
but yet very muted and it just doesn't
go too far on either end of that
spectrum I do think it's a really pretty
color and a good choice to go in a
palette like this then we'll use the
highlight this is called puresole and it
has just sort of a classic champagne II
highlight look it's not an all-out white
it's got just a little bit teeny bit of
gold any warmth in there but I wouldn't
call it like a real gold gold or
anything there's no real like sparkly
bits or anything like that in here and
it can be pretty pronounced if you want
it to be the interesting thing is there
you've got that color and then you've
also got two shimmers up here that could
easily be highlights also so I almost
think it's funny that a specific
highlight is included when the shadows
could do that too
now I'm not really familiar with Aspen
but I did go ahead and subscribe to her
channel since I was talking about her
palette I'm here so I've got the
highlighter everywhere tops of cheeks
Cupid's bow a little bit just kind of
appear on the forehead area but this is
really a beautifully made palette I love
the floral print there we've got kind of
rose gold everywhere else a good sized
mirror her name right down in here and
all these eyeshadows are a nice generous
size so you really latch on to one of
these and you decide you love it you
know you're gonna have a good amount I
mean it looks like the size of a
standard like Mac eyeshadow makeup geek
whatever I already have my primer on my
eyes and I'm gonna go in with a little
highschool sweetheart I'm gonna see if
this is one of those colors that
sometimes shades like that appear a
little deeper on the eye than you expect
and that's one of them yeah that's
giving me a little bit more in my crease
than I was expecting to get out of a
shade of that lightness
there's that nice kind of hint of
vanilla type scent to these eyeshadows
kind of like with the tartlet palettes
seems similar to that that color packed
much more of a punch than I was
expecting the other day I was playing
with tea time a little bit and that's
the shade that gives you quite a bit of
warmth now I don't know if anybody saw
that but I lightly tapped into this and
it kicked up quite a bit of Fallout and
I have noticed that with a lot of these
shades see I'm adding a little warmth to
the border so I think you really want to
be careful tapping off your excess with
these I mean I appreciate a shadow with
some softness but that's pretty soft I'm
gonna just blend out my edge there a bit
very easily blendable though
set up with this really nice super soft
crease and I think I'll go ahead and do
some highlight we'll do married life
that's the matte cream color right down
here
really nice sort of coverage to that
shadow I like to see a white that
actually you know doesn't just
completely shear out so I should point
out our shimmers in here we've got kind
of a soft satiny one here with
brilliance I mean it's got just a little
shine endless summer is more of a
metallic heart of gold is very metallic
also more that rose gold color and then
wanderlust down here is like a shimmery
bronze everything else shadow was this
one here here here and here those are
all matte I'm going to use a little bit
of heart of gold just right on my lid
and sometimes with colors like this it's
more effective to press and slightly
drag your brush than it is to just go
pat pat pat pat you just kind of realize
it as you go with certain shades
sometimes really metallic shades anymore
I feel like that's the most effective
way to make them stand out almost as
though you were swatching you know if
you're swatching on your skin you press
and you pull sometimes that's the more
effective way to apply to the lid I'm
just gonna get that color all over the
lid that's really pretty I feel like if
I just really moved my brush around too
much I'm gonna have some flakes cuz I
can see a few sort of falling but
overall it's a really nice tone
this shade is just a little bit of a
diva you've got to work with it just
right and you know I do have a primer on
there but this might even call for a
more like heavy-duty primer you really
help it stick well but I think that's
pretty on my lids then I want to try a
little bit of brilliance just with a
small brush and kind of take it right
around that inner corner I didn't show a
whole lot maybe let's scratch that and
do endless summer
endless summer seems to have a little
more gold to it just like catches the
light a little bit better I still think
that other shade is nice it's really
soft but it just went in a little pop
right there
now I think we need to use some of road
trip this is our darkest shade in the
palette and I want to show you like how
dark the look could go just so you're
aware so this I would identifies just a
medium neutral brown it's not super warm
and I'm gonna just get this going here
in the outer corner so you can just kind
of see what it's capable of basically
I think that's really pretty I think
that shade plays really well with the
other crease colors I had going and also
the rose gold but that's about your max
that kind of how dark it's going to look
this is my mua makeup academy 315 brush
by the way and I'm just find myself
doing little like circular motions with
this just get the color down where you
want it and then just sort of buff it
and I'm giving myself a little bit of a
lift here slightly upward and then I'm
kind of just going over it pulling that
color in a bit just help it blend with
everything and I may just go along the
outside a little bit too and then do I
want to go under the eye with anything I
think I will I would like to smudge a
little bit of wanderlust this right down
in here it seems like a really similar
tone to the other Brown here just a
shimmery take on it
so there's my eye shadow my chicken
highlight also from this palette I'm
gonna finish off the look with a little
eyeliner and mascara and find a lip
color then we'll chat about some overall
impressions on this alright everybody so
here is my finished eye look I've got on
mascara top and bottom and some liquid
liner across the upper lash line and I
think it's a pretty look I do feel like
the palette is good quality and some of
the shades you might find to be kind of
flaky I felt like the mattes especially
I mean just putting your brush in
there's a lot of powder you have to be
very aware of it I think or else some of
that fallout is going to become excess
like down your cheek I think you have to
be a little bit careful with heart of
gold right in the center as well but on
the whole I think it's a good quality
palette and I don't feel like any of the
shades are really lacking and
pigmentation I think the blush is really
beautiful and so is the highlighter well
I can do a pretty look with it I think
it just doesn't inspire much creativity
on my part you know there's nothing
really super different about it to some
people that might be a great thing if
you don't want you know they're really
warm end of the spectrum or especially
cool you just want like a lot of nice
middle-of-the-road neutral shades that's
what this is this would make a lot of
good work looks I think if you don't
ever like to go too dark that's
something to be aware of also because
your darkest shade is really I think
just a medium brown and that color
placed in my outer corner you know
that's about as dark as that's gonna go
solid quality product yes did you do a
pretty look for me today absolutely is
it gonna be the thing I want to reach
for all the time because I just feel so
excited to pick it up not necessarily
not that every palette you have has to
be that you know but I just feel like
these are shades you could probably find
in a lot of different places now with
the concealer and the concealer brush
I think the concealer did a great job
coverage wise actually on two different
concerns both the under eye darkness and
also melasma type in discoloration I
thought it did really really well I
thought the brush function very nicely
too I'm not saying everybody has to have
this brush but I do think a really dense
type of brush like if you have any of
those P whatever's from Sigma like the
p80 or the p80 for something that you
can kind of dab over the product and
gently pull it in the direction you want
it to go without feeling like you really
need to buff it in and search
emotions or anything like that I think
that's what maintains really beautiful
coverage with the product I hope this
review was helpful thank you so much for
watching and I'll talk to you again
later bye Oh also this is my lipstick
today I use my girl Han with the cap
this is the shade zero six that I have
on but it's the pick your cap type deal
on Sephora that I was a little you know
guilty about actually going for that but
it is a pretty color isn't it hey guys
my product has been on for about four
and a half hours yes I changed my shirt
dentist glam and whatnot but I do not
think my under eye looks dry in the
least even though I lightly said it I
can still kind of tell that there's just
a hint of texture there I mean I had
very little powder on my brush so that
doesn't really surprise me but I'm just
kind of letting you know where we stand
here I'm really pleased with the staying
power so far you can really see that
highlight poppin to here okay got my
crown that was quick quickest thing ever
it fit perfectly they didn't have to
really do any adjustments with it so I
did have some big glasses on for a bit
that came across my cheek but it looks
like my concealer is still hanging in
there I feel like I might be getting a
little oily perhaps a little sweaty
maybe around the nose my little blemish
concealer here it's that time of the
month Shelton from my chin it has now
been nearly 12 hours I'm really really
pleased with the concealer I don't
notice any dryness for sure also I'm not
seeing any just thickness of product or
build up in any way collecting in
certain areas patchiness it all looks
really even and fresh it just kind of
feels like skin and I don't feel like
the coverage has faded so I'm very
pleased with that as far as the
eyeshadow I think that shade that I put
on my lid when I look up really closely
I can see how it's kind of fallen down
under the eye just a little maybe I need
a bit more aggressive primer under that
one but as far as the rest of the shades
go it's doing pretty well maybe a little
fading from my darkest shade but overall
pretty good stuff but I just wanted to
give you that little update I've got a
child climbing the stairs unsupervised
so I'm gonna get to that
Peppa Pig oh no I love Peppa care right
wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle
I like your toes say bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
