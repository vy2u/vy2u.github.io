talking all about the latest release
from Tarte it is the tartlet in bloom
palette so this is the sequel to the
original tartlet palette so in this
video I'm going to be of course
reviewing this giving some comparisons
to that original palette and other
palettes that I think have a lot of
similarities and then I'll also be doing
a little tutorial as well with the look
that I'm wearing right now so let's jump
right in this palette has gorgeous outer
packaging I think Tarte tends to do a
really good job with their palettes when
you open it up you've got this mirror
here and it's the very same layout as
the original tartlet palette you've got
let's see 12 different shadows in here
but instead of these being all matte
they've actually thrown in three
shimmery shades it is all neutral as you
can see but there are definitely some
differences with the original you look
at them both I think you can tell the
colorful row in the original tartlet
palette is more on the Plum side and
with this new one the in bloom palette
what they've done is made it more of a
pinky mauve burgundy type thing top row
in the in bloom palette you know very
neutral if not kind of on the cool side
and then your center row has a really
shimmery bronze so there definitely are
opportunities to get some very warm
looks out of this palette as well
probably more so than with the original
tartlet now Tarte is doing a really
great job with their eyeshadows lately
particularly with these new palettes I
think they've got a really nice
pigmented matte texture the three
shimmery shades and here are really
strong as well and they're the kinds of
shiny shades that I think accent a matte
look really well you know that shimmery
taupe that's a great lid color same with
the bronze and then you've got that
light shimmery shade that can be a nice
pop around your inner corner so I think
they really strategically put in three
shiny pops that do really work and make
sense with these shades you can
absolutely do some fully matte looks
like you wouldn't have to work in the
three shimmers by any means because
you've still got matte highlights over
here and you've still got you know matte
mid-tone shades this row right down here
looking vertically is very interesting
because I think those shades appear to
be rather light as you look at them in
the past
but when you swatch them and when you
apply them on the eyes I feel like each
one of those comes off just a little bit
deeper which is interesting and I'm
happy with that because I think they
each make great soft crease shades
they're definitely not too light for
that as far as the dark shades here I
feel like these to come off very
similarly they're extremely close one is
like a near black it's not quite as
black as the black that's in the
original tartlet palette and then you've
got an extremely dark brown and they
just look very similar to use them I
mean you wouldn't see a lot of
difference on the eye but then this dark
kind of brownish brick red is a great
one to have in there and feel free to
bounce around use this palette however
you want but I think as with the
original you've got some clearly laid
out quads if you look horizontally so
you're cool quad a little bit warmer and
then you're sort of rosy burgundy look
here before I start pulling in a bunch
of different palettes and showing you
some comparisons I do want to say that I
think quality wise just looking at this
palette as a standalone option for
makeup I think this is a really great
neutral palette quality is good there's
good light and dark options the three
shimmery shades that they put in they
really fit with the color scheme that's
going on here
but for those of you who like
comparisons have already been buying a
buttload of palettes this holiday season
I do want to give you that I want to
tell you where the similarities lie with
a lot of the other things that have been
coming out recently first of all the Too
Faced stardust palette I have identified
six colors in here that I think are
pretty similar to what's happening in
the tartlet and bloom palette not saying
there are exact exact dupes but I mean
pretty darn similar as far as warm matte
neutrals go
Stardust definitely has that going on
what in bloom has that Stardust doesn't
have I would say would be the cool matte
shade it's just a wider selection of
mattes basically and then what Stardust
has the in bloom doesn't have would be
those few pops like the really pop and
gold shade the several purpley tone
colors so overall tartlet in bloom a
little more muted a bit more toned down
in a lot of ways but there definitely
are some shade similarities there so if
those are shades that you like and the
shades that you were interested in in
the in bloom palette and you all
have the Stardust palette that's why I
wanted to point that out to you now I
want to talk about what in my opinion is
the mother of all rose gold rosy
burgundy palettes and that is the lorac
unzipped not the gold but the original
one absolutely love this palette it has
a special place in my heart there are
great metallics in here and great matte
shades if you like rosy slightly pinky
tone shades bronze gold that's all in
here but then you've got deep colors
like dark brown medium brown mauve dark
burgundy bottom line of this comparison
I would say if the bottom row of in
bloom is what interests you most and you
really like those kinds of colors and
even more shimmer more glow more bronze
e-type things thrown in like kind of an
expansion also of the middle row the
lorac unzipped palette has you covered
in that arena and then some on what this
lacks would be the kinds of shades that
are in the top row up here see how
everything's a little more you know
gradute role and then I just really got
on a roll digging through my stash and I
pulled out my Too Faced natural matte
palette which I love this palette
two-faced has gotten so great with their
matte shades it's very simple you know
you got a very cool row up here this row
brings in a little bit of mom and then I
love these two very interesting warm
shades down here it's a very warm brown
and then kind of this golden e light tan
I love it and I think the top rows of
both of these palettes with those cool
shades have some similarities the
natural matte just kind of dips its toe
into the rosy vibe because you're not
getting really deep dark brick-red
you're just kind of getting this Mavi
shade right here in the center that
allows you to kind of take a look in
that direction but you're going to be
able to go deeper and darker in that way
with the in bloom palette and of course
this is an all matte palette this one
does have your few shimmery pops now to
share some looks that I've actually done
with this palette and the other day on
snapchat I was showing that I used a lot
of the shades in the bottom row and then
I blended this one called firecracker
and a funny girl over here so I kind of
lightened up the bronze and
had a real shimmery pop on my lid and
then it was blended out with some of
these rosy brick red colors and so I
really like the way that look turned out
so today I wanted to show you something
much cooler I used primarily the shades
in the top rose I primed my lids and
then I used jet setter all over the lid
and kind of work that into the crease as
well with my Sigma e25 brush I brought
in smoke show the darkest shade in the
palette and I patted that over most of
the lid and I also work that up into the
crease as well and just kind of blended
over that whole crease area so those
shades could come together a bit more
next to soften up that color I went down
to smarty pants and I applied that just
over the border of my dark crease color
just under the brow as a highlight I use
just a little bit of charmer I didn't
want to lay that on too thick and then I
used rocker which is the shimmery taupe
on just the inner part of my lid to give
a little bit of shine there and I took
funny girl around the innermost corner
then I did liquid liner across the upper
lash line I lined my lower inner rim
with black liner and kind of smudged it
down below a bit I used a smudge brush
to really get that a bit more blended
and then I took jetsetter the same shade
we started with and blended back with a
pencil brush across the lower lash line
and then I finished things off with
mascara and some false lashes here that
I got for only $1 yes I'm going to
expand on that in a future video and the
finished look really just makes me think
classic smokey eye and I think you could
follow almost like the same template of
shades that I used with the next row and
you would just get a more brownish a
little bit more warm smokey eye
another thing that I noticed and anybody
else who already has this to give your
palette a whiff you feel like those have
a bit of like a a sweet scent not like
as strong as the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette but just a little bit of
sweetness but all in all for the quality
I do think this is the kind of palette
neutral lovers out there would enjoy
especially the matte lovers who are
willing to go there from time to time
with a little bit of shimmer and don't
always want like the 100% matte palette
this is interesting because it gives you
just those few pops of
so quality I give it two thumbs up but
for those of you who like me to
reference uniqueness and how it compares
to all those other things as you saw it
does have its share of similarities to
other pallets that are out there then on
the other hand for the specific reasons
I mentioned you know the sprinkling of
shimmer shades a sort of pink to warm
brown to brick red in the bottom that
makes it a little bit different from the
regular tartlet palette if those aspects
really speak to you and you decide to
get it I do not think you will be
disappointed at all with the qualities
so thank you guys for watching I'll see
you later bye look who came to visit hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
