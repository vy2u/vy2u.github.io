show you the full Fergie collection for
wet-and-wild Fergie is the like global
ambassador for the brand and as a little
beauty ambassador blogger type here I
was able to get that full collection to
review for you and just show you so
maybe you have an idea of what to look
out for or maybe things you don't want
to try when you see the collection in
your stores a lot of new stuff in this
collection there are highlighters and
eyeshadow palettes and lipsticks and
cream eyeliners eyeshadow base mascara
so I'm going to go through everything
for you in this video also wet and wild
just in the regular line has some new
things including a new foundation and a
new powder that will be in a separate
video some of the other new updated
products for the line this is just going
to be about the Fergie star thing I'm
going to talk about are the lipsticks
there are 10 new lipsticks in this
Fergie line called perfect pout lip
color it really reminds me of kind of a
cross between the wet and wild megalast
which they have you know these long
wearing lipsticks a lot of them were
matte finish lipsticks and then they had
mega shield which is a little more
moisturizing this is somewhere in
between I feel like there's more
moisture content in these than the mega
lasts and they don't all have like I was
super matte finish some are creamy some
have a little bit of shimmer the one I'm
wearing right now as you can see it's
got almost a little like bluish
undertone metallic to it so I'm going to
start off by showing you my favourites
out of these ten and I have for favor
I'll show you the rest as well but the
one I have on today that I love so much
I think is kind of unique is called
fuchsia nice is just a great fuchsia
magenta pink and like I said as you look
at it it has almost like a blue toned
shimmer I love that for a bright lip
color and one little tip here these can
be really difficult to close if you
don't do it right there is a little like
F on the top of here make sure the F is
facing forward and it meets up with the
notch
on the front there if you try to close
it any other way it will be really hard
to close and then get open again I also
love this really deep color called
divinely chilled and it reminds me of a
deep color that Rimmel had a while back
called metallic seduction and it is a
little bit metallic it has some sparkle
in there but it's like a really really
nice deep wine type color it's a great
vivid red in this collection and it's
called saraghina and it is your classic
red with kind of a bluish undertone
there's another one I prefer this one on
me but there's another one with more of
that orange e undertone to it as very
bold just full-on color with all of
these the same time there's a nice
subtle nude shade there's not a lot of
that in this collection but there is one
called Fergie daily and I do really like
this shade for a nude lip I can put it
all over I can use a lip liner to maybe
make my you know the outsides a little
bit deeper as I like to do to create
some dimension with the lip throw a
gloss on top of it if you want to but
like I said these have just a little
very subtle amount of shine we're not
talking like a lip butter would have but
they're creamier than some of the other
wet and wild lipstick those are my faves
but I will walk you through the rest
we've got VI pink which is kind of a
pink with a little bit of a lilac tone
to it
a little bit deeper pink called
penthouse suite which is another pink
with a little bit of a purple tone but
it's deeper than the one I just
mentioned a little bit orange E toned
red is called old school glam and it is
kind of like that old Hollywood red lid
there is another little bit deeper
neutral than the Fergie's daily color
it's got a little more of like a
brownish tone and it's called bebot BB
ot beb ot love bebot love I don't know
I've had some Fergie lingo I don't know
about but this is just kind of a deep
neutral in to really dark shades one is
Ferguson Crest Cabernet and here is a
really dark wine color with instead of
the Burgundy influence it's got more of
a purple tone in there and
then there's an all-out black y'all if
you want a black you've got it it's
called pig and Angel and so that's a
totally black look something called a
shimmer palette in this collection and
there are three of them eidest one is
called rose champagne glow then you've
got one that's a little bit deeper and
incorporates I feel like it comes off a
little more orange II and it's called
rose golden goddess and another one
that's more of your bronze look and it's
called Carnival in Rio and it looks like
that so there's a swatch of each of them
the rose champagne is there the rose
gold is in the middle and the carnival
and Rio is right there and other than
this one which I think serves is like a
classic highlight that you could put on
your cheekbones and it's light enough to
really highlight with this is the one I
would reach for the most although I
don't find it specifically to be
anything outstanding I'm really a fan of
the reserve your cabana from the wet and
wild just regular line one of those
highlights that just has barely any
shimmer in it and it just is very very
flattering and it doesn't draw attention
to pores and things like that this one's
nice it's pretty shimmery it's still
usable these other two to me are just
kind of like shimmery bronzers basically
and I don't love a ton of shimmer in my
bronzers most of the time unless I was
going to use these like kind of as an
all-over like body product on the
decollete or something like that for all
not seeing these as a total must-have
Fergie does have an eyeshadow base which
I thought was interesting because
wet-and-wild does not have an eyeshadow
primer and I've been wearing this the
last few days it's in kind of like a
squeeze tube format and it just has that
light kind of skin toned color that many
of the primers out there have whether
it's your urban decay primer potion or
Too Faced shadow insurance it blends in
and it remains to have like just the
slightest bit of a I don't want to say
tacky feel but there's a little moisture
you can still feel there and I feel like
when I use it in conjunction with the
shadows it really does grab the shadows
and makes them more intense than they
would be without this primer so it's
good in that Reese
Becht and I do think it helps the
staying power I mean I've looked at my
eyes at the end of the day and I've been
like okay I feel I feel like the shadow
has not moved but it reminds me a little
bit of the texture of Too Faced shadow
insurance I'm definitely a fan of this I
think it works well I'm glad
wet-and-wild has now come out with an
eyeshadow primer a couple of cream
eyeliners in the line as well they're
called on edge cream liner there is a
black and a brown and they each come
with their own little brushes they're
actually not teeny tiny brushes it's
about size of a normal brush kind of a
small flat brush and I've used this it
along with the liner and it works pretty
well curves of texture and staying power
this reminds me of the liner that
wet-and-wild
already has in their regular line I have
it in just the black color really
amazing stain can absolutely wash your
hands with even with some soap and it
may not go anywhere if you don't scrub
there I just wanted to point that out
because if you already have one of those
liners and you're thinking oh I want to
pick this up in case it's something
special and different it really seems
like the same liner wet and wild already
has although they do have the brown the
brown is a nice kind of rich chocolatey
Brown if you're looking for that I don't
think they have a brown in the in the
regular wet and wild lines so you got
black or brown really think these are
fantastic cream liners for the staying
power and how well they go on so thumbs
up for those you came out with a mascara
it's the turn up the volume mascara and
I'll show you the brush here it's kind
of a thick sort of large brush and it's
got long bristles on the top and bottom
you can see it's kind of you know a
little bit more flat there but then
there's those longer bristles and it's
got kind of a gentle curve to it didn't
clump very much on me but the length
that it built was kind of minimal lashes
are kind of sparse like mine and you
feel like they could use a lot more
length and a lot more thickness this
didn't provide a whole lot of that it
gave just kind of a natural but still
clump free well now we're going to get
into the eye shadows there are four
different eye shadow palettes in this
collection as a whole pretty happy with
them I got to say one that I'm wearing
today just a
of the more neutral shades in it is this
one called metropolitan nights and I
know
Fergie had some boxed sets come out and
she had one that looked really familiar
to this it's a different formula I
didn't really like this and this is this
is different from this so I just thought
it was necessary to make that known the
deep colors and all these palettes are
so rich and a lot of them have some
sparkle I mean these are some blinged
out kind of palettes Fergie is known for
you know some kind of over-the-top looks
sometimes so don't think that these are
going to be your super natural matte
palettes because they are not this does
have a great matte shade right here in
the center a matte black but you've got
kind of a sparkly gold sparkly white
this sort of neutral taupe kind of color
and then a sparkly black down here some
shades in these palettes I feel like
really mimic the same texture of the wet
and wild color icon palettes which I
love so much there are some shades where
I feel like has kind of hit and miss you
know it wasn't quite as strong with the
texture or the pigment involved for
example this shade here so this this
palette well you know I really love the
richness of the deep shades I'm not like
over the top like this is a Mustang you
really like a good colorful palette I
was wearing this one the other day and I
was really impressed with how bold these
colors were this palette I mean we've
got that matte gray in there and then
you've got a little bit of like a satiny
finish on the rest the purple again was
not super bold and I had trouble making
that show up on my eyes so it's one of
those little bit hit-and-miss you know I
love this intense blue and this teal the
grey but the purple was a little bit of
a weakness there and if you like purple
you know you want the purple to show up
if those deep smoky shades or something
you're looking for I wore this one
called Dutchess lounge on New Year's Eve
and I really liked the look I got one
thing to keep in mind is like this shade
looks super dark but once you start
blending it out on your eye it doesn't
quite have that intense sparkle that it
has in here so if you're thinking wow
that looks really unique it's going to
be amazing on my eye it's going to be
once you put it on with a brush and
blend it
a little bit it's not going to have
quite that kind of intensity it's still
going to be super dark and pigmented but
it's not gonna look just like that I
love this kind of plummy color up here
the silver the purple is kind of like
the purple here I mean it's like the
exact same tone this feels softer to me
I mean I could be crazy but this one
feels just like a little more of a
better texture to like this palette
overall I think it's really great for
someone wanting a deep dark purple eye
another palette from this collection
that I like especially if you're wanting
kind of more warm tones in your look
this is called desert festival and
you're getting kind of like a peachy
Coral a really deep intense core matte
Brown and these two shades are kind of
more matte a light kind of nude shade
right here and sort of a deeper I'm
holding this really crazy a deeper brown
with a little bit of sparkle I think
this could be a pretty palette now it
could also be a great summer palette if
you choose to really play up the coral
shade overall I just really prefer these
to still wear drugstore eyeshadows are
concerned I feel like these are overall
pretty good quality just a little more
hit and missing
I feel like wet-and-wild has given us a
pretty high standard with their color
icon Paolo's there are pretty much no
dud shades in there and with these two
you know maybe there were one or two
shades where I was kind of like and what
happened with that color as a whole I'm
glad wet-and-wild came out with this
collection I think there's some really
fun colors both in the lipsticks and the
eyeshadows I don't think everything is a
total must-have I mean I think some of
those lipstick shades are gorgeous and
definitely worth trying a couple of
those eyeshadow palettes are nice they
make a great base the eyeliners too are
really good if you haven't tried wet and
wild scream liners maybe try the Fergie
line the highlighters the shimmer
powders I was kind of not too thrilled
about and also not too thrilled over the
mascara but like I said keep an eye out
for more wet and wild videos featuring
this new foundation and powder and some
other new products that they have come
out with so thank you so much guys for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
