fantastic this is the first video I'm
shooting after Christmas and I had been
over about the past week playing with
some new products from wet-and-wild now
I ordered all of these off of their
website I assume we will all start
seeing these in our drug stores
I haven't here locally so I went ahead
and placed an order it took a long time
for it to come in so I was waiting
waiting waiting but we're talking about
new coverage products like foundation
concealer powder and I've got some new
lip products as well so I thought in
this video I could talk a little bit
about what's new and kind of review it
for you because like I said I have been
using this stuff for a little while now
so for the foundation concealer and
powder the whole line is being labeled
as photo focus and these claim to be
products that don't give any like
flashback in pictures so if you're want
to take some good Instagram pictures or
something you know they cling to
photograph really well and so I have
this in the shade soft beige that's 365
C and it says goodbye photo flash bag
helps eliminate white particle
reflection and it claims to be tested
under 7 light conditions with top
smartphone models and also with and
without flash I can tell you I was
actually wearing this foundation in my
fails video I thought it looked quite
nice on camera just you know in this
lighting which is really not normal
lighting for you know just the average
person walking around definitely not
normal lighting for the whole rest of my
day I don't typically take a lot of
photos with my phone with the flash on
but I did test it was a few and I took a
couple just to show you like this
morning that it really doesn't give any
kind of weird like ashy
or like overly white reflected type look
on camera so I mean I don't think that's
anything you have to worry about the way
it's packaged we're talking about a
glass jar here the cat twists off and
then you've got like a little spatula
and overall consistency wise and as you
can see like we're waiting it's going to
drip it's gonna go you know it's kind of
a liquidy consistency foundation not as
completely liquid as say a makeup
forever you know water blend type of
foundation that just seems absolutely
the consistency of water I would just
this is most toward the liquidy end of
traditional liquid foundations and the
way I apply this is I just sort of use
that little spatula and dab it all over
my skin until all the product is off of
it I think you're going to have to
experiment a little bit with you know
maybe you need more maybe you need less
at this point in time with the product
being so new you know when I pull that
little wand out it's fully loaded with
products so I can get it under my eyes I
can go all over my face and then I've
experimented with a few different ways
of blending it in different Beauty
blenders versus an actual brush and I
think for this being a straight up
medium coverage foundation you can kind
of maximize that the most I think by
using a brush a really dense foundation
brush Beauty Blender I mean it still
blends it out nicely and it will look
nice and natural but I feel like that
does take away some of the coverage so I
use a sigma f80 to blend this out and I
thought it did a great job really and
I've been very impressed with right
after application how natural this
actually looks on my skin how close I
can get up to my face and feel like wow
you know that doesn't look like some you
know super cheap wet-and-wild foundation
like it actually looks very very skin
like and I think the price tag on this
was like $5.99 so you really got to
consider that and think about how many
brands are upping the price of their
foundations to double if not a little
bit over double that cost you know
something about the texture that's
interesting for as thin as it is I was
picturing this as a foundation that
would set like kind of immediately on
the skin I certainly didn't think it
would be overboard with moisture but yet
it actually does have kind of a an
unexpectedly tacky feel on the skin like
it doesn't set immediately and even
after having the foundation on my skin
and setting it lightly with some powder
it's not like out now dewy but it is
just slightly tacky on the skin and
that's just not something I run into
very often when the foundation
consistency seems this thin and it feels
this lightweight really going on and
blending out I don't really expect to
have any of that extra moisturised
feeling it's really going to be up to
you as far as how much powder you apply
on top I mean that can definitely affect
the
sure I did a very very light amount of
powder all over my face so I definitely
am still feeling a little something
there now because of the look that this
has on my skin and the look that it
continues to have all day and it seems
to have good staying power for me
throughout the day
I'm not going to whine about that too
much this is a low cost foundation that
looks really natural on the skin it's
got medium coverage and it doesn't make
me look like super dried out I am a
pretty much normal skin type person but
that would have to be one of the biggest
surprises with this foundation for me is
that it feels like there's some moisture
in it but it's still so thin so
lightweight so this could be an
interesting thing for a really dry skin
person to try and maybe you might notice
you don't have some of the same effects
that you tend to have with foundations
that are super liquidy and light like
this but as far as staying power goes I
mean I've been really looking at that as
we get late into the day you know I
apply this stuff in the like 5 o'clock
hour of the morning and then I look at
it 12 hours later 16 hours later and I'm
really looking up close at my skin I'm
looking for areas where I might
typically see some you know texture
developing as makeups it's on there for
awhile like right here and also sides of
the nose and I can tell the makeup has
not worn off although given I haven't
put it under like super sweaty
conditions or harsh outdoor conditions I
can tell by day's end the product is
still there and it does not have a heavy
or a natural look on my skin so all in
all I'm pretty dang happy with that
foundation claims about looking really
good in pictures honestly not my top
concern but you know added bonus that it
can look nice it if you happen to be in
a picture here there now I also got a
couple of concealers I was really
confused as I was ordering online which
concealers am I so I got to one of them
is a little bit more cool and light
that's the light ivory and then the
light to medium beige has a little bit
more yellow tone a little more depth to
it and that's definitely the one that I
consider to be more of a skin tone match
for me
so after applying my foundation I
primarily dotted that one over areas
where I needed it I had a blemish I got
redness around the nose just some areas
I want to even out a little bit more on
top of the cheeks and then I you
the lightest one unlike my innermost
corners hoping to bright and I also put
that on like the high points of the face
and then I just dabbed over that with my
Sigma f80 brush and I find that that is
does a good job of blending without over
blending a beauty blender works fine as
well but like I said before I don't
think these are the highest coverage
products ever these are pretty thin
lightweight concealers and I think in
that kind of a situation you can use a
little extra coverage so brushes can
help with that also use the p84 to get
me a little bit more targeted blending
right around the inner corners of my
eyes and although these did a pretty
good job considering I reached for no
peachy corrector you know to really help
my under-eye circles but I still feel
like I've got brightness and I do feel
like I've got additional coverage on top
of the foundation I just don't really
see these concealers though is anything
super special they don't offer any
additional moisture to areas of my skin
where you know I'm going to be applying
them and hoping I don't look like a
crepey mess after a few hours they
really just don't give much moisture
back to the skin at all and I've noticed
that I like the appearance of my under
eye area better when I apply this
foundation and use concealers like you
know maybe my benefit erase paste or the
Anasazi has something that's going to be
a little bit more emollient in that area
these just aren't wow me you know
they're kind of like run-of-the-mill
typical liquidy concealers I don't think
they even provide quite as much coverage
as like the Maybelline instant age
rewind you know the ones with the little
dabber puffs at the epitaphs oh that's
an example of a good drugstore concealer
that just doesn't dry me out quite as
much as these and furthermore the claims
with the concealer kind of the same as
the foundation claims to photograph well
you know and I haven't noticed any
issues with those not photographing well
you know they seem to do what they say
they will do then I also got the photo
focused pressed powder and this is in
the shade warm light this is verging on
just a little bit light for me to wear
all over my face the texture really
surprised me it's kind of domed up in
here even though it's sitting down in
the compact a bit it is a domed powder
so just seeing that I was thinking is
this going to be like a really dry baked
powder but once you just once
world of your finger in there the
product really does come off quite a bit
so your product from the pan does seem
to kind of transfer onto your brush
pretty easily you're not going to be
struggling to pick up powder but that
being said it's not really the kind of
powder I would classify as being
especially rich or creamy or buttery if
you felt L'Oreal True Match if you felt
Revlon nearly naked pressed powders
those are powders that I think you touch
them and there's some cling between your
fingers this feels pretty light and
powdery it's also very very matte so for
an oily person who was needing something
to take away any kind of dewy texture of
this foundation and really just mattify
the whole look of the skin this could be
a good setting powder pairing for you
but if you're dry you might not love
this powder for me being as light as it
is I just used it lightly as an under
eye setting powder and boy it I think it
borders on making me look a little too
dry in that area but just for the tone
that's the place where it seems to work
best for me if this makes sense
I used it very lightly elsewhere on the
face not even enough to like I said
really take away the texture of the
foundation but just to give me a little
bit of setting powder and in my testing
of this product I've never gone
overboard and applying a lot of this all
over my face just because I know you
know the way it feels it feels a little
bit dry and it's also kind of light
that's the perfect formula for looking
cakey so I'm not saying this is a bad
powder or couldn't be exactly what
certain people need but for me and just
for the shade that I have I'm not going
to be wearing this really full on all
over my face and having not done that
too much I think I'd give you an even
more accurate explanation of the staying
power of the foundation because we're
talking a little bit less of a cocktail
of products and more just you know how
well does this last so with very little
setting powder on it I think this
foundation again lasts very well
throughout the day the concealers the
powder they can work for you but not the
most remarkable and different type of
products you know in this line now
outside of the photo focus stuff I did
get a few other new products as well one
thing that I think has been out for a
while but I just haven't been able to
lay my hands on it in a store is this
highlight it's the mega glow highlight
powder and I got it in precious petals
very very metallic looking I mean we're
talking just the extreme of powder
highlights right here and as you look at
it on my finger it just the light just
really bounces off of it this is a
powder I'm really not going to wear it
such a full-on way up my cheeks that
it's going to look that heavy what I did
do by the way after the whole Foundation
and powder concealer steps and I used my
compact from NARS as the narcissist
cheek studio palette which I've had for
a while and just kind of recently busted
out but I used the Laguna bronzer from
that and I used the I think is called
the ghoul a is it the ghoul a blush I'm
not sure if I'm saying that right but
and I put those steps on then I went to
this highlight and I just use my open up
highlight brush went kind of lightly
tapped off the excess and went on top of
the cheeks with it and I do think it's
nicely glowy you can control it but I
feel like I am walking a fine line with
using highlights like this because they
are really shimmery and even with a
light amount I look up close here at
like the outer part of my eye area and
I'm thinking I'm seeing a little more
texture there than I normally would just
for the fact that this is so shiny so
just be warned this can go extreme and
it might not be everyone's cup of tea
and then I also want to tell you about
some lip products I got wet and wild now
has some tinted lip balms out and
they're calling these gel lip balms and
saying first of its kind gel lip balms
especially formulated with vitamin E
avocado oil and a gel complex to deliver
innovation with the ultimate performance
and comfort these don't feel like
anything super different to me like if
you're thinking about stocking up on
these because they claim to be something
state-of-the-art and unique they're
really not are smooth they're creamy
they feel comfortable on the lips
staying power is really not very good
these in particular have sort of a thin
kind of lip smacker ish feel to me on
the lips they're not one of those bombs
that has a thickness that really clings
to your lips I do prefer one shade over
the other that I have here so I'll show
you both of them again these were online
orders I wasn't quite sure what the
shade would turn out to be but I have a
color called tease and this is so like
milky on the lips I mean for being
described as Jill I was so surprised to
see this kind of opaque whitened peach
look on my lips or a white and pinky
peach it's kind of odd definitely not my
favorite type of shade to wear so I'm
not loving that one but the other one
that I have called play I definitely
prefer this shade much more it's a
little bit more like what you see is
what you get it's this pretty sheer
coral but there is a good amount of
color to it and it feels nice but like I
said I was wearing this the other day
and it was with me for a couple of hours
but once you're eating and drinking I
mean you're definitely going to
absolutely need to reapply these pretty
similar I would say to the Maybelline
Baby Lips maybe a little bit more slip
to these the Baby Lips have just a hair
more thickness and then wet-and-wild
jumped on the liquid lipstick train so I
decided I'll try a couple of these
they're calling these the mega last
liquid cat suit matte liquid lipsticks
so I got two shades I got one that was
in this sort of like light more medium
family and then a deeper one this light
one which I've been wearing throughout
the video is called rebel rose and the
other is video vixen so we're talking
about a wand applicator here with these
and it actually has a bit of a scoop in
the DOE foot so that does hold some
product and you may find that that
amount of product that gets scooped out
for you is enough to get all over your
lips without going back for more I'm
personally not a huge fan of liquid
lipsticks especially in weather where I
feel like my lips are getting more dried
out than usual anyway I don't think
liquid lipsticks offer any additional
moisture back to the skin but the
benefit to some of them you know when
they 100% set you are going to get some
decent staying power out of them the
question is do they make your lips look
super parched and just unattractive
because everything is so dry these
liquid cat suits do totally sit like I'm
not able to pull off any product from my
lips yet when I really press my lips
together hard
there's just the tiniest bit of cling
it's not sticky at all but there's a
little more moisture in these I guess if
you want
moisture than like a colour-pop ultra
matte but at the same time they still do
do a good job of setting I always feel
like I get better wear and less obvious
dryness like I know the dryness is there
but less obvious looking dryness when I
go for a medium color like this in one
of these matte liquid lipsticks so I
feel like the rebel Rose is looking
better on my lips and I worried a couple
nights ago too and I thought okay you
know that's that's working for me at
least I mean I don't want anybody
getting too close to my lips to look at
all of that texture that's going on but
it's just not as pronounced I think is
when you wear a really light shade or a
really dark shade from one of these
lines so I also have a dark shade and
again this is one called video vixen and
the shade is gorgeous like I love the
color but with wear throughout the day I
feel like this wears off more obviously
like also on the inner part of the lip
because it's such a different shade than
what's happening like on your gum on the
inner part of your mouth so it really
shows a lot I don't like that and also
these liquid lip colors can be a little
more flake prone you know because they
are so drying so anytime you're using
something that creates I think a little
bit more contrast with your natural lip
color it's going to be seen more as it
starts to flake off but surprisingly to
me the best thing in this little hole
and the thing that I am most like
excited about I guess is this photo
focus foundation this for my normal skin
type being something that has that
lightweight thinness but yet it doesn't
set to a totally like completely dry
place that seems to be working for me it
seems to have good staying power on my
skin I think it looks good on camera or
in pictures so I think that's the good
news the bad news is there's really
nothing else that I've talked about
that's making me super excited nothing
else in this haul that I can really say
that I loved but you know that's the way
it works out sometimes certainly happy
to have tested these things out for you
guys thank you so much for watching I do
have some new things from ELF as well
and that will be an upcoming video for
sure so thanks for watching and I'll see
you soon
