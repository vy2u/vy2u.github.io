love kits of makeup I love being able to
get a lot of product for your money and
that's kind of what we'll be talking
about in this video gonna be showing you
all the ins and outs of the Tarte
what is your makeup done for you lately
collection here you're getting six
different products this is gonna be the
today's special value on QVC on July
13th the cost is just under 50 bucks
it's gonna be available on Easy Pay you
can check it out early on the QVC
website so I'll put the link down below
you can actually order it
um in advance but the day it's actually
gonna be able to be viewed on TV and the
presentations and everything is 13 I was
really excited when Tarte actually sent
me this ahead of time and they wanted my
feedback on it so I was pretty honored
to be able to share my thoughts with
them and then also share my thoughts
with you on this I get to show you all
about it before it actually goes on-air
which is really cool because normally I
get these kits I order them you know the
day they show up on air and then by the
time I get a video made you know maybe
everything sold out and it's you guys
are watching it it's like oh I like that
but I can't get it now so here you'll be
able to see it and then decide for
yourself if you want to see some little
demonstrations along the way I really
want to show you how it all works all of
these products are full-size it's
foundation it's like your moisturizer
step you're getting a foundation brush
lip product the full eye that you would
need with a shadow stick a liner and a
mascara so we'll go through all of that
in a lot of detail but I've said this
before in my video on how to save money
on high-end makeup if you're interested
in you know say two or more of the
products in this kit it really is the
best value to go ahead and get the kit
rather than buying them individually
because that you save a lot of money
this way and I love these kits because
they are a whole full-size you're not
buying just a bunch of mini things for a
good price you're getting a lot of
full-size things for a good price the
thing about this kit is sometimes kits
claim to be you're like full face like
everything in this kit is everything you
need to do your face and I don't
generally agree with that about
this kit there are gonna be some
products that I would throw in on top of
us to really finish the look for me
these are more like bits and pieces that
you could put into you know your own
makeup routine add to it enhance it and
whatever but it may not be your total
full face so I just want to get that out
there I want to jump right in here and
tell you about sort of the first product
I put on in this kit and this is the
Tarte pure maracuja oil with a
rollerball that's what makes this
different in different today's special
values that I've ordered from Tarte like
they'll give you maybe you know this
little guy and it has a dropper and
that's all good but I tell you what this
is a lot easier to use it makes a lot
more sense and it feels so good on your
skin so you just twist the top off you
have the rollerball here and a lot of
you are maybe still stuck thinking wait
Oil face isn't that a bad thing
this is like a really really thin oil
I've used this as a nighttime
moisturizer I've used this as a daytime
moisturizer too it's very lightweight
your skin just kind of drinks it up and
feels super soft after you put it on so
you've heard me talk about this quite a
bit before um this is just the new
format it feels super good as you put it
on a foundation in this kit is based in
that Markku Jo oil concept well var
foundation with broad-spectrum SPF 15
you're getting again the full-size here
it's got a nice little pump you can pump
out with one pump I mean that pretty
much got all over my face and then I use
their brush which this is the flawless
finish
bamboo foundation brush and this is kind
of cool I'm going to just stop and talk
about this briefly this is sort of like
a flat top brush but it's a little bit
tapered down the side meaning if you
like to apply foundation more like a
with a traditional brush where you're
almost like painting on strokes over
your face you can kind of do that with
this brush or you can use it more on its
and circular motions to buff everything
out for the foundation when I first put
this on my hand and kind of swatched it
out I got kind of worried because I was
like oh this looks so hydrating you know
is this gonna be too much I have combo
skin I don't want to be a grease slick
at the end of the day
but it really once you put it on it kind
of like absorbs a little bit it you can
tell it's hydrating your skin but you
don't feel greasy at all it is going to
be I think one of the perfect
foundations for dry skin and if you have
oily skin though I would suggest topping
this off with a powder I'll get to that
in a minute but first let's talk
coverage with this coverage wise like I
said I think it's kind of like a medium
coverage when you first put it on like
you just put on that initial amount you
blend it all in it's not covering all
your dark circles or your spots or
whatever it's gonna depend on your
personal skin needs as to how adequate
you think this foundation is and
covering everything but for me you know
I got some circles in spots and one
thing you can do with this which I
figured it out after wearing this for
like a couple weeks then I finally
determined oh hey this works you can
just pump out a little more foundation
dot it over those areas and just kind of
Pat it in and that covers actually
rather well and kind of eliminates the
need for a concealer for those minor
issues if you've got bigger problems
than that you may want to draw in
another concealer on top of this but
overall they say 12-hour foundation I
can vouch for the however if you have
oily skin or even combo skin like me I
would really suggest topping this off
with a little bit of powder that's gonna
enhance the staying powder if power if
you're really oily you may want to
reapply that powder later in the day it
does give you I mean I wouldn't really
even say totally dewy skin but it gives
you a really fresh skin look with the
thing I was most intrigued about with
this kit because I've never tried a
foundation like that and it really does
work well very surprised at how well
this lasts it looks pretty in pictures
it's looked great on HD television for
me so definitely a fan after I apply
that foundation I do like a little bit
of powder on top to set things and also
kind of what's left out of this kit is
some sort of blush and bronzers so I
sweep on a little bit of bronzer a
little bit of blush that's just how I
roll that's what I like you may go
without it if you want to that's fine
but the
just a couple of steps that I feel are
kind of necessary with this kitty eye
part of it you really aren't getting
everything you need and we've had 100
plus degree heat for about the past week
and a half now and I have worn this on
multiple occasions with a no primer and
be no shadow on top we all know that
those are things that really help a
cream eye product stay and this doesn't
need the help so it's the tarte
modernize waterproof creaseless shadow
liner duo not a really bold purple look
it is just more of a soft plum so what I
like about the shadow stick is that it's
not too big so while you're not gonna
sharpen it it's gonna stay fairly
precise there and you can feel
comfortable taking it in under your eyes
so I just glide this all over my lid you
can build it up for a little more color
just go over that same area again I took
this under my eye as well all the way
under and this really lasts it doesn't
need any help from a powder shadow on
top for staying power in terms of the
liner you're getting it's described as
plum brown I would say that's very
accurate it's not gonna be something
that stands out as you know really bold
purple but you can see the plum and the
brown in that color so that glides on
really easily I think I might even like
that part of this stick the best you're
gonna have to work quickly if you want
to smudge this out because it will set
and it's gonna stay there that's all
there is to it however my one sort of
beef with this is the fact that it says
it's waterproof but like when I swatch
this on my hand this will wash off
easily with water now it'll stay at my
eye all day I'll be hot I'll be a little
sweaty it will still last you can even
just you know rub your fingers across
this and it's still gonna be on there
it's still gonna look good but in terms
of being waterproof it washes off not
even any soap needed it just washes
right off so keep that in mind if you're
a swimmer I mean I'm not swimming every
day wearing full eye makeup so it
doesn't bother me but just so you know
that waterproof clay my question that I
was very excited about this kit was
getting a full size of the Tarte gifted
Amazonian clay smart mascara
you may have remembered back around
Christmastime I got a mini size of this
in the Sephora lash stash and this was
my favorite and I said I think I might
like this even better than Tarte lights
camera lashes I think this is even
better than lights camera lashes like
they made an improvement on it which was
kind of surprising but what's
interesting about this mascara is like
less is more I guess I would say you
don't have to go back get back into your
tube I mean I can build up pretty sparse
lashes and make them look pretty darn
good if I don't say so myself and also
you can tell this isn't clumping as you
watch this get applied to my lower
lashes it really is easy to put on there
you don't worry about the clumps it's
highlighting every lash I just feel like
this is probably a little more
lengthening and just a little more
Vava voom even than the lights camera
lashes which I still really like but
this is just up a notch and I love it
and I'm so glad I have a full size with
the lip product this is really cool you
guys know I'm a fan of jumbo lip pencils
and tarte lipsurgence in general this is
a lip surgence lip shine so that's why I
look like I've practically put a gloss
on with this this is so shiny it has no
shimmer it's just a pretty pink standard
shiny color but what's really smart
about this packaging is that they give
you a sharpener here in the camps so
this is not like the typical lip
surgence with the plastic around it I
have several of those and as you
continue to use them it's nice that you
don't have to sharpen them but because
you're not they kind of flatten out on
you like that so with this you can keep
your precise tip but you've got the
sharpener right there in the cap that's
kind of the downer of sharpeners it's
like if you're traveling you got to
remember to bring one you'll lose them
and all that kind of stuff so it's very
cool that it's there it's concealed in
the cap and then you can just cap the
product as usual so I love that I really
really like this color I'm a big fan of
Pink's as is so I like that this is
shiny and it does have really good
staying power even after the shine fades
I find that you still have some color it
kind of reminds me of the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stains but maybe
just a little bit shiny
than some of those and this whole kit
comes with a little thing here so you
can actually get some refreshers on how
to apply them and what they're for and
what's in them ingredient wise and all
that so overall thoughts on this kit
first off as with anything I recommend
to you I mean don't just get it because
I say oh I like it I think you should
get it too I don't I'm not into think
saying anybody has to have something I'm
talking about what you should think
about is if you're intrigued by maybe
just a couple of these different
products this may be worth getting for
you in the kit just to save you money
because the total cost of all these
things just bought separately would be a
whole lot more than the close to fifty
dollars you'd spend for all six things
in this kit so if you are intrigued by
some of these products if you genuinely
are interested if you think that these
would be a good fit for your makeup
needs right now I say go for it because
this is a really good isn't your full
face if you get this kit is that all
you're gonna need I don't really think
so personally because I like my blush
and I like my powder and I think if your
combo too oily or if you are oily skin
you're gonna need some powder with that
foundation so you know I don't think
it's your full face but I do think these
are nice little supplements to plug into
your routine and kind of improve it in
different ways the foundation by the way
the shade I'm using in this is like
that's the only decision you make with
the kid is what your foundation shade is
so as you watch the presentation maybe
you want to wait until the day you see
this on air they'll have some more
explanation of the shade that wraps up
my review of the new Tarte today's
special value kit what is your makeup
done for you lately you're only going to
find it on QVC again you can check the
website now order it now if you want you
can wait and check out the presentations
coming up on the 3rd Lily honored the
Tarte sent this to me wanted to know
what I thought about it and I told them
basically what I've told to you guys in
this video I definitely would have been
intrigued enough about that foundation
and wanting that mascara to buy this on
my own for sure but thank you so much
for taking time to watch and I hope you
have a wonderful day
