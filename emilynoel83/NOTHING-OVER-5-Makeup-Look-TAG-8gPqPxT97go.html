this tag going around on YouTube the
nothing over $10 makeup tag people are
challenged to put together a look where
no product costs over $10 and I was
tagged by the beautiful and hilariously
and says so thank you Leanne and I saw
her video on this and it was really good
I also watched Dominique's videos she's
the amazing Houston news anchor who has
a YouTube channel and she's got great
videos as well so I decided hey I'm
going to get in on this but something in
the back of my mind was telling me why
not challenge yourself just a little bit
more and try to make this a nothing over
$5 makeup tag because I own and use a
lot of drugstore makeup you see it a lot
in my videos and apparently on some kind
of glutton for punishment because I just
wanted even more challenge here so I
decided to make this under $5 and
something I really liked about Leanne
and Dominique's videos is that they each
had some if not I think Dominique had
all of her products like recently
purchased she went to the store she
tried to find things under you know the
$10 mark or whatever and considering
this is kind of a fun video not
necessarily a hardcore you know super
review I kind of like seeing how they
both worked in some new products and had
some surprises along the way you know
that was fun to see so for me while I
had some things that I'd recently
purchased that fell under the $5 mark
that I thought I definitely want to put
in this video there were some things I
needed so I went to the store with my
little shopping companion we are going
to be doing one of my favorite things
which is bargain makeup shopping you
like to find a good bargain
one good answer
Oh found an eyeliner on this nail polish
you like it
that's immense stuff ah what we're
finding is it's very hard to find
coverage products like concealers or BB
creams or foundations or $5 or less
we've retreated to the candy aisle
that's your Hall try to pry down the car
help you see geese up there we must have
flown off all right it looks like five
below is open now I needed a new one of
those but in the court
thank you
nugget are we finding one thing boo here
so many thanks
um um no you throw it in go there go
good job I've already moisturized we're
going to start this off with foundation
and this was the foundation that I
picked up I found it at five below and
it is the profusion aqua stylish silky
milk Foundation oil effect it says oil
effect of oil free foundation not sure I
understand the marketing behind this one
but I was looking at this yesterday and
I've absolutely used some off you know
foundations color wise this is so so
orangie and it looks that way even more
getting at home that it did in the store
so I'm going to set this aside and I did
find something else in my collection it
was really hard first off to find under
five dollar foundation in the drugstore
but wet and wilds cover all is one of
them and I did already have this so I'm
going to use this as my foundation and
I've got it in the shade fair slash
light oops I just glob some on my table
I just had somebody on standby off to
the side with Kleenexes these videos
would go a lot faster so let's just dab
this on all over the face
I did not include brushes in this under
five dollar video but I am going to try
to use draw at least drugstore brushes
when possible so keep it with the
bargain theme right this is my Real
Techniques buffing brush and this
foundation you know it really does have
decent coverage it's definitely head and
shoulders above certain dirt cheap
foundations I remember picking up like
in high school or you know when I was
just experimenting with a lot of really
inexpensive stuff they also have a nice
coverage pressed powder from this line
as well the LA Colors cover-up Pro
concealer stick and I gotten this
recently off of I think the I Kate House
website and this is in the shade
champagne so it's a decent stick
concealer that does have you know good
amount of creaminess to it so I'm going
to hit the under-eye area with this and
anywhere else that I need it if I del
little redness and thank you so much for
the get well wishes on this little cold
I've been dealing with it certainly is
nothing major but I appreciate you
thinking of me and I am feeling the day
by day a little bit better it can almost
feels like a borderline allergy type
thing because as the weather has cooled
down around here a little bit I felt
like a noticeable difference in my
breathing and the congestion and
everything so
pretty decent coverage with this
concealer I must say I'm going to use
some of this tone correcting powder that
I got recently from ELF
and this is in the shade warm and I do
kind of like using like this yellow and
peachy side they make kind of nice
under-eye brightening setting powders so
I'm just using that with my ELF small
tapered brush which you know is a must
if you watch my videos great little
brush for highlighting for setting the
under eye for applying powder over small
areas of the face I'm just going to use
this a little over the t-zone and then
call it a day powder wise well I have
one assistant over here holding Kleenex
if I could have another one pulling out
the proper brush at the right time then
shooting videos would go super quickly
this product is pretty dang cool this is
something I got from five below I have
had it for just a little while like I
got it the last go-round and when I was
at five below not the time I was there
with Belle and it's from beauty treats
and it's called bronzing blow basically
a neat little bronzer palette here that
has a matte bronzer and then various
glowy bronzers and a highlight so I am
going to use a little bit of that
darkest shade which isn't quite as scary
as it might appear and I'm just going to
warm up my skin a little bit applying it
on the perimeter up around my hairline
and I'm using my ELF studio complexion
brush
then I think I'm going to warm things up
all over a little bit more with a combo
of those two shimmery shades its
pigmented but it's not like over the top
where you've got to be too crazy careful
with it you know gonna put that on
standby for just a moment and look at
this cute little blush that I found it
got this at five below uhm just now just
the other day it is the city color HD
blush in warm mauve this was literally
the only shade they had but they had a
lot of them this particular color and I
do have quite a few city color be matte
blushes that I love so I'm just going to
start small with this gently tap in with
my Milani blush brush
oh yeah that's going to work I tell you
if you want good affordable products
it's not that they're not out there you
just got to know where to look and then
back to my little highlight in the
center here it's got glow it's not like
a becca highlight over here but it's got
a little blue so we're going to work
with that on top of the cheeks here five
below really has like palettes galore
though I palettes combo I face pallets
contour palettes you name it then at
this stage of the game I think I'm going
to use a little setting mist I've got an
under $5 option here with the elf makeup
mist and set which works really well I
think there was a time when this first
came out and I didn't think their
sprayer worked very well hmm good good
stuff yeah I had to use this one in a
little while this was mine that I had in
my collection I didn't know if it was
randomly gonna like spray me in the face
super big-time
on browse the product I'm going to use
this from wet-and-wild and it is the
color icon brow pencil in the shade
brunettes do it better and it's just
your very standard little pencil here
with the spoolie on the other side and
this was one of the things that I you
know I had in my collection and I know
this is kind of like a soft brow pencil
in other words a lot of color can
transfer off of it so you have to be I
feel like I have to be kind of careful
because my brows are already pretty dark
this is not like a topi shade this is a
real legit Brown so I just kind of
barely apply any pressure and just get
that color going roughly where I want it
it was so funny watching um Lee Ann's
video and particularly her brow portion
of it I will link below if I didn't say
that already - Dominique in Lee Ann's
challenge videos they did they were
really good
little baby and my tummy is kicking
around like nobody's business right now
dang very very active child in there
then just use the little spooley wand to
pull through any product that got a
little caught up in my brow forest and
then I've got my wet n Wild mega clear
gel which this priced out at Walgreens I
already had this but I noticed the cost
was like a buck ninety-nine or something
like that so definitely works and then
very recently when I replenished my
supply of Jordana color Envy liquid
liners I noticed on their website which
they have revamped their website and
made it just a little bit I don't know a
little easier to navigate a little more
friendly to the eye let's say in Jordana
has this made to last I shadow primer
now Jordanna and Milani are manufactured
like under the same umbrella and a lot
of Jordana things turn out to be very
similar to Milani formulas sometimes and
I'm thinking that this made to last I
shadow primer is going to be a whole
heck of a lot like my Holy Grail Milani
eyeshadow primer I mean it feels like
the very same consistency and the size
of the tube is like just the same it's
just funny but I think this may have
been a buck or two cheaper than the
Milani the only downside was I don't
find this particular product in my
drugstore you might but I had to order
this okay now for eyeshadow I've been so
looking forward to this we've got
options here one of the things that I
bought yesterday was this profusion
studio eyeshadow palette I thought okay
there's some kind of stony smokey basics
did some swatches yesterday no there is
no color translating off of those
unmoving on within the past month or so
after I heard Sabrina talking about this
little gem this two-dollar beauty treats
palette from five below they either call
it neutral matte or warm matte and this
is really good I've used it several
times I've gotten great looks out of it
so I thought it could go that direction
or this is the cool map
one that I hadn't seen the first time
that I purchased this I got this one
yesterday and I think this is the one I
want to use today because there are just
some interesting tones in here I've just
been in such a warm toned eyeshadow zone
lately I think I need to switch it up
so again two dollars for this palette
and the first thing I'm going to do is
go into this shade it's kind of like a
topi Brown and that's going to set the
tone here in the crease Sigma e25 oops
that's technically not even in the
drugstore family I apologize I'm going
to bring that shade up just a bit like
really go above my crease with it but
this shadow really translates nicely
onto the eye you know I don't feel like
I'm doing a lot of work to to build up
color or to make it be seen no I don't
hurt it don't know lugging you mm-hmm so
we got that shade blend around it just a
little bit here then I think I'm going
to go into this deeper brown up top I'm
going to get that going in the crease as
well build up some depth
then I guess my only real highlight is
this shade up here do a little bit of
that
now for all over the lid we're hitting
up lilac right here sponge tip
applicator baby and we're just going to
start dabbing this all over the lid for
a fun little net lilac pop right here
yes yes it's happening I like this
alright that's kind of fun you know I'm
building up the color a little bit but
it's really showing up rather well for a
pastel purple
how fun I like this color a lot and then
what I think I want to do just to add a
little something interesting in the
outside too
I'm going to take this shade it's like a
really bluish purple we'll see what this
is made of here in the outer corner
there we go yeah that's showing up to
noise I don't like how these Purple's
are playing with those Browns that I
already had going on in the crease
I don't know how many of you are
watching this is us on NBC on Tuesday
nights but oMG I just got caught up on
this week's episode last night so so
good
show makes me cry like every time though
I can't my hormones can't quite handle
it but I can't stay away and then
because I just really don't want to lose
my brown that's part of this look or my
taupe whatever I'm going to like
continue to bring that back in I want
that to still be a player in this look
because it just it kind of gives it this
wearable little twist having that above
the lid $2 palette thank you very much
and I just remembered halfway through
this eye look that I've got this thing
the other day from wet-and-wild it's the
ultimate brow highlighter it's a little
just a little pencil so we're going to
try this out and see how this goes
seems like kind of one of those benefit
high brow type products go little pinky
tone certainly cleans up the edge of the
brow area effectively and it's matte
I'm going to do my lower inner rim with
Rimmel scandaleyes in nude which I think
I saw on Walgreens online came in just
under five dollars
and then here's the deal with the liner
I got this interesting liner from
Jordana it's the cat eyeliner in orchid
and I was just kind of swatching it out
and this may be something for use on
another look on another day because it's
a gorgeous shade but it's almost exactly
like what's happening on my lids right
now so I'm not so sure this look is the
best place work because I think it would
just kind of mesh in with everything not
be seen so I am going to use my color
and the waterproof liquid eyeliner in
black envy this video I think has been a
nice mix of new discoveries and some old
tried-and-true favorites and this is
definitely one of those tried-and-true
items that I just love so much my
favorite black liquid eyeliner that does
not go anywhere so I'm going to just
line the upper lash line with this real
quick
I'm sorry I have not really been
sticking to a purely drugstore brushes
on the eyes and for that I apologize
I've just been kind of going to what's
in my comfort zone since I'm unfamiliar
with the shadows I think I want to keep
with the dark brown on the lower lash
line I'm going to go to this really dark
brown over here that I haven't used yet
sort of smoky Brown halo around that
little pop of lilac
a little bit of this shade to which this
I have like a little pink in it there's
something different going on in that
color like it dusty taupe eros or
something I noticed it in the crease as
like am I seeing something different
happening in that color something
unpredictable
For Lashes I'm going to use this LA
Colors X Volume Mascara this was another
five below fine so I'm gonna curl my
lashes first and what do we that was dry
a little dry flake just fell off of
there okay it's just as new to me as it
is to you folks this is a rubber bristle
brush a little bit tapered towards the
end um everybody home let me see
please don't say I just bought a dried
out mascara I swear nothing nothing is
going on my lashes right now you guys
except a little fallout on my cheek look
what I got I got something back from
when I did like a dollar store Beauty
adventure type video this is also from
LA Colors and it's called bulb lash
mascara and I think this came from
Family Dollar definitely under five
dollars and there seems to be some
creamy yeah okay there is legit product
in this one folks not sure how much it's
going to do for me but it's doing a
little something
but alas we are doing some lashes here
did I just say alas these are the kiss
blooming lashes and I got some kiss
improved formula brush on strip adhesive
with aloe and I got these yesterday at
Walgreens
they were both under $5 and it was on I
think a BOGO half off deal it's like
multiple layers of lashes instead of
just being one row of lashes sweeping up
there they're more fluttery and I got
the style peony I've just given my
lashes a little trim II trim they were
kind of long left to right and then this
is just a wand applicator type of glue I
don't think I've tried this one before
and it goes on seeming like it has a
very similar consistency to the Revlon
same look I like to just hold my lashes
right in the center align them with the
center of my eye and then pull down the
outside pull down the inside these are
very fluttery Wow
I feel like they almost are coming
across looking thicker on my eyes than
they appeared to be in the packaging
for lips I've got a few options here
I've got this soft pink from
wet-and-wild and also a brown
this one's called will you be with me
and this one's called mink brown and I
think those two could come together to
be kind of this neutral like nudish
color that I'm after both seem to be
just creamy lip colors with no shimmer
so I'm going to put my pink on first I
think these were just like 99-cent
lipsticks so that's much more pink than
I want so I'm going to go over with a
little Brown
and then you guys I was really looking
over wet-and-wild selection
I had forgotten they had these lip
glosses the mega slicks lip glosses and
these have been around forever it killed
me that they had like a new sticker on
the packaging because this goes so far
back like probably to my junior high
days this particular shade called bronze
berry I know I had this it's like a
metallic neutral lip gloss and now that
metallics are back
I figure heck let's just apply a little
bit of this and I don't really mind so
much like a metallic gloss as much as a
metallic matte formula those are the
ones that I just think don't do any
favors for your lips if you got some
brighness final look
nothing over five dollars I am very very
pleased with this I got to say this was
fun I enjoyed pulling in some things
that I had some things that were new to
me letting you kind of see the whole
process unfold as we went I would say
the biggest hit / surprise of this even
though I knew I liked the warm version
of this this cool version was really
really fun and I loved that even though
it was cool you know they did throw in
some Browns which I thought made for fun
look I love the lilac on the lids
quality of these is just they're very
easy to use I can't pick it apart it's 2
bucks
biggest dud would be the mascara that
flaked right out of the gate and was
unusable and just was so dried out it
wouldn't even go onto my lashes so LA
Colors boo I think the whole under $10
makeup tag has been around for a while
you've probably seen a lot of people do
it but if you've got a favorite youtuber
or you yourself are watching this and
you think hey I'd like to try it as a $5
challenge I say go for it the products
are definitely out there certain things
are harder to find than others it is
tricky to come up with the coverage
products for under five but it is most
definitely not impossible so I would
love to see what you guys come up with
if you try it out and thank you so much
for watching I'll see you later
