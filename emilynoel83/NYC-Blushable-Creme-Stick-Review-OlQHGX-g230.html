video today on some cream blush sticks
and if you've been out in the drugstore
lately
looking around you know that there's not
really a huge market for the cream
blushes I know Evelyn has some and NYC
has some and that those are the ones I'm
reviewing today and they're a flushable
cream stick by NYC New York color
cosmetics what's nice about these is you
get a decent amount of product in here
too and it's gonna last you a long time
you don't necessarily use a lot when it
comes to cream blush and the brighter
the shade that you pick out I think the
less you're going to end up using so I
have four shades I believe they are all
of the shades that are offered so I'm
just going to tell you what they look
like and kind of how they go on and what
not the one I have on today is called
berry no wild berry and they come in a
stick like this and they twist up
they're about the size of one of those
jumbo lip smackers you remember those
from a long time ago and they're all
creamy this one I mean doesn't have any
sparkle in it and it comes off like a
like if you first put it on your cheeks
before you blend it in it looks like
that okay so kind of a bright pink and
then if you blend it in you're going to
get sort of a soft pink glow like that
so that's kind of the way I'm going to
swatch these for you guys because I mean
there's no point in putting it I like
hate when people put like a thick swatch
of something that's ultimately gonna be
blended out on your face and it's like
it's not gonna look you know like that
you are gonna blend it in so I have that
on and the way we're cream blushes I
mean I just like taking a little bit of
this off with my finger blending it in
it doesn't take like these are not hard
to blend at all so like you get a little
bit like I might get for one cheat just
a little bit on one finger and blend it
and it they're not hard to blend so you
don't feel like you're really messing up
the makeup that's on underneath and then
you can leave it as is if you want more
that dewy look or you can still get the
dewy look kind of like I have today I
topped it off with a with a pink blush I
use this one for
luscious its blush bouquet in
pretty-in-pink so just something that
coordinates like that and then I put a
highlight right on my cheekbones so you
can still get the dewy look and have a
long wearing look just by topping it off
like that but yeah these blend in super
easily and it does help your blush look
lasts a long time if you do that
layering so again this is the pink one
the bright pink berry one I should say
the next one I'm going to show you is
called Plaza pink and this one is a
little more muted looks like this and
this is gonna be more like your classic
peachy pink I guess I'll swatch a little
bit of it and then I'll blend it in and
this is again creamy no shimmer to this
just to put a swatch on without blending
it hold on get a little more so you can
see right there is a swatch of that
without blending and then blending it
out it's gonna be like a really subtle
pink okay so there's the berry right up
there there's this one so this one is a
little more peachy definitely softer if
you're a beginner with cream blushes and
you want to go with something that's a
little more forgiving in terms of the
blending that might be a good one and
then pink flash reminds me of more of
like a straight-up coral and it's a
little brighter as well this is again
creamy no shimmer get some of it on my
finger you can see that's really bright
and just watch it it looks like this I
used this one last night and loved it
blending it in and with the peach blush
over the top Milani minerals in my tie
oh my looks so good or the the NARS
orgasm dupe and the elf blush and
bronzer duo it's kind of like a light
sparkly peach looks so pretty on top of
this so there's that one all blend it
out you can see that these are not
nearly as intense don't look at this and
think that looks like a lip balm I don't
want to try that you know no it will it
will totally blend out and look good so
there you end up with kind of a softer
peach if you the more you blend
where you blend the more I guess muted
the color will get and then there's a
bronze one this is called urban spice
and this is the only one I believe that
has some shimmer in it okay so find a
bear finger here to get some of that on
there it is on my pinky you can see
concentrated it's very warm kind of is
something you can use as a borderline
highlight or contour depending on how
concentrated you left the color and then
blend it out put it right here you know
it's you're just gonna get like a softer
bronze look I've used that a little bit
one time as a contour like right in here
and that can work nice just don't put it
too thick of a layer you know but I mean
these are all really good quality
products I love the amount of color they
deliver how it can extend the wear of
your blush and hey they're available in
the drugstore for a really good price
probably I'm guessing around $3 mark or
less prices always vary by location but
again they're called the blush Yule
cream sticks by NYC I hope you get a
chance to check them out and let me know
what you think have a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
