right now I am talking about some lip
glosses from NYC and I was sent by the
company and why see a lot of new
products from that brand to try and I
know you guys know that I give lots of
honest reviews about drugstore and high
end makeup so I'm always up for trying
something new and especially a brand
that I think is very available and very
affordable for everyone so I'm going to
tell you what I think today about these
extreme lip liner lip glosses and I know
I included one shade in particular in my
recent shopping list ideas video but I
kind of wanted to give more of an in
depth review and show you some of the
other shades that are available and kind
of tell you which ones I think are worth
buying and which ones really are not and
which ones are not necessarily what you
think you'll be getting just by looking
at the packaging in the store so first
off the one I am wearing today was
actually the one I just showed you there
it's Park Avenue pink and it's a
gorgeous looking almost borderline lilac
pink shade in the tube but it's very
sheer it's a light shimmery shade and
I've enjoyed wearing this a lot over the
top of different liners and lipsticks
for example I'm wearing the Knicks or
NYX lip liner in Rose today and I've got
a Park Avenue pink on top of that just
to give it that frosty glossy appearance
now I really one thing that is an
absolute pro to these is the fact that
the texture is really good not too
sticky but just sticky enough to not
drift outside your lip line to stay put
to be really kind of a long wearing lip
gloss if you're not doing a lot of
eating or you know something like that
this is going to stay on your lips for a
relatively long amount of time i like
the amount of gloss you get I like that
it's not too thick and even though some
of these have a little bit of shimmer
it's no shimmer to the point where you
can feel some sort of texture on your
lips you know sometimes you can feel the
chunks of glitter or whatever and that's
not very fun now they all have sort of a
I want to say a borderline melon fruity
sent they're all they all smell pretty
much the same it's it's kind of just
like think of like a sweet fruity scent
but it's fairly light I don't have a
problem with the scent I know some
people sometimes I forget to comment
about the sense in my review videos and
everyone's like you didn't tell us what
it smelled like so there you go but
anyway Park Avenue pink I enjoy I also
my very favorite one of them all and one
that can totally be worn alone if you
want to is Plaza punch this was the one
that I had in my shopping list ideas
video you can see it's got some sparkle
it really turns out to be a similar
color to this I'm liking berry tones
lately if you couldn't tell and so that
one's really good a Chinatown cherry
okay this one would probably be one in
the store that I would gravitate toward
first because I feel like there aren't
enough nice cherry red lip glosses out
there and I would assume this would look
about like that no it does not i will
show you this watch is in a minute and
not really a fan of that one I Chelsea
Rose and Carnegie Mellon honestly they
look pretty similar in the packaging
Chelsea Rose has just a little more
shimmer it seems like and it's a little
more mathy Carnegie Mellon just does
have that little more coral this is
Carnegie Mellon a little more coral to
it but honestly in a swatch they look
almost identical so basically here are
the swatches this is Park Avenue pink
here this is the one I have on over the
top it's you're going to see sort of a
really light frosty pink and it's going
to add a frosty glossy edge to whatever
you have on your lips this is Plaza
punch sorry I don't have all these quite
memorized but this is my favorite
because it really is a true colored
gloss I feel like now this one this next
one here that's the cherry that's this
gorgeous in the packaging Chinatown
cherry right there that one I do not see
it I'm sorry I so wanted to like that
one but I'm just not feeling any color
out of that oops right here Chinatown
i'm gerry not so much these next two are
okay these are kind of like my my
average ones the Chinatown cherry was
sort of the fail of the group I really
like these two and then these two are
kind of average this one is Chelsea Rose
and the one above that is Carnegie
Mellon so you can see how those pretty
much you know you get either one you're
going to get a similar kind of light
neutral somewhat glossy look but this
cherry one even if you squeeze out even
more and try to do with like a fix a
really thick swatch of it you can get a
little more color but it's like it
doesn't show up on your lips like that
just you're just kind of going to get a
clear gloss so well the the feel of it
the texture is very similar across the
board on all of these the amount of
pigmentation and the concentration of
color greatly differs so that was why I
thought was really important to do this
review so you guys would know if you
could use up in the stores that what you
see isn't always what you get in the
packaging um hello as I was saying
though I do think these are a good
product even if you get one and you're
not exactly pleased with the color I
think you are going to like the feel on
your lips and like layering it over on
something that you have on but these two
Park Avenue pink and Plaza punch are my
pics of the group so thanks so much for
watching this video I hope it was
informative for you and if you've tried
these and want to share your opinion
definitely please please with any of my
reviews share that down in the comments
section because I always think it's
helpful for people to know more than one
perspective on a particular product that
they may go out and buy so anyways these
are very affordable I find all my NYC
stuff and at my local Walmart you may
find it elsewhere as well so keep your
eyes out for these thanks for watching
