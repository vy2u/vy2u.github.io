tuning in for this video I have so many
things to talk about like seriously I
have like the longest to-do list for
this video and i want to tell you thank
you so much for tuning in for my first
to New York videos you saw me getting to
New York with my sister and then being
there and meeting malli which was just
an incredible experience like I was
seriously walking around like this
afterwards I was like did that just
happen like I have to watch my video
back to confirm that this actually did
happen in my life so it was so amazing
but the one thing that I didn't really
touch on much in these last two videos
was makeup because we were there for
like two and a half hours for this kind
of beauty blogger beauty editor or
breakfast type thing and so malli went
through tons of makeup information and
just tips for applying the makeup so I
thought you know I really want to do
something just sharing like all the
things that I learn i mean i've been
using some of these tricks and I feel
like it's changed the way I'm putting my
makeup on and even if you don't you know
whatever line of makeup you choose to
use you know you can use these tips and
you can take these these words of advice
and really put them into action now and
i'll be demonstrating them throughout
this video also i have a giveaway coming
out i'll see what's in this bag see what
this is all about i'll be talking about
that at the end of the video so let's
get started you're just tuning in and
you haven't seen my other videos Mally
roncal is a celebrity makeup artist she
has her own line of makeup products she
is talking about here are the very same
things that she used like in the tracy
reese fashion show for new york fashion
week so i mean we're talking like stuff
that's actually being put into action on
celebrities on models and all that so um
I feel like her overall philosophy with
her makeup is kind of a glowy modern
look taking you know the makeup that you
use and using it in a really up
way first thing i want to touch on is
using a concealer as a foundation if you
have a concealer that has sort of a
foundation like consistency you know
what I mean not like thick and creamy
but more of a little bit liquidy
consistency it can be great for just
going over those areas that you need to
cover for example right now all I have
on is concealer dotted around a few
certain areas and Mally has a great
concealer that's really um it really
like kind of hangs together I guess it
doesn't take up on any one particular
area another tip was highlighting under
your makeup if you have some of those
cream highlighters and I'm not talking
something with chunks of glitter in it
but something really subtle and pearly
highlighting under your maybe I'd really
go it starting you know from scratch
giving your skin some dimension instead
of always thinking that highlight has to
be on top which you'll see I'd still do
that but this is kind of a neat way to
ensure that you're not getting look too
shiny but you're giving your face that
dimension and pulling certain parts out
bringing light to certain parts of your
face without looking overly shiny
because you're going to be topping that
with you know blushes and this and that
so it's a really great tip still you
know once you've got your blush on
highlighting is something that malli
really preaches and if you're using the
right kind of highlight I think that's a
key not to metallic not sparkly but just
the perfect kind of pearl type look to
it and going on the cheekbones the nose
I mean the nose would have been
something beforehand I would have
thought I don't want to look shiny I
don't want look you know greasy no it's
it's about getting a glowing skin that
looks healthy and that does entail going
down your nose your cheeks you know kind
of around here above the brows and and
on the brow bone you know it just is of
really great healthy look more like a
smoky eye taking brushes that you have
that are a little bit chubbier like for
example this is about the size of you
know like uh I don't know medium sized
crease brush she's taking a brush like
that and going underneath the eye to
give it a truly smoky look so and even
when you're blending your shadow in you
know kind of reaching out there for some
of those bigger fluffy brushes I know we
already probably have some of these in
our collection but use those and really
think about blending and getting the
most diffused look possible also smokey
eye doesn't have to mean super super
dark I have it as even more blend feel
like I have a smokey eye on right now
it's a very blended subtle smokey eye so
I and that was kind of what she demoed
on me thats a very modern look it's not
necessarily putting you know okay I'm
going to put my light shade here and it
just looks super light and then my super
dark shade you know it's all kind of
smoky that's what that smoky eye
philosophy is that mal a shared she
talked about really getting it into the
lashes like you're practically drawing
right on top of where the lashes connect
into your skin like I feel like
sometimes I will do my eyeliner will do
it real quick and then maybe I'll look
back it later be like there's a little
gap there you know you don't want that
gap because the liner is too on your
upper lash line is meant to make your
lashes look thicker if you're going to
totally not get that if you don't get
close enough to the lash line so I mean
I've been practicing really doing my
liner and getting as close as close as
possible
when I was getting prepped for the
little demonstration in front of
everyone Albie and Malley's like
right-hand man what comes to make up he
is amazing he is not only super talented
but just the nicest person ever and he
was like getting my skin ready and he
was given me some lip gloss and he went
something I noticed that he did is he
took it right out to the furthest point
possible and I don't feel like I have
shrimpy lips but get the most out of the
lips you have whatever you have you know
use them to their fullest extent I would
like normally just put some lip gloss on
okay i got my gloss on but he took it to
the total outer edge too because lip
glosses about catching the light and if
you're catching the light out towards
the furthest edge of your lip possible
your lips are going to look even more
lush and plump so and also kind of
crossing right over the Cupid's bow and
not doing that you know distinct defined
Cupid's bow it's a younger look it's a
more full and fresh look and I noticed
he did that because after he did it i
went back and i kinda like opened my
compact mirror and I'm like oh that's
what he did watched Malley you know her
feelings on this but she is very anti
translucent powder because of the fact
that it does have a certain amount of
color to it many you know white-looking
translucent powders do come off with a
whitish look on your face and so she has
her poreless face defender which you
know is totally like a clear product
here and you can use it to touch up you
can see like it's kind of actually
helped out any shine that is developed
you know on your skin or something this
can be your finishing touch this can be
your touch-up throughout the day but
that
cool now on the topic of that face
defender there have been some new
products that have come out um that
she's going to have in this today's
special value that's coming up this
Friday on QVC and what's interesting is
that when I first found out this today's
special value was coming out i
pre-ordered it so i got on QVC calm and
i found the link and i'm a QVC insider
so you can kind of like see this stuff
ahead of time and The Insider magazine i
know i'm a dork and I like know
everything that's going up but anyways I
found this and i ordered it as soon as I
could little did I know I'd be going to
this event and everyone would be going
home with the today's special value
given straight from malli so I thought I
want to share this I don't want to keep
this to myself I already have the
products so I want to give this to one
of my viewers so as you can see it comes
in a super cute little crossbody bag and
then I'll leave what's in here and i'll
just talk about the stuff that i have
already but you get one of those face
defenders okay so you get this to
experience you know this product that
you just kind of Pat on your skin I
think I described it as the texture of
clear deodorant hey I mean it's amazing
it's so smooth your skin your finger
feels like after you touch it as if you
put a really silky smooth primer on it
only your blotting this over your makeup
and it doesn't change the look your
makeup it doesn't undo the great things
you've done with your makeup but it
helps it kind of last and look fresh
without powder now there are seven
full-size products in here and then you
get the bag so I'm just going to take
you through what's in here this is what
you'll be getting if you get this from
me she has made her face defender into a
highlight as well same texture only it's
a highlight guys so you can just put
this on with your finger you know you
can highlight any area of your face it's
so cool it's so funny like you're
putting that on your face it's such a
different texture and she's got a blush
like that too so if you've ever thought
powder blushes you know they can look
kind of powdery and dry and cream
blushes sometimes feel a little heavy or
hard to blend in she's got a face
defender blush like the
is it's so fresh looking like I'm
putting it on right now and as you can
see no biggie put it on with your
fingers it blends in like silk and then
you're getting one of her ever color
automatic liners this is in black cherry
I want to let you know this is not a
stark dark liner this is a soft eyeliner
it's like if you're going for soft
smokey this is the kind of line you're
getting one of the really nice shadow
sticks that I talk about all the time
this shade is violent as you can see
it's like a pearly purple it's really
pretty once you put that on if you let
it set for a little bit it's not going
to move around on you get the volumizing
mascara which way back when i did my
mascara favorites video remember this
was one of my top favorites i love this
mascara i'm wearing it now really plump
brush fantastic formula very buildable
build up multiple coats no problem with
that this is the volumizing lip gloss
and so on the shade is in flirty I have
it on right now it's not a lip plumper
it does not sting it's more of a
volumizer by nature of it fills in kind
of any creases or lines you have in your
lips and relay just it's more by texture
I guess I'm trying to say that it makes
your lips look plus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
