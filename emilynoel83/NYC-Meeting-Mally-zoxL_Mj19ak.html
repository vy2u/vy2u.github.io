just use other stuff you know for beauty
purposes please to take their cause I
had that little bit of God's eye
you must at all times be aware of every
angle you ask for the worldwide launches
that's the develop talking about our
corners of the eyes or we tend to get
dark so all of these places I should
respect our first ever lip scrub which
I'm so incredibly here it's the
highlighter the highlighter I take and I
put right underneath the brow above the
chin cheekbones okay what are we doing
on Emily Oh doing a smoky eye and got a
bum rap
obviously for years because when you
think smoky eye you think two balls in a
bedsheet like something I'm not doing
the eyeballs something like that but I
have loved a smoky eye since the day I
was born and I think I was important
I'll be - hello we already put the
eyeshadow base which it comes in every
single smokey eye could be when I see
makeup that is in my opinion applied
incorrectly it's because there was no
blending done again don't be afraid
experiment with different shape brushes
underneath the eyes I love it when
eyebrows look very shiny and very alive
by taking this deeper shade and just
blending right in the crease super super
easy you happen to have a face behind so
it's very amazing to do math quick easy
totally blended and it just looks super
super fierce and that's what a smoky eye
is all about smokey eye is one part
technique one part product and one part
they
I am such a huge fan of this girl first
of all you are so you're just so amazing
like I watch you oh yeah and I think
that you're so smart and you're so
together and I like what's the first
thing I said when I saw her I was like I
want to be her friend like and I know
the world feels the same way about you
and I'm just so honored that you came to
give me a phone call I made
what we'd like this thing I want you to
know this I think that the phone
get her to do I said I know she does the
news in the morning make somebody do it
for her here you know what I love about
what you do you do it right and you
represent women so beautifully and you
have all three you like 27 all the
angles that you take in you're so
beautiful and you put yourself together
you are you so proud of her for so much
I love the way you do things and where
it comes from I just I so appreciate
everybody it's like the best and I say
it is makeup right so people are like oh
it's makeup who cares
but what they don't realize that we
realize and the people who watch you and
want me really
is that it's so much right about feeling
good and when you feel good and when you
look good you know you feel good it caps
it off exactly so what is like a little
obsessed with you where you come from
like what I'm from Southern Illinois
well I'm originally from Western
Illinois and I've just been you know say
you know just with trying to make up
ever since high school right oh I just
kept doing it kept doing it randomly
made a video on YouTube
and that was to me how long ago was that
I mean I know you go to late 2007 when I
put my first video this is what I do
it's not my job devotional day tell them
about me if I'm going to review this or
that but people would email me stuff
like you know I watch because my mom's
not around very much and I watch because
you give me like a companion or
something like that man so I mean that
kind of turned it into a different level
and I feel like the people I talk to
their life that's why I think it's so
serious I gotta be honest with you I
don't have time to take it down all
right
I do take time to just look around and
see and I'll never forget the day I
called them
there is this gorgeous though I was like
I am so in love with her I said she just
took cast it I said she has it she's so
and I know I want to and I know once or
birthday December 27 so your Capricorn
like me maybe she's the climber she's a
go is that what it is you are stars so
you are going to whatever you want to do
is gonna happen
