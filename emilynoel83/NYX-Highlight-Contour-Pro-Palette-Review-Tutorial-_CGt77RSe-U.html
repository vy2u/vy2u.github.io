today I am reviewing something /
tutorial something that I have had a lot
of questions about no I don't think
tutorial is a word but that's okay this
is the NYX contour and highlight Pro
palette contains eight removable contour
and highlight shades it sells for I
believe twenty-five dollars and this was
sent to me by NYX very interested in
this product because contouring is all
the rage right now seems like every
brand is coming out with a contouring
palette and today I use this not only on
the face but also for a quick eye look
as well and there's eight shades in here
there really is a lot to work with and I
believe I integrated probably every
shade into this look in some form or
fashion
so I think there are more complex ways
you can play with this palette or some
very simplified ways you could use it
you know just kind of going with one
contour and one highlight shade that's
fine the entire palette is matte with
the exception of this highlight up here
which is kind of a pearly white and this
pearly champagne colored highlight and I
think the textures of these powders are
really nice they are creamy they're
pigmented maybe not as rich and smooth
the texture as the powders in my
Smashbox contour kit which this is kind
of like the current leader of the pack
in my contouring world because I just
think this is simplicity and just
wonderful this here three shades great
quality as highlight is everything I
mean it's just like a perfect kind of
satiny finish just the teeniest bit of
glow in that product to be beautiful to
actually bring light to the face and
give you a little bit of glow this is a
great shade for contouring and then this
can be either mixed in with that shade
to alter it a little bit but these
powders are terrific quality granted
it's going to cost you a little less
than double what the NYX one does and
you're getting a lot more in here but
quality wise I think this is a really
great palette and I just love how simple
it is I know there are quite a few
high-end contour palettes out there
several that I'm kind of like on the
verge of trying like I just got the new
on to face contour kit I am expecting to
get the on estancia Beverly Hills
contour kit which I know I'm kind
I do foresee a massive like contour
palette comparison video coming in the
near future but as far as drugstore
stuff goes there's not really a lot out
there and I must say I do really like
this
I think the shades are really on point
for what one would want for contour is
actually a nice cool tone shade right
here that I think is really contour
friendly just for creating the look of
natural shadows on the skin and then
there are warmer shades and multiple
finishes of highlight you can totally
kind of mix I don't think people always
consider that powders can be mixed but
you could easily tap your brush you know
into one shade in another shade and kind
of create something a little more
customized even beyond these eight
colors that you see here now something a
little confused about is the fact that
these all pop out of the palette and
there are claims made on the next
website that you could like you know
create your own customized palette and
on the NYX website all of these shades
are labeled and have names but there are
no names on the back of any of these in
my palette as I pull them out I don't
know that any of these are currently on
the market individually sold you know
what I'm saying so I would assume that's
the plan in the near future if they're
creating a removable you know palette
that they would come out with refill
shades but I'm just saying I haven't
seen them yet I want to cut to my little
tutorial where I am using this both on
the face and for a quick look on the
eyes because I figured what the heck
there's eight colors and here you could
easily do and I look with it right it's
nothing groundbreaking incredibly
different but it for a quick basically
matte look I think it's great but I
wanted to let you know the products I
have on my face before I started the
contour I'm wearing the hard candy
glamoflauge oh my gosh glamoflage and
I'm wearing camo what this is in the
shade fair I'm going to have a big haul
video coming up with some new products
I've found in the drugstore and
elsewhere but that's but that's the
foundation that I've got all over my
face I used a little bit of my Sonia
Kashuk all covered up concealer in my
darkest areas and then a little bit of
my Maybelline instant age rewind in
brightener just kind of on top of the
cheekbones nothing drastic and set all
of that with my new NYC bebe radiance
skin perfecting powders so that makes up
kind of my face canvas here as we start
the tutorial so to start out I'm going
to contour my cheekbones I really like
using this cool
shade for that area and this is the
contour brush from Real Techniques so
I'm just going to tap into that and I
find that when I think about kind of
pulling my lips over to one side you can
reveal a little bit more of your actual
facial structure so when I go like this
it really pulls out this area and I can
totally see where that indentation is
down under the cheekbone start laying
down this color you can really see that
contour coming in in the right spot
and I think anytime you're wanting to
get a really contoured look it's good to
use I think somewhat small brushes to
not pull your color too far up or too
far down so this is the buffing brush
you've seen me use this at times for
foundation it's great for that but then
it's also nice to just kind of smooth
over any areas where you have contoured
and I basically stopped the contour just
under the apple of my cheek so if I
smile the chubby part right there that's
kind of where it ends for me never
really talked about that little rule of
thumb but that's always kind of what I
think about whenever I am contouring so
going to go back to that shade again
whoops add some hair to the mix that's
always fun
you can kind of blend a little bit with
this small brush but this buffing brush
really does a nice job I think of
diffusing the color out and since this
shape is so nice for creating
natural-looking shadows this is what I
actually like to take down here under
the jawline and down the neck just a bit
so I go in with a larger brush this is
just a big kabuki brush that I've had
for a long time I think I came up with
it at Big Lots years ago it's gone
through a lot of cleanings it's not the
softest brush ever but for body type
stuff it really covers a lot of surface
area and it works just fine now this
palette there are so many shades there
are lots of different ways you could use
it one of the things I really like doing
at this stage of the game is now
creating a little warmth on the face so
I like taking this shade right here and
this is with my blush brush my up and up
blush brush from Target I'm taking a
little bit of that just above where I
contoured almost thinking about where
you'd place blush and then around my
hairline I kind of do a mix of that
shade a little bit of the cool shade and
I just start blending that in right up
around the hairline and around the
temples and this is an area where
contouring might not be my primary focus
but I'm thinking more kind of a bronzing
and where the Sun would naturally hit me
you know I'm generally going to develop
a warmer more tan look up here so that's
why I pull in a warmer shade to go in
this area I kind of think of this area
as the JLo effect because she always has
a really warm kind of sunny looking
sunkissed contour happening right around
her hairline now this is definitely not
part of my routine but the shade I would
use if I were going to contour my nose
would be this color right here the same
one we used in the hollows of the cheeks
and would put it on a smallish brush
like this and just kind of take it
lightly down the sides I don't do a lot
of nose contouring because just the way
my bone structure is you can't really
see it from the side but like once I
start putting product in here there's a
little bump right here kind of where
glasses would rest and any time I go in
with any sort of dark powder that just
shows more so I don't bother with it and
I guess that would be a major contouring
tip is to know your face don't just
go through steps just because
everybody's doing them think about
whether you really need them or whether
actually makes you look better to do it
next you can pull in a different brush
or I've kind of cleaned off this contour
brush from Real Techniques and you've
got all these highlight powders here
this is a pearly shimmery powder you've
got a matte kind of cream powder this
matte banana powder and in this pearly
kind of champagne color and I'm going to
take a little bit of this this yellowish
powder is just not too dark and it's
kind of brightening adds a little
coverage I think actually in the under
eye area so I'm just going to sweep that
right in here just on top of the cheeks
and see how it kind of just really
perfects that area somehow and then I'm
going to pull in a little blush here
just because this is what I would
normally do in the routine you can kind
of see where the placement is but this
is that romantic Rose blush from Milani
playing it right here on the outer part
of the apple of the cheek kind of
pulling forward a bit so think about
seeing it a little bit when your face is
totally you know facing front
but then pulling backward and this is
happening above the deepest part of your
contour and a little bit above that
warmer tan level I put in there which is
not always necessary I just kind of like
to do it if I've got a palette with
different shades I like to work with
them and then my finishing step is
actually just a little bit of this glowy
champagne powder I just like to tap that
right here just really lightly dusting
it across the top of the cheek and the
cheek bone as you can see I'm not really
buffing this into the skin I'm just kind
of placing it exactly where I want it a
little bit of that looks nice down the
nose as well and then I just want to
show you something super simple you can
do with the eyes using this palette I'm
taking this color right here this was
our main cheekbone contour using eye
sigma e25 and just applying this to my
crease same thing here on the other side
and when I take this color in the crease
that's the first spot that I'm putting
my brush but then I kind of think about
pulling the color upward just a little
bit I'm going to do a little highlight
under the brow with this shade this is
one of the two glowy highlights in the
bunch
taking a little bit of this matte
cream and I'm just going to dab some of
that on my lids with my Sonia Kashuk
medium shadow brush and then I'm just
going to pick up some of this darkest
shade with the medium shadow brush I'm
just dabbing a little bit of that right
here in the outer corner so outer part
of the lid a little bit into the crease
no this is not any epic groundbreaking
eye tutorial I just wanted to show you
kind of how these come off as shadows if
you wanted to use them that way and then
taking that same dark brown with a
pencil brush it just gives a little you
know super soft definition to the eye
there and it's a really legit pigmented
Brown and for just a touch of brightness
around the inner corner I'm going to the
white pearly color and just popping the
inner corner a bit with that makes it
look a little dewy and then I'm just
going to finish this look with my two
eyeliner go twos and one is the Milani
shadow eyes and almond cream that's
going to go right here in the lower
inner rim for brightness and I'm using
my Jordana color in the liquid liner in
black envy across the upper lash line
so as far as the finished look that this
contour palette gives I would say it's
looking pretty darn good and you know I
had a good base with the foundation
evening out my skintone and that is
super important you're not ever going to
feel the true effects of contours and
blushes unless you've got a really
evened out skin tone from your
foundation so just keep that in mind I
think that's really important in my lit
by the way this is a new gloss from hard
candy it's called fierce effects daring
lip gloss in 963 I think it had another
name but that was on the outer label and
as I look at this finished product at
the look I think there really is an
advantage to having both you know cool
and warm tone shades to use as you
contour I really did a similar method
with this palette to what I do with the
smashbox one because like I said this
contains a cool and a warm and I love
how you know your deepest shadow is that
cool tone shade and then you kind of get
on top of it with a little more warmth I
love what's happening around the
forehead the only thing that kind of
ends up requiring a little more effort
is the fact that your highlights are
kind of in extremes here they're either
fully matte or pretty darn shimmery but
you do have this nice yellow tone which
I think can be a little bit corrective
and actually adds some decent coverage
so that was nice and then you can add as
much glow as you want or not on top of
it but I think it really would have been
ideal if this puppy right here was like
a satin finish like the highlight is in
the Smashbox kit that would have been
kind of a really quick you know one-step
highlight for me I'm really loving the
contour I'm loving the glow that this
palette is giving it's really all the
tones that one might need so many
options in these multi shade palettes I
think it's really all about technique
and if you've got a decent texture to
work with which I think these are
definitely a decently creamy pigmented
texture I think it's really going to be
a workable thing for a lot of people so
thank you guys for watching this video I
hope it was informative if you were
considering that palette I'd give it a
couple thumbs up for sure and one more
thing I should probably mention if it
comes down to traveling with one of
these I'm definitely throwing in the
Smashbox one because just the size on
this it's kind of bulky I would maybe be
a little concerned about all those pans
of powder and something breaking perhaps
on me while options are always
great I do still love the compact
simplicity of this palette thanks again
guys I will see you all very soon I have
a haul video coming up a pretty
extensive haul with a lot of new cool
drugstore items to talk about some cool
and not cool so that's always exciting
I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
