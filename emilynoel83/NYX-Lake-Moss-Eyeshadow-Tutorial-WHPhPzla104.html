tutorials here so I hope this isn't too
close up and scary but I think you'll be
able to see what I'm doing a little bit
better this is going to be a tutorial on
the trio from NYX called Lake moss and I
actually noticed a comment someone left
that had also received this trio and
they were saying like well how do I use
it and I can see why it would be kind of
confusing because if you look at the
colors they're all kind of like
basically contour shades you know darker
shades or liner shades even that you
could use so you do have to kind of work
in another color I think to sort of make
this more wearable but basically the
colors you're getting this is sort of a
sparkly deep charcoal green shade it's
really unique I've never seen a color
really like this anywhere else but it's
got some Sparkle and it's like a dark
dark green and then this middle shade is
a navy and the n shade is a dark plum
and these have just a hint of maybe just
a little bit of shimmer in these two but
this one really has the sparkle in it so
I'm going to show you how to use this
and I'm going to work in another shade
from wet and wild it's cream it's this
single because after you apply your
primer you're just going to apply this
shade all over your lid so just going to
use my eyeshadow brush and just apply
that all over my lid
just to give us a little bit more of a I
mean I don't I don't always like to go
entirely dark all over my eyelids so I
think this shadow just kind of adds a
little bit to the whole look the next
thing I'm going to do is reach for a
smaller brush this is a low cornell
brush it is 270 Maxine's mop so it's
very small and I'm going to dip into
that that green shade the dark kind of
sparkly charcoal green and I'm going to
apply that basically right at the outer
corner and kind of ease it in so it's
like the outer half of my eye
and I'm just going to work it up to the
crease just a little bit and this isn't
really a blending brush this is more
just kind of a lay the color down sort
of brush and I'm going to also use that
to go right under the lower part two
just a little bit okay so next I'm going
to go to my blending brush and just use
this to blend that color out just a
little bit again this is this comes off
as just kind of smoky looking but it
does have I mean some sparkle and it is
like a dark green okay so now you've
blended that out a little bit more we're
going to go for that plum shade and
we're going to use that sort of on the
inner part of our crease shades of plum
and mauve generally you have a little
bit more of a warmer effect and I just I
like incorporating that color into this
looks oh so you can see where we're
going with this now and just kind of
blend it a little bit over the green and
you'll get kind of a nice little halo of
color there so after that we're going to
take the shade that I surprise surprise
uses my highlight shade the middle shade
it's called golden sunrise in the
covergirl of golden sunset trio and
where's my brush and I'm just going to
use that just all over the top here just
to warm it up because I've gone pretty
bronzy all over the rest of my face and
so this kind of just continues that work
and I'm going to grab my covergirl
perfect point eyeliner in midnight blue
and I'm going to whine about halfway and
your three quarters of the way in on my
upper lash line with that so this is
just a nice name
shade sorry you're getting rid of those
still kind of trying to work this new
camera angle and go right out to the
edge and then start on the lower click
there and we're going to go all the way
under the eye all the way across
okay and then this is where that third
shade comes into play here then good
open again geez now we're going to use
this Navy shade the one right in middle
and grab your liner brush and just dip
it in there and we're just going to go
right over the top of our Navy liner
with our Navy shadow just brings the
color out a little bit more and go over
the top lash line to and this is I me if
you're wondering where you can wear this
look I mean this is a a nice look for
fall all the colors are kind of you know
a little bit deeper so I mean I think
you could wear this look for every day I
think this would be a fun look for going
out or you know whatever it's just kind
of interesting smokey eye that's a
little more subtle because you're using
you're using colors that aren't
traditional somewhat geckos I mean
you're using dark purple dark blue dark
green and so it's a nice twist on the
smoky eye and you could use any to
simplify the look you could really just
use a light shade on your lid and then
choose any one of those colors as your
crease shade so this is kind of like a
crease color / liner color palette and I
mean or you could go really dark and put
one all over your lid and then use
another one in the crease or whatever I
mean it's really endless possibilities
but I'm just close your lashes i'm using
my bit voluminous carbon black mascara
and run it through your lashes
I already did my eyebrows alright and
there you go there's a look at your at
your finished product I hope you guys
like this look and we're able to see a
little better what I was doing as I did
it and let me know if you have any
questions bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
