here today in this video I'm going to
talk about some new kind of exciting
products from NYX and they are the new
ombre blushes and also these ombre lip
colors I got mine off of ulties website
and you might notice that the cost on
these products is a little bit higher
than what you might expect I mean just
judging by other NYX lip products and
blushes these were I think around $10
and these were around 11 so my thought
was I loved the concept the shades look
beautiful but you know do they work are
they going to be worth it so just a
classic around compact here with these
blushes they do have a mirror you can
see the ombre concept however there's
not quite as much of a fade as I was
expecting with these one product that I
thought did a really really seamless
ombre was the it cosmetics CC plus
bronzer it went from like a matte
bronzer all the way to a shimmery
highlight and in the middle you really
felt like you were transitioning between
those two shades with these I feel like
it's kind of more of a cut-off like
we're going to give you two shades and
just kind of mesh them in a little bit
like if you saw I shadow this way you
wouldn't think it was blended right I
can't speak for the entire line but all
of the shades that I have had at least
some amount of shimmer so the first one
I'll show you here is called nude to me
and this is a really like coppery tight
blush it might even strike you at a
glance to think maybe that's a bronzer
but to me especially when it sheared out
I see so much warmth in this it's
definitely still a blush and then this
lighter shade is just kind of a light
gold it does have some shimmer and yes I
feel like that can act as a highlight
however don't feel like you have to use
this like one shade one way and then the
other shade separately another thing you
can do is definitely just swirl your
brush in both and get a little bit more
custom type color I also picked up this
peach this is called strictly chic I
would say this is more of a satin finish
here the nude to me definitely had more
shimmer in the larger portion of the
product and I noticed a little bit more
of a fade happening into the lighter
peach shade up top once I share this out
on my skin it kind of seems like it
performs like a matte it's just you're
not going to wear it concentrated enough
to see a lot of shimmer happening
but I do think this is a beautifully
pigmented peach color and then the shade
that I was most interested in when I was
browsing the website was this one called
mauve me so you've got this very cool
mauve colored blush and then it fades
into a really light cool pink at the top
and what this one I can see that there's
much less compared to the others there's
less of a light top shade there that
it's blending into a shade has a similar
level of shimmer to it as the nude one
the first one that I mentioned but it's
kind of a deceptive shade because you
really lay it on thick and the light's
not catching it and it seems darker but
when you wear the sheer and you know
light is coming to that shade and
reflecting a little bit off of the
shimmer it can look like just the
lightest softest mom so interesting
things happening with these colors
something about the formula that I
noticed they're very pigmented I mean
the main color in each of these is just
there's a lot to it I find that when I
tap into it I only tap once I tap off
the excess and with each shade except
the peach I felt the need to also like
tap off onto my hand to get an even
lighter application that way I could
build it up if I wanted to but I mean
you can go big with these these are
colorful blushes something I especially
like about the mob me and the nude to me
shades is I can do something with my
blush that I've really been enjoying I
think it was actually prompted by these
products but it's going a little bit
lower on the cheek with my blush
sweeping back it's like not exactly
where my contour would be but going
slightly above that and then kind of
lightly blending it out as I go upwards
so I will demonstrate this in the demo
but I'm just really liking that look I
think it defines the cheeks more but you
still got a lot of radiance happening on
the skin so today I used a combination
of a couple of these I use the deeper
tone from the nude to me and I used my
up-and-up blush brush and so just like I
said I feel like I'm getting the most
concentrated amount of product a little
bit lower on the cheek and then as I
blend I gently pull that color up just a
little bit so do that on both sides and
then I brought in my up and up highlight
brush to go into this lighter shade so I
could have blended these both together
to get a little different look
I kind of like with this one using them
separate because I feel like you have a
distinct blush and highlight here if you
want more of that apple of the cheek pop
I think the one called strictly chic
would you have the peach color groups
this Beach Gellar really I think looks
beautiful right here on the apples of
the cheeks so I wouldn't so much wear
this one in that same manner because
it's just not as deep of a blush but it
is a very pretty shade the mauve me
color I would use in a very similar
manner to the nude to me again taking it
right in almost like just above the
hollow of the cheek blending upward I
think that gives a beautiful look and
just a little bit different look than
just the standard here's my condor
here's my blush you know a little
different placement I think that's okay
for me personally the things that are
most unique to my collection would be
these kinds of colors I really like them
I love that method of application that I
described a peachy one I feel like I'm
just loaded down with blushes of that
type in my collection so it's not as
unique for me now the thing I am
probably most excited to tell you about
in this video are the ombre lip duos and
I just not too long ago mentioned in the
Emily Awards how much I love those NYX
slide-on lip liners really long wearing
very creamy love the shade range I mean
those are just awesome products these
when you see these kind of looking like
that pencil style they're not the same
formula they don't quite lock in in the
same way and they definitely do stay in
place on my lips they don't feather
outside my lips which I really
appreciate
but whereas I could lightly kind of
blend over my lips when I'm wearing one
of the slide on pencils and product
would not move these do have the
potential to be smudged a little bit
which i think is a good thing because
really that's what the application is
all about with these I think it's
putting on one color smudging in another
color and getting a little bit different
look and a kind of customized look for
what you're wanting you're gonna have
one side of this pencil that's a little
bit thicker it's not going to be as big
as a lot of the Jumbo pencils you might
have I'm thinking about like jumbo
shadow sticks and that kind of thing
it's a little more fine than that so I'm
really happy about that you get it and
it is nicely formed to a tip at the end
but I still think I'll continue to like
this
once that wears down because it's not so
super wide but then the other end is a
very fine tip as you can see both sides
are retractable and this is going to be
more the size of a standard lip liner so
the smaller side will always be the
darker side that's at least the trend
I've noticed with the four that I have
and the general formula that I enjoy
with applying these and I'm sure there
are other ways to do it but this is just
the look that I like because I feel like
it's subtle it doesn't really look like
oh my gosh I have created an ombre lip
it looks like more of a natural just
fade and I think it always makes the
lips look fuller when I do it this way
so I take the lighter side I fill in my
lips entirely then I take the deeper
smaller end and I kind of work in from
the outsides on both the bottom lip and
the top lip and then think like I'm
blending two eyeshadows together I Pat
over the border of what I've done with
my finger just right where the colors
start to overlap and then if I feel like
I've lost any color from the main shade
the larger part of the stick I'll maybe
add a little bit more like center of the
lower lip to really make that pop and
these go on so well it is a really
creamy formula and I think they were
described as a satin matte finish and I
mean they really do look matte all of
these come off matte on my lips I see no
shine and I think this is a great method
to wear mattes because they don't look
as flat because you've created that
dimension with the dark and light colors
I love the concept but I do feel
differently about some of these shades
and I'll show you all these going on
first off ginger and nutmeg this would
be the most nude neutral um duo that I
have so your lightest shade like a
classic nude I really like that color
the darker side is like a dark plum and
here's where I think it's a little
tricky there is a big leap between these
two shades so when I go to add the
darker side I feel like I don't know
I've gotten a little better at it
because I've been practicing you've got
to be a little bit more careful in
making that fade look good but as I
described before I put it on and I just
kind of DAB over the edges to blend I'm
not saying I just like this one I just
think it's the trickiest to use and if I
were making it I would have maybe made
the dark end just a little bit lighter
the next one I'll show you is freckles
and speckles and
this one has probably the least contrast
between the larger end and the smaller
end so you're working with kind of a
warm pink shade a really rosy pretty
color all over the lips and then it's
just like a little bit deeper pink that
is paired with this and when I put that
on the outside I just don't see a lot of
difference with the other ones so this
is one that I would skip if you're
really after the ombre effect and the
color is beautiful but it's just not
really giving you the feel that you're
working to separate shades into one okay
these next two are my favorites I'm so
excited of if you like the cool pink
kind of Mavi lip you will love
rags-to-riches so the one end here as I
said light cool pink really beautiful
shade just in itself and then the other
color that you're working into that is
going to be like a dark almost brownish
berry they're far enough apart from each
other that you can create a really nice
ombre look but not so opposite ends of
the spectrum that it's really difficult
so I just love the finished look that I
get with this I was wearing this in my
Emily awards video for eyes and I got so
many questions about what lip color is
it and I just I love that one my other
top pick that is just way way up there
with that one is the one called Bonnie
and Clyde this is such a great idea for
those of you who like the thought of a
bold red lip but you want to dial it
back down like you don't really want to
go full-on bright red all across the
lips because you've got a very warm red
on one side almost a little bit of an
orange --red very retro old-school makes
me think of a pin-up girl type red and
then you've got a dark berry to blend in
with that it makes that whole tomato red
vibe a lot more approachable in my
opinion I think this might be the most
beautiful ombre effect of all of them I
feel like the lips are matte yet they
look full they appear to have dimension
it's just a really pretty twist on a red
lips so I miss is the one I've been
wearing throughout the video I
absolutely love it I mean and my top
picks of anything I've talked about in
this video would probably be these two
lip colors they just knock my socks off
the Bonnie and Clyde and the rags and
riches not that I dislike the other two
I just think these
were the perfect execution of the ombre
colors also really enjoyed the mauve me
blush and the nude to me blush different
type shades that I'm not crawling with
in my collection you know it's not
another pink it's not another peach
they're deeper tones that I think are
really fun to wear a little bit lower on
the cheeks so I hope this was useful to
you if you're considering some of these
products I mean I know the price is a
little higher on them but they're really
fun I have had so much fun playing with
those ombre lip colors and I kind of
really want to try some more of them not
that I need more but they are so fun to
play with so thank you guys for watching
I will see you again very soon
