this video this is just gonna be a quick
review on a product I got from cherry
culture calm actually I've gotten them
over a span of time and have realized
that I like them a lot and it's a lip
gloss called the nicks or NYX round lip
gloss it also says I don't know what the
significance of this it says girls right
there I guess it's I'm not sure what
that even really means but many people
refer to these just as the round lip
glosses they're $2 on cherry culture
calm and they have a pretty wide
selection of shades so I would encourage
the you to get on there and get on the
website and browse through but even more
than that in terms of shade selection
maybe google it or like look it up on
YouTube see what swashes people have put
out because my big issue with these is
just the fact that and with a lot of
makeup I get off with cherry culture in
general is that the little
representations they have of the shades
are really not accurate you've really
got to kind of guess or look at what
somebody else has picked up and and see
it for yourself before I mean I don't
buy necessarily just based on those
swatches but fortunately there are so
many resources through websites like
makeup talk makeup alley YouTube Google
you know whatever so do a little
research before you go picking out
shades whether it's the red lipstick
which I really like and also these but
these are great product if you can get
your hands on the shades you want the
one that I'm wearing today this appears
I'm not sure if it's showing up really
this red it's not super red it's a shade
called amethyst and this is probably my
favorite one this is the one I probably
get the most questions about if I'm
wearing it in a video and I forget to
say oh yeah I put on this lip gloss and
if I can swatch it for you here it's
just kind of a pretty shimmery deep pink
shade it's how I would describe it it's
got sort of a metallic finish to it
really I'm not sure how much you can
tell it from my lips oh you can really
tell in the packaging there and sort of
in that swatch so it's got a little bit
of a metallic finish deep rose
shade so I really like that I'm just
gonna take you through my shades that I
have first and then I'll go through more
of the texture and consistency this
other one I have is called soap opera
queen and I actually saw this on one of
Julie G's videos and I thought oh that
looks for like a really nice pink lip
gloss and this has some sparkle to it
it's not big and like chunky glare but
it is a little more sparkly and it's a
little more of a transparent shade I
think I've wear this in one of my
tutorials recently but pretty sparkly
but kind of more feels like a gel almost
more than just a creamy color I love
that all three of these that I have are
like slightly different in the way they
are this one's more like a metallic this
one's kind of slightly more transparent
with some glitter in it and this last
one is whipped and it's a nice nude
shade and this is just like a creamy
creamy shade and this may not even show
up a real well on my hand but you can
see there this will show up like
basically a nude lip color so it's
interesting like I said it's not you
know with some lines it's like okay
every lip gloss of this certain type is
gonna have glitter in it that's gonna
you know it's gonna be shimmery or it's
gonna just be creamy the neat thing
about this is the fact that they all are
a little bit different you know they all
and obviously these are three different
shades but you know in terms of the
finish metallic glittery creamy so like
I said it's important to kind of look
around and do your research to make sure
you know what you're getting I mean two
dollars isn't a lot but still it's two
dollars so I get a product that you know
your color you're never gonna use I
actually had one shade that I've since
tossed out because it was so dark and
the swatch didn't look that dark but it
was so so dark I was like I'm never
gonna wear this so I actually pitched it
and I hate hate having to do that but it
was virtually unwearable for me in you
I just didn't like it so and to save you
the trouble just look it up yourself I'm
trying to think of anything else I have
to add this is not a sticky lip gloss if
you are one of those people that hates
the feeling that your lips are almost
sticking together a little bit or your
hairs always getting caught in your lips
this is not a sticky lip gloss it is
really really smooth but it walks a fine
line because you know how when you hear
somebody talking about how so it's not
sticky at all then you wonder well is it
gonna slide right off my lips or you
know out of my lip line but I don't have
that issue either I could see that if
you actually if you kind of went a
little overboard and put too much on you
might have that issue but really this
stays on my lips it doesn't feel sticky
the staying power the fact that it
doesn't have a whole lot of stickiness
to it that could be why the staying
power isn't wonderful however I think if
you're buying this these two dollar lip
glosses chances are you're buying this
for the color selection and the fact
that you know oh maybe I want to try you
know that sparkly pink shade and you can
get away with it for two dollars if it
doesn't work it's not a huge crisis but
you know these are these are just good
to kind of have that color in your group
if you don't wear a lot of nudes and you
wanted to try a nude you know I like all
three of these that I have so I would
recommend all three to you but this is
definitely a worthwhile thing if you
want to experiment with lip gloss and
get some shades that aren't gonna drive
your lips crazy because they're so
sticky I think you would like these so I
will have a link in the side to tell you
where to go to find them and get more
information and I think that's all have
a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
