about my favorite nail polishes I
realized that in the Emily Awards the
nail polishes didn't even get a category
and I don't know why but it just I guess
it just worked out that way I didn't
even think about it and so a lot of
people have asked you know what nail
polishes do you like or if I'm wearing
certain ones what nail polish is that so
I kind of tried to keep in mind the ones
that I've gotten a lot of questions
about and the ones that I personally
like a lot and I've also been painting
my nails a lot more lately I mean I was
kind of in a phase for almost a year or
so where I was doing a lot of the glue
on nails so I think those are still
great but I just kind of gotten in this
mode where I like changing it up I've
got neutral polishes pastels metallics
and some fun bright colors as well and
then a couple of top coats that I really
like so let's get started for neutrals
my first favorite is beige blast and
this is a Sally Hansen insta-dry and
it's just a very nude type type of
polish there's you know it's gonna give
you that really light light color and
you could wear it sheer but with a
couple of coats this is really going to
give you just a nice polished look that
goes with absolutely anything I've worn
this a lot and a lot of people will ask
what's that on your nails and what's
neat about the insta-dry is that the
brush is kind of designed to be extra
wide so I guess it doesn't take quite as
many swipes to get it all on your nail
you do like a little more color if you
don't like quite that you know just
light and creamy and you want it a
little deeper the Rimmel lasting finish
pro in Barenaked if you compare the two
you can see this one is more like makes
you think of like a nice nude lip gloss
or something like that and both of these
that I've talked about so far are creamy
so there's not any shimmer or glitter in
them but this one is just really really
nice because it also makes sure makes
your fingers look longer it just kind of
elongates the look of your hand and
because it does kind of blend in with
that skin tone look so once again
regardless of what you're wearing you
get that finished polish or something a
little bit deeper one that I've kind of
just it's really grown on me I think I
picked it up I thought okay I'm going to
just try this didn't really think I'd
love it
much but I totally do and it's the Sally
Hansen complete salon manicure which is
a formula that I love and it lasts
really well once called commander and
chic so a little bit deeper kind of topi
gray shade and I just love it so much
it's creamy its rich you put this on and
you don't necessarily even have to do a
top coat with this if you don't want to
I just really love the amount of color
it gives off without a whole lot of
effort next I'm going to talk about some
favorite pastels and sometimes these
border on really being neutral also
because they can work with a lot of
things take this light pink for example
this is by finger paints and the shade
is called shall i illustrate and what
this is is kind of a pink with a little
bit of a it's kind of like a pearly pink
with a little hint of gold undertone to
it so if you see it just right in the
light and you'd be able to tell that but
this is available at Sally Beauty Supply
you can't beat just a nice light pink
manicure for working with your outfits
and looking polished but not overdone I
mean I just think it's a very delicate
look on the hand a brand that I
mentioned way back when is the Sally
girl little mini nail polishes you will
be surprised at how well these wear on
your nails without chipping I have been
so impressed I actually have a bunch of
these and a couple of my favorites are
actually these pastel shades one is
called angel baby and it's a very very
light lilac and I love it I am you know
basically out of this one I can't quite
get any more out and then this other
shade that I have is called spank and so
that's kind of like it makes you think a
little bit lavender but with more pink
so those I love next are my metallic
shades or just sort of my metallic tones
in color like metal tones I guess like
gold and one that I have here is from
China Glaze and it's midnight kiss and I
hope this is not limited edition but I
fear with this top on it maybe it is but
I'm wondering if there's something
similar in the line because I got this
around Christmas time and a Christmas
kit and this I love because when you
look at it really up close you can see
that it doesn't have you know
a lot of glitter there but it just has
the nicest golden Sheen ins and and
shimmer to it how two coats of this and
you are totally set to sometimes when
you get into the real glittery nail
polishes it looks so gorgeous in the
container and then you go to put on your
nails and it's like the neverending
process of trying to make it look like
it does in the bottle but this really
looks this way from Sonia Kashuk and it
is called smoke and mirrors and this one
is a silver and it is very metallic it's
it kind of reminds me of that China
Glaze one in that you're getting a fine
shimmer here but you're not getting with
a lot of glitter something that I tried
putting on top of that silver one and I
love just from Nicole by OPI and it is
called tip of the iceberg so this is
like your classic silver glittery nail
polish put it over that and it's like
wow if you had like a formal event to go
to and you just wanted your nails to
totally pop and kind of give off the
effect that you know the bling on your
rings or your earrings or something like
that have I think that would be so
pretty from China Glaze and it's called
avalanche and this is one of my
favorites
toenail shades think of like a sort of
gunmetal deep almost remind you of steel
type of shade with some blue infused in
it it's so pretty
there again there's no sparkle this is
this is very metallic but it's just it's
just a beautiful shade and its unique
and you're not gonna run into this shade
just everywhere now I have three more
colorful shades that I want to talk
about and one is the Sally Hansen
completes a long manicure in red Zin and
this is what I have on my nails right
now what I like about this particular
red is that it's a little bit deeper and
I feel like in a way it almost clashes
less with what you put on this wouldn't
be my ideal it look much better with the
out but I head up on yesterday than with
the pink but still I mean I do like this
color of red a lot I just think it's
very glossy very rich and I just like
like that has that slightly deeper twist
to it than like that bright cherry or
fire-engine red really awesome unique
color from China Glaze I love that they
have some things that you just don't see
anywhere else and one of those shades is
called Awakening and I've blogged about
this before been asked about it what
I've had it on but you're seeing kind of
pinky purple but once it hits the light
you'll also see tones of gold and just
it's so gorgeous I think this looks
great on fingers on toenails I mean it
the way it catches the light and picks
up so many different shades I feel makes
it very wearable but I love a good hot
pink and one of my favorites is the
Nicole by OPI
it's called believe it do it can you
hear those bells cupcake just walked in
with her little she has this little toy
it's like a a little leopard print thing
with a bell on a stick and it's it's
clear the type of thing like you hold
out and she's supposed to jump that but
she likes to take the end of it put it
in her mouth and take it places she'll
jump on the bed with it she'll just take
it it will go in the shower with I mean
nowhere is off-limits for cupcake that's
what I've found since I've had this
shade again it's it's a bright pink and
at times it has AIDS what seems like a
blueish undertone Ins at times it seems
almost golden so I love that I think
this is so fun on toes in the summertime
summer it's so cold here but I really do
like this pink and there are a lot of
Pink's out there but this is just kind
of the one that I go back to like oh
that's my favorite just a couple of top
coats to tell you about one is from
Sally's and it's called out the door and
a lot of top because I've had like
Stesha vite get really thick and the
guy's thick the thick kind of quickly
you know it's like that shouldn't be
getting that almost unwearable at this
point in time but this one is a little
bit thinner but it's still pretty fast
drying and then one of the ultimate
fastest drying but it sort of has that
thickness problem again a Sally Hansen
mega shine but this is available at the
drugstore you can see it's in the
mirrored container it's called mega
shine and it works so well this is one
of the fastest dragging ones I've tried
so those are my nail polish favorites I
hope you don't feel like I've neglected
nail
it's anymore after this video so thanks
so much for watching let me know if
you've got some favorite shades because
I think I'm always up for trying more
nail polish is just one of those things
it's so fun to experiment with because
it's I don't know it's very low risk
it's like you try on a nail polish it's
like okay you know maybe I don't love
that one but I'll try this one and you
just feel very free to try new things I
think wear nail polish goes so thanks
for watching have a wonderful day and I
will see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
