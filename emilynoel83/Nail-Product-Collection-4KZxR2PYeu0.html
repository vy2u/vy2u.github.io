wanted to go ahead and show you today my
nail collection um it's kind of long
overdue I was meaning to show you this a
while back that didn't get around to it
but I have had some questions you know
do you have this if you have that and so
i just thought i would show you what i
have and maybe highlight some favorite
items and also i wanted to start out
though by just giving a few tips for
growing your nails many of you have been
with me from the start and you probably
recall like in my really early videos
some very short stubby nails and i had
said in some video just giving facts
about myself that I would bite my nails
and I really had for a very long time
but pretty much over the ever since i
started my youtube journey here um I
kind of decided I was going to stop that
and because I wanted to have nice pretty
nails and as you can see I do a nail
story on the day my nail polish is
chipping off but you can see like um you
know they've they've grown and I enjoy
keeping them keeping them nice and stuff
but and it can be a challenge but I get
asked sometimes from those of you who
didn't know how short my nails used to
be how do you get him to be so long and
for me the key was to keep them painted
i oftentimes you know as my nails didn't
have anything done to him I would just
like start picking at them and you know
messing up my cuticle and things like
that and so if I would keep them done it
would kind of like make me feel like oh
they look nice right now I don't want to
mess with them at all and yeah way back
in the day you know I've done that no
bite so it's like a bitter tasting nail
polish didn't work for me and it just
right now I mean throughout that whole
time it was a matter of keeping them
painted keeping like a top coat on them
every couple of days to keep it really
fresh and to um kind of lock in whatever
I put on there and it really helped me a
lot you know I would just kind of get in
the habit of like maybe on Sundays or
whatever i'm going to redo my nails for
the week and you know slowly but surely
it happened and
it can be hard because you know we all
want instant results on stuff but nails
do take a while to grow but when they do
it's just a matter of maintaining them
and that's kind of where I'm at now but
yeah that was the key for me it may not
be the key for everyone some people may
not have that same frustration where if
there's a little chip and then you start
picking out that's what I would always
do so if I could keep them nice and
maintain that it kept me from wanting to
bite my nails and so anyway I hope
that's a little tip for any of you nail
biters out there right now they're
looking to kick the habit I guess there
are worse habits you could have in this
world but maybe that'll help those of
you that are trying to stop so anyway
let's go ahead and take a look at my
collection alright my friends this is my
nail area as you can see it's just a
little cart and it actually goes up
higher up in here is where I've got some
jewelry store like you know rings or
earrings and different things like that
it's actually like a tackle box and I
had put my stuff in there when i moved
to college and just kind of held on to
it ever since it keeps it organized
until i get you know like a nice big
place to put my rings like my bigger
bracelets up there but down in here is
the nail collection and so i'm just
going to start up in here in this little
shelf area I got a little divided I'm
sort of practically a Tupperware dish I
guess you'd say and I've got some
lotions in there one of these that I
really like is the Vaseline healthy hand
and nail lotion it's really nice for
after you take off your old nail polish
and and you know this nail polish
removers can be very drying and so you
put some of that lotion on and it's
actually supposed to help harden your
nails and strengthen them so I put that
on you know before I go ahead with my
polish and stuff and I really like that
some other things I have in here I've
got like a Sally Hansen cuticle cream
just some little lotions that picked up
over time from Avon these are really
neat these are little on individual toe
separators that i got from Sally's and
it's nice because if you don't like
these that kind of
you know you have to try to keep them
snug in there between all your toes here
you can just use a couple between your
toes and all your toes are separated
there so those are kind of fun they're
really soft too I got some of these
little buffer things and over here just
sort of a container of emery boards and
some of these little corrector nail
corrector pins touch one of these I like
here that's many of this many of these
things are from Sally's so get ready
everybody this one is from beauty
secrets and it's just one of those nice
it's like a felt tip pen marker sort of
thing and you just help you remove your
mistakes Oh another thing I've been
loving lately is this thing from ELF
it's a ones that say they're nourishing
cuticle pen with avocado and almond oils
and so it's got a lot of vitamins in it
and basically this looks like a looks
kind of like a marker tip there and
that's nice to use after I do my you
know that Vaseline lotion on my hands
then I used that little marker just two
or the little it's not a marker the
cuticle pen to sort of nourish my
cuticle area it's very moisturizing and
nice so that's from elfin that runs
about 99 cents eyes lips face calm love
that great would be a great purchase
there if you're thinking of picking up
some things just random emery boards and
nail buffers and whatnot I've got some
nail polish remover and sort of in the
back there if you really look I've got
an electronic buffer that I got to a
while back for Christmas and I'm really
enjoying that it's got different some
like buffer heads and things like that
and back in there um let's see some
extra emery boards extra nail polishes
and things like that so there's sort of
my nail care area and here is where i
have many of my nail polishes and so um
you can see it's kind of dim i need to
get some bitter lighting down here i
guess i don't often shoot videos you
know bottom drawer of the nail area
but I've got quite a few nail polishes
that I've racked up and I actually just
recently weeded out you know older ones
once that I never end up wearing so this
is fairly new and updated so um I don't
know if you can tell but there's like a
little container within a container here
on the side and that's where I keep a
lot of the things that I would use for
say a French manicure like my very
favorite top coat my MVP nail product is
a sally hansen mega shine love that
nothing has dried faster for me than
this and it drives to a solid not just
tacky that's cheating when they say it
dries and then it's just tacky and it's
just some other things that I'm liking
lately i like the sally hansen insta-dry
in beige blast oh my gosh great if you
only do a couple coats even it looks
like sort of a nude manicure or
something it's really pretty if I do a
French manicure I'll often use these two
shades from Orly it's just the early um
french tip in white tips and then
Beverly Hills manicure in Beverly Hills
plum so those are sort of just some more
popular items I've got a lot in there
from Rimmel that I've used over time
definitely a lot of Sally Hansen these
little guys I featured in a video before
but those are the LA Colors Art Deco
things that you can do little designs on
Mary Kay I don't know how if these are
kind of up these probably aren't up with
the new packaging for Mary Kay but these
last a really long time the Mary Kay
nail polishes I have them in red and
pink shade and maybe one other shade and
they're really nice actually to tell you
the truth I'm not even sure if Mary Kay
still does nail polishes so sorry if
I've got any hopes up there but those
have been really good even just really
cheap things you know nail polish is one
of those things you don't necessarily
have to spend a lot of money on if you
can get a good you know top coat that
you can count on you can make some
basically crummy nail polishes last a
while
I've lon has some really nice ones that
dry fairly quickly this one is in cherry
crush that's just a good read standby
shave there and this one's kind of fun
from Orly it's it's really like golden
ian has that beautiful shimmer to it
that is pearl wisdom so that's fun um
what else another you know people tend
to get me you know as a gift these sort
of like kind of berry shades and they
really do work well for a lot of
instances in my life so they're kind of
I don't know for you professional
looking this shade is gorgeous i love
this color it's like golden ii pink and
the shade is blushing bride it's sally
hansen diamond strength that is awesome
you know one kind of nail polish that I
don't have that I want to try is the
China Glaze stuff which i know is
available at my local Sally's so I'll
have to look into that this has little
hearts and it's from Maybelline and I
got to show you before I go oh this is
what I used to just remove you know one
finger at a time basically nail polish
remover got this probably from walmart
and then this little container i keep it
somewhere else but i just wanted to pull
it down for you guys these are all the
little 99 cent or 89 cent with your
Sally card the little Sally girl and
individual polishes I love them they are
such good quality for the price tonight
pick up I mean collectively there's
probably one two three four five six
seven eight nine you know only twelve
dollars worth for everything in here and
I just get a variety of shades I usually
pick up a new one when i go and anyway i
would really recommend those but anyway
guys this is my nail area my nail
collection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
