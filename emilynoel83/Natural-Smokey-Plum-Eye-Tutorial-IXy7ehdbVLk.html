today about this smoky purple I look
it's very very easy and affordable to
recreate and I just think it's a very
good alternative to the traditional grey
smokey eye which I will be doing a
fairly soon here but this is just
another way to use those Purple's in
your collection and so if you want to
learn how to do it just keep on watching
so it's what i'm going to use our some
colors from sally girl these are 99 cent
colors eighty-nine cents with your
Sally's card and I'm going to start out
with this color in the middle here the
cool thing about these if you haven't
seen these yet is that they're
detachable so they like run on this
little bitty track sort of thing it's
kinda like it that there and they they
click together so you can create your
own palette basically as many colors as
you want so I'm going to use this lilac
shade here it's kind of a sparkly light
purple very very pretty shade and I'm
going to I've already put a primer my
Mary Kay eye primer on this I and so I'm
going to just go ahead and put on the
purple mist all over the lid
just work it on there this isn't meant
to be the real bold part of it and I'm
and it isn't like screaming at you
purple it's kind of like a deep plum
look so keep that in mind you know this
this isn't really colorful purple it's
almost smoky yet more natural and now
the shade right next to that that I've
purchased is eggplant and that is a
there's really not there's probably any
shimmer to that it's just a deep purple
but it's not incredibly dark so I'm
going to just get my contour brush into
that and go just kind of back and forth
over the entire a crease area
and just go over it real lightly because
we're going to build up our intensity
with another shade but this is just kind
of laying the foundation through that
okay this would be a great stopping
point if you want something a little
more natural if you if you know you
don't want the shadow look to be quite
as intense now we're going to sit this
Sally girl shades aside for a while
we're going to move over to our L'Oreal
hip duo and this is in cheeky and what
you've got here is kind of a shimmery um
kind of magenta shade and then a
shimmery deep plum I don't know if
that's cutting off a little bit Brown
but it's actually a plum color so I'm
going to dip a small contour brush into
that plum and concentrate just on the
outer part of my crease here just kind
of putting that color right in the
crease and working it out ever so
slightly see how it's really getting
that smokey effect right now
and just keep looking at me know for met
your other eye obviously you're probably
not using this method where you do one
eye at a time so it's a little easier to
be even with what you're doing but but
there you can see just building up the
intensity right there in the corner and
as you close your eye you can you can
see how that comes off I'm not very good
at winking with that 1i so that's okay
though alright so you've used that then
this pink color I don't want to leave
this out because it can it has some just
a really pretty look to it so I'm just
going to take an eyeshadow brush into
the pink and kind of create just kind of
overlap what I just did there with just
a little bit of pink shay just in person
I think it really it really kind of
warms up the look makes it even a little
more natural that's what you're going
for and then we're going to do a
highlight and i'm just going to use this
other color I had with my salad girl
shades it's in coral and what you got
here is sorry if it's not showing up
it's kind of a there you go that's sort
of the shade we're looking at it's like
a light shimmery peachy pink and this is
just going to act as our highlight so
just kind of get it all over up here I
have a little bit of a shimmer to it all
right next we're going to move on to our
liner we're going to use a new liner
that I've got that I'm kind of excited
about it's from Revlon colors today and
it's in blackberry so it's kind of a you
know smoky plum shade I really really
like it and I'm just going to go all
over actually my entire um all the way
around with this so I'm going to start
right here in the myth in the inner
corner and I'm going to be getting kind
of close because I need to get close to
my mirror
then just use small strokes I'm actually
going to use my little bitty mirror and
look how I look down into it until maybe
you can see better
and I'm trying to just stay extremely
close to the lash line because kind of
smudging it there close to the you to
your lash line almost makes your
eyelashes look thicker once you put your
mascara on okay so basically got this
extending it all the way to the outer
corner and then we're going to go
underneath as well so just kind of look
down and into a mirror is what helps me
and we're starting at the very inner
corner and this is going to be very easy
to achieve that smoky look with this
shade it just kind of lends itself to
that it's not quite as stark as black
doesn't create as much contrast with
your skin as black does so be careful to
make sure you're connecting there at the
corner if it doesn't look just right
with your liner that's okay we're going
to get a smudge tip and kind of smudge
that out actually smudging the entire
area we've done just to achieve the
smoky eye so put the eyeliner aside and
get you have a smudge tip like this
sometimes it comes on the ends of some
eyeliners and we're just going to
basically soften the color and help
blend our outer corners together not
going to really do too much to the upper
lash line oh I still want to remain and
keep having some intensity there but but
there you go there's that part of the
part of the look we're almost done I'm
going to curl my eyelashes and be sure
to always when you curl tilt up that's
how you really get the lift with your
eyelashes and I hold for about 15
seconds and if you are thinking about it
kind of lift lift up on and move it
towards the ends of your lashes for a
nice curl I'm going to use my volume
exact mascara from covergirl and I'm
going to use my mirror and I like to
look
down into something so I can kinda make
sure I'm getting every lash and I just
kind of zigzag from the root to the tip
of the eyelash I like this mascara a
little better than the lash blast I
don't know if I've mentioned that before
but it just I feel like it creates even
more volume and I'm just go on for a
second coat here and there you go
there's a beautiful purple smokey eye
kind of a plum smokey eye that you can
just pretty much take just about
anywhere it's a nice level of intensity
that not too loud and hopefully this
gives you some ideas for how to use your
purple and plum eye shadows thanks for
