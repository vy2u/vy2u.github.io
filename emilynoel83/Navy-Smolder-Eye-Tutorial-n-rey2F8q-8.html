for this video this is a tutorial I love
so much and I love it because the eye
shadow look is really low maintenance
easy to put together but yet the impact
you get from it is so strong and bold
and so this is a look that can take the
place of your typical gray or black
smokey eye because it is a navy blue
smokey eye and really the entire eye is
going to be surrounded by gorgeous navy
blue shades that are going to make the
whites of your eye pop so if you're
thinking you know I like smokey eyes but
it just makes me look a little too dark
in the eye area here's something that's
gonna allow the color and the whites of
your eye to really glow in this look so
I'm really excited to show it to you and
stay tuned till the end because I'll
share what's on my eyes and lips to help
pull the look together so keep on
watching I can first prime your lid I
used my Palladio herbal eyeshadow primer
all over my lid and then I'm taking a
jumbo shadow pencil in a really rich
navy blue color and the one that I love
I love these shadow sticks from Malley
they're the ever color shadow sticks and
this shade is called nautical and it is
a gorgeous navy blue and so what we're
gonna do with this is basically draw
this all over our lid and you can see
how that blue color it just it plays a
big part in how this look actually comes
off and I'm really getting it on heavier
towards the lash line and then you can
see I'm just practically dotting it up
to my crease there and I wouldn't
probably go to my crease with a lot of
shadow pencils but this is one that I
know will really last so I'm going up to
there and then kind of dotting it around
and then also getting a little bit of
that on my lower lash line here so just
I mean you can dot this in be
because this does give you before it
really sets in there a period of time
where you can blend this out so I'm
going to get my cat bag on here and then
I'm just gonna take my finger and
basically just dab over this and this is
going to just kind of pull the whole
product together anywhere where you
dotted it for a lighter concentration of
color is going to really start to come
together and the warmth of your finger
is just going to melt that right in when
you're blending the lower lashline a
q-tip can be a great way to once again
just kind of pull the product together
and we're going for it this is not
precise this is kind of smoky smudgy and
the q-tip can be a great way to help
finish that look I'm going to take a
gorgeous blue shadow from NYX called
frosted ocean and this is the most
beautiful blue shadow it's like a true
royal blue with a gorgeous kind of
metallic shimmer to it so I love this
I'm going to be taking my ELF flat
eyeshadow brush any flat brush will do I
like the flat one from Sigma as well I'm
kind of looking down and then I'm going
to be patting this shade you can get
enough on there patting this shade all
over that shadow stick and it really
this really mimics the same shade in the
shadow stick but I just think it gives
it just even more of a vibrant look on
the lipping my brush over and pulling
some of that product up to the crease
we're not doing a really precise outer V
with this look this is just kind of you
know follow the natural crease and just
kind of go up ever so slightly so some
of this blue becomes visible there it
creates this nice little shadow as you
can see right over your lips just a bear
fluffy brush this is the Sigma SS 224
and I am just blending that right over
there just to give it a little more of a
softened look and this is probably
blending the shadow stick and the shadow
just a little bit there and then because
we want to incorporate some of this
lovely shadow on our lower lash line I'm
taking this brush that I love from Sonia
Kashuk little smudger brush such
great brush to have in your brush
wardrobe and I've picked up a little bit
of that shadow kind of bringing these
two together the upper lash line and the
lower lash line and then I'm just in no
real precise way once again this is a
smudgy smokey look just carrying that
all over the lower lash line and if you
really want to smudge it out you will
turn the brush from flat like that two
more up and down
more of a north-south direction there
and just blend right over this the only
other shadow shape we're using here is
one that I love from NYX and it's called
Aloha just a great highlight shade and
I'm going back with the SS 224 any
fluffier dome brush will do pick up a
little bit of that color there and I'm
just gonna take that right up under the
brow and just let that blend slightly on
top of where you have the blue there I'm
gonna take a loja in this tiny detail
brush that I got from Coastal Scents
that I love it's the smallest breasts
smallest brush I own and I'm just going
right around that corner just the
slightest pop of color and feel free to
bring it up just a bit kind of overlap
those blues and it's going to create a
nice little blend put a black liner on
my waterline and I have discovered one
that will last meet pretty much all day
without me having to reapply it and it's
the Mallee ever color automatic
waterproof eyeliner and I like that it
doesn't have to be sharpened either this
shade is onyx what I'm doing is just
getting that all over my waterline all
the way to the extreme inner corner
there and then for some added depth on
the upper lash line just using that same
liner and just kind of going not I'm not
winging this out or anything just going
right along the lash line just go over
that with your q-tip you only have a
little time to do that because this will
set and not move
so I'm going to curl my lashes and apply
a couple coats of the Tarte lights
camera lashes mascara as you can see I
have the mini size here I'm just trying
it out apply a couple of coats to the
top and the bottom lashes next I'm going
to apply my Ardell fashion lashes number
106 I really like these because you get
kind of a mix of longer and shorter
lashes here it gives you a nice amount
of thickness without an overwhelming
amount of length and what I've just done
is taken my Revlon precision lash glue
the glue that I love and swear by and I
just put that all over the upper lash
line and this is going to dry to where
you can't even see it but now that I've
got that on there and I've waited
probably about 30 seconds and then I'm
just going to kind of look down into my
mirror and align these with the center
of my eyelid and then just kind of press
them on so here we go I'm looking down
applying them right there really paying
attention to where the center is going
and then I like to just use my fingers
and kind of Pat along that lash line and
make sure that they are on the lash line
as close to my lashes as they can get
while still being on my lash line and
then I kind of blink on to my finger and
make sure that they are you know kind of
tilting up and the way I want them
through then you may want to apply one
more coat of the mascara this is going
to help to just kind of blend the two
both your natural lashes and the false
lashes
so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial that
like I said isn't by far not the most
difficult tutorial I've ever done it's
something I could easily have just told
somebody you know take a shadow stick
take the shadow and whatever but I love
how it brightens the face while still
being kind of dramatic and smoky at the
same time so in terms of what's going on
on cheeks and lips here I went with sort
of an overall peachy kind of vibe here
it's really pretty I was actually
reading make up my Mario's blog I'll
link to it below but he does a lot of
makeup on Kim Kardashian and he had a
particularly he was describing all the
products he used and one of the products
he used as sort of her face contour was
actually a really affordable drugstore
product and it's from covergirl and it's
the cheekers bronzer in golden tans has
a little bit of shimmer to it but not a
whole lot and I went lightly sort of
used it on the as a contour for my
forehead and also just under the
cheekbone - in my cheeks I used my
standard blush that I love the Milani
minerals blush in my type perfect
teacher shade and then on my lips I used
one of the NYX jumbo lip pencils in pink
nude and this is really kind of a sheer
lip pencil it's very pink and pearly so
I just drew that all over my lips and
then for that last pop of peach I use
the NYX mega shine lip gloss in perfect
and this looks kind of pinky here but it
really is that classic pinky peach with
a little bit of shimmer to it so it is
still kind of sheer but I like it
because it really lets the eyes be the
star of the show for this look so thanks
so much for watching I hope you like
this tutorial and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
