you have actually browsed your dollar
stores for makeup because I think
sometimes people think I want to use
what's there it's area it's too cheap
but really a lot of dollar stores you're
gonna find some mainstream brands you
see all the time like covergirl
wet-and-wild L'Oreal stuff like that
but you're also may be prone to coming
up with some hidden gems some
potentially really good stuff at a store
called Fred's super dollar and not too
long ago I ran across a brand called
ayane and I know I talked about a blush
from there in my dirt cheap products
worth trying at that point that was the
only thing I've used since that time
I've gone back I'm trying some more
things and some things I'm really
impressed with so I really wanted to do
this video just to tell you about it
because the line is fairly new it I
think it's maybe a year old and it's
produced by the same company that makes
la splash which you might see in Ulta
stores so in this video lots of little
reviews it's going to cut to some demos
as well so you can see some of these
products in action and swatches and the
whole bit so I can't find my receipt for
what I paid exactly for all this stuff
but I know there was nothing more than
two dollars and fifty cents and I think
some of this stuff was just a doll to
start off with this bronzer duo and it's
in the shade you're glowing and I think
they may have had one other lighter
option for bronzer but this is what this
looks like and you can see they both
have a little sheen both the deeper side
and the lighter side and the lighter
side could basically be like a peachy
highlight for you the deeper side is
still I think kind of on the light end
where bronzers are concerned I used it a
little bit as a cheek contour but again
it's got that little bit of shimmer not
maybe ideal as a contouring product
overall I don't see this as a big
must-have really I mean I got it because
I tried the blushes and I thought oh
maybe the bronzer is fantastic as well
but not really now for the blushes I'm
the first one I mentioned first one I
ever tried it's called ecstasy and this
is a matte super pigmented kind of
reddish coral blush it's gorgeous it's
still probably my favorite one from the
line but
what I'm really happy to report is that
I tried three other blushes the only
other three I could find in stock and I
liked all of them as well so this one's
ecstasy this is your quarrel there's
another matte one and this is the one
I'm wearing today and this is a Miss
bliss and I think this is kind of a
pinky mauve shade it's a little bit
deeper a pigmented gorgeous so I love it
there too you know entirely matte
blushes you don't see that a lot now
these other two are shimmery and this
one is goddess kind of a little bit
deeper bronzy coppery type shade and
then this one is orgasmic I wonder if
this is supposed to be some sort of dupe
for NARS orgasm blush I'm not sure I
don't have that one but this is a
beautiful color nonetheless it has a
little bit of gold and shimmer so as you
look at swatches of all of these you can
see you know they're super pigmented
when they're blended out on the cheeks
they blend out easily and I do know that
these were 250 apiece I think they're a
fantastic bargain for what you're
getting definitely for me the highlight
of this line are these wonderful blushes
now for eyes I'm always kind of excited
when I see that a brand has an eye
primer and this says eight-hour wear
eyeshadow primer and this is kind of
refreshing because the claim on this
eight hours I've worn this longer than
eight hours and still had just wonderful
staying power with my eyeshadows so
that's interest different from anything
I've tried and that the texture of this
is almost like clear it's practically
completely transparent not a creamy
shade and it gets tacky very quickly so
you kind of have to spread it around
sort of fast because it's gonna get very
tacky and remain a little bit tacky but
then when you put your eyeshadows on top
it really clings the amount of tackiness
that this had had me a little concerned
that I might have some creasing like you
know what's this gonna do throughout the
course of the day but I had no problems
I'm gonna have to confine this hair
today needs to stay back there behind
the ear for some of the eyeshadows okay
I've got two duo's and two singles and
the duo's I have are in sand dune and
truffle I'm gonna focus on this one
first this is the one I'm wearing today
and I kind of found it odd that they put
together sort of a grayish color and a
brown but really
this is more like almost a little bit of
a khaki color it's got a little hint of
green in it I'm not sure if that really
comes off but I'm wearing this all over
the lid and then I blended this shade
into my crease and I also used a little
bit of the brown just smudged underneath
the eye as well and these aren't like
amazing eyeshadows they don't have the
really impressive pigmentation of like
wet and wild shadows but they still
perform well they're still decently
pigmented and they really I thought
popped on top of this primer it also did
use in this look a little bit of this
light shade in the duo called truffle
and I use that as my highlight a little
bit on the inner corner and this is kind
of a golden shade it looks just creamy
but it is a bit golden it almost reminds
me a little bit of Mac's nylon in that
way and then you get a brown that is a
little bit cooler in this one than that
Brown that's a little bit more warm
overall I mean you can put together a
look and I don't think anybody would
like look at you and think oh nice
dollar store makeup I would say these
are maybe comparable quality to like the
Maybelline expert wear eyeshadows the
eyeshadows that have been around a while
in Maybelline's line they seem to have
that kind of a texture but really not
bad and maybe worth a shot if you're
looking for some new shadows and then
the others the singles that I tried this
shade is called rodeo that's pretty
Brown and this really reminds me a lot
of the brown that is in the truffle do a
texture of this feels just a little
softer but as a whole it performs
basically the same as this Brown and
looks the same when i swatched them
side-by-side but if you just want this
kind of a shade this little single this
is pretty good I'm pretty happy with
that and the one in posh this is
Purple's it's a very soft kind of dusty
purple shade it's a subtle purples
wearing a look over the weekend where I
used this duo I put in a little bit of
this shade and I like smudge this purple
on the lower lash line
very subtle so don't go for this or if
you want a big purple color payoff
eyeliner this is precision automatic eye
pencil I think they had another
kind of eyeliner too but I'm kind of
drawn but the kind that you don't have
to sharpen it looks packaging wise
exactly like you know Maybelline master
drama and I was really hoping to have a
great surprise and that this was really
long wearing or really smudge free and
sadly it's just not a smudge free liner
it liked it it does not have that
quality where you put it on and it sets
it will fade a little bit but if you're
not like out being super duper active
it's probably not gonna fade much and I
didn't have smearing issues but I just
noticed the intensity of the black
wasn't there at the end of the day when
I wore this
this glides on so smoothly I love that
aspect very easy to put on so today I
just took that all the way across my
upper lash line and it was really
mascara this was one of those things
where I'm like what the heck I'll try it
probably gonna hate it you know but I'm
gonna give it a go and I got the lash
affair lengthening mascara and they had
a few different kinds of mascaras but I
thought oh I'm just gonna go for this
one and first thing I noticed with this
when you pull it out of the tube for
some reason the this part of the brush
closest to the wand needs a little extra
cleaning off for sure because there's a
lot of product there but as far as the
actual look of the brush and the shape I
do really like it you can kind of see
that it's flatter when you hold it this
way and then it's got two sides with
longer bristles I like that kind of a
brush because I feel like when I want to
load on more product I'll put the flat
side up against my lashes and when I
want to comb through for a little more
length and definition I'll use the side
with more long bristles so I like this I
didn't feel like it made my lashes hard
and crunchy or you know that feeling
like oh they're so brittle and they look
dry and nasty it really looked nice
throughout the day it built nicely on
top of itself I mean for a mascara to
work decent on my lashes I think it's
saying something so I was really
pleasantly surprised with this mascara
and I also wanted to show you in this
video how the eyelashes went on I'm
wearing the style flirt these I would
say are one of the more natural options
from the line but as you can see still a
lot of length and thickness
not my ideal lash I mean when I think of
ardell lashes they've got a really nice
natural curve to them same with the red
cherry ones I've talked about so much
they've got kind of a thin band and it's
very easy to maneuver the band on these
really wants to be very straight it
seems so you've got to work with it a
little bit get it a little bit flexible
the lashes themselves are not very
curled either that's another thing I
noticed I think if you looked at me from
the side you would even see more lash
than you do head-on just because they're
not really curving up big-time and the
other style I have is probably twice as
long as what I'm wearing now and these
are called glamour so there you see
full-on thickness a lot of length look
it's nice but just not maybe the easiest
lashes to maneuver and get right there
on your lash line but I'd give those
kind of an average rating I guess three
glosses from this line and this one's
called cappuccino this is a great nude
it looks beautiful it's actually kind of
comfortable on the lips not super sticky
but there is enough stickiness it's not
one of those that seems really watery or
oily greasy like it's gonna just slide
right off your lips so I like the
texture I like the color this is just
creamy there's no shimmer to it it's
beautiful for a nice nude lip the one
I'm wearing today is called a razzle and
this I would call kind of a peach and
this does have just a little bit of
shimmer it's kind of sheer I had to
build it up just a little bit to get the
look I have right now and then one
that's very full on color and no shimmer
with this one either this is called
sassy and it is just a creamy hot pink
magenta type color so I've said lots of
good things about these glosses but
guess what happened to me the other day
I'm undoing this and the stopper that
should keep all that goop so you see how
goopy that wand is now the stopper that
kind of cleans off the wand is stuck up
in the cap and even if I really like
press down as I open it it stays in
there and that is a huge like
deal-breaker for me like I was so
wanting to love these and
just today after I put my first coat on
my lips the coral one did it - I'm not
saying that's gonna happen to everyone
but two out of three glosses I got have
now failed in that way that's it that's
everything I've tried from the Ayane
line the blushes are my absolute
favorite thing from the line I don't
think the shadows are too bad I mean if
you're looking at some specific colors
you think I want to try something new
give them a gum not the most fantastic
shadows but they do perform really
nicely on top of the base speaking of
base this primer worked pretty well it's
strange because there is no tacky
feeling to it anymore once you get the
shadow on but it does have a real
tackiness when you first apply it so if
that gives you a few details on this
ayane line good luck finding it like I
said Fred's super dollars where I'm
finding mine I'm not sure where else
it's going to be coming out but it's
fairly new so thanks again for watching
guys and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
