day today I want to talk about blushes I
really like when I have the opportunity
to sort of work several products into
one video and do it kind of comparison
style because normally that's the kind
of question I get which is better like
viscera this and a lot of times
especially this time of year a lot of
new products of similar kinds are coming
out at the same time so I thought this
would be a great opportunity to talk
about several new blush things that I've
been trying first off we've got the
Physicians Formula butter blushes and
then a couple of different blush
palettes one is from Maybelline and it's
the master blush color and highlight kit
and then I also have the NYX sweet
cheeks blush palette so I'm going to
give you my take on all of these
different items today I'm going to start
off with the Physicians Formula butter
blushes I have enjoyed the butter
bronzer by the way which is the first
butter type product that they came out
with and it's a very subtle bronzer but
I mean for kind of that all over the
face healthy glow it can look good may
not be the type of thing that suits
every single skin tone you know but I
was very intrigued when I saw that they
were coming out with blushes in that
similar texture that I think looks very
natural on the skin not at all powdery
and so I ordered both of the shades that
this product comes in off of ulties
website and just a comparison size-wise
here's the bronzer blushes are a little
bit smaller and they were I believe like
$12.99 each so two different shades here
one is natural glow and that looks like
this and then we've got plum rose which
is another pretty so looking shade here
as you can see there's super soft colors
like I can't even see how they're
calling this one a blush this natural
glow it's basically like a highlight to
me and even in that capacity it's
extremely extremely soft on the skin
like I remember the first day I tried
applying this is blush and it just like
it was doing nothing for me I had to
layer some of this over the top and that
helped a little bit this plum rose shade
is kind of one of those sneaky blush
colors I think I've talked about
products like this before where they
really don't look like
much in the pan but they do show up for
whatever reason a little bit better on
the cheeks and this is definitely one of
those products it doesn't swatch that
great I mean you can barely identify it
I feel like in my swatch but it does
give you this little bit of subtle
unexpected rosiness on the cheeks like
just a hint of a mauve rose glow I was
wearing this one and this one alone in a
previous video as well so I'll show you
you know what that looks like and it's
just it's not a bad blush but it's
really really subtle and I think $12.99
is really pushing it for you know one
drugstore blush so these are products I
don't feel like I can wholeheartedly get
behind and recommend to you because
first off like I said the one called
natural glow really does not come off
like a blush at all and it's still kind
of barely there even if you think of
this as a highlight and then the other
one like I said there are so many
blushes on the market you know that can
give you a more pronounced look than
this and yes these are cute and yes they
smell like some sort of tropical
cocktail but I mean once you get past
the cuteness and the scent and the
packaging and everything there's really
not a lot going on here in terms of them
being great blushes so yeah those were
kind of a disappointment to me I wish
they had some more intensity sweet
cheeks palette from NYX this is kind of
another thing that I feel like you know
it's good it's definitely for the blush
lover out there because it's nothing but
blush in this palette you're not getting
like a variety of highlights and then
some contour shades or the gold shade in
here that maybe some people might work
in and more of a highlighter capacity
but really all in all this is a blush
palette and from also this one cause to
me I believe it was 1999 so you're
getting eight shades in here you are
getting a variety of finishes the three
shades right here in the top row do have
some shimmer I would say you know this
shade is quite shimmery and some people
might work that and it's like a peachy
highlight same story with the gold you
know that's quite a bit of Sheen to it
this is more like just a natural like
neutral rosy shade with a little bit of
glow but everything else from this
orange down to these cool pink plum and
sort of a Coralie shade right down here
those are all Matt and what I had to
compare these two in terms of Nick's
products would be there HD blushes I
have quite a few of those singles and at
a glance here I thought maybe these are
just the HD blushes put into a palette
but I don't own all of them I have like
seven or eight and none of them seem to
be exactly the shades that are in here
also they feel like a different texture
those NYX HD blushes feel a little bit
softer to the touch a little bit more
creamy for those of us who describe
certain powders is feeling creamy it's
like what I think of powders like that
there's a little bit of thickness to
them almost you don't feel like they
just instantly dust away between your
fingers these powders are a little bit
more thin and powdery and it's not that
they're not pigmented because they do
show up and they do have pigment but
they're just not quite as rich feeling
as the single HD blushes in terms of
color variety I think they've really got
you covered all over the board you know
with the orange something a little more
neutral peachy and then these really
cool pinks a deep plum lots of variety
here like I said it's a blush lovers
palette I don't think every single
person is going to feel the need for a
palette of eight different blushes and
at nearly $20 I would think you probably
want to be getting a lot of good out of
every part of it you know for me I feel
like pretty much any shade in this
palette is fair game too for me to want
to use a gold not quite so much just
because you know it really is a gold and
I don't see that as really brightening
my skintone to wear it as a highlight
but you know you can pop some of these
shades on even as eyeshadows if you
wanted to so I'm not really knocking
this product all around I mean I just
think there's a certain audience out
there for it there's a certain group of
people who would appreciate having a
full pallet of blushes but if you're
accustomed to the texture and feel of
the HD blushes if your going to find
these to not be quite as rich as though
they're still pigmented but like I have
an orange e shade that's in the HD blush
format and I was just comparing that one
to this orange and this one didn't quite
hold a candle to that one in terms of
intensity even though this is still
fairly intense so think about your own
expectations what you look for in a
blush and if you feel the need to have a
blush palette
but this is really good in terms of
variety what they packed in from
finishes to colors
there's a lot of different things
happening in here but my personal pick
of this video would have to be this
Maybelline master blush palette and this
surprises me so very much because I have
never really been a fan of maybelline
powder blush products like their fit me
blushes I thought those were not intense
enough at all and when they were I think
being called the expert wear blushes
before that you know there just weren't
a lot of things I enjoy they make great
cream blushes
I've enjoyed their cream blush sticks
and The Dream bouncy blushes but I was
not expecting greatness out of this
palette but I must say I really enjoy it
and I like it kind of over the NYX
because I feel like it incorporates
three distinctly different blush shades
so I still do get variety you're getting
something kind of peachy pink a cool
pink a plum but you also get a highlight
and I think that does help the
versatility quite a bit and I like that
all three of these are for the most part
matte for whatever reason I feel like
there's a little bit of a satin finish
coming off of that plum I don't notice
it a lot on the skin but just in a
concentrated swatch I can see it but all
around I feel like it's three matte
blushes and a glowy highlight and I
actually really like the highlight - I
didn't think I was going to like it
after i swatched I thought is that like
a little dry or is it a little chalky
but honestly on the skin I love the look
so that has not disappointed me at all
I've worn all the shades and today for
the demo in this video I wanted to show
you the shapes going on because they're
just surprised me so much they're really
pigmented blushes so I use this lightest
kind of peachy color just right there on
the apple of my cheeks love the glow
that that shade gift and then I brought
in some of the plum just a little bit
lower on the cheek you know it gives me
a little bit of added definition not
wearing it like a full-on contour but
just giving my blush look a little bit
of dimension there and then I brought in
my highlight brush my up and up
highlight brush and I'd go into the
highlight and just lay that down right
on top of the cheeks or anywhere on the
face where you want a little added glow
and I can see that shade
we brightening up a lot of skin tones
from very fair to even deeper richer
skin tones major major surprise biggest
surprise of the video I thought I was
going to like the butter blushes a lot
more I kind of thought that sweet cheeks
palette was going to fully knock my
socks off but for me I mean I feel like
this is enough color variety it's about
half the price of the sweet cheeks
palette depending on where you purchase
it it might be 10 to 12 dollars this
Maybelline palette but I really value
the fact that there's a highlight in
there as well and it's really you know
distinct blush tones that would suit
pretty much any look I would wear so if
you were considering any of these
products I hope this video helps you out
I love being able to share with you guys
especially when you know the outcome of
whatever review I'm giving is kind of
surprising to me I really think that
that's valuable information to pass
along so let me know if you've tried any
of these products or are there more
blushes that I've been missing out on
that you think I should check out that
have come out recently let me know and I
will talk to you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
