special welcome to anybody watching this
video from the Ladies Home Journal gloss
daily blog I've been doing posts pretty
much like every other week there on the
gloss daily blog on some of them have
been videos some have been written blog
post that's just one more place you can
go to see different content that I'm
putting together and there are tons of
other awesome contributors there as well
but this video for the gloss daily site
is appropriately about lip gloss and
there are a lot of new lines coming out
in the drugstore lately you're probably
seeing displays everywhere you turn just
a new line of lipgloss from different
brands and today I thought I would just
give a little roundup basically of the
kinds I've tried give you my thoughts on
them really explain how they perform so
next time you're out shopping you'll
maybe know what would best meet your
needs what you should go for or maybe
what you want to skin the ones I'm gonna
be talking about are the almay liquid
lip balms I've got four of those that
I've picked up also the Rimmel showoff
lip glosses these also are if you're
from the UK these came out as Rimmel
apocalypse which i think is kind of a
cooler name but I have a couple of those
those recently launched here in the
States and also I've got the new Revlon
Super Lustrous line which of course is a
line that's been around for a while but
they've repackaged them and relaunched a
bunch of new colors also throughout the
video you're going to see pictures of
these different colors on my lips I
think it always helps to see you know a
certain color and then see the whole
face so you can see what kind of effect
a certain shade has on just your
complexion your eyes you know everything
as a whole I think lips are totally
important in that way so we're going to
start off with the almay and these are
again the color plus care liquid lip
balms and these came out recently they
claim to have sheer shiny color ten
shades and these are also gluten free
which I thought was interesting overall
impressions on these the scent is
amazing I love the sort of sweet vanilla
scent that
I feel like these are the type of
glosses that the anti lip gloss girl
might just go for because they're not
sticky at all they do not have a thick
feel to them and they are very sheer and
some shades are more sheer than others
another thing you're going to notice
with these is that because they don't
have a lot of tackiness to the feel they
can wear off fairly quickly I mean I
find that even if I'm doing a lot of
talking or a little bit of eating taking
a drink of something the color will
transfer off fairly easily and these
don't seem to be something that really
stain the lips or leave a lot of color
behind even after the shine goes so it's
kind of like once it's gone it's gone
that is something I notice about these
as far as color payoff let's go through
the shades that I have first off I have
this shade in blooming balm and I was
really just attracted to this color
right off the bat I thought it looked
like a gorgeous pink and this is before
I had tried these at all and so I just
thought that's the kind of color I would
like to see on my lips this actually
comes off extremely sheer on the lips
and I have a feeling if you're someone
with super pigmented lips naturally
you're probably not going to be
satisfied in the amount of color that
these give off the pink shade I mean
while it gave me a little bit of color
it just wasn't as much as I expected and
it's kind of the same story with this
second shade which is called rosy lipped
this was the one of the bunch that I
thought looked really nude and I was
wondering you know would it end up
looking just like that on my lips but it
just you know your natural lip color is
going to show through quite a bit with
these lighter shades these were the
first two I picked up and while I was
maybe a little disappointed in the way
they came off on the lips I still was
really attracted to the comfortable feel
and the scent and I just thought it was
a really kind of unique thing for a lip
gloss to actually feel so moisturizing
so I pursued some other shades and I
thought well maybe let's try some of the
brighter tones in this collection and
the one I'm wearing right now on my lips
is this shade called apricot pucker or
apricot if you prefer but this shade
really has kind of a coral II punched to
a little bit of a reddish orange look
and I was so happy with the way this one
ended up
being on my lips I felt like I could
build the color up a little bit with the
other ones even the lighter ones you
know I might try to build the color up
more but it wouldn't make as much of a
difference with these brighter shades I
feel like you can definitely get the
color you're after so I just thought
this was gorgeous a great summer shade I
just love it and I also love the red
tone which is Apple a day so you can see
comparing the two apple a day has much
more of that classic red look like this
shade is a fun approach to red lips
because the it's just so comfortable on
but you can still get that really fresh
juicy look so of the ones I tried from
the alum a liquid lip balm line I really
liked the brighter colors a little bit
better I think you're going to be more
satisfied with the color payoff on those
these aren't bad they're very
natural-looking and they just kind of
add a little tint of color to your lips
and for some people that may be what you
want
now the Rimmel show off lip lacquers and
these really make me think of like a
melted down lipstick whereas you know we
talked about some of the Almay ones
being kind of sheer these are really
full on color I have two shades and I
feel like both of them went on equally
opaque just full coverage across the
lips that really is the claim behind
these is that these have the rich color
of a lipstick but also a satin smooth
shine is what the company says you have
some shine on the lips but it's not
really a wet look if you know what I
mean another interesting thing about
these is that you might notice in the
DOE foot applicator there's actually
like a little well there it dips down
and it holds some more product and I
found that when I applied these I could
get completely around my lips and not
have to go back for any more product and
whereas I talked about some of the almay
ones being more buildable you just don't
need to go back and add more
after you basically get one coat of this
on your lips it's all the color you need
basically really full-on color in one
swipe so the shades I have in this are
celestial
which is kind of a Mavi rosy shade
really one of those shades I think you
could feel safe wearing in a lot of
different circumstances you know whether
you're going to work and you just don't
want something
maybe too loud but you still want your
whole face to look kind of finished this
is nice it had no shimmer in it I really
wanted to try two different finishes in
this and the other one I have is
shimmery but I just felt like this was
gorgeous on the lips I also noticed that
as you wear it once the shiny part of
this wears off I still feel like there's
a decent amount of color left behind yes
Joel I think is a gorgeous shade the
other one I have is called
out-of-this-world thing that I noticed
what this one was I thought it was kind
of pretty when it was freshly applied as
this one wears off as the glossiness of
this kind of starts to come off of your
lips a little bit it leaves behind that
frost eNOS even more like it's gonna
look even more frosty as it starts to
wear during the day which I wasn't
particularly a fan of still I mean I
can't really knock it at all for having
intense color payoff easy to apply one
coat and you're good decent staying
power all around the scent on these
might be a little off-putting to some
because I find that it's kind of strong
comes off as sort of a chemical or
almost a plastic ease and it's kind of
hard to explain I mean it doesn't really
bother me I don't notice it once it's on
my lips at all some people are very
sensitive to scent though so I wanted to
just point that out it would be
interested to look into some other
shades of these particularly the ones
that don't have shimmer because I think
they wear beautifully and just have a
nice feel and a nice intensity of color
on the lips
finally the Revlon Super Lustrous lip
glosses and these have been one of my
favorite kinds of glosses from the
drugstore they were packaged like this
in this squared-off packaging and I
loved them I actually kind of like this
packaging a little bit better than just
the round tube because I feel like a lot
of things are in tubes like this plus
you're actually getting less product I
found this interesting because I think
people might see the new ones and think
all bigger tubes they're giving us more
you're actually getting less in here and
if you're ever wondering if you might be
getting a little bit rooked in the
amount of product Department look at the
bottom and take a look at how thick the
outer coating of the
you know the outer packaging is and how
big the actual you know part containing
the glosses there's a lot of packaging
surrounding this gloss and whereas with
the old kind you're getting point to
fluid ounces in these you're getting
point one three fluid ounces it's kind
of funny with these because while Super
Lustrous glosses obviously have not been
discontinued they have pretty much
changed up almost all of the shades and
it's going to take me trying more of
them to see if some have just been
renamed and if there's there is still
some overlap with some of these older
colors and that'll just take a little
more time because I've only got two of
the new ones right now but after years
of you know using these and enjoying
these I wanted more shades and now
they've come out with some new different
ones so I'm not entirely upset about
best formula as a whole I think is just
my ideal for lip gloss it's got a little
more thickness to it than say the Alma
glosses had and I like that because I
feel like that adds to the staying power
a little bit I think they're pigmented I
think they just feel good on the lips
they apply so smoothly and evenly
not at all streaky sometimes glosses I
feel like you put them on and just the
the imprint of that doe foot applicator
like creates some sort of a streakiness
around your lips not at all with these I
think they're just gorgeous and so I
have a couple and I like them both both
of these shades the first one is rosy
future and I got this because it has a
little shimmer and it kind of reminds me
in the texture of one that I have loved
for a long time which is called foiled
it's definitely not as light as foiled
but it is kind of that same look on the
lips just a little bit of pearly Nasir
is comfortable yet just tacky enough to
last for a good part of the day up until
maybe you eat a meal you might want to
reapply but I just think these are great
the other one I have is called fuchsia
finery
and when I saw this I mean I noted in
the scheme of the colors this one seemed
to have quite a bit of a purpley tone to
it and I'm like okay I'll get out of my
comfort zone I'll try something that has
more purple but it actually shows up a
little more sheer on the lips
you might expect it's not quite full on
opaque this color but this is creamy
this does not have shimmer in it comes
off with a beautiful berry look I will
definitely wear this a lot I found this
shade to be somewhat buildable so you
can add a little bit more and get a
little bit closer to this shade but I
don't think you get exactly the shape
that you that you see here ultimately
with these I mean yeah they changed the
packaging and they've given us new
shades but what I think was most
important to me that was that they
didn't change up the formula that I can
tell it feels just like the old Super
Lustrous ones that I loved so much so
that was important to me and I'll be
trying more shades and I'll let you know
if I notice any more comparisons across
the two lines I know I still saw a pink
pop in this new selection a much loved
shade from the original line of Super
Lustrous glosses but I'm not sure if
some others might just be renamed but
still be really similar to the originals
so we will see thank you so much for
watching this review I just wanted to
give you as much information as I could
about these different new glosses that
you're going to be running across in the
drugstore again for the girl who maybe
just really can't get into glosses and
thinks they're all too sticky I think
you might be really pleasantly surprised
with the Almay liquid lip balms they
really feel moisturizing but they're
very soft and just really comfortable to
wear and I really like those brighter
shades for the girl who really likes
opaque color and that's very important
when you really want to see exactly the
shade that you see in the tube come off
onto your lips and have pretty good
staying power while it's at it these
show off lip glosses from Rimmel are
pretty nice and I think the classic lip
gloss lover if you've been using these
Revlon Super Lustrous glosses and you
love that formula you're gonna like
these too it's the same kind of formula
just some new colors to play with so I'd
love to hear what you think if you've
been trying some of these new lip
products from the drugstore and thank
you so much for watching thanks again to
anybody drifting over to my channel from
the gloss daily blog I'm happy to have
and have a great day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
