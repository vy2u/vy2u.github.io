today I'm going to be talking about elf
and I'm excited to do so because there
are quite a few new products to the line
if any brand I say this all the time
there are always hits and misses and
even the brand that has something you
just absolutely love they can also make
something that just doesn't happen to
work for you might work for someone else
but isn't quite your thing and of course
elf is no exception but with a lot of
the new things that I've recently tried
I've actually really really been
enjoying them and I've just got a lot of
recommendations now the foundation and
the primer I'm going to mention I'm not
exactly sure how new those things are I
might be a little late to the party on
those but everything else is definitely
very new to elfs line and I am wearing
like practically all elf on my face
today once I get going on a theme I've
definitely had some hits and misses with
elf primers but I recently tried this
poreless face primer it's the one that
looks like a little bit pinky tone with
the packaging it says fills in fine
lines and minimizes the appearance of
pores I love a good pore minimizing
primer and I've really liked the one
from NYX called pore filler it looks
like this it's really really good about
mattifying as well and with this one I
think it's a really great smoothing
primer I adore the feel of it it looks
white like that but once you start
blending it in it just feels like so so
skin softening I absolutely love that
texture it's not quite as mattifying as
the pore filler one but I do think it
actually functions to minimize the
appearance of pores and just really
evening out the texture of your skin
making everything so consistently even
in smooth that I think your foundation
goes on just that much better it's other
thing huge surprise just kind of tried
it on a whim I don't normally go for the
acne fighting stuff I'm not usually
dealing with a lot of blemishes lately
I've had a few more and I think it's had
to do with my morning cleansing routine
which I addressed in my little Holy
Grail repurchases video but anyway I'm
starting to get over that I don't
necessarily need an acne fighting
foundation but holy cow this is great
salicylic acid witch hazel tea tree aloe
it surprised the pants off of me I could
not believe how rich the texture of this
foundation was I guess I was expecting
it to be like more on the drying side I
thought maybe this is going to be
something that oily skin people will
like but heck I'll try it anyway I had
this in the shade buff the squeezy tube
next best thing to a pump I just
couldn't believe how beautiful this
texture was it's smooth it's a little
thicker than I would have expected it's
really nice coverage I would say medium
to full but it looks so natural not
luminous there's nothing glowy about it
but it's just something about the
appearance of the skin right after I put
this on I'm gonna have to do a tutorial
where you see this going on I think it's
kind of a soothing formula like I could
see if someone was dealing with a live
acne on their skin like this would have
really smooth across it and almost
nourish the skin a little bit but the
tone of this the color of it was
absolutely perfect for my skin enjoyed
the coverage staying power was pretty
good yesterday I was keeping a pretty
close eye on that now I do feel the need
to set this all over with some sort of
powder because it can have just a little
bit of a moist feel left over on the
skin so putting some powder on there can
just even everything out nicely but holy
cow I was so surprised by that really
impressed
so I concealed my under-eye area I don't
have an elf concealer to talk about
right now but I used some benefit array
space right in there in my caverns and a
little bit of the Rimmel hide the
blemish which you know this stuff can be
used anywhere on the face if you want to
and then I set it with the prime and
stay finishing powder it's just a
translucent powder
it's toward the less-expensive end of
elfs range it has a really nice smooth
texture but as you can see it you know
translucent powders can reach a point
that they're not translucent anymore we
all need to I think realize that so
today I use this on the under eye area I
also used it on the t-zone and then I
used a powder that is a little more
suited to my exact skin tone elsewhere
on the face and I do think it mattifies
it kind of perfects this area nicely I
do think you can go too far with it
though it's
easy to pick up a lot of powder with
your brush and it can just come off a
little bit drying because this is really
like a very mattifying powder so I think
it's important to keep that in mind but
I'm liking what it's doing for me in
this area it's kind of brightening just
because it is you know that lighter
powder and you know it's doing good
things
now this illuminating palette was so
excited to get this I think they came
out with this on the heels of the
release of a bunch of other palettes not
all that long ago and I missed out on it
I think it's sold out like that so when
I noticed it was back on the website
actually one of you guys told me I
scurried over there and got it and it's
the same kind of format as a lot of
elf's palettes you know it's got the big
mirror up top all of these individual
pans come out they just push through
like little buttons on the back and some
might see this as like elfs take on an
hourglass ambient lighting palette and I
haven't tried like every single ambient
powder out there to be able to say like
exactly how these compare but in my
opinion these all seem very highlighter
ish you know just different tones you've
got your really like soft pearly one
this one has a bit of a pinky tone this
one is very interesting because it's
it's very subtle that's the one I'm
wearing on my cheeks today and it's like
just a little tone down glow I really
like that because I feel like I'm
getting a natural looking glow to the
cheeks it's not just as bright as most
highlights out there art and then this
one over here is more sunny it's got a
little more like golden very soft copper
to it might be pretty layered over a
bronzer I think what's really nice about
these is I don't think any of them come
off looking super metallic like really
really frosty they're all kind of soft
wearable highlights somewhere in our
makeup stash we all have some blotting
papers somewhere I know elf has come out
with blotting papers before but what has
been the thing missing from them a
mirror like nothing I have has a mirror
and it only makes sense that something
like that that you would pop out and
kind of blot over your skin you know I
get that you're not applying product to
your skin so in that sense you might
think well what do you need to see well
I want to see the shine is being removed
I Navy want to see like did my mascara
smudged under my
eyes or is my lipstick running outside
my lip line that kind of thing - well
now elf has this cute little compact and
it's got the blotting papers in there
but it's also got a mirror and on the
outside it's got like this little I
don't know city skyline thing going on
you pop it open there's the mirror as I
said and then they've also got kind of a
puff system in place if you want to call
it that that picks up the paper and then
you can blot it all over your face so
this has like a light adhesive on the
back here of the puff and when it comes
to you that's covered up there's
something that you peel off and then
every time you get a new paper out it'll
automatically stick to this and you can
blot all over your face then you take it
off and then this will be stuck to the
next one but they work just as well as
any blotting papers I've used and just
to have the little puff I think that's
handy you can see I picked up some oil
there and then you know you got that
mirror that's everything elf has a lip
color remover now I have tried the one
from NYX and so now I've moved on to
this one from elf ice watch a lot of lip
products so I have plenty of
opportunities to test something like
this out and there are so many long
wearing lip products out there these
days and thinking about lip stains and
think about the liquid lipsticks and all
that stuff and it's not just a matter of
sitting here like I once was able to and
just you know taking a little wipe and
clearing off all lip product and then
putting on another one like it can be
difficult with some of these and so this
says it's an oil-based formula that
gently breaks down and removes color
infused with aloe and jojoba to help
soothe and hydrate the lips so I can
definitely tell this is sort of
replenishing when I use it it's giving a
little something back to the lips and
the way I use is I leave it on for a
little bit of time I don't know maybe 30
seconds or so and really just leave it
on top of whatever product I'm trying to
remove or sometimes the case is that I
can remove like a good deal of lip
product just with a Kleenex but then
you've got the residue even with some
tinted lip balm so I'm going to talk
about I mean even these are able to like
once you take them off they've still got
this kind of staining effect on the
and when you're going product after
product and swatching something you want
the truest color possible so something
like this is handy for me to have up
here I know I could probably just grab a
thing olive oil and use that but I mean
this is handy this is small it only
really takes a tiny bit and this works
every bit as good as the NYX one that
I've been using as well even with the
colour-pop and you know liquid lipsticks
that really don't move at all
just let this sit on one of those 30
seconds or so and then just take a
cotton pad or a tissue and it just
completely wipes away so it works great
now elf has a little line of some
two-dollar lip balms and I purchased
them all because I'm just into tinted
lip balms they're called the lip kiss
balms they are infused with vitamin A
and E grapeseed oil and jojoba I can
only say jojoba so many times and keep
it serious okay and it said it's going
to help nourish protect and moisturize
the lips they feel nice they feel a
little bit cooling
I wouldn't say all-out minty like a
tarte lipsurgence but you can tell
there's kind of a refreshing feel when
you first put them on the lips I think
they definitely have a thicker feel they
pack a little bit more of a moisturizing
punch then like Maybelline Baby Lips and
they are pigmented as heck so I'm just
going to do a little swatch on my hands
but also show them on my lips as well no
shimmer in any of these by the way
there's the bear kiss is this one right
here and that comes off very peachy on
the lips I'm wearing that today paired
with a bit of a berry type lip liner
just kind of on the outsides but as you
can see a lot of color coming out of
that tinted lip balm this is flirty and
perky pink flirty and perky all right
here very bright
this is XO red again a full on red
tinted lip balm very red and then this
one as I mentioned is the berry it's
called berry sweet right here speaking
of sweet I forgot to mention with this
this tastes a little bit sweet on the
lips
no like distinctive flavor other than
simply sweet these bombs I don't know
it's hardly any taste on the lips at all
it's just that slightly minty scent but
they feel so great there's some
thickness to
they're comfortable they're not at all
sticky they really cling to the lips
these two are the ones I see myself
using the most and I layered them the
other day it was a really pretty effect
it's actually a similar look to what
I've got today but two bucks a pop I
mean who can argue with that they feel
so rich like there's a really good
thickness there if you were going out in
the cold if you already had chapped lips
and you were looking for something to
kind of rehab them a little bit these
feel so nice now everything I've
mentioned thus far I've had good
experiences with their things I'm
recommending to you things that I think
are worth trying last couple of things
are new products I want to just let you
know about them but I'm still kind of
trying to figure them out they've got
two new varieties of the Mist and set
they've got matte magic and illuminating
and I've been playing with these I've
been trying to figure out like do I
really feel illuminated or do I really
feel mattified after I put this on and
it's just going to take more we're like
just out and about in the world to
figure this out and because I really
like the regular mist and set I have no
problem with it but I'm trying to
determine whether either of these are
drastically different from the effect I
got from the regular so today I'm
wearing the illuminating the other day I
put on a lot of this matte to see if I
could you know spray on quite a bit and
it would still stay with a matte finish
and I wasn't sure that it did I really
want to give these a fair shot I want to
use them some more but I wanted to let
you know that those are out there and
I'm in the process of drying them but
anyway guys thank you so much for
watching I hope this was informative if
you're thinking about some new elf
purchases against that acne fighting
foundation Wow who knew it's great as
