joining me for this long-awaited video
man it is felt weird not posting videos
for this long I think maybe the last
time this happened was that big storm
last year that knocked out my power
forever but I have moved I've gotten to
our new house this past weekend was when
we actually got everything completely
moved in and got all the way out of our
apartment and so for the past week you
know it's been a matter of kind of
unpacking and fine-tuning things and
getting everything the way I want it
that'll continue for some time
throughout the rest of the house the
living room for example the furniture
won't be in for probably another few
weeks so it'll be a little while before
I want to go ahead and do a whole like
you know look at the new house video but
I thought I would go ahead and give you
a little preliminary tour of the beauty
broadcast room because a lot of the
stuff in here is complete and I just
thought it would be fun to show you what
I've got so far maybe you can give me
suggestions on this stuff I still have
to do in here but yeah overall the move
went well it was so nice to when I got
to work you know I would see you know
somebody would leave me a tweet or a
nice comment and it was nice to know
that you were thinking about me even
though I haven't been posting videos as
much as I want to but I've got to say I
absolutely love this room I've been
getting up and getting ready for work in
here and it's just fantastic I mean just
the whole room just gives me this good
vibe and then I'm able to really spread
out my stuff how I want to and I feel
like the lighting is good I feel like I
you know it's just going to be a great
place for me to do my videos and I think
it's just really going to take
everything with my channel you know the
videos the blog everything it's going to
take it up a notch and really make me
feel great about what I'm doing here so
thanks again for tuning in and let's
take a look at the room so as you're
walking into the room you can see
instantly the color is kind of a I know
it's a semi bright berry tone the color
is actually a Valspar paint
it's in very very it's a satin finish
paint and I got it at Lowe's and I just
I saw a picture actually of the room of
a room and painted in this color they
have you know those little like template
kind of things and so when I saw it I
just thought that's it that's what I
want so I'm kind of doing a pink white
and black theme so by the door here I've
got this little five dollar it's almost
like a TV tray wooden table here from
Target and I got this light at Target as
well it's really cute it's just got one
of these little pull things and it just
matches the decor quite nicely and it's
nice to have kind of a secondary light
like that so you don't always have to
use your overhead light I'm not using
the overhead right now I got a little
radio this little like zebra-print devil
buck I don't know where that came from
but very cute nonetheless so anyway I've
got this blank wall here right now which
I think I'm gonna do put a picture on it
or I have kind of this white circular
picture frame actually right down here
that's got various pictures in it and in
a little that's a little mirror on there
as well it's kind of big and I thought
it would work well with this room so I
may put that there over here in the
corner I've got this white bookshelf
thing which I had in the other house or
in the apartment and I went ahead and
gave it another coat of white paint
because it was looking kind of chippy
and it was amazing what that did it
still has sort of a rustic finish to it
but I think that it just totally
brightened up the color so I've got some
of my makeup books over here on this top
shelf and then this is my picture that
was in Elle magazine they're got nail
stuff in the bottom two areas which I
may kind of organize a little bit better
but that's what it is for now and I will
do plan to do a more detailed makeup
collection video coming up kind of
really going into what I have here but
for now this is just kind of the layout
I've got the
neat little TV this is a great TV it's
from Vizio and I got it at Walmart for a
couple hundred bucks here and this is
the DirecTV receiver I guess right
underneath it but it is so thin it's
less than an inch thick there so a great
little size TV to have right up there on
top and so in the morning when I'm
getting ready for work
I can sit over here keep an eye on the
news and you know it's just a very very
cool thing to me to be able to have that
TV in here the room just came with some
vertical blinds I don't know if I'll
keep them for good or what but they are
super great in terms of controlling the
lighting because I can you know kind of
with the direction I turn them I can
really control the amount of light
that's on my desk area over here which I
think will be very very good for
tutorial videos I can already tell the
Lighting's gonna be good in this room
for seeing the colors that I'm using so
anyway these are working out well for me
so far on this wall this part of the
wall over here I'm probably gonna have
to have a clock over there because I
just
especially when I'm getting ready in the
morning so I can get kind of carried
away with the make up thing and then I'm
like oh what time is it so a clock there
and probably my little bulletin board
slash dry erase board thing they go over
here as well the kind of the focal point
of this whole room is this l-shaped desk
I got this from Staples and it's neat
because it's got the L shape so you got
kind of like a longer side over here the
shorter side right here and then you've
got this little like attachment thing
this little corner that pulls it all
together it also came with a pullout
drawer like that you would put your put
your keyboard on if you had one of those
computers on there but just to have less
space underneath because that's where I
store a lot of stuff I opted not to have
that put on there which Tyler put this
all together so that was awesome it also
comes with this cool little shelf thing
on the back which is great for makeup
storage as well so I thought that got
this chair
from Staples as well super comfy and I'm
able to kind of be working over here I
think this is where I may just kind of
generally keep my computer but I also
have this opportunity to basically use
this side of the desk for natural
lighting and then this side of the desk
for my regular old makeup mirror here so
I've got another light here as well that
I can use for some added brightness so
knock on wood I may have figured out
good lighting finally but anyway over
here got that got it on beauty broadcast
of course but I've got a little cart
down here with basically just some extra
items like you know extras of something
I've already had that you know I just
haven't opened it yet some extra q-tips
things like that and down at the bottom
here are little makeup bags
so this desk is a great height for
storing things underneath I've got my
trashcan right over there as well and
down here under this side these are
containers I have used so much basically
what I've got here are two three drawer
pullout containers but you can find
these at a lot of different stores I
probably got mine from like Walmart or
Target or something like that but
they're stacked one on top of the other
I keep a lot of my eye stuff in this top
one like liners and cream shadows things
like that a lot of individual shadows
here in the second drawer next drawer is
again I will go through this more
specifically in a collection video but
there I've got you know more like
drugstore palettes loose shadows and
smaller shadows larger ballets and on
the bottom more palettes so yeah
basically here I've got some other
collections of brushes like those from
bareMinerals and everyday minerals they
can just kind of sit right on top there
so I love that amount of space see what
I mean under the desk on this side I've
got a one two three four drawer cart
here that I have used since college and
up top I've got like mascara
and cream and gel liners I've got
concealers powders and foundations and
then this next drawer is kind of hard
for me to get shut with one hand cuz
I've got a bunch of false eyelashes and
and kind of like extra stuff down there
looking up here what's on top this is so
funny I found this awesome organizer it
was left in the master closet in here
and I remembered seeing it when I first
looked at the house and I just thinking
oh that's just some little like thing
that went on the wall that you know the
people here forgot about and but I took
a closer look now it's like oh my gosh
this is just a great little turn table
organizer thing and it's got so many
great little compartments here and it
really has just turned out to be great
for my brushes I was able to divide them
up kind of by brand I've got Sigma
brushes on here and I've got you know
different random brushes that I use for
every day and it's just a super great
way to keep them from taking up this
whole area I was picturing this whole
top shelf would take up my brushes
instead it's just this one little
compartment and it's working great over
here this is the same basic layout of
the turntable that I had before I've got
a lot of skincare things and primers and
and this is just a cheap little three to
five dollar turntable you can construct
it yourself it's available at Walmart
you'll find it by the like spice racks I
think and kitchen storage items but
anyway got a few little smaller tools
q-tips things like that
got some foundations moisturizers a lot
of different kinds of moisturizers
actually night creams day creams SPF you
name it there yes so over here my mini
mascaras underneath here are a bunch of
free samples that I force myself to look
through I kind of save like the stuff
that comes free with like your Sephora
order or whatever it may be and I wound
up with all these perfume samples which
I thought that'd be great for travel
and then a bunch of like there's bronzer
samples and shampoo body wash different
things like that so I'm keeping that
handy over here I've got a little area
where you know I save stuff from the
mail or any like makeup related
pamphlets or packaging that I want to
save if it's something I want to review
hint hint this product called the
falsies mascara from Maybelline saving
that because I think I want to review it
so anyway this desk is working fantastic
for getting ready in the morning I've
got great natural light coming through
here I've got my TV within view and dr.
da this great bookcase that actually
matches the desk top I've got my pallet
storage which this is just like a you
know one of those things you can put
your organizer file folders it's
definitely an office supply type product
very cheap and it holds the Coastal
Scents pallets fantastic so all of those
that I owner there and my you know
really cutely packaged stuff from like
two-faced and got a little container
there from lorac and that little Sigma
mirror that's so cute I think that is
the adorable stuff that's fun to kind of
set out containers here with face
products from cream blushes highlighters
bronzers things like that more Bramley
bronzers over here on this side so
there's all that down here we're talking
lip products so this is my kind of nude
lip side I've got nude glosses bronze
glosses and nude and bronze earthy tone
lipsticks pink glosses over here berry
glosses pink lipsticks the lipsticks can
you need to get categorized into like
corals and reds and berries down below
I've also got plumping lip glosses clear
tubes tinted lip balms lip liners have
their own drawer here like I said I'll
get into this more this is more to show
you the the room really than my whole
collection but I've got mineral makeup
then over there on that
side down below some overflow
skincare and that white tub brush rolls
couple extra makeup bags and this is my
older computer my older laptop that I'm
getting some files off of there so back
behind what you're gonna see a lot
probably in a lot of the backgrounds of
my shot are these doors it has a really
nice-sized closet in here actually what
the closet I've got some boxes that
still have some things in them up there
but in my apartment we used quite a few
of these like pullout drawers like three
drawer little mini dresser type things
and these bookshelves and so I just
thought rather than throw these away you
know you can always use options for
storage so I just kind of went in this
closet and put them just basically into
end which is going to be great as you
can see I haven't filled it up yet I've
got some travel bags I've got like my
printer and just a lot of some unrelated
items in there
but this is going to get maybe more
organized and just be one more way that
I can keep the clutter off of my desk in
here what I'm doing with it is my room
everyone this is the place where I will
be spending a lot of time doing
tutorials reviews all things makeup
related this is where I will be and like
I said I've got some more things that I
want to put up things on the walls and
this and that so if you have any
suggestions please let me know but I'm
definitely loving it so hey guys that's
