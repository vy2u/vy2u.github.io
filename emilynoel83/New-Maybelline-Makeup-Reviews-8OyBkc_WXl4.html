this video on a bunch of new Maybelline
products if you've been out in the drug
store lately chances are you've seen
quite a few new things from this brand
so I'll be going through the ones that I
have and kind of reviewing them for you
and also demonstrating how they work
this isn't really intended to be a
full-on tutorial but I did just want to
show you on camera how they come off and
how they apply because in a lot of cases
that's the difference with these
products all tried you know eye shadows
blushes foundations etc but what makes
these different is sort of the form
they're in so I want to demonstrate how
that works the things I'll be showing
you in this video are the Maybelline
Dream nude air foam foundation the Dream
Lumi touch highlighting concealer a
couple of the Dream bouncy blushes and
some of these color tattoo eye shadows
also the illegal links mascara which is
a new release on an old name there and
super stay 14-hour lipstick just to jump
right in and start off let's talk about
this dream nude air foam air infused
foundation it says nude perfect finish
it has an SPF 16 in it and my shade is
natural beige here and if you saw my
most recent video you know I talked
about Revlon Photoready airbrush both of
these come in a can and you know you
shake them out before I show the
application on my face I do just want to
demonstrate this on my hand real quick
so I shook up the product and it advises
you to use a walnut sized amount here
just to show you how it comes out and it
looks a lot like a mousse that you would
put in your hair you know except it's
tinted you know skin tone but once you
touch this this gets really really
liquidy like it is very much like the
texture of hair mousse as well because
as you touch it it really starts to go
to a a thin liquid type of consistency
it's actually less creamy than the
Revlon but this does not have shimmer in
it like the Revlon does and it goes on
much more sheer while I would call the
Revlon version maybe a
medium coverage foundation I would
definitely call this a light coverage it
seems to me to be a very thin layer of
tint that you would put all over your
skin giving you a similar effect of say
a tinted moisturizer and it is just I
mean I feel like I am using more of this
and having to pump out more and more as
I blend this over my face because it
just does go to that thin texture so
quickly and it seems to dry a little
more quickly as well this is not going
to cover up freckles it's not going to
cover up sunspots or dark circles or
anything like that I need to its benefit
it does not have shimmer in it which i
think is a good thing but at the same
time it doesn't have enough creaminess
to it to really give you coverage next
product is the Dream Lumi touch
highlighting concealer and so this is
one of those concealers that comes out
of the brush tip here my shade is nude
and you could also get one of these in
just a highlighting color like universal
just use it to highlight to get one that
would give me a little bit of coverage
on my skin this is a gel based concealer
illuminates shadows as it can see
actually give some recommended points of
where to apply this so you know like
your as they call the marionette lines
right here on either side of your mouth
and also kind of a the under eyes and
across your nose and that sort of thing
I really like this product actually I
felt like it's not too heavy and it is
somewhat buildable so like when I put
this on the first time I thought okay
there's some initial brightening for my
under eye area and then it just kind of
depends
I feel like day to day I will have
different needs or my under eye
concealer is concerned sometimes I need
more sometimes I don't need as much and
the fact that this is buildable without
looking cakey is a good thing and I also
applied it down my nose and as they
advise kind of around the sides of the
mouth it was able to conceal some
redness here rather well on the side of
my nose and what it reminds me of
Maybelline has another pretty popular
product out there the instant age rewind
eraser for dark circles and this I feel
like it's similar to this and that it's
not a very thick concealer although this
is just
little more creamy and this is a little
more laughter I applied the foundation
and that concealer by the way I went
over my face with a little bit of Laura
Geller balance and Brighton to give me
some coverage to supplement what I felt
that foundation was lacking and then I
also went over everything with some
Rimmel natural bronzer just a light
bronzer to perk everything up next a
product that I've gotten so many
questions on and it is the Maybelline
Dream bouncy blush when I saw these I
got so excited I was like what is this
you know I couldn't wait to pop it open
and actually touch it and see what they
meant by that but I have a couple shades
in this I have one that is kind of
lighter and this one's called fresh pink
and then I have a brighter one which is
called Hot Tamale it's like you can mush
down into it and you're not going to
scoop off product but you're just going
to touch on to it and it's going to kind
of feel like you're on some sort of
bubble there all these blushes are a
cream product I like the fact that
there's not too much moisture thrown
into them so you can feel okay putting
this on top of a foundation or a powder
and it doesn't leave any sort of tacky
feeling I mean it's kind of like the
dream mousse blushes were once you put
them on you didn't feel them on your
skin they didn't feel heavy I wanted to
demonstrate both of these so first I put
on the fresh pink just to show you how
light this was deeper skin tones I don't
think this would show up very much it is
it does have a little bit of Sheen to it
so it's not like a totally matte coat
and then Hot Tamale is definitely you
know that pop of color so I really
really like this shade and it looks by
the looks of it I mean I just had to try
it when I saw this shade in stores
because I thought is it going to give me
what it appears to have here and it's
almost like a staining effect on the
cheeks because it is so thin but yet it
has that subtle creaminess to it so I
really like the Dream bouncy blushes and
if you're looking for a good cream
product where blush is concerned I think
these are worth trying I've worn these
on their own and I've worn these um with
a powder blush on top either way I think
I find the staying power to be pretty
good especially with the brighter color
it's just more visible on the skin and
you can tell it's there and you can tell
that it has you know withstood a day of
Wieck step one of the most talked-about
products here lately in terms of new
products that have come out is the
Maybelline Color tattoo 24-hour
eyeshadow and so these are cream shadow
products we haven't seen a lot in the
drugstore in terms of long wearing cream
shadows until now
I mean we've had great shadow sticks
we've had you know revlon has come out
with cream shadows that are just that
they're a cream shadow but they're not
long wearing and with almost anything
I've tried I've had to feel like okay I
have to top this with a shadow because
this just will crease like crazy if I
don't and with these I definitely been
putting these to the test over the past
week wearing them with primer without
primer with shadow on top and without
shadow on top say these last rather well
on their own without anything else
involved what I will say is that the
intensity of the color does fade a
little bit throughout the day I looked
at them at the end of a work day so
putting them on for me it's 1:30 in the
morning and then I look at them at you
know say 12 hours later at 1:30 in the
afternoon and they're still there but
the intensity of the color has faded a
little bit what I do enjoy is that they
don't crease they don't collect in the
crease right here of your eye which is
hugely important because almost any
other cream shadow will do that except
the Mallee ever color shadow sticks
something about those they keep their
shimmer and their intensity the entire
day no problem these fade a little bit
but they don't crease so I've got to
give them a thumbs up for that and if
you want to top these with shadow I mean
you're gonna have a really long wearing
look there but I'm referring to wearing
these all on their own and I've got them
on all on their own right now I want to
walk you through really quick the shades
that I have here I have this one which
is called too cool that's the white I've
got bad to the bronze that's the one I
didn't show in the demo here I've got
toughest taupe which is the lone matte
she
that I have and then pomegranate Punk is
this gorgeous burgundy as you can see I
can kind of rub my hand across these and
they're not mixing together they are
picking up a little bit on my finger as
I rub across them but they're not really
lifting off the skin and becoming a mess
on my hand you're wondering what I did
to get this look I did it all with my
fingers which is pretty cool so I just
went with the taupe shade all over my
lid and I also took a little brush and
went just under my eye and then I took
the pomegranate shade and I dab that
along the outer corner just a little bit
almost created a little bit of an outer
V not too much though and then with my
pinky I use that in the white shade just
to get that little bit of brightness
around the tear duct and a little bit
under the brow so really easy to work
with you do have time to blend them and
really make them work for you in that
way I almost wish they would put this
into a stick form because it would be
easier to get the smudgy liner without
having to go to a brush at all and you
would also feel like maybe you have a
little more control getting it on your
lids so it would be cool if they came
out with a stick form but as a whole I'm
impressed with these these are probably
the best long wearing cream shadow from
the drugstore because I don't think I've
ever said drugstore long wearing cream
shadow until now
there's just nothing out there that does
this so people have compared these to
the Mac Paint Pots I have one Mac Paint
Pot it is long wearing but not as long
wearing as this so overall great job
maybelline on the color tattoos they
don't quite live up to their 24-hour
claim because they don't keep up that
intensity all day but as a whole they're
really good this is the Maybelline
illegal length mascara and they used to
have this a long time ago and this
actually used to be like my favorite
mascara in high school college time
somewhere in there and so I was really
curious to see how they changed it up
and basically they've made this into one
of those lash extensions mascaras which
I don't remember it being before
specifically I think they said they are
a 4-millimeter fiber extension there you
can see it right here right under my
finger this are being swept on your
Asha's in providing that little bit of
an extension mascara is a little wet for
my liking which seems to be a trend with
a lot of Maybelline mascaras your lashes
are sparse it's going to kind of clump
them together a little bit and not
separate and I think this may be a
mascara that I start to like better the
more I use it because it will dry just a
little more but right now it's not quite
the illegal lengths that I remembered it
being so I just kind of give this an
average rating finally had to try the
new lip product from Maybelline which is
the super stay 14-hour lipstick this
shade that I have is called infinite
iris so I really like the color but
staying power it's not 14 hours it kind
of bothers me when these brands put this
hour number on the products and rarely
if ever does it live up to that claim
but anyways this one looks like a
typical lipstick here it goes on and it
feels really creamy I'm not very picky
where scents are concerned but I really
dislike the scent of this product feel
like it's a chemical scent that they
tried to cover up with something that's
just a little bit sweet and it just
didn't as I said it goes on smooth and
then it feels kind of dry on your lips
and it does transfer onto things so for
example my coffee mug this morning yeah
it's going to come off on they're not
all going to go to your coffee mug it's
not going to all go on to the person you
just gave a kiss to but it's not going
to be there for 14 hour maybe some
remnants on there after that time but
overall this is going to be gone over
the course of eating talking and all
that maybe you no longer wearing than
say a Revlon lip butter but in terms of
feel they don't compare I now really
want you know that moisturized hydrated
feeling on my lips and this just kind of
makes it feel dry and it also kind of
highlights the lines that are in your
lips and so that's my review on a bunch
of new Maybelline products in a nutshell
here the things that I thought were hits
for me anyway were the Dream Lumi
concealer the bouncy blushes and the
color tattoo shadows the things that I
learned was not so impressed by where
the dream nude air foam the illegal
length mascara and the super stay
14-hour lips
Dick's so I hope that helps you guys
have a great day and thank you so much
