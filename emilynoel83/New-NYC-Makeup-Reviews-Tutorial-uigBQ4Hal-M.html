I noticed at the end of an aisle there
was a display of some new NYC or New
York color products this is a line
that's been really hit and miss for me
over the years some things I try and I
love and their must-haves and then there
are some things that I get really
disappointed with so I thought hey I'm
gonna give these a try see what I think
and let everybody know there will also
be a tutorial on this eye look it is
using several of these new eye products
as well I'm gonna start off with the
lips though and the a policies' glossy
lip balm I gotta say I was drawn to
these for the cuteness of the little
Apple inside the lipstick there I don't
know if you can see that they had a nice
array of some like pink and berry colors
so I picked up a couple one is in the
shade apple blossom and so this is kind
of like a magenta looking lipstick with
a light pink apple in the middle so
you're getting sort of the combination
of those two colors and that's the
swatch of that shade the other one is
called Apple plum pie and it's this
shade right down here the apple blossom
really not that big of a fan of it it
didn't give off that much color I mean
that these are hydrating they feel nice
on the lips but I mean I didn't feel
like the color was that unique and it
didn't really show up that much but this
one the Apple plum pie I think is so
beautiful and it's kind of like a sheer
take on that really deep kind of Plum e
berry lip color you're seeing out there
a lot I think it's beautiful but I think
a lot of people might be a little
hesitant to try to pull that one off in
like a full color opaque lipstick so
this is a little bit more sheer but it
gives you you know that beautiful kind
of plum berry color I love it
it had it not like kind of clash with
the shirt I'm wearing I would have worn
that today they smell really fruity I'm
not sure if they're supposed to smell
like apples I'm not sure that I sense a
real Apple II smell there but they do
smell nice probably won't run out and
get a whole lot more because I just sold
on this
kind of remind me of the vibe of the lip
butters and the color whispers and
things like that by this one the lighter
shades are going to be more sheer less
visible on the lips and the deeper
shades are just going to show up a
little bit better I really do like this
color though this Apple plump I am very
pleased with that as far as the eye
products you may remember some little
palettes that NYC put out over the past
couple of years and they've got I think
maybe four powder eyeshadows like a
cream base and a cream shimmer
I totally dislike those I thought they
had zero color payoff the little cream
parts like dried up and literally fell
out of the container like in a whole
chunk like okay there's a little shimmer
thing it's falling out again like I'm
not a big fan of those these have that
same kind of like quilted texture on
them and so I kind of feared that maybe
they do the same thing and then I
thought surely not surely they would
improve that as a whole I feel like
these are not near as flaky as those
seem to be but they're not terribly
pigmented you're going to get a shimmery
look a relatively sheer look you're
gonna see that when you see this
tutorial you know it's actually like the
finished eye look that I came out with
here but it is two things it is sheer
and it is shimmery and actually it's
three things it really requires a base
of some sort you must use an eyeshadow
primer I always use eyeshadow primer but
I mean this is one of those shadows that
I think really requires it and
preferably some sort of color base will
bring the bring the colors out on these
a little bit more are these as good as
wet and wild absolutely not as good as
NYX no as good as covergirl no this trio
is called late-night latte and it's got
a cream a lavender and a light brown and
here are those shades swatched you can
see the cream the lavender real
disappointing I wanted that to look just
like it did in the pan but it didn't
really the brown is not so bad the brown
is just kind of like a shimmery Brown
again nothing matte if you demand matte
shadows they are not not at least in
these trios I got
and then this other trio I have as
Central Park plums so a pink a taupe and
kind of deep burgundy colors you can see
the pink extremely sheer the taupe
doesn't show up a whole lot the burgundy
I mean I would expect more from the
color I see there in the pan too the
color on the swatch it's not so hot the
other thing I picked up was this sparkle
I dust and so it's in a little thing
like this it's a wand applicator I
wasn't gonna get one of these but I
noticed this particular shade it's
called smokey topaz and I am a sucker
for these kind of taupe purple colors I
think they're so beautiful and so I
thought you know if this turns out to be
a good thing that's a color I would wear
a lot you've got to be really careful of
this is essentially loose powder in a
wand applicator and even as you open it
up like there's little bits that are
gonna fly off like they flew on to my
pants earlier you know it's not pleasant
there's a couple little bits it's just
so lightweight it's hard to man put a
swatch down you initially put it on here
and it's gonna be a little bit flaky but
once you blend it in I mean this color
is beautiful well you're gonna see in
this tutorial that I'm going to show you
now is I took this trio and since this
little lavender shade wasn't really
doing it for me I kind of replaced it
with this and I used bases to make that
work and so here's the look all right
first off a little eye primer using my
put a lid on it eye primer from the bone
and just gonna put a little bit of that
all over the lid up through the crease
and up to the brow bone next I'm using a
base for this loose powdery shadow it
really needs a base so this is the
Maybelline Color tattoo and bearly beige
just gonna get a little bit of that on
my finger and apply that all over the
lid this is the sparkle eye dust in
smokey topaz I'm just gonna dab a little
bit of this on the lid there not really
trying to blend it in because I think
that would be a fallout nightmare
so I'm just dabbing some on and then I'm
going to take a little flat brush and
use that to kind of Pat it in on top of
the color tattoo and now you can see how
gorgeous that color is I love it and
inevitably that was a little hard to
manage and I got some fall out there so
I'm taking a fan brush really lightly
and it sweeps it away no problem next
I'm going to this color HD trio this is
in late night latte and I take the brown
and use that in the crease I'm just
going back and forth in my natural
crease area then I'm gonna use a fluffy
brush with this pearly white like that
it's my highlight and I want to work in
a little bit deeper shade so I'm going
to my other trio in Central Park plums
and I'm gonna be using this burgundy
right down here using that shade on a
small flat brush and I want to kind of
create a little bit of an outer V with
my shadow here when you're working with
a flat brush it's really about just
placing the shadow where you want it so
I'm kind of angling upward a little bit
towards like the tip of my brow there
and making sure I get some on the lid so
that shadow looks like it's kind of
originating from somewhere if you know
what I mean sometimes I see outer views
appear out of nowhere and it's like you
need to use the crease and that's where
the naturally you know some darkness
would be and then build out from there
and I'm gonna blend that out a little
bit and our liner is gonna fall right
and blind with the way that shadows been
done using my Milani ultra fine liquid
liner and I believe the shade is black
vinyl and then I'm gonna wing it upward
kind of falling in line with how I did
the shadow there I've done these looks
sometimes where it's like the I do the
wing first and I make the shadow fall in
line with that here I did the shadow
first and the wing is kind of matching
then I'm lining the waterline with
Maybelline master drama and midnight
master and I'm gonna do a little bit on
the skin as well kind of connecting to
the wing what makes this look really
pretty is smudging some of this Burgundy
down under
and going over the black I'm gonna
switch back to the palette with the
brown that's this one and just take a
little bit of that kind of medium brown
and take that under the inner part then
I'm going to curl my lashes apply some
of the covergirl clump crusher mascara
on my upper lashes Maybelline lash
discovery on my lower lashes and today
I'm using the kiss zero three false
lashes so I'll get that done and I'll be
right back so to sum it all up the a
policies' glossy balm it's not
necessarily a more fantastic texture
than the lip butters or than the color
whispers or anything like that but I do
feel like this color in the Apple plum
pie was outstanding I really really like
that as far as the eyeshadows these HD
color trio eyeshadows not a vast
improvement over what they were selling
in those little you know palette or
sized and packaged like wet and wild but
they are not near that kind of quality I
like the look I got I mean its sheer and
this is with the help of bases eyeshadow
primers this little loose thing here I
mean it's a gorgeous color I guess I'll
say there is by it your own risk because
chances are you're going to take the
little wand out it's gonna flake on your
pants I would put a napkin down like
you're going to dinner on your lap so
that does not happen but if you put it
on top of like a creamy base I think
it's really really pretty
paired with brown I mean I like I do
like the finished look
had I not done false lashes and winged
liner this would be a very natural
looking eye I think you're a young girl
or a beginner and you're starting out
with makeup and you're intimidated by
the dark colors and you just want some
sheer products to work with that you
know aren't gonna get you too far off
track you know they they aren't going to
show up too deep on the lids these may
be something to play with but if you're
accustomed to very rich pigmented
shadows and you like some mattes thrown
in and you like you know that real
creamy buttery eyeshadow textures is not
maybe something you're going to
be impressed by they can work I would
advise anybody using these to use an eye
primer or some sort of colored base
products so they have something to cling
to and that does help bring out the
shadow a little bit more so hope this
was helpful for you guys thank you so
much for watching and I will see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
