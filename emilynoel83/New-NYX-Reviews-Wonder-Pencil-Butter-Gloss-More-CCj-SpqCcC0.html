my eyes a little break from the context
I switch them out every month and so I
try to have a day where I don't put them
in at all of this to give my eyes a
little rest from them but I think you
can still very much be glam in glasses
so more power to all you who wear
glasses all the times I've actually seen
quite a few people here on YouTube who
Rock the glasses and look so awesome
with them on so I'm wearing mine today
and we're going to talk about new NYX
products and some of these I found
online some in an Ulta store I'm pretty
sure most of what I have here is all
around new but if not some of it may
just be new to me but first thing I'm
going to talk about are these butter
glosses so they've come out with this
new line of lip glosses and if you've
seen other reviews I've done on NYX
products you know I really really like
the NYX mega shine glosses I think
they're just a really nice texture very
full on color what you see is what you
get not these and there are a couple of
really high points for me with these I
think the texture is extremely
comfortable on the lips like does not
feel sticky at all they're not so
unsticky that they have horrible staying
power so I mean these last okay on my
lips when I wear them also the scent
reminds me of like a cake just out of
the oven I mean very pleasant scent very
like I'm sensing some vanilla but I also
feel like um some sort of baked thing
you know like cupcakes or cake oh no
it's yeah it's all my nose I knew there
was a reason why I stayed in my pink
pajama bands today because I was gonna
drop some pink lip gloss on anyways um
great scent good texture thing I didn't
love as much is the color payoff I feel
like it's not as bold as it might appear
I feel like they're all like really
milky when I put them on they can be a
bit streaky on the lips like when you do
a nail polish
and it doesn't go you know nice and
opaque in the first coat you got to just
work with it a little bit to get real
nice even color I feel like that's
sometimes the way these apply and
they've got you know ok color here on my
hand but my lips with the natural
pigmentation that they have they don't
show up as full-on color on my lips in
fact the lightest shade just looks as if
on my lips like I've put a clear gloss
on or something it's kind of strange and
I've got a blog post about these showing
them on my lips going into much more
detail so you're aware on this first
shade is called Eclair
that's that lightest pink the pink
that's got just a little more punch to
it this was the first one I got this is
called meringue so that's right there in
the middle a little bit brighter pink
that's this and then this one on the end
that looks like it has a little more
coral to it I'm wearing that today and
that is called maple blondie with that I
wanted like a little more color on the
lips so I took this buxom big and
healthy lipstick and Monico kind of a
coordinating shade put that underneath
put the gloss on top but I mean you see
what I mean they're kind of like milky
creamy but not like incredibly saturated
on the colors those reasons I mean I'm
not out of my mind loving these I'm not
probably going to purchase any more of
them but I just wanted to show you what
those were about stay matte but not flat
liquid foundation was so excited when I
saw they came out with this and I
ordered this off the website on the
shade of God is soft beige and it comes
off like when I go to put it on my face
it's just a little bit yellow for me but
I've got it on today and I mean it all
pretty much worked out once you blend it
in but it says oil-free water-based full
coverage mineral enriched matte finish
and it all started the love affair with
stay matte but not flat started for me
with the powder foundation as you can
see I've used a lot of it I have this
one in medium beige and what I've always
felt was special about this product was
that it combined coverage with a non
shiny finish but yet it looked natural
on the skin
there was no sparkle no shimmer nothing
heavy like
popping out of this powder even though
it covered up my problems and it erased
the shine it still looks like skin so
I've been very impressed with that I
don't know if I would call it a satin
finish or if I would go that far but
it's just definitely an extraordinary
finish on the skin so I love the powder
and so I had a high standard for this
far as the texture on this foundation
and it's a little bit thicker than your
average liquid foundation so just a
little bit more creamy
once it blends in on the skin like I
love the initial look that you get once
this is all blended out even if you
haven't put concealer on or anything you
know you may still need some for your
circles and whatnot but it looks so good
it's very consistent in the philosophy
of the powder and that it does mattify
you but yet it looks like real skin it's
like you can see when you turn your head
like there's a little bit of a I don't
want to say glow because there's no
shimmer or sparkle but it's it it gives
a real skin type feel and finish on this
can be buildable it's not enough for me
to like correct a dark under-eye or like
the darkness you get kind of in the
inner corners of your eye and stuff like
that I need some concealer there but it
can be built up a little bit too
probably like the high end of medium
coverage so it's got all this stuff
going for it does it actually last
throughout the day I am NOT a very oily
person but I've worn this a few times
just to test it with a very minimal
amount of powder on my face and I did
get oily in my nose area primarily I
just looked at it and thought that
doesn't look quite as fresh and lovely
as it did when I first put it on so I
needed to touch up with the normal
routine when I applied this and I put
some powder over it you know make a
conscious effort to set it it really
does wear pretty well throughout I would
say the maturity of a day like the
majority of a work day it's gonna look
still pretty fresh for me at the end of
the day if you're incredibly oily you
may have a different story there but I'm
just kind of combo skin so the
as the problem and I've got I've got a
little bronzer on a little blush on a
little highlight on so it's hard to just
see the foundation here in this video
but it really does have a nice natural
look yet it covers and mattify so got
this born to glow liquid illuminator it
says lightweight liquid illuminator that
gives skin a refresh glow and beautiful
highlight the shade is Sunbeam and I've
got to say I've only used this a few
times and I feel like the containers
like half-full like as I told it up to
the light it looks like it's just
half-full that's not fair
it's like when you open up a bag of
potato chips and you're like where's all
the chips and it's like a third of the
thing it got filled up I don't know not
real pleased with that but this is
pretty much the exact same color its
benefits high-beam let's just cut right
to the chase here really reflective just
maybe the slightest hint of pink
undertone in there so really all the
qualities of benefit hi be once it
blends out all the way the glow is
really soft I'll use it with my ELF
small stipple brush and it goes on very
easily I just put some on my hand first
and get it on my brush and then go to
town to check again on what the cost was
on this this says point five fluid
ounces and like I said if this were all
the way full I would say that seems like
a decent amount of product you kind of
compare it to the foundation here you
think you're getting quite a bit but it
seems to be only I mean like there's not
much in there so got a double check on
that as far as the you know what the
value might be for the record it does
perform for me just like high-beam I've
got the wonder pencil I feel like this
needs a theme song and a little cape or
something this is the NYX wonder pencil
and it says it is a concealer eye
brightener and reverse lip liner in one
special about this is that it comes in
varying shades for different skin types
so I have light and it looks like this
like a traditional pencil but yeah you
can use this to conceal I used it to
conceal a little zip that I have in
between my eyebrows can't see that any
more you do the reverse lipliner thingy
you know you can use it around the
Cupid's bow if you don't like highly
shimmery stuff theirs is gonna have the
same sort of skin type finish as the
concealer would have now I used it in my
waterline as we'll see it looks a little
bit bright in my waterline this was
applied within the last probably half
hour for the long haul throughout the
whole day this does not last as well in
the waterline as the Rimmel scandaleyes
does or the Tarte emphasized so if
you're buying it strictly for the eye
brightening purposes I wouldn't rate it
as the best but what is cool about it is
if you want the multitasking and really
find your skin type if you check out the
different options I'm not sure how far
they go how deep they went it were sold
out of most of these in the store so I
wasn't really able to see what all they
had okay let's talk eyes shadows they've
got some new single shadows called glam
shadows and I am wearing those today
I've got amber fire and this is kind of
a muted golden e color I say muted
because it's just not the real brassy
kind of gold do you see a lot it's a
little bit softer and it does have some
sparkle in there and I guess that's the
overall tendency with these shadows is
to have Sparkle I ordered these on the
Ulta website so I wasn't able to tell
for sure what I was getting this shade
is called sable and basically I like one
of these and not so much the other I
feel like this amber fire has a nice
texture I feel like it's kind of creamy
feeling even for having that glitter in
there it didn't feel real gritty color
payoff was excellent but this other one
this deeper one called sable I thought
it felt gritty the color payoff was not
so hot there you can see them but I felt
like that was a really nice texture this
one just felt kind of dry and gritty
and as you can see for a dark brown I
don't think it's having quite that kind
of effect that you see in there on my
hand at all I've got the more golden II
shade on my lid and the brown in the
crease so it kind of blended out and
functioned almost like a matte color
actually which is crazy because you see
how she Marie it is there I would
suggest maybe checking these out in
stores I mean the way the Knicks display
is set up you can swatch them and feel
them for yourself because there may be
some inconsistencies across this whole
line then there's some other new palates
new trios just a whole new line
basically of eyeshadow groupings and one
is called the love and Florence
collection and they're configured with
five shades like this and this one's
called eat love be fab and this one just
caught my eye for that gorgeous coral
with kind of a gold reflective quality
so doing a tutorial with this I've been
playing with this and created like a
really neat look that I think you'd
enjoy but this is such a great palette
nice matte brown to have right there
these three are yummy gorgeous emerald
green really pops the dark brown not
quite as impressed with that it doesn't
come off quite as dark as it should as
it would appear in here but as a whole I
think this is a great little kid the
swatches I mean the gold really pops the
coral shade is beautiful even prettier
than it looks in that swatch the matte
Brown truly soft nice I mean just this
that's a good shade to have just in
general in your collection my phone's
ringing the green and then there's that
sparkly brown that I said wasn't quite
as dark as I thought it should be can I
call you back real quick I'm just
wrapping up this video oh okay no that's
fine
see ya bye that was mom she thought I
called her I didn't call her but I will
call her but anyway a pretty sweet
little palette and this does make me
want to you know look at what else they
have in these kinds of shadows like I
said trios this kind of grouping I think
there was and yet another configuration
but I just really that just kind of
spoke to me when I saw it and it said by
me so I did so that's what I have I'm
just wanted to update you on some of
those
things I again do have a blog about
these butter glosses showing you more of
how they actually look on the lips so
check that out so thank you so much for
spending some time with me and watching
this video I hope you're having a great
day and I'll see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
