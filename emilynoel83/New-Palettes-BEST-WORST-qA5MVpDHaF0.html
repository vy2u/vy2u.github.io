tuning in this video is going to be all
about one of my favorite topics in the
makeup world of mists you know rolling
miss leaves over here it's all about
palettes and I have recently tried well
I've got a stack of six of them right in
front of me rice is on these range from
you know the 30 $40 range I believe up
to $85 so I know with palettes a lot of
times you're thinking well if I get this
one how will that compare to this other
one that I'm thinking about their cost
I think comparisons are really key very
helpful when it comes to reviewing
palettes so I thought it would be fun to
just talk about these in one big chunk
and I'm going to be going from my least
favorite to my most favorite so I'll
show you some swatches and just kind of
walk you through the different high
points and low points of all of these
different palettes and one that was
unfortunately a real disappointment to
me I wanted to love this palette and
mainly because of the amount of money I
put in to buy this ballot it's the
Lancome audacity in Paris palette here
and you can see packaging I think is
adorable I love this little design
they've put on the front you pop it open
it does come with a double-ended brush
one fluffy end one flat and the fluffy
end is kind of huge for my eyes but
whatevs
big mirror which is always great you're
actually sixteen shadows in here you are
getting a mix of all different warm and
cool tones I feel like they've put in
several really workable highlight shades
you move into some mid tones where
you've got you know I love this kind of
rosy brown and then you know warmer
Brown you've got that option really nice
deep dark shades it's always great to
have a matte Brown and a matte black to
work with in your palettes and there are
some really brilliant shimmery shades as
well and some of these you may be
familiar with if you're a big Lancome
shadow user I know kitten heel for
example that's a shade I think I have in
some other little Lancome palette there
are some individually really pretty
shades in here but as a whole I was kind
of let down by the overall texture and
pigmentation of everything but you know
I'm thinking about my urban decay
palettes my Too Faced palettes just you
know the other palettes I'm looking at
in the stack in front of me and I think
you know the war
I've had to do to build up these shades
to get them to really stand out and be
as vibrant as I hope they would be I've
used this palette a lot I've gone deep
and dark with it and you can do like a
nice smoky eye with this it's not like
it's the worst palette of life I don't
want to put it out there that way but it
is a pricey palette and for that cost I
would expect it to be at least as good
as some of the other high-end palettes
that I have and it's kind of one of
those situations where a lot of the
shades are just kind of in that sort of
dusty not super pure color type of range
you know what I'm saying like this
purple for example it's pretty it's
really pretty to look at like in the
lineup of shadows but it's just a very
like dusty muted not pure purple so when
you put that on the eyes you don't
really get the satisfaction of oh I'm
wearing purple today you know a lot of
my looks seem to come out very neutral
and a lot of them looking very similar
so not a big fan of this palette next
this is the Laura Geller the delectables
eyeshadow palette this says delish
delicious delicious shades of nude and I
know there is another version of this
palette that is more of a cool smoky
looking selection of shades but this is
what this one looks like and I think
just to look at this it just does look
yummy
it looks delectable if those were
candies I would eat them there are some
certain shades in here that I'm thinking
come to mama you know these are my
colors these right here you know it's
like a sunrise sunset type thing and
yeah these babies up here the greens
laura geller is of course really well
known for her baked formulas in face
products like balance and brighten
bronze and brighten various highlights
and things like that so I have to ride
some of her baked eyeshadows some of
them a lot of times come in like little
duo's like about yay big
but in this palette I thought it was
interesting that not only do you have
some of those really metallic very shiny
shimmery shades that you expect to see
in her baked format but you also have
some mattes like vanilla mushroom
hazelnut mahogany those are all matte
shades and they're very classic colors
as well so there are nice colors to have
a nap
and mix them in with all the really
super shiny hey look at me type colors
and part of the thing with baked shadows
is you can wear them dry or you can add
a little bit of water to them you know a
little fix plus or whatever you know
makeup setting spray you like to use you
mix that in with these and then you can
achieve an even more intense look and I
think before you invest in a lot of
baked shadows you should ask yourself am
I willing to take the time to do the
extra step there are some days when I'm
getting ready when yeah I've got that
extra time I don't mind doing it I like
the finished look but more often than
not it's just an extra little hassle you
know especially when you look at other
palettes and you see okay they can be
intense and they don't need any water
added to them but as I show you swatches
of this one you'll see it all dry
everything just swatched out dry no
primers I don't ever swatch anything on
top of certain primers in any of my
videos as you see them dry I think
they're pretty faint really and I think
the matte shades are especially
disappointing like they're so light and
I've worn these on my eyes as well of
course and it's just it's not enough
punch they're very dry feeling to the
touch now when you look at the swatches
with a little bit of what did I use I
use the elf makeup mist and set to
dampen these and you can see a major
difference in the shimmery shades like I
think they look double as brilliant the
matte shades only seem to be helped
slightly by that that's a little
disappointing because I think for the
palette to really work you need the
matte shades to be just as good as the
shimmery shades so they can be worn in
conjunction with one another you know a
nice deep dark good-quality matte brown
in the crease is what allows shades like
honey and sunrise to really pop on the
lids let's say it's not an awful palette
by any means
I just wanted these shadows to be so
good just used dry I think there's a
really nice very fall-like concept
happening with this palette but for me
I'm just not seeing it as a must-have
now these next four palettes I really
enjoy I'm impressed by them I really am
glad I have them and one of them is
actually a sequel palette to the
original it cosmetics naturally pretty
matte palette now they have the
naturally pretty romantic
and it actually is a similar color I've
got right behind me here the original
ones so you've got lighter pink and now
deeper pink but on the inside here's
what we're working with you know what
strikes me first about this palette I
feel like there are a lot of pastels in
here matte pastels and when I first
think of that combination I think are
they gonna be just chalky and dusty
because they're light shades and they're
matte I don't feel that way though about
these I think the color is super easy to
work with and build up you do have the
transforming pearl in here which is
something you can use is like an
accident shade maybe you only wanted a
little glow like under the brow or
around the inner corner you've got that
or you can layer it underneath or on top
of some of these matte shades another
thing I like about this palette is the
fact there is a pistachio green shade in
here there are also some really pretty
purpley tones and for that reason it
reminds me of a matte version of my Too
Faced romantic eye palette because that
is it's such an unlikely shadow combo to
pair greens and purples but it's so
pretty and if your shadows are pigmented
enough to really pop on your eyes it
won't look muddy one small gripe about
this if you've already got this palette
there are some shades I won't say they
are exact like they put in the exact
same colors but there are some shades
that are really close in here I'm
talking about the shades called Noir in
here and mystery in this palette the
deep dark Browns Java and fate you've
got midnight which is a dark navy blue
and Trust in this palette and I get that
they're trying to keep this something
that people will see and be like yeah
that's wearable that's something I can
use you know they're not going to put
totally off-the-wall colors in an it
cosmetics matte palette to me I still
think they're different enough and I
still think they're worth having
especially if you are a die-hard matte
shadow fan and you're tired of all of
the matte palettes that come out that
are so so just neutral it's like
everybody who makes matte palettes
thinks all people want are the nude
shades I think some people want some fun
takes on mats as well and there are some
of those in here the original palette I
think is overall a
a bit deeper with the tones and you've
got this really unique kind of warm
sector down here that I love meanwhile
this felt like I said some more like
pastel type colors that still really pop
and if you're a fan of Purple's or
purple-ish type shades there are some of
those in this palette there are some in
this palette and they each have their
kind of own unique twist if you swatch
all of the purples from this palette and
all of these in a lineup you have the
most beautiful range so I could see this
being a nice companion to the original
or you know just used on its own I think
it's a great palette this next one is
one I feel like I am speaking about this
palette from a total makeup lovers
perspective a makeup collectors
perspective if you will because I feel
like there's that way of looking at
things and then there's the super
practical way of looking at things and
from the very practical side you might
see this palette and be like okay I'm
willing to seek out those kind of looks
from drugstore products and pull off
that type of I look from any number of
other cheaper products but from a
collector standpoint this is something
that's kind of exciting to have and I am
talking about the Mac warm neutral 15
color eye palette this is one of those
pre put together Mac palettes I remember
getting this talking about it in a haul
video I believe in saying you know I'm
not even sure if this is worth it
I dropped $85 on this thing I feel like
that's too much really so many of you
were saying in the comments section that
that's actually a really good deal for
something like this because the shadows
are so great that are in here and if I
were to create this palette on my own
like by an empty Mac palette and fill it
with singles I would have paid a lot
more so I see that but then I also think
$85 you know like this is a fairly you
know just neutral normal standard
looking palette can't I get that kind of
look from other things I do think you
can get that kind of look from other
things this is a palette that I enjoy by
looking at the small details of what
this is also I find it worthwhile for me
because I don't own very many Mac
shadows with all the amount that I have
feels like a medium sized Z palette and
I didn't
already have any of these shades so I'm
very excited to have this and be able to
try those shades and there are just some
really interesting things happening in
here for example this shade down here
this is called lemon tart I don't have
anything like that it's like a really
soft yellowy buttery shade that is so
pretty
around the inner corner it's like
absolutely turning the lights on I love
that and this is a really interesting
kind of greenish khaki shade that I
think is so so pretty honey lost in
amber lights and these shades on my kind
of golden e brown eyes I think it's so
pretty the dark too right up here I use
all the time like any look I do from
this palette I feel like I'm pulling in
one of these too and this one is dark
brew this one's danced in the dark
love um have become a huge fan of saddle
and I just got to say these shades blend
so nicely they really are such good
quality eyeshadows and it's just fun to
have those shades that people know by
name I use this palette to create a look
for a wedding I went to recently I
absolutely loved it it was warm bronzy
some of these shades I really don't
think I would have picked out myself
but I really really love them so pricey
yes
but am i enjoying it absolutely next
palette is something I have really been
enjoying and I know I've mentioned it at
least a couple of times on this channel
and I still wanted to work it into what
I was talking about here the content of
this video because you might wonder like
okay she said she really likes that how
does that stack up with everything else
and this is the anastasia beverly hills
world traveler shadow couture palette i
really think this is for the person who
likes their neutral looks but is ready
to start bringing the pops of color
because there's some really pretty pops
of color in here the Shaco metallic
beautiful yellowish green a gorgeous
pink in here asher is a really fun blue
it's not all just a glitter bomb type
palette because you've got some really
nice a matte shade soft peach fudge
Morocco those shades are just money and
you'll find yourself working them into
all of the different looks you do love
that there's a mirror included also love
that there is a brush that
I get a heck of a lot of use out of that
is also put in here one side it's kind
of like a jumbo smudger brush the other
side is a really great terrific blending
brush it's a lot of fun it's probably
the least expensive thing I've mentioned
in this video so great value love it now
there's one more pallet to talk about
guys and it is right on par with this
one if not a hair above it and it is the
Too Faced Stardust by Vegas nay palette
slash collection because it's really a
little collection that you get and I
have been so impressed by this
I have heard raves about it on YouTube
and before I even got it I thought yeah
yeah really
it was that great I really adore this um
I think this is a very thoughtfully put
together palette I think you get really
nicely sized shadows in here and the
selection of shades I feel like is right
up my alley this will be a great
giftable thing because I think somebody
would get this and be like wow this is
special stuff you open this up this is
magnetic
you've got Naomi aka Vegas name herself
here pictures of some of the looks and
outside of this box comes a little tray
and that tray is holding several like
accessory products you get a Too Faced
shadow insurance and I'm always using a
base with whatever I look I do so it's
great to have that in there to give you
a better than sex mascara which i think
is an awesome bodybuilding like really
volumizing mascara they also threw in
this Too Faced glamour dust in nude beam
which I have not yet actually played
with in any of my looks and I don't want
to tip it too far but it's a pretty life
soft beige very very shimmery loose
shadow also in there another reason why
I think this is fun to gift is because
it comes with all these cards okay I'm a
dork but this makes me think of like
little baseball cards if you like makeup
trading cards they've got the look in
you know not just a sketched out face
chart style but really like seeing a
photograph and then step by step on the
back of every card I love it and I'm
looking at these and I'm thinking yeah I
want to do that look I want to do that
look a lot of times you'll get a palette
and there will be some sort of
instruction with it but it's usually
like really predictable and I don't
always follow it
with all these I'm seeing them and I'm
thinking yeah yeah I love it I'm with
you I want to do this so I'm wearing
this today and I did this look this look
is called repost rebel and so I just
went step by step and I very easily
really recreated the look seriously I
love how it's basic a little more shiny
Purple's thank you
burgundy yes please Gold absolutely does
the palate need a black every palate
needs black there are plenty of things
in here that can give you that really
natural like quick out the door everyday
look but there are so many ways to spice
a look up with this this look is a lot
of thin City all over the lid follow me
and pink pearl are around the inner
corner but then it's kind of a
transition shade I've got showgirl right
up in here and chandelier is the
highlight I've already used this palette
probably five or six times and I still
feel like I have only scratched the
surface of the kinds of looks you can do
and I'm just loving like I said these
little ideas and it's not to take
anything away from this honest hacia
palette but I just think the shadow
quality is extremely good across the
boards with every shade and just all the
little extras so that is my review on
just a bunch of different palettes I've
tried recently we're on the verge of
holiday palette time one of my favorite
times of the year so definitely be on
the lookout for a lot of new reviews to
come thank you guys so much for spending
time with me today and I will see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
