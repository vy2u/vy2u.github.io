quick update for you on some recent
items I picked up most of them are all
there pretty much a drugstore type items
but I wanted to let you know just what
I've gotten recently because a lot of
more things you can probably expect a
review on pretty soon I'm gonna try to
start doing that more so um first off
I've got a couple of the L'Oreal hip
eyeshadows wildin is in cheeky it's like
it got a deep purple slash sort of
metallic red kind of shade there that's
really different from anything else I
have and also I have this one in
forgiving they've got a really nice kind
of smoky taupe color and a turquoise
color so I'm really excited to start
using those I have used um that shade
this sort of brownish shade and it's
makes a really really good contour color
so we'll see how I like continue to like
both as I keep using them a couple other
things that I thought were awesome buys
that I picked up when I was at Claire's
actually I've heard a lot of people talk
about how good some of the Claire's eyes
shadow is you know really pigmented
gives off a lot of color and they have
these great looking rolled palettes
there look how free those colors are
they've got like you know this one has
ten colors in it and they're all they
all have kind of a metallic finish I've
only used a few of them so I can't
really say for sure you know put the
colors like on all of them but I'm
getting a sense you know they give off
so much like you just touch your finger
to it and you get a lot of color off on
it so um if you can see here yeah that's
a pretty good shot of it um you know
just a lot of earth tones and these are
not even really almost look like they'd
be cream shadows as you look at them
there they are
you know powder shadow and I really love
I'd used that dark kind of black color
you see right down there and that's
really good too so I loved this palette
so far so I picked that up because
they're like buy one get one half off
and then
got this really fun colorful one let me
open it up here again ten colors in it
and here you get they're not all real
metallic although they some of them are
kind of give you a couple greens some
blues and purples this doesn't isn't
really showing up the colors are very
vibrant they're really great and they
just don't find stuff like that in the
drugstore all the time so I mean if
you're interested in some really you
know doing some experimenting with some
new shades check out clear so they have
like tons and tons of different palettes
and stuff but I just saw these and I was
like oh my gosh especially this one so
oh oh maybe do some tutorials or some
you know specifically music I figure out
how well I like those then today I went
to Walgreens and I was looking for you
know it's a new foundation to try and
cuz I love Revlon Colorstay but I was
just kind of you know wondering what
else was out there and when we'll have
buy one get one and I'm not was I don't
think I really been that impressed with
their face products but they have this
new foundation out called lasting
lasting finish and this is a transfer
resistant formula will especially apply
for up to 16 hours enriched with
minerals to help energize skin
comfortable where I got color 200 and
soft beige and I mean it looks it sounds
good
usually you hear they're like when
people talk about stuff you know having
Merrill's and it's more the standpoint
of you know natural finish or you know
won't irritate your skin and that kind
of thing but you don't usually hear it
associated with something that's long
wearing so I thought this would be kind
of interesting to try and so I with that
I got something free and so I was really
curious about this volume flash mousse
mascara yeah sounds kind of interesting
doesn't it like I didn't know they did
mousse mascara I haven't used it at all
yet but I mean it got kind of a good
looking brush on it
you know volumizing mascaras go time I
can't really get a good feel for the
formula is lighter okay
and I actually kept the packaging so I
could let you know what it's claims are
here that's five times the volume
instantly air whipped formula feels two
times lighter than regular mascara it
also says it has minerals in it for
healthier lashes what else that's about
it but I just thought well you know if
I'm gonna get something free with that
foundation I might as well try it out so
I'll let you know how that goes and then
lastly NYC that kind of surprising brand
you find at Walmart quite often and they
have had some really good things in the
past I know they have a very popular
eyebrow kit they have some good bronzers
there but they are really expanding
their line and I didn't even really know
what they have minerals now they have a
lot of new eyeshadows new bronzers like
mineral eye shadow liner stuff really
cool stuff and so I picked up a few
things there
first off from some reviews that I've
actually seen people on here doing
talking about how good they're
lengthening mascara is this is like a
buck and some change and I was just like
well if it's that cheap and people say
it's that good I might as well try it um
so just thought I'd give that a go I'll
let you know on that I also picked up a
couple of lipsticks there because I
wanted some good red lipstick and not
quite sure you know how well I like it
on me yet you know true red lipstick so
I got a couple different shades they
were a dollar a piece ones more red red
and one's a little ones called sheer red
that's what I have on right now so you
know I'll see how I like them I figure
if I'm gonna experiment I don't want to
really spend much on it so those are
those are some things that have been
around for a while in their line but a
new thing I got that having taken out of
the package yet
it's called lip
it's like Li ppin large it's a new kind
of lip plumper they have this in quite a
few shades and you can see what they say
or what they're gonna look like
afterwards I like what plumpers because
I like I some people felt by actually
like that tingly get this it has
cinnamon ginger and vitamin E hydrates
smooth and soothe pumps plump lips
instantly and painlessly the news is
called that topic if there's kind of
neutral share I think they had some
pinks and like a peach color too so I
thought well why not it was probably
like around four bucks for that and then
super cute they have do you guys know
about their color wheel color wheel
blushes they have this is one example of
one that I've gotten in the past you
know it gives you it's like that mosaic
sort of color to them I really like that
well now they're making the most
adorable little eyeshadows out of that
same concept they have in so many cute
colors they have some really cute
Purple's blues I think just a lot of
different a lot of variety right out
this one and it's called brown-eyed girl
and it got some pre Browns and kind of
like I don't know if you can see that
but in the bottom there right here it's
like a sparkly deep brownish red and I
love it I love that color I haven't
really been used it much yet but I've
just kind of touched it on my finger and
it's got a really nice texture to it and
I really like it I know I'm going to
like you so anyway that's what I've
gotten for now I will keep you posted on
how these things work out and give you
some reviews and tutorials a little
later all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
