video is going to be all about wet and
wild and the new stuff that's coming out
it's all set to officially launch in
January of 2014 but I know a lot of
people are seeing this stuff in their
drugstores already there's definitely a
lot of new additions to the line I mean
lip products nail polishes some new
eyeshadows so I just wanted to go
through everything for you this was all
sent to me by the company that's why I
have everything to show you in my
opinions are kind of all over the place
on this stuff so let's get started the
first new thing that I want to touch on
are these balm stains yes wet and wild
is now on the bandwagon the Jumbo lip
pencil this is a format of product that
I really do tend to like I like the
Jumbo pencils they twist up when you
need more they tend to give you a little
more precision than a lipstick might but
not quite as much as a lipliner the balm
stain concept which is not exclusive to
wet and wild Revlon's done this Jordana
has done this but the thought is that
it's going to give you a really
comfortable feel on the lips as the
product wears on it's going to actually
stain your lips so there are six shades
here and I actually got some specifics
on these products from wet and wild
which is nice to have some of the claims
of what this stuff is supposed to do it
says it contains
açaí palm oil says it forms a
protective shield on the lips prevents
feathering and has a unique minty
cooling sensation I don't find it to be
an especially strong minty scent or feel
but it is there and you notice it like
right after you apply the product to
your lip my issue with these is that I
feel like this line of products more
than any other balm stain that I've
tried and that includes revlon and the
Jordana ones I feel like what these
actually stain your lips is far
different from the actual color you
initially put on if it's art with the
deeper shades you will have a long
wearing color on your lips but it may be
quite a bit different from what you
thought you were getting I have not
noticed this feathering outside my lip
line I've eaten with these on and stuff
and I haven't had any issues with it
feeling like it's getting outside the
lip so the lightest shade here is called
nudist colony looks like a classic nude
it really
look kind of nude when you put it on
your lips but the what ends up hanging
around is a little bit of a pinky stain
on me and then the other one pinky
promise
this is the only one of the bunch that
actually shows up pretty frosty when you
apply it to the lips and I don't notice
much staying out of this one at all and
they've got Rico mauve or Rico mauve a
for those of you familiar with Rico
suave but it looks like this and it's
kind of like a deeper more muted pink is
what it looks like but it definitely
leaves behind a very pink stain a
brighter pink stain out of that one
shade a stiff pink love the name but it
looks like a really nice bright cool
pink
I feel like this stains even brighter
than it appears like a bright bright
magenta pink we've got a red here called
ready or not and looks like a pretty
classic red I notice a lot of that red
color when I first apply it and I don't
know if this is just me but the stain
that the sleeps behind is much more
berry than red and then the one I have
on is called lady in the vamp and this
looks like a nice deep berry and I just
reapply this before doing this video but
I've worn this a couple days ago and I
couldn't believe how bright my lips
looked by afternoon like I put this on
in the morning sat down edited for
several hours and then looked at my lips
and thought whoa is that that color
really look like a bright pinkish red
like probably the biggest deviation from
the original color of any of these was
on this one so frustrating kind of is
that they have a lot of aspects that I
do like I mean they don't feather
outside my lip line they go on very
smooth very rich and pigmented upon you
know your first application they have
just the slightest bit of shine that I
think is really pretty but it's just
frustrating when you put on a shade like
this mauve and it turns out to be a
brighter pink you put on this berry and
it ends up looking like a magenta
pinkish red also there's a new eight pan
palette and it is very colorful it's
called poster child it's got eight
shades in there as I said the one side
of it has a pink tone and the others are
like blues greens and yellows I was
reading over the claims of the product I
jotted down some notes and it says these
shadows contain macadamia oil seem to be
touting it like it's a new thing and
they say it will provide moisture and
improve skin's appearance when you use
these eyeshadows
touch and on my eyes I don't feel like
this is the same wet-and-wild formula
that many of us have come to know and
love in palettes like comfort zone or
those nice little trios a lot of these
shades have a different feel to them but
it's kind of inconsistent throughout the
whole palette as you look at the
swatches and you can see that these
pinky shades are kind of as we get into
the greens and the blues they're a
little bit stronger those two blue
shades really end up looking a lot of
life for all when I put these on the
eyes and I did a look with them last
week I just felt like I had a very
pastel look going on and to glance at
these colors with the exception of these
Pink's everything seems like it should
be pretty bright you know and some
shades are better than others I mean
there you've got some that really show
up almost like the same way the old wet
and wild palettes did but then others
are just kind of like what was that so
they all have sort of a satiny finish to
them so just a little bit of Sheen
nothing super shimmery or really
metallic in that bunch but yeah it's
called poster child and that is the one
new 8 pan palette and I'm not really a
fan there are five new color icon five
color palettes out and these have the
same kind of claims behind the eye
shadows talking about containing the
macadamia oil and what not thing I
really like about these palettes and
I'll use this brown one as an example
this is the one I'm wearing on my eyes
today by the way but can see that there
are a variety of finishes in this one
palette you've got a couple of matte
shades got a satin finish something with
a little bit of sparkle another shade
that's maybe a little bit frosty in
there but they're all like that they've
all got some variety thing that throws
me off a little bit is that the shades
up here these matte colors that are in
pretty much all of these five color
palettes are so nice they feel like a
really luxurious texture and then some
of the other shades just won't have that
feel to them so that's a little
disappointing I feel like you can still
get good looks out of these on your eyes
but I've got to compare them to you know
the other color icon palettes that are
out there like comfort zone etc etc
because I feel like those had such
consistent pigment
and I don't find that to be the case
with all of these some shades are better
than others you can still get good looks
out of them but I think you're going to
definitely notice a difference in the
texture of some of these shit's starting
with this brown palette I was really
satisfied actually with the look that I
got out of it
I think the matte shades in here are
really especially nice the base shade
the matte Brown that's called the finer
this crease shade is actually shows up
like kind of a soft bronzy color so I
used that to blend things out there just
above my crease the eyelid shade this
taupe I was kind of disappointed with
when i swatched it but I am wearing that
all over the lids and it actually went
on just fine over pride as far as a weak
shade and several of these palettes I
think it tends to be the brow bone color
seems to just be a more sheer formula
sometimes a little bit more flaky it's
not a bad neutral palette by any means
and this is probably one of my favorites
of the bunch I really wanted to wear it
today because I figured a lot of people
would be interested in this one so this
is definitely one of my top pick also
like the one in tunnel vision which
reminds me a lot of the trio and don't
steal my thunder but you're getting a
couple more shades thrown in there you
got a totally matte black a matte creamy
white shade as I said a really nice
texture on those matte shades labeled as
base I don't know what it is a little
bit of shimmer in that crease color
shimmery charcoal so pretty happy with
this one I mean if you've already got
don't steal my thunder this won't give
you a drastically different look but you
do have a completely matte black shade
in there which is pretty nice to work
with and this is kind of the exception
where the brow bone shades are concerned
this is a very nice silver palette that
I was wearing recently in my glitter
video was this one in floral values and
it's loaded with pink and purple overall
again good base shade I like these
couple of really colorful shades here
this one's not too bad either it shows
up a little more blueish than purple and
again the shade labeled brow bone not
quite as intense slightly flaky a little
bit drier feel to that color that I like
the least is a one called on his breezy
and it's the one in the blues it's got
light blue
Matt Navion they're a matte brighter
blue and then another brightest blue
down there labeled crease this one just
doesn't appeal to me as much because
it's a palette full of Blues I'm more
likely to go with something maybe that
gives a pop of blue here and there but
just to wear all out blue is sometimes a
bit much for me so I feel like these two
shades come off a lot alike if you like
color matte color um check out art in
the streets because these really I'm
pretty impressed by I feel like this
palette the swatches show up so true to
color like the shades you see here I
think in the swatches are they're pretty
darn close to this intensity level if
you're seeing both of these and maybe
you're going to pick one or the other
for something bright
I would really go toward this more than
this eight pan these are better textures
they're more full color than that orange
is just really intense the purple is
really good too and I know for some
reason and a lot of palettes purple
tends to be the weakest color you don't
necessarily wear all these shades
together in one look but you just want
to have a purple or have a real like
kelly green color that's in here too now
when wild already has a line of the
color icon singles and there are three
more shades just kind of some random
shades
there's Unchained which is a silver
there's a pink called cheeky and then a
really true royal blue called suede if
you've tried these let me know if you
agree but I think these have the very
same feel as the classic old color icon
eye shadows they're pretty pigmented
they're very soft they give off a lot of
nice color I'm happy with any of these I
mean it's just a matter of if you're
looking for a particular shade like one
of these now probably the thing I like
the least out of what I've tried and
it's these glitter singles as you can
see lots of different shades you need to
know is that to the touch when you first
touch one of these it's going to feel
like dry glitter but as you press your
finger down into it a little bit more
you can tell there's definitely a gel
type base in there and I actually really
dug into one of these like literally
took my little tweezers and ugh
and just to see what was under their
shell also mixed in with glitter so what
really got to me was when I was reading
the claims on these and it says
long-wearing
crease resistant these are by no means
crease resistant like I don't even have
very oily eyelids I applied a little bit
just a tiny bit of this gold one on top
of a look that I did a few days ago and
it creased like crazy all I was doing
was sitting in front of a computer
editing me and I go look in the mirror
to check it out I knew it felt very dewy
because these don't set to any sort of
dry finish they stay dewy and tacky and
I looked in my crease and I saw my eye
shadow you know kind of collecting there
there was still some glitter there but I
mean it just does not do good things for
my eye look when I wear this stuff so I
have done a video three wearable ways to
use glitter in your looks these are not
one of them I mean I just don't like
these at all I think if you've got a
costumey look that you want to accent
with one of these you know special
colors maybe there's a place for that
but if you really want something to wear
hardcore throughout the day this is not
going to do that for you the different
shades you have are bleached which is
kind of a white bowl kind of glitter and
there's a silver one a golden a one
called brass pink is called croupy other
ones are the red shade called vices the
purple in binge and the blue is called
distortion so just random new products
wet and wild now has a clear mascara you
could use this as a actual clear mascara
or as a brow gel which is probably the
way I'll use it most and they say it
contains soy protein and vitamin E and
they also suggest that you can use this
as a protective base coat on your lashes
I guess to protect it from I don't know
any drying effects that a mascara might
have on your lashes or to seal your
mascara and stop flakes I've tried it
both of those ways I don't really like
using it before a mascara because I feel
like this is so liquidy and kind of wet
it makes my lashes cling to
before the mascara ever gets in there
put it on top as a top coat I didn't
have any flaking when I did that so
maybe there is something to this it
might depend on what mascara you're
putting it on top of but by all means
it's definitely a good thing to use on
your brows you don't have to spend a lot
on a clear brow gel it's a couple of new
additions to the wild shine nail polish
line I haven't had a chance to try these
yet so this may be some review material
but there's a protective base coat and
then a matte top coat I'm so excited to
see how this works because I haven't yet
done anything really with matte nail
colors and lastly there is a full line
of new nail polishes called mega rocks
and these are all glittery polishes with
a very large large flakes of glitter
inside a lot of pretty colors I mean
just as you look at it I'm like oh wow
that's pretty so I took this pink one
and the shade is called creative control
and it is flaking off a little bit
because I had to remove the seals off
all these products isn't that the thing
I always get your nails when you got to
get some kind of sticker off of
something and then it takes the tip of
your nail polish off but anyways I did a
pink on most of my nails and then I did
a little silver accent now on top of all
of them I did one coat of the big pink
glitter it's like you got just a few
flecks of glitter on the brush and you
sort of want to disperse it out across
your nail but as you swipe the brush it
tends to pull the glitter toward your
tip so you got to mess with it a little
bit I guess is what I'm trying to say to
get an even doubt look of the glitter on
your nails I definitely wanted to do a
polish underneath the glitter because I
knew it would take me ages to build up
an opaque coat of this stuff so I think
of it as sort of an accent thing you
know if you like glitter on your nail
polishes you know if this might be
something you want to check out some of
these also have smaller flex as well
example this lilac shade and not only
does it have really large pieces of
glitter but it's got smaller bits which
I could say I've tried each and every
one of these but I've really only tried
that pink one that I've shown you
actually don't have a price on those
yet so if I get some of that info I'll
add it in or put it in the info box
below so that's all the new wet-and-wild
stuff that I have to tell you about
right now I hope this review was helpful
for you as you can see a lot of hit and
miss stuff going on with this collection
thank you so much guys I hope you're
having a great day and I will see you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
