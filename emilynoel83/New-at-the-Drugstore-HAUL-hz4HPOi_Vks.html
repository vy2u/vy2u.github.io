obsessed like I am you've been noticing
as you prowl around the drugstore that
there are a lot of new products lately
and I just thought i would compile some
of the new things that I've been getting
and put them into a new at the drugstore
haul and a couple of things I want to
mention right off the bat I have
reviewed very recently on my beauty
broadcast Express channel that's quick
reviews five days a week so brief less
than five minute types nonetheless these
are new things and I just wanted to give
them a mention here these are the new
revlon shadow links basically these are
individual I shadows they sell for like
2 99 apiece you can pick whatever one
you want and then you can connect them
up and make your own little like quads
trios duo's whatever you want to do with
those not a big fan of these I'm not
going to go in depth because I do have a
full review with the swatches and the
whole nine yards but I have seen these
at walgreens if you're interested in
other thing that's very new that I have
a review on our Maybelline Color elixirs
these are a lip color that basically
applies like a gloss it's got a little
like pointed applicator there I find
these to be very thick on the lips these
work in not a real favorite product of
mine but you can get more of a
description in my review video the
shades I have our Rose redefined dashing
orchid and amethyst potion so a real
classic pink shimmery purple a shade and
then a really deep plum now on to some
brand new things that I've not yet done
any reviews on and this is the Revlon
perfumery scented nail polish and this
is in the shade Bordeaux and I am
wearing that on my nails right now it's
a creamy just wine colored nail polish
and when I first put this on like you
don't just open it up and smell it it's
still got a strong nail polish sent
right out of the bottle of course after
I applied it and I was like asking Tyler
do you smell anything I don't notice
kind of a faint smell like right after
the Polish started to dry on my nail
know that it was a real wine wine type
scent but it had kind of a deep little
bit fruity um
yeah I can't smell it at all and I did
not put any top coat on it because I
really wanted to see what would happen
and I mean by nails really don't have
any sent to them whatsoever I do really
like the color this is two coats that I
did here I would be curious to see what
some of the other scents actually smell
like or how accurate they are or how
bold they always one of nothing else I'm
happy with the color I'll probably do a
full review once I can figure out like
how long this lasts on my nails without
chipping so far so good it's been like a
day and a half something new that i saw
in walgreens is this Fergie limited
edition little package here from wet and
wild and it says limited edition to
reflect shimmer palette bonus kabuki
brush this was eight bucks a little
palette and the Kabuki brush um not
really wowed by this at all I actually
think eight bucks is a bit much for this
product and this kabuki brush it's may
be okay for like a body type application
for the face I mean it's not real soft
and it's definitely like just slightly
tapered here but then all the bristles
are very blunt around the side I don't
think it's really the greatest for doing
a ton of blending the bristles are kind
of just course it's it's basically a
cheap kabuki brush in my mind and then
this is kind of setup shimmer brick
style I believe this is the same size as
the like other Furby highlights that
came out you best your brush over all of
this you end up with something that's
basically just a golden highlight I mean
nothing too special maybe even a little
bit copper eat look in a very light
dusting of that on my cheeks I mean it's
pretty but I don't think it's really
outstanding some of these shades
individually could be used as eyeshadows
I mean the pigmentation isn't that bad
it's just that they all kind of look
really similar when you swatch him out
at walgreens they've got some new
holiday elf stuff which I blogged about
it one of the things was like a smallish
palette with those geometric shapes in
there and then another one was one of
their beauty books so I reviewed those
on my blog if you want more info you can
check that there later on after visiting
target I realize they've got a whole
display of even more elf holiday stuff
too and this little guy was one of the
things that I saw there i'm going to
swatch out some of these shades for you
just randomly
so you can get an idea of what they're
like because the quality is not that bad
overall but my only objection with like
this geometric style here is some of
these are in really small spaces you
know like they're hard to even get your
finger in there and swatch and they're
even a little small if you were to stick
a blending brush in there to you know
yeah I'm noticing some of these shades
are a little hit and miss and flaky but
there's just a little random sampling of
some of them you can see some of the
deeper colors are really not too bad and
of course I have no primer on my hand
either and I'm wearing some of the
lighter shades just for a really light
kind of wash of color on my lid decent
color variety i just kind of wish they'd
just put a big squares you know or maybe
took some of these and made him a little
bit bigger so the shadows were easier to
get to i don't know if i said but that
is the 32 piece eyeshadow palette and i
believe that was like six bucks ulta i
noticed a new little revlon display i
think they had maybe some new photo
ready eyeshadow palettes and they had a
couple new lip butters one was blue I
believe and this one was purple it's
called provocative they look like this
there in like some frosty silvery
packaging and then you have this I
should have known better this is just
clear yeah there's nothing I mean I put
it right there I don't know if you can
tell it's just a shiny like lip smacker
type balm it doesn't have much of a
smell to it that I can even pick up on
it just gives your lips a little bit of
shine but I I don't notice any color
coming off on my lips with this thanks
Revlon how about some new lip butters
with like some really intense fun colors
or something I don't know revlon did put
out these which I've now seen at
Walgreens and Walmart and both
selections were becoming very picked
over by the time I got to them but these
are the colorburst matte bombs and these
are the lacquer balm so these are the
same exact format as the just bitten
kissable balm stains only you've got two
distinctly different finishes got these
mats which are really full color and
creamy and then these shiny ones as well
so I'm going to go ahead and swatch out
what I have so you can tell a pretty
distinct difference here between the
maths and the
hackers but the shades i have here that
light pink is called elusive then this
kind of deep rosy color is sultry and
the red is stand out and that is the one
that I'm wearing on my lips right now
that matte red as for the shiny ones the
shiny red is called enticing and this
sort of shiny purpley pink is whimsical
you can bet I'm going to be doing a
review on these once I get a chance to
try them more I'm really impressed so
far with the way these matte ones feel
on my lips I haven't worn the lacquers
yet but these remind me a lot of like
the l'oreal limit which i was very
impressed with to just super full color
and decent staying power i was wearing
actually the light pink one the other
day and I was very impressed with how
like I could put it on and I could eat
something or drink something but a lot
of color remained on my lips throughout
the day it doesn't feel dry doesn't feel
uncomfortable so definitely look for
more on the Express channel on these
they also got a couple more of the NYX
butter lip balms I have done a review on
these these are so cool like them
because they give you that tinted lip
balm feel but they're not like greasy or
really slick they're a little bit thick
and moisturizing not at all
uncomfortable and there's not a ton of
shine which I find is interesting most
of the tinted lip balm things you know
they give off a lot of shine and these
give more of an interesting like a
little bit Matt look on the low new
shades that I picked up our panna cotta
which is this kind of medium pink tone
right there and then I got red velvet
which is this very pretty red you
guessed it looks like such a pretty
cherry red on your lips and like I said
not a lot of shine it's a different kind
of tinted lip balm product but I really
like these butter lip balms found those
at Ulta also there are some new color
tattoos from Maybelline I believe
they're limited edition but they are
Matt and the one that I found they were
really picked over and when I got to
them at Ulta but it's the color tattoo
and nude pink and so it's just a creamy
shade with notion realize it doesn't
look super exciting but I have been
using this lately as kind of a base for
my eye looks like i used it underneath
this i look today saying
great creaminess and staying power of
the color tattoos that you would expect
really think a shade like this totally
belongs in their regular line trying to
build up the swatch just a bit so you
can see better what it's like and see
how it's like just a little deeper than
my skin tone but works very nicely as a
neutral base couple things from Nixon
I'm not sure how new these are they may
not be new at all but they're due to be
and I got the knicks mineral matte
finishing powder it says set it and
don't fret it and I got this in
light/medium looking for something
that's really really light and doesn't
change the finish of your foundation too
much but helps a little bit in
controlling oil this is nice it is a
silica-based powder and that does help
in filling fine lines and pores and that
kind of thing and it just got the
traditional sifter there there's a lot
of projects coming out but not a
coverage product but just something
light to set with if you don't want a
real heavy powder this isn't a full-out
review on it but just something i've
been using here and there a few times
and I like the finish it gives dewy
finish long-lasting setting spray I use
this in my full coverage radiant
foundation routine I love this stuff
really love just adding this as the
cherry on top on my fuller coverage
foundation look because i love how long
wearing the estee lauder double wear and
Revlon Colorstay and the cover girls
stay fabulous foundations are you great
coverage great staying power this
becomes like the perfect finishing touch
on top of those I just do one or two
spritzes of this it's perfect it just
gives the skin a really nice radiant
finish when you're done with everything
and it's not Dewey sticky tacky or
anything like that it's super
lightweight something I love about this
also is the how fine the mist is you
know you if you're going to be using a
setting spray spring something on top of
your finished makeup look I think it
needs to be just the perfect fine mist
and this is great for that but there's
just a little heads up on some new
things you might be running into in the
drugstore for the things that I have
reviewed I'll have those links below
otherwise reviews are probably coming
soon if I haven't done one yet so thank
you so much for watching I'll see you
guys soon I've</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
