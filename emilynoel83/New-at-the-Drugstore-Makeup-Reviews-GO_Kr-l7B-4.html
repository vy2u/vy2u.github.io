certain new drugstore products lately
like the clump crusher mascara and the
ultimate suede lips - I thought it might
be good to do one of those what's new at
the drugstore video so you might know
like what to go for and what to maybe
steer clear of or just my thoughts on it
anyway because those displays those
special little setups showing you what's
new can be so tempting sometimes and
sometimes just the fact that it's there
and it's new it like makes you want to
try it but there are some of these
things that I'm not so much a fan of so
I'm excited to share that information
with you and I am going to start off
with the clump crusher mascara by
covergirl this is one of the lash blast
kinds of mascaras so it's got that
rubber brush but you'll notice it's not
near as big as the brush is that comes
with regular lash blast one also has
just a really subtle curve to it feel
like it can get in there to your smaller
lashes the bristles on this are
relatively short close together and
there's a lot of them as far as the
formula it's a little different from
regular lash flats because I feel like
it's just a little bit drier I don't
feel like regular lash blast it's really
wet mascara to begin with I mean it's
not even close to being as wet as
something like a Maybelline great lash
mascara but this maybe even a little bit
drier and I love that kind of mascara
for my lash I don't have the greatest
thick as longest lashes ever and I feel
like drier formula mascaras are a little
bit more buildable and with a couple of
coats I feel like you really can build
up your lashes without them getting
clumpy I could use a little more maybe
in the length department a little more
volume it doesn't maybe go quite as far
for me it's like the owl may get up and
grow but I love how smudge free this is
for me I don't notice any flaking on my
face throughout the day this is the
totally the end of my work day here as I
sit here in front of you and I've got it
on and I really like it with some
mascaras the more you kind of mess with
it and go through your lashes the more
they just kind of stick together and you
look like you got about four or five
lashes with this it's like you can
continue going through it
and you can actually get more separation
and more definition but I've noticed
this can give you clumps if you wait too
long between codes let's say you do want
two coats on your lashes I recommend
putting on your first coat then
immediately going back in getting more
on your brush and going right back to
that eye because if you let it dry too
much in between that's where your clumps
come about but I mean you can definitely
build it up as it is still somewhat
moist on your lashes and get a really
nice effect it has these 32 color
palettes and they have them in warm and
cool and I've had the warm for quite a
while I had been targeted it might have
been online but I knew I wanted the warm
and then I didn't really look too much
at the cool I got to looking at the
variety of finishes and colors and
noticing that it wasn't just like one of
those typical palettes with like the
full rainbow effect but that they
actually threw in just some nice
interesting colors and still gave you
some neutrals as well so you've got like
neutrals across the top fun colors in
like your middle two rows and then some
deeper smoky colors in the bottom I'm
wearing it today I'm actually wearing
let's see gosh I'm kind of a mixture
here like these two this lilac and the
blue I just watched randomly a few of
the shades right here and you can see
some are matte summer shimmery some have
more of a metallic finish but it's a
nice variety and if you were looking for
something to give to somebody is like
that nice little $5 stocking stuffer
type item
these are nice little palettes to have
and play with and just see you know do I
want to try experimenting with a blue
eye or green or fuchsia or something
this is a really inexpensive way to try
it out and most of the shadows are
pretty good quality you just say you
know those pallets and even some others
and some larger ones are out there in
Walgreens and then another shadow thing
that's new is the Revlon Photoready
eyeshadow and this is sort of a kit here
of five different eyeshadows kind of
configured in the shape of an eye that's
primer plus shadow now don't get me
wrong all of these are a shadow a powder
consistency but I guess they're calling
this one right down here
all membered and this one is allegedly
the primer of this color right texture
of these colors seems to vary with each
different shade like I actually really
love the creaminess still powder but you
know what I mean it's like a really rich
texture on this one that claims to be
primer plus shadow but some of these
others like this accent color this gold
here I thought it looked gorgeous in the
packaging but that is is very very flaky
gone ahead and swatched all the shades
here I feel like the dark brown was a
really nice texture that first one that
I mentioned was nice
the other three seemed to be really
pretty flaky if you can get like a nice
concentrated swatch like I got you can
get full color but when applied with a
brush like on the eye they don't really
look that amazing a price on this that I
paid was right around $10 and for only
having a couple of shades that I really
enjoy I didn't find it to be all that
worthwhile so want to talk about these
ultimate suede lipsticks which I was
really excited about when I first saw
them when I saw the shade selection I
thought okay these look like nice colors
I got my first one I put it on I thought
oh it feels so good and then like ten
minutes passed and I thought wow my lips
feel really dry uh-huh these don't go on
looking like a lip butter they don't
have that instantly glossy appearance I
don't think they're supposed to do like
with the lip butters with the kissable
balm stain they feel hydrating they're
comfortable to wear with these you feel
like they glide on pretty easy as soon
as you put it on but within just like a
short window of time they do feel pretty
dry so I'm not a big fan of these not
planning to really purchase anymore I do
have a shade called socialite see pretty
color pretty kind of peach tone but you
can see what the finish is it's got like
a little bit of almost a frosty
appearance it even starts to not only
feel dry on the lips but it looks a
little dry on the lips after just a
short time I got this pink shade as well
this is called silhouette and so that's
just kind of a light baby pink and then
I also got the nude color which is
called private viewing and again I
really like the colors but they're
definitely things you could come up with
in the lip butters
like that's maybe a creme brulee and
there are different ones that you could
find to sort of mimic those colors way I
plan to make these work is to wear a
gloss on top because then the feeling of
that lipstick seems to go away a little
bit like if you like the color which I
do like these colors I'll put a clear
gloss on top and it'll make them more
comfortable on the lips I know I talked
about these in my last video but in case
you missed that wet-and-wild does have
new eight color palettes out in CVS a
lot of people said they've seen them in
Walgreens - one is just like I heart
matte all matte shades one smoky and
purpley tones and one is one that I've
been using so much it's called sparkle
till morning and it's got great neutral
shades don't be surprised if you see a
tutorial using these coming up soon but
I just want to let you know those are
out there five bucks the collection is
called where's the party I love those
shadows so much so definitely check out
my video on those with swatches and more
info if you haven't already so I'm about
to ran out of space on my memory card so
thank you so much for watching guys have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
