going to get both sides of Valentine's
Day look so I'm going to show you how to
get the nice land a naughty look see how
to do it all in one to two start with
the nice look and then if you want to
use that for daytime and then vamp it up
at night for the naughty look you can
totally do that with all the same
palette now the nice look is just really
innocent and flirty I mean it's not
totally a natural look but it does do a
little bit lighter look on the eyes we
work in sort of a warmish red shade and
a little bit of winged outliner we keep
the lips nice and natural and just make
it a really approachable pretty look if
you were looking for a hair look for the
nice look you know maybe pull part of it
up and do the rest kind of down in curls
the naughty look is much more dramatic
it definitely plays off of darker shadow
colors and there's a lot more activity
going on on the lower lash line we've
got a couple different liner techniques
there we're still using the warm
burgundy shade and the palette to make
it as court of a unique look not the
type of look you'd use everyday but it's
a definite contrast from the night so
off both looks just using the cover girl
drama eyes eyeshadow palette in a couple
of different ways so to see how to pull
it off keep on watching
step one you're going to prime your lid
with Too Faced shadow insurance I primer
so once you've blended that from your
lid all the way up to under your eyebrow
you're just going to grab your cover
girl drama eyes palette or some similar
colors in this palette we're talking
about like a deep burgundy shade a
silver a black and a matte white color
so we're going to start out just by
using the sponge tip applicator and go
to the silver shade and just load some
of that up on there and go from the
inner corner and just kind of Pat that
all over the lid just to the outer
corner as well next we're going to use
the white shade which is kind of a matte
color and we're just going to use a
small mini brush here that i got from
Coastal Scents but you could also use
like a q-tip here or just whatever
smallish brush you like and you can see
I'm taking that really light color right
around the tear duct and just under on
the inner part of the lower lash line
we're also going to take that light
shade right up under the brow so just
use any fluffy brush you like to sort of
lay that color down right there in the
area under your eyebrow and the next
step is very easy as well take any
crease brush it doesn't have to be a
tiny crease brush I'm using my essence
of beauty sort of the medium size crease
fresh in the duo and we're going to go
to the pretty burgundy shade here and
we're not going to do a really dense
application of this but just get a
little of it on your brush and go to
your crease here and we're just going to
blend this out and make it just a pretty
wash of like a warm color in there so if
you usually do like Browns or Grey's in
your crease this is going to be a really
nice contrast and it's going to just
kind of warm up your whole eye area and
just blend that right there in your
natural crease so from the inner corner
to the outer corner just really buff it
out and to keep this the really sort of
sweet and natural look blending it's
going to be a big key so take your
fluffy brush and just really blend blend
blend over the outer edge
next for liner i'm using my la girl fine
line and this is just a liner pin that's
going to give us a really easy way to
get this little bit of a cat I'd look
here and that's a neat way you can take
even even if your shadow look it's kind
of subtle like this you can do sort of
that cat I'd liner to glam up the look a
little bit so I'm going to be going from
the very inner corner here so just get
your liner going right there just like
so and you're just going to continue
that on to the other end of your lashes
and once you get to the end then we're
going to do our little wing so go to the
very corner of your eye and sort of just
draw a little diagonal up like you're
pointing to the outer edge of your
eyebrow there if you were to continue
the line and then just connect it over
just like that and fill it in it's kind
of like outlining and then coloring in
and then you've got your nice little
winged outliner look next we're going to
curl our lashes so just grab your
favorite eyelash curler i'm using my ELF
of one dollar mechanical eyelash curler
which I love and hold it for about you
know 15 seconds or so whatever you need
to do to kind of get that curl going in
your lashes and then I'm going to be
using my L'Oreal double extend mascara
which is really good for length you put
on the D like a primer coat and then you
top it off with the black shade so I'll
do that and then I'll join you with the
finished look
alright guys here is the finished look
what I also did was I went underneath
the lower lash line and i used some
maybelline lash discovery just to make
those lashes fan out just a little bit
more but overall this is a really
natural look it just incorporates a
little bit of a warmer tone on your eyes
that you might not use everyday to make
it kind of fun and flirty for a
Valentine's Day look and on my lips I'm
wearing NARS lip gloss in Turkish
Delight it's a really light sheer pink
so I think it really keeps the look very
soft and on my cheeks just use any kind
of like soft pink blush you can lightly
maybe contour with a little bit of
bronzer but keep it really soft on the
cheeks as well use any a little bit of a
shimmery highlight on top of your
cheekbones and you will have the nice
look
so to get the naughty look we just start
with what we do with the nice slick
which was basically laying down our
liner we got on a light shade on our lid
and a little bit of a highlight going
but the first thing we want to do to
really set this look off and make it
more dramatic is to incorporate the
black shade in drama eyes so this is a
really pigmented shade and we are
definitely going to use it that way so
I'm going to take my cup my essence of
beauty fine crease brush get a little
bit of that black on there and just
start working this into your crease and
you're going to see an instant
difference in the two looks so basically
yeah I'm starting on my inner corner and
blending it out and up and i'm using the
corner of our winged liner to really
create a dramatic outer V here so that's
why it's helpful to kind of go ahead and
do that step first anyway so if you do
follow these tutorials you know start to
finish you'll you'll be in a pretty good
position to make it all come together so
I'm just kind of extending it out from
the outer corner that liner and up and
you can see we've instantly got this
nice you know more dramatic shadow look
here now we're going to go back to the
burgundy shade and kind of run that
along the border of this black we've
just put on here so take a fluffy brush
I'm using my Sephora rounded crease
brush and just run that right along the
borders going to warm it up and it's
just going to give it a different look
than your typical smokey eye and if you
get kind of close to your brow don't
worry about it because we are going to
kind of redo our highlight we're going
to intensify the light and the dark of
this look with your sponge tip
applicator just go into the white shade
in this palette right there it's a matte
white and we're going to go a little bit
more intense on that right here on the
inner part so just kind of make a little
streak of that there and blend it out a
little bit with your sponge tip now you
notice we're really getting a dark look
on this I and that's a lot from what's
going on on the lower lash line as well
if you wanted the in-between look if you
watch this and thought I don't know if I
want either of those maybe you could
stop here and just kind of amp up
shadow a little bit and leave the lower
lash line as is and you would get like
kind of a middle-of-the-road look but
we're going to go ahead and show you how
to do the lower lash line first where
I'm going to do is line the waterline
with a black liner i'm using my l may
eyeliner pencil in black and so just
kind of very gently tug down on your
lower lashline and get that right there
on the inner rim and once you've got
that liner there you're also going to go
on your natural lash line just on the
outer corner and kind of connect that
with the wing that you made earlier so
then we've kind of got a little bit more
depth to work with and really make sure
you're covering right where the lashes
you know come out you want it you want
it to all be dark you won't don't want
any sort of a light gap in between so
just on that outer part get it on on
your natural lash line as well and make
sure it's not on your eyelashes because
that can be a big cause of smudging that
some people don't realize when they're
really getting their liner in there and
then somehow they've coded their lashes
with it so anyway now we're going to go
to our shadow take the black in your
quad I'm taking an angle liner brush and
I'm just going to top off what I just
did there on the lower lash line I'm
going to carry that all the way in and
then we're going to smudge it out we're
going to get a little bit of a smudged
out less defined look so we're taking it
all the way in with our liner brush then
you can take any smallish brush and just
kind of you know run it over that powder
you just put on and it'll smudge it out
a little bit make it a little bit softer
another thing you'll want to do there
with the lower lash line is sort of
thicken up those lashes so go with
another coat of the Maybelline lash
discovery or your favorite mascara that
you feel like really doesn't smudge
there on your lower lash line and just
put a little more on and what that's
going to do is just kind of enhance the
smokey effect I feel like anytime I see
heavy lower mascara it makes me think of
still that morsel
you look it's a little undefined and
then we're going to do on the top lash
line since we've already got our coat of
mascara there we're a step ahead of the
game we're going to take some false
lashes and put them on there you don't
have to do this step but it does add a
lot of drama to the look i'm using my
ardell fashion lashes number 106 they're
kind of a semi dramatic kind of pc oops
mankind of a pc look there so i'm going
to put those on and i'll join you with
the finished look
so here's the finished look everyone I
just went ahead and put on those false
lashes you can tell they make a huge
difference in just drawing attention to
your eyes I also did a few little
changes with skin and lips lips are
obviously darker than they were in the
first part of the tutorial I sort of
blotted off the lighter shade that was
on there and I used my Jordana easy
liner in plush plum and I line the lips
and fill them in with that so that's
what's really giving it that nice deep
color and then i used the Loreal
infallible plumping lip glosses of
really gorgeous shade it's in plumped
mauve that's the color it's got a nice
little sparkle to it looks gorgeous over
that liner and I think it just really
playing up the eyes and the lips you
know it's definitely a dramatic way to
go about things I also went a little
heavier on the contouring for this look
and the highlighting as well so we're
creating a little more contrast with our
face all around it's a more dramatic
look so thank you so much for tuning in
to see this duel tutorial I hope you
like seeing both sides and let me know
if you'd like to see more of this in the
future and have a happy Valentine's Day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
