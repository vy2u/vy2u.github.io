declutter videos who's ready for it
first drawer I figured let's start with
the primers outside of skincare primer
would be the first thing I put on my
face so well that seems logically the
best place to begin and in my collection
my primers here share a drawer with
concealers oh isn't that going to be a
fun thing to declutter back to primers
this is our starting place this has
actually been decluttered one time
before very recently when I switch
things around in my storage and looking
at it again
I can see yes I've got more cuts to make
yell I haven't watched a lot of
declutter videos but I think I get the
idea that you're supposed to get rid of
stuff you're supposed to end with less
than what you started with I've got a
lot in here some new some older we're
just going to go through it talk about
them make some quick cuts or some keep
and then I figure we'll check back in
with the drawer and see how the keepers
fit in here it will also look at the
pile of rejects and as I keep doing
these it'll kind of take you through my
storage and how that's going how I've
reorganized some things and maybe said
if you think will change along the way
if we get rid of a significant amount of
makeup you know next one I might just go
ahead and do concealer my foundation is
off in this particular drawer right here
because this drawer has a lot of depth
and my foundations you see which one I'm
talking about here is this one right
here foundations can actually stand up
in that drawer so that's pretty much the
only face product that's living off in
its own area there everything else like
down below here I've got powders Rogers
blushes is kind of like a face makeup
station a little bit dramatic this
morning aren't we yes I'm using actually
experimenting with this new Smashbox
the create and transform palette so it's
got a lot going on in here I had a lot
of things that I needed to be tested
with that I do like the way the Iowa
came out it seems like definitely the
type of thing I could have done with
that naked heat talent as well kind of
plumb me but a little bit
Capri in there too anyway this video is
about primers and I've got a whole bunch
of primers sitting in front of me so
we're just going to go through these I'm
going to try to do this quickly just
give you like some reasons why I'm
either holding on to something or
letting it go I can tell you right now
things that I'm going to let go are
going to be things that are too old like
if I feel like it's been sitting around
in my collection entirely too long I'm
going to get rid of it if I know I just
haven't been reaching for it at all it's
going to go and if I feel like it's lost
any sort of relevance in my collection
where future reviews are concerned
that's the element of these de clutters
that may make it a little bit different
than the average they're you know the
average makeup using person out there
because in some cases I'm really
interested in keeping something so I can
use it in an upcoming video so I can
sort of keep it as a standard by which
to compare another product so certain
things I'm going to feel like I need to
keep here am I already trying to justify
keeping a lot of this stuff around first
things first I've got a couple of elf
primers here I got the elf hydrating
primer and the elf poreless primer I
happen to like both of these the
hydrating primer I kind of like this
even better than the smashbox hydrating
primer this has worked really well for
me it says fill in fine lines and
moisturizes with vitamins A C and E so I
am going to keep that around the
packaging is kind of bulky especially
for like laying in a drawer but I'll
keep it poreless face primer although it
smells kind of like I don't know lemons
and crayons mixed together it really is
a nice feeling primer it's very very
smoothing feels so good when I put it on
I don't have to keep that one as well
about all these from Smashbox I really
tend to like a lot of the Smashbox
primers and I'm probably going to be
keeping like all of these because
they're all fairly new I like using them
I'm not going to declutter just for the
sake of getting rid of something like I
love the pore minimizing as you can see
that one's a highly highly used one I
like their regular photo finish from
time to time this is the new radiance
version and that's
so I'm going to need to keep that and
keep using that a little bit they have
an SPS 20 primer which i think is a
brilliant idea because sometimes you
want to use a moisturizer that doesn't
contain the SPF and you can't always
count on a foundation to have SPF but
the primers got SPF can your girl make a
case for keeping primers around good
Lord at the color correcting blend hmmm
kind of want to keep that to this
physician's formula I can tell you right
now this is going to go I've already
reviewed this is cushion corrector and
primer duo with peach and lavender I
reach for this randomly not too long ago
it seemed way less juicy than it was at
the start and not to mention the fact
that this product just kind of makes me
roll my eyes it does nothing if you want
a peachy cushiony corrector check out
wet and wild because this stuff just
really didn't do anything for me it's
just cute you know it's adorable it
looks like the kind of quilt I might
want on my toddler's bed but beyond that
it's a no these guys from flower beauty
the erase everything I remember given
these products a really hard time in a
video because they are basically like
sheer almost colorless products on the
skin and they're called erase everything
like what they got this one called sheer
tint and it's absolutely nothing there
is no tint to it and then busting it has
a little bit of color these feel like
extraordinary they're really nice and
smoothing on the skin but I don't like
the delivery method I mean it comes out
through a little brush that you're never
going to actually use to blend anything
out and I don't know this stuff is kind
of rennet source in my collection by now
I've had it around long enough to know
that I'm not reaching for it so that's
going to go in the no pile the no pile
is much smaller than my keep pile
currently we got to turn this thing
around
okay got this Mally perfect prep
neutralizing primer this comes out as
kind of a skintone color
feels really good it honestly reminds me
of a primer mixed with a little bit of
foundation I kind of want to keep that
around this alum a smart shade CC's
luminous primer i remember really kind
of going on a mission to get this stuff
and the more kind of use
that I've been sort of underwhelmed like
it is a little bit glowy but it doesn't
do quite enough for my skin like if it's
going to be a glowy primer it's really
got to go there for me because you're
putting foundation on top right the
glowy primers got to be pronounced
enough to even be topped off with a
foundation and still do something am i
right so I'm going to have to let that
one go here's another reason for getting
rid of a product you just kind of look
at it and like glaze over and it doesn't
even excite you at all you're just kind
of like the jordana Prime no pores pore
refining face primer I'll tell you kind
of primer that doesn't excite me at all
one that comes out and it's like white
and it's not particularly smoothing it
just feels exactly like moisturizer yeah
this one no it's going to go maybelline
baby skin reminds me a lot of like the
original Smashbox photo-finish but I've
had this entirely too long I had a good
run with this you can see it's kind of
been squeezed in there it's gotten some
museum ok NYX Pro foundation mixer I'm
not sure how this snuck into my
collection our candy sheer envy lift and
firm primer Eustace recently to kind of
remind myself what I thought about it
didn't really notice any lifting and
firming if anything it just kind of I
thought made my foundation a little bit
on the greasy side I'm going to say
goodbye to that one you've had your
chance now we've got Lancome 'la based
pro little sample here it looks like
Smashbox photo-finish it feels a little
more slippery than that maybe I'm not I
have to let that one go I'm just not
interested Porefessional matte rescue I
don't know that I've ever reached for
this it's a big tube matte rescue is
you're no filter filter mattifying pore
blurring and visible finish kind of
makes me interested now that I read the
claims comes out looking kind of like a
gel in terms of the feel it feels like
one of those super dooper like have you
ever tried a really really lightweight
moisturizer is it mattifying No
I don't know what to do oh yeah I don't
know what to do this one's going to be
on the bubble at the end we're going to
make a determination judging by the
amount of stuff I'm keeping and the
amount of getting rid of that you also
decide here benefit Porefessional yes
definitely keeping this because I feel
like a lot of primers come through my
collection that I end up comparing to
this one so many things come out that
are similar to this texture or
consistency like different kinds of pore
filling primers so I am going to keep
that around la girl pro prep high
definition
smoothing face primer I haven't used
this one much but this one seems really
close to Smashbox photo-finish
maybe I could do a primer dupe video I
think I'm going to keep this one just
because this is kind of new to me and I
haven't used it quite enough yet man
this one's been used a lot makeup
forever the smoothing primer this one's
really good I remember it feeling like
even just a little more rich than the
professional but it's kind of similar
it's along those lines but I'm going to
let this one go I've had it for quite a
while got a mattifying primer from
makeup forever I'm not really like super
turned on by the idea of mattifying
primer so I'm gonna let that one go but
wait I'm considering keeping this
mattifying one it must just be because
there's a little detective on the
outside now that makeup for everyone has
been sitting around too long in my
collection and then there's a hydrating
one for makeup forever and a nourishing
one I believe the nourishing one
actually feels a little bit richer than
the hydrating yeah I remember really
liking that nourishing primer but like I
said I think it's just been around too
long in my collection and it's time has
come it has to go and then there's this
it cosmetics bye bye pores primer this
is oil-free poreless skin perfecting
serum primer don't mind me I'm just
gonna whoa that just shot out everywhere
I was who say I'm going to try this out
on my legs since I'm running out of arm
space here
it's very smoothing it's kind of silky
but it looks very matte my knee is super
matte right now I don't know it cause
headaches I love it cosmetic stuff I
think I'm going to put that in the maybe
category as well this Marc Jacobs
invisible undercover perfecting coconut
face primer is a definite key because
I've barely used it it's new and I want
to try it some more yes I'm keeping the
milk blur stick yes I'm keeping the milk
cooling water the many sizes there
because now I'm getting reminded of
something I wanted to do a comparison of
that the cooling water with the hard
candy coconut water sheer envy primer
stick and also the elf prep and hydrate
ball I thought that would be a good
three-way review but I kind of forgotten
about it
now I'm reminded of it too more primers
here and I kind of feel like there maybe
do type things for one another the Tarte
clean slate smoothing primer this one
really has I don't know a filling type
feel when you put it across your skin
it's very smooth I've used this quite a
bit it has like a thick feel right off
the bat but then you blended it across
your skin you're like yes it feels silky
and then Catrice I have the prime and
fine and that has a really similar like
maybe not quite a thick seal right at
the get-go but I think a similar effect
as it blends out across the skin so a
down-low headcount
I've looked here what I'm getting rid of
so far I've just got 12 that I'm getting
rid of which seems like a lot like I'm
proud of myself for that
but looking at the ones that are kind of
in question this matte rescue I think
I'm actually going to let that one go I
just don't really see myself using it
I'm not excited about it it's at around
this long I haven't reached for it so
that's going to go I think I am going to
keep this it cosmetics bye bye pores
primer it looks like I've used it like
more than you would think I barely used
that thing so I want to use that some
more and reevaluating what's in the keep
pile I think I'm going to let the Mallee
perfect prep neutralizing primer go
because on second thought I've had that
one for a long time I said this was no
mercy right I'm still looking at my keep
pile and I'm thinking what can I still
get rid of this elf poreless face primer
and I kind of feel like this has run its
course you know I've tried it
I know what I think about it it's hard
to tell with these products but I feel
like it's almost gone so I think I'm
going to go ahead and move this out and
let myself focus more on the ones that I
really want to be using all right
everybody here's a look at the pile
that's going bye-bye there are 15
primers in this chunk and then here's a
look at the keep pile just this stuff
right here that's going to be 16 primers
staying in my collection although am I
being a little generous with even
calling some of these cooling Stix
primers I mean just storage wise that's
the zone of my collection they're living
in but yeah I kind of wish I got rid of
more than I kept but it's a very close
line and it's really almost half and
half which makes me kind of proud right
but I very much feel that this was a no
mercy process for me because I got rid
of some stuff right off the bat and then
I looked at the keep pile again I got
rid of more so yeah I think I think it
was a good experience okay guys here's
what it looks like in my drawer now I
can see everything we're like at one
layer of primers in this basket so - - I
got the Smashbox ones all the to be kind
of primers they're the two in the pots
and here are the sticks and check this
out that can move all the way back there
like I said in my room tour video I mean
we could play twister here we could have
a dinner here we could like sit our
coffee mug right there I don't know I
just what am I going to do with this
space but for now I think I'll leave
that here because when I pull out the
drawer you know I'm not always looking
to reach back in this was satisfying
guys was it satisfying for you because I
feel good about this I feel I have a
very manageable selection of primers yet
I was reminded of a couple video ideas I
got some time holding on to for
comparison's sake and I think this is
going to be a good thing this on the
other hand well I can already tell you a
concealer declutter is going to hurt I
might have to bring in backup for that
video like my mom or Tyler could come in
just they encouraged me throughout the
process like helped me through it that's
what I might need anyway thank you guys
for watching my first ever
de-clutter video I hope it was good and
I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
