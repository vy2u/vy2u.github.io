me today this is gonna be kind of a
casual like you know sip some coffee
just sit back and chill kind of video
but it's something I just felt so
compelled to do and I feel like I might
get emotional in this video like I'm
just kind of feeling the vibe but what I
want to talk about here are what I would
call oh gee youtubers okay that's like
the best way to describe it that's what
I will say and I think you it will dawn
on you what I'm talking about people who
really I don't know laid the foundation
for the beauty community that we have
today here on YouTube people who were
making videos consistently like years
ago everyone on this list started their
channel at 2010 but most of them before
2010 so that's what I mean that's kind
of the benchmark I set for the list that
I was coming up with and a lot of these
people are people who I watch a lot some
of them are people who I would like to
see even more from and some are just
like newly rediscovered but at some
point in my journey on YouTube they were
an inspiration to me and something I
love about this list is there are there
are no repeats here by that I mean every
single person I mentioned is a complete
individual nobody is alike here I don't
feel and that was a really precious
thing about early YouTube if you're not
familiar with it I just felt like there
were so many people hopping on because
it was a fun hobby nobody really knew a
living could be made out of this and
that is throwing no shade at anyone who
has gotten on here because they thought
it could potentially do something good
for their life in that manner no
problems but these people happened onto
this platform when YouTube was really
centered on just helping people like
people helping on with a good tip that
they wanted to share with a little
community of people they built and I
mean I am one who you know I did my
first YouTube video in late 2007 and
it's hard to maintain longevity here
viewers from a viewership perspective
it's easy to just like glance at numbers
and be like well why aren't you at a
million yet because it's like a million
has become a new sort of benchmark I
feel like on YouTube like one
not multiple millions of subscribers
what I want to say every time I get
asked that is what about a hundred
thousand because I remember and many of
the people either on this list or people
who really got into watching YouTube
like back in that day are probably
saying they're nodding their heads
because like I remember when a hundred
thousand was a unheard of number on this
you know and like people who were
hitting that I was like what if I one
day could ever hit a hundred thousand
and I I don't ever want to lose that
person inside of me who feels that way
who feels the massive nature of that
number and also the gratitude and the
appreciation for the fact that I did
ever reach that milestone here so just
to remember that if you're a viewer
you're on the outside looking in and
you're wondering mobile where wise
hasn't this person got here everybody's
on a different journey you know but I
come from a place I'm sure many of these
people do as well when a hundred
thousand was like and I know goals
change and as we go along we set our
sights on different things but for a
time like that was major and I don't
know where I'm really talking about this
I guess I'm just trying to set the stage
up for you that YouTube in a time when a
lot of these people were getting started
out as well as myself like it was a
different landscape than their people
who I would like to be neighbors with
there many of them I've met and the ones
who I haven't met I'd love to me if you
are currently watching them will be like
high-five and in the comments section
like yes if you haven't watched him in a
while
go check them out like make sure you're
still subscribed because I know YouTube
does crazy things like unsubscribing you
from channels that you genuinely watch
and weird stuff like that give them some
love and support on their channel
because it's hard again to have
longevity and to have started way back
when and you know it's been a long time
since any of us were new kids on the
block and keep churning out content over
you know seven eight nine ten years like
it's a long time so anyway I'm going to
jump in now two names that I want to
mention first who like have not posted
on their channel in at least several
years but I want to mention them because
they were huge and inspiring me to start
a channel I'm talking about encore and
I'm talking about purse buzz those two
channels were two that I watched a lot
and who made me feel like I could made
do this so thank you to them I would
love to see them back on here like doing
some videos every sell-off and just like
a little life update I don't know but
thank you so much to them and now people
who are currently just making videos
um Julie g71 3 she is where my makeup
education really came from most of it I
feel outside of on cord purse buzz like
I remember so early on in my channel
watching and being inspired by Julie
Gees like flawless eye tutorials and
just the way she did it and like got in
close and you can see on the eye what
was really happening and she would use
like fun colors and she seemed just like
sort of this application wizard and
nowadays I think you know while she's
doing her YouTube channel she's got her
nail polish she's got a vlog channel as
well and I think she's doing
professional makeup work on top of it
but if you check out her channel you're
gonna see you know I'm just glancing
down at it some tutorials some really
fun bright stuff she had her colorblind
mom doing her makeup with her last video
she has like the sweetest personality
when I met her in person at an IMATS in
New York years ago I was just completely
taken aback like I couldn't believe that
this person who I had watched and
learned so much from I was actually
getting to see in the flesh you know but
she is kindness she is intelligence
she is creativity just all of that
rolled into a cute little ball so Thank
You Julie cheek like and when I say
thank you I mean like I should be have
way more to say than thank you she is
just so inspiring to me eleventhgorgeous
let's talk about these ladies for a
moment I had the pleasure of meeting
then at that IMATS is well actually
going to dinner with them and a few
other ladies and I remembered meeting
them in person and coming away thinking
I wish they'd like lived in my town I
felt that way a lot of times about
different youtubers that I've met out in
the world I'm like why can't they just
be my neighbor but I mean they're so
sweet and just have this exuberance
about them that you do see in the video
because they have this you know kind of
natural chemistry doing videos as a duo
if they are doing a really wide range of
things on their channel they're doing
Ulta hauls their talk about Amazon
they're talking about t.j.maxx they
had Instagram followers control their
life for a day that's a really fun video
idea they have even talked about can
Shane Dawson help our channel and I
think that if you want a taste of you
know the YouTube struggles sometimes for
people who have been on YouTube for a
long time you know you'll watch that
video and you'll feel their
vulnerability and the situation that I
think a lot of people are going through
wondering like how do i how do I get
this master dunk I'm getting views on
this thing that I try to do it again and
maybe it doesn't go over so well what am
I doing wrong are people even actually
getting my videos and their feed like
there's there's just so many questions
and I did feel like I could relate to a
lot of what they were saying there but I
want to support them and I want to say
hey I love you guys and you're great and
I hope they keep doing what they're
doing and sometimes when it comes to
like channel inspiration or what should
I be doing like it takes a little time
stepping away from the noise by noise I
mean kind of like you know
the social media realm and just thinking
like what comes to mind what's making me
happy what will I put out that's like
easy to put my heart and soul into you
know to talk about but I think they're
great they're oh geez and I love them
here's another makeup by Tiffany D why
is it that we all I think remember a
setting so much like when we started
watching someone so many people be like
I watched you and then it'll be followed
by in the apartment or back when you're
in your other pink room or something
like that and I remember watching
Tiffany when she was in a closet and
still watching her to this day and
something I admire so much about her is
the fact that I feel like she has
remained so unchanged by YouTube like
she has gotten on here time after time
you know she'll talk about products she
loves she'll do tutorials
she will integrate fashion and home and
all kinds of things in her channel but I
feel like her preferences are not really
swayed by necessarily what's super
trendy or by what she thinks she should
be talking about according to what maybe
a bunch of other youtubers are talking
about I feel like she thinks with her
own freaking head and unapologetically
so I like that she'll talk about luxury
products she'll mention I mean I have
tried things that tiffany has
recommended and they have become like
life savers that dove dry spray you know
deodorant stuff that was her the tip of
like dampening a beauty
blender and using it to like touch up
and bounce it in around your already
applied concealer and softening it up
and making it look all fresh again like
that was her I think she's a lovely
honest real person but on top of it all
she has provided actual game-changing
advice to me in the beauty realm I
remember when I met her I was at an
IMATS in LA at the time I had just
learned I was pregnant with Belle
I remember going up to our big guy too
nervous like hi my name is Emily but
yeah I have massive respect for Tiffany
and I just I loved her attitude let's
talk about makeup geek Marlena I mean
here's a youtuber who started out as a
youtuber she's built a brand she's taken
that brand now into Target stores
there's an ongoing theme here on this
list and it's people who seem genuinely
kind and that's that's where this is
coming from some of the things she's
done lately I mean she will talk about
new launches that are coming to makeup
geek she did a non Instagram makeup
tutorial which is kind of fun I love her
current obsessions videos she did
cooking with my mom I feel like she is
joyful inspiring creative and maybe
there are people now at this point who
like know a lot about makeup geek
cosmetics but maybe you don't know as
much about the person behind it I think
you need to definitely be subscribed to
your channel and see what she's doing
there okay Kristin game near and dear to
my heart heart of gold on this human
being just wonderful person I can
confirm because I've met her I sincerely
love Kristin and I love that when she
talks about makeup I feel like she comes
at it with the one-two punch of I know a
lot about high-end and I know a lot
about drugstore so boom like it's
everything you need she's from Wisconsin
if I have any Wisconsin viewers who
haven't found her I think you will
relate to her on another level the
feelings that I get when I watch her
would be comfort warmth cheeriness
positivity
you know sometimes you'll you'll run
across a person you'll wonder like are
you genuinely into what you're talking
about
you won't wonder that like her
discussing makeup seems so natural and
if her and I are put into the same room
discussing makeup like we may never go
to bed she's knowledgeable she's fun
she's funny and I
have just nothing but love for her so
check out christen game check out Lola
Marie seven here's one on my list that
like I know she's busy I love it if she
posts more fitness because she her
personality is to die for she is
hilarious my initial connection to her
she's actually from very close to my
hometown like back in the west central
Illinois area and when I started
watching her I mean I just felt this
immediate connection to her she runs a
salon she's just had a little baby
actually and she has two kids who are a
little older she genuinely cracks me up
when I'm watching her videos like just I
love the casual nature to them whenever
I watch her I feel like here's old
YouTube again okay I can relax gorgeous
everybody I'm talking about is stunning
but like I love to hear what kind of
products she's using I loved her
pregnancy updates when she was doing
that more recently I would watch all her
like stitch fix updates I mean like when
she's got a video on my feet I am
watching I don't care what she does just
talk on the road while you're in your
car like she's so funny nur nur BER X Oh
whose channel is now neurology nor has
done some deep stuff lately nur has I
mean I'll let her tell the story from
her video but she has been in a very
dark place and has come out on the other
side and her video to watch on that
topic you'll know what I'm talking about
when you see it is fascinating it's on
her neurology Channel I'll link to
everything below by the way everybody be
linked she is gorgeous she is smart she
is a masterful communicator like
absolutely just I mean I could take
lessons she's fantastic
it's a different kind of content like I
mean I would love her to hop on like
share some Beauty favorites sure I'm
always interested in that but I mean
she's doing some very important content
on her channel right now so I would say
go find her and take a minute to watch
that Erica Jones Erica Jones has had her
channel for quite some time and I'm
loving her vlogs that she's posting and
she will sprinkle in some beauty like
favorites here and there basically I
want to know everyone's beauty favorites
I don't care what the heck it is that
you do have youtube I want a beauty
favorites video every
often just so I know I'm also a person
who wants to like just peek into
people's purses on the street what are
you wearing I love how every person I
mentioning on this list is completely
different from the next and Erica is my
southern belle of my youtube life here
she's from Kentucky she I mean she talks
like it I love some of the references
like she makes like little phrases that
she says like kill me I love her laughs
she is 100% joy I got to meet her at my
Macy's meetup last year and it was like
I cried like it just cried I couldn't
believe she was there I feel like
everybody I'm talking about here it's
not just that they make good videos but
there's some x-factor coming off of all
of them that I aspire to like take a
little bit and in like can I put a
little bit in her level of joy her level
of kindness and just sweetness that that
comes out of her you will see it when
you watch her videos and then she's got
that southern accent that just like
icing on the cake I love it miss Krystal
makeup I've been watching her for the
longest time I'm finding something I
love so much that she does are like the
grocery hauls or she'll talk about what
she's eaten in a week like weeks worth
of meals food type stuff from her I
don't know it just really resonates with
me but she's super down-to-earth so
sweet I feel like a lot of things that
she's talked about I like like some
recommendations I'll take from her and I
figure out that I like them but
sometimes I'll just start watching her
and I'll realize oh we were on the same
page about this and this and this I mean
this in the most wonderful way possible
she seems like just a normal friend you
know like a normal person and the world
not like while youtuber down-to-earth
wonderfulness I really appreciate that
she's on here this next one was the
absolute sign that I felt like I got
that I needed to do this video now
panacea eighty one Lauren Luke we're
talking the og of of us oh jeez here on
YouTube she posted a video like a day
ago I stumbled across it and it was just
her kind of casually talking to the
camera and I felt like oh my gosh like I
love her I
feel like I could listen to her for
hours on end if I had the time and
that's the struggle with a lot of this
is like I don't have time to really
watch YouTube all day but you know if
I'm doing something during that time I
can like turn on a couple videos or
while I'm getting ready here I've been
like just making a point to turn on so
many videos and just kind of get back in
touch with some of these people and she
is one of them who like I want to
rediscover I want to go back and watch
some of her older stuff but she got on
it's doing kind of a life update and she
kind of explained the fact that she's
been through some ups and downs she is
working another job but she put it out
there like I what would you like to see
from me and I mean her comments section
was filling up with people who were
excited to see this and I mean if you
know who I'm talking about and you were
around like at the start of YouTube and
the start of beauty YouTube you will be
excited to know that she did post that
video a day ago and she's potentially
looking to get back at it and I think
you know all the encouragement she could
get would be great because she is so
like genuine and sweet and kind she just
like casually like I think standing in
her kitchen just talking to her camera
updating everyone on where she's been
and she's like yeah I've still got some
makeup back there and I think I'm not
doing her accent well enough at all I'm
not even gonna try but if you don't know
who I'm talking about if you are a
beauty youtuber or you love watching
Beauty youtubers and you want to see who
the mother of all of us Beauty youtubers
is I think it might be her are you my
mommy yes you're Sam
Sherman talk about a gorgeous like
mystical fairy human being like she
looks like an actual goddess she's got
this beautiful blue eyes
stunning hair her skin looks like it's
just glowing she is a vision she has
been around on YouTube a long time I
like I watched her in very very early
days and I'm in a point of rediscovery
of her and also the next one I'm talking
about here X spark age Leisha she's got
an adorable little girl named violet
Belle's middle name is also violet so we
are connected for life but you know back
to Sam like just the sweetest like kind
of fun light personality she had her
Sherman show vlogs I found myself
thinking about Sam a lot before Eve was
born and I was thinking well Sam's got
two kids and she's still doing YouTube
so I guess I can keep this thing going
like I'm just watching a product
recommendations I love the little little
stuff that she'll just throw in there
like Spencer Pratt's snapchat like how
did that come into the mix she was
talking about hummingbirds I watch her
and I like I want to throw so much more
love her way than just the like button
you know on YouTube and same with Leisha
I feel like Leisha has really been
bringing it content wise like when my
channel was a lot younger like I
remember her channel 2 as always being
like kind of one of those inspirational
channels it's sort of like Julie G
because I've always been learning I've
never come into this beauty landscape as
a pro I would never tell you that I am
today either I'm just like kind of
you're getting my continual journey of
learning here and I felt like lisa was
one of those people where okay do I want
to really see how to actually do this I
look like go and watch her grow much
Julie or Tiffani - you know just like
amazing application and creativity and
she's just always had this fun like
bright edge to her at the sweetest
personality like I feel like a mom - mom
we would get along so well on that level
- I've never had the chance to meet her
in person but I kind of feel like I know
her after all these years you know kind
of doing the same thing but guys that's
my list that is my list of og Beauty
youtubers that I love and support that I
hope you love and support as well a
challenge when you do sort of a list
like this is that you know you're always
gonna like forget someone like you're
trying to remember this whole massive
group of people and it's hard but these
are people every one completely
different from the next all of them just
true individuals every person has
inspired me in some way that I've
mentioned everyone has brought something
wonderful to this platform I admire them
all I respect them all if I could like
just go on some sort of a retreat with
all of them like that'd be great not in
the woods preferably somewhere nice that
these people here I give them massive
credit for helping lay this foundation
of what the beauty community is on
YouTube they are a massive part of this
story you know and I would hate for
people to be super into YouTube and not
know who these names are because you
should so thank you so much for your
time I would love to hear your feedback
in the comment
section of OG youtubers that you just
love and support again I will be linking
to everyone's channel below so you can
easily check them out subscribe if you
haven't already and yeah
