product review with you it's on the
benefit they're real big sexy eye kit
and when I saw this on altas website I
thought well first off part of me
thought this is too good to be true the
way they're marketing this as a
situation where you can sweep a little
applicator across your two shades and
bam you've got your eye look I thought
that's got to be too good to be true
but I was still holding out this tiny
bit of hope for maybe that does really
actually work so I've got to test it out
so before I get into my review let's
talk about just how this palette is all
laid out it's kind of like a metal
palette and it opens up you've got a
mirror here you've also got three duo's
of shadow nothing is 100% matte in my
eyes some of them apply and don't have a
whole lot of shimmer on the eyes but as
far as being a 100% matte color I don't
feel like anything of that nature is in
here your top duo is kind of a golden
shade and a light to medium brown your
center shade is a soft shimmery pink and
then kind of like a Mavi taupe type
color and then on the bottom you've got
probably what's closest to matt with
this very light brown and then the
darker shade in that duo is like a very
very deep bronze now meet the little
applicator that comes with it it has you
know this little handle this little
notch right here where you hold on and
it's completely rounded on all sides
there's no sharp edge to this thing the
level of sponginess the softness of the
sponge really reminds me of like an
actual Beauty Blender you know it's got
quite a bit of give to it and these are
the instructions you're going to take
that round tip slide it across the duo
of shadows and then slide it right on
top of your eyelid slash crease area and
then boom you've got your eye look so it
sounds like it should be really really
easy and I've got to tell you guys this
wasn't as bad as I thought it was going
to be I know that's not like the most
glowing review ever but I really thought
there's no way you know with this
product I'm thinking back to the L'Oreal
one sweet product that had a really
funky shaped sponge tip and
were supposed to be able to take three
shades across the eye and it just did
not work and with this I think there are
a couple of reasons first off that this
can be workable number one if then if it
was going to put out a product like this
the shade selection is pretty smart
you'll notice that the contrast between
the colors in each of these duos is not
very extreme at all you don't have like
world's darkest Matt up against a really
really light shimmery shade all of the
deeper tones are kind of like a darkish
medium at best so when you're applying
those to the eyes and maybe you don't
get the placement of your little spongey
thing just right it's not going to be
brutally obvious necessarily another
wise thing that they did that I think
makes this workable is the applicator
well you might think how in the world is
that precise enough to apply two shades
of eyeshadow to my eye it is rounded you
know it's round all the way around
there's no sharp edge coming off of this
product and I think that kind of does
help you as well because you can sort of
turn it you can work it in with the
shape of your eye if there is quite a
bit of give to this so the contours of
your eye you know it can sort of adjust
and it's not like you're flat out
stamping like a cut stencil you know on
to an eye look as far as the quality of
the eye shadows goes they're really
quite good I've played with all of these
with this technique and I feel like
everything truly does show up on my eyes
I'm not feeling like oh that wasn't
pigmented enough I mean like I said your
darkest shades aren't going to be
world's darkest colors that's just the
way they've chosen to lay out this
palette and honestly for this to work I
think it kind of needs to be that way I
don't think you really want too much
contrast between your two shades and the
duos and something I have picked up on
after using this for a bit it might be
tempting to start your application and
want to sweep like this from inside to
out but the first spot where you place
this applicator is where the most
products going to go and at least on my
eyes it just does not look flattering to
have the most of my dark shadow right in
here it looks better when it's more
toward the outside so I go with kind of
a stamping method
there and then sort of softly bring it
in I'm going to go ahead and cut to the
demo and show you the method that I
prefer to use with this pallet so I've
already primed my lids I put on a little
Milani eyeshadow primer and I think I'm
going to go for the center one today I'm
taking my little applicator here holding
it by the handle and I'm going to go
back and forth a little bit across that
shade just a couple times because I feel
like that does pick up the little bit of
extra product that you need for it to
have a decent impact and really show up
on the eyes then I turn it around so I'm
going to get the lighter shade on my lid
and the darker shade should hit right
around my crease area you'll notice if
you look at the packaging the lighter
strip is always wider in these duos and
for me that just kind of fits my eye
shape a little bit better I feel like I
do have a decent amount of lid space and
then the dark shade falls in the right
spot if I were to turn it around and do
it the other way yes I would have some
darkness right up against the lash line
but I feel like the light shade would
fall right in my crease so anyway I've
gotten plenty of product applied there
and then I'm going to start toward the
outside of my eye and I'm going to start
with kind of like just a little dab
there and then a gentle pull in just
like that I've got the lighter shade on
my lid the deeper shade in the crease
and I certainly don't think that looks
perfectly blended but as far as the
placement of the shadows kind of being
in generally the right position I think
that is correct so what I'm going to do
is kind of rub off any extra shadow
that's on that little applicator and I'm
going to use it to sort of blend over
the edge of my darker shade there I
could see it was a little patchy on the
inside and kind of go over the outer
edge too
now I'm going to try this on the other
eye so I'm going to swipe back forth
back forth got two distinct shades
they're going to slip it so the light
part is on my lid and kind of stamp it
on for a second there we go and then
kind of lightly pull inward making sure
the most darkness gets on my outer
corner and it lightens up as I go inside
that side actually worked out pretty
well and then I just kind of rub off any
excess and I can use that little blender
to get a little bit of a blend on the
outside
so using this palette and this palette
and applicator alone that is the look
that I come out with I do again feel
like it's placing the shadows in the
right spot for my eye I know not
everyone has the eye the same eye shape
so that could kind of vary from person
to person as to how satisfied you are
could I walk out a house like this and
be okay with it absolutely but something
I'm always kind of tempted to bring in
is a little bit of a blending brush so
I'm just going to show you a couple ways
that I would work with this to kind of
create and finish the full look I just
really feel more comfortable going over
the edge with a full brush and then I
also like to go into a lighter shade
which I feel like this pink is probably
the lightest of the light shades as far
as shimmer goes it just has the most
glow and I can kind of use that as a
highlight too and then I can take my
darker shade with a pencil brush pencil
brush does fit into that narrow shadow
all right and I can use that below the
eye for a little smudge because I'm
certainly not going to smudge that round
applicator under my eye
and then another thing that I have done
a time or two is dip into that darker
shade with just a small crease brush
this is my essence of beauty fine crease
brush that I've had for ages and you can
kind of build up that shadow a bit more
if you want to because sometimes you
know when I'm using the round applicator
I really hit it in the right spot and
sometimes I would go a little bit
further over with the shadow so just
something to think about as a way to
sort of refine this look a bit and then
beyond this point it's just whatever
liner mascara lashes you want to put on
and you're good so for my finished eye
look I just have a nude liner in my
lower inner rim black liquid liner
across the upper lash line and some
false lashes and mascara on there as
well and it's certainly a look
I feel fine about wearing you know it's
not real flashy it's not terribly dark
but for an everyday look this definitely
works but that being said about this
being a workable I look I still was so
compelled to bring in that extra
blending brush or you know kind of
refine the shape of the crease color
just a little bit if it wasn't just how
I wanted it the one step nature of this
product could work but I think kind of
depends on how your application turned
out on that given day and how picky you
are with the way your eyeshadow ends up
coming off and I will say this if you
are one who is already very comfortable
with using makeup brushes if you think
about doing a two shadow look let's say
one shade on the lid another shade in
the crease and it's not going to take
you long anyway so if you already know
I've got my brushes
I'm happy with my brushes I can do a
quick look you know just as quickly with
my brushes
I wouldn't go seeking out this kit
because the shades honestly are not that
unique now on the other hand maybe
you're a person who's really struggled
with brushes you think these everyday
very basic color duo's would be
something that would suit you day to day
I can't say this kid is a total flop
because once I just sort of learned a
few little tricks to applying it really
has done a decent job of doing the two
shadows at once type of thing for me I
would just say at the
I'm an extra tool to have on hand would
be a bear blending brush just so you can
go over that darker shade just in case
it gets placed a little bit outside of
exactly where your crease is and you can
also use this as a highlighting brush
but I do have a word of caution if
you're planning to just straight-up
ditch the applicator and just use these
shadows with your regular brushes the
darker shadow here is really slim and if
I was going to stick my e-40 in that you
know there's a good chance I'm going to
pick up some of the lighter shade it
seems to fit the lighter shade okay but
when you want to get more darkness on a
fluffier brush even an e25 type brush
you've got to really be careful with
where you're placing that in pencil
brushes smaller brushes can hit that
darker shade just fine but something to
be aware of if you're thinking well my
backup plan is to just use this with my
brushes if the applicator doesn't work
for me you might have a little struggle
with the darker shade so that is my
review on the benefit they're real big
sexy eye kit again I think it's
something that's really going to vary
person-to-person as to whether you like
this method whether this is enough for
you you know if you're into big complex
and or colorful looks on a day to day
basis these are very natural duo's
there's not a lot of contrast between
the shades and I think I shape and size
may dictate how successful you are with
the little rounded tip for me I can
definitely make that work going outside
to end but almost always I am very
tempted to bring in an extra blending
brush just to clean things up a little
bit but going into this thinking it was
going to be an all-out unworkable
gimmick I'm actually coming away
thinking you know that could work
alright so thank you so much for taking
time to watch I really appreciate it and
I will see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
