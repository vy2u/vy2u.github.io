video here on my channel today I'm
talking about the Urban Decay Naked skin
shapeshifter so this is a contouring /
kind of multi-purpose face palette and
there's a lot going on in this little
space here and I can try to contain my
excitement for this but I'm just going
to put it out there I think this is a
brilliantly made product I think the
design on this is so good
I think Urban Decay has done some really
great well thought-out palettes my mind
goes to their lip palettes and how
nicely packaged that was I think a
little it is hard to put together and
keep it neat and they did some great lip
palettes recently and this is another
one of those things where I look at it
and I think whoever's responsibility
this was like they freaking nailed it
because you've got half cream in this
palette half powder they have done a
good job in actually separating those so
the integrity of the products is so well
maintained it's kept totally separate I
mean you've got this mirror here and
there's a mirror on each side they
wouldn't have had to have done that but
it makes it so convenient when you're
using powder products now you can look
right in here and then you flip it over
and you've got your creams I mean I love
that I love that attention to detail
also this is a product that is out in
two shades so I've got the lighter of
the two or the light/medium shift as
they call it and then there's a medium
dark shift and the difference is in
these I think are pretty pronounced in
both the creams and the powders I mean
you're getting a whole different shade
range from one to the next and I have
not used the darker one yet because I
mean for my skin tone the light one is
pretty much all that I need but if
you've used this one and you could share
in the comment section the darker of the
two you know how that's worked have the
tones been appropriate for your skin
these are the powders side by side and I
can pop up some pictures to just kind of
swatching them out so you can see
exactly how different they are you are
getting much deeper contouring powders
here and in the darker of the two and
the light kind of skin tone powder over
here or light beige powder is a little
bit more of a banana type powder in this
one and then the highlight here that is
more of a like peachy golden highlight
whereas here it's more of a pearl and
then on the cream side and the dark
palate I mean your highlight is more
peachy again and unlike the lighter
palate having a couple tones of peach
corrector here you've got a yellow and a
deeper orange and then these would be
like your cream highlight and contour
shades and by highlight I don't mean
like shimmery glowy highlight but just
something that's going to add like light
and brightness to the skin and those are
both of course deeper than what's in the
light palette so I just wanted to lay it
out there that that's what's in the
deeper of the two palettes but again
packaging I cannot argue with this one
bit this is a really great design look
how compact that is it's not like you're
getting tiny pans of product in here
either there is no wasted space
whatsoever
and everything is kept so nicely
separated Oh magnetic closure derp I
love that I am wearing every element of
this palette on my skin today I thought
it was quick you know because
everything's kind of all in one place I
thought it was therefore very simplified
because you know you don't have to do a
lot of picking and choosing you just got
to decide what I fall into the light to
medium category or the medium dark the
blend ability of the products was really
good and very simple I think it's very
high quality nice feeling powders in
here
I think the creams are really good and
really easy to work with as well I do
have a couple of small complaints with
the corrector shades that are in this
one that I've been using and I think I'm
just going to start there because I did
a full application so you could see this
stuff going on also I'll just go in
order it the way I put this stuff on so
I have a foundation on my skin I use the
covergirl vitalist healthy elixir today
which is a straight up medium coverage
foundation for me so it's still leaving
you know circles and things to cover up
on my skin so the first thing I do is I
go into the deeper peach in the
correctors here and I use that right
around my darkest place which would be
the innermost corner right here on like
the side of my nose and then I use a
little bit of the lighter peach kind of
dabbing over the top of that and
covering the whole area kind of on the
top of my cheek then I kind of find
myself blending one or both of those
shades with the light highlight color in
here not the shimmery highlight but just
the base color type of thing doing that
can kind of create a bit of a concealer
for me around areas where I might have a
little redness or blemish I can blend
one of the peach tones with that and get
more of a beige and I can use that
lighter shade to just highlight anywhere
you know down the nose wherever and I
could certainly blend this in with my
fingers if I wanted to but I actually do
like this brush that I got for free and
well it's the vib rouge brush so I'm
really good at free did I am but it's
the pro mini flawless airbrush and I
just kind of used that to dab this stuff
in all around my eye area and it's just
a nice little blending synthetic brush
beauty blenders work great with these
products as well but they're just not
difficult to blend so I really think
whatever manner you choose is fine there
is something I do need to say about
these correctors right here all of these
creams from here to here are kind of
like the same formula this highlight the
shimmery highlight is a little bit more
dry than everything else but I feel like
everything else here is like the same
consistency it's relatively thin very
smooth does not stay super creamy
definitely not sticky at all on the skin
but it's just not super thick either and
I almost could have used a little more
thickness out of these shades and I'm
kind of coming at this critique from a
place of like back when I had melasma
very severe discoloration up in here
mask of pregnancy it's sometimes
referred to as I took some real work to
cover up and not every corrector worked
just perfectly with it like just because
I reached for something peachy didn't
mean it was automatically like gone and
I'm pretty sure the way these are a
little bit thinner peachy correctors
they may not have done the job there for
like run of the middle under-eye circles
or a little bit of darkness you need to
brighten up their I think they're really
quite good for those purposes maybe the
deepest darkest under-eye circles they
might not totally be able to go there
with but I feel like for me on a
day-to-day basis while it does vary a
bit I always have some amount of
darkness on the under eye area sometimes
it's pretty dark and sometimes it's
I'm like moderate and this step seems to
work well there but for dark patches on
the skin really dark age spots that some
PG directors seem to work well with like
benefit erased based always work well
for me there these may not be thick
enough for event but anyway back into
application you could certainly take
these creams and like totally do
yourself up and do the light stuff and
then have dark stuff down here you know
just really dab all these colors on at
once but I kind of like to get one level
of it blended and then go in with the
cream contour which I like to use my
Real Techniques contouring brush I do
this is so perfect like this brush it
practically blends itself like I'm not I
don't feel like I'm doing any work here
to use this it also helps that these are
very easy to blend creams because
they're not too thick so my main place
for use and that is in the hollow of the
cheek and kind of around the hairline
area so I just get that all blended in
there and then something I rarely do but
I decided to do for this video is take
the lighter shade that's right beside
the contour and use that down below the
hollow of the cheek and that can kind of
create a bit more contrast and really
make that cheek contour pop even more if
you're into that and so once that's all
blended out that's my cream stuff for
now we will come back to that cream
highlight in a second but then I kind of
flip the palette over and you've got
your powders here now I'm not saying you
have to use all of this stuff every time
you do your makeup because you could
maybe just go with the creams and leave
it at that or you could just do powders
but obviously for the purposes of
showing you as much as possible in this
video I'm trying to give you the whole
shebang so the first thing I went to
powder wise was this light matte powder
here and I used my small tapered brush
from ELF and this makes a nice little
under eye setting powder it's really a
perfect tone it's a very nice feel I
mean it feels very smooth it actually
adds a little coverage but it's not too
thick for that area you know what I mean
I definitely tap off the excess on my
brush so because it can kind of pick up
quite a bit and then I can use that very
same powder and take it around my nose
onto my forehead a little bit for me
it's kind of become
like this all-purpose setting powder in
this compact and then the layer of the
to contour shades I just used a little
bit of that to sort of set the cream
contour now that that cream is like
screaming to be set by any means it's
not sticky it does not have any sort of
major texture in a way going over it
with a little powder it does give this
added kind of smoothness to the skin
maybe a little bit more of a modified
like airbrushed look to it I guess so I
use my ELF complexion brush just to very
lightly go over the hollow of the cheek
area there didn't use a lot of product
by any means but I do really like that
shade it's a nice tone of contour and
then this shade here really strikes me
as much more of a bronzer so I like
using that right around the hairline
because it makes me think more of where
the Sun is naturally hitting and it just
really warms up the skin a bit more I
even like taking that right over the
tops of the cheeks because it just looks
so natural in that way so I really enjoy
these tones I like what's happening here
it's a nice feeling powder just
across-the-board pigmented easy to work
with but let's talk a little bit of
highlighting here because for this I go
back to the cream and I do a little
layering and this cream you might swatch
this in a store and think there's not
much going on here with this cream
highlight like it's not super bold and
vivid and it just isn't it gives you a
pretty subtle look and I just dab it on
with my fingers a little bit on the top
of the cheekbone
but you pair that then with this
beautiful powder highlight and it's so
gorgeous this is a beautiful highlight
that they've put in this palette and I
use my Mota highlight and glow brush
with that and it just it pairs so nicely
and it looks even more pronounced on top
of that cream which is not a sticky
cream at all like I mentioned it's a
teeny bit drier and formula compared to
the other creams in the palette but I
just cannot get over how beautiful that
glow is and I have not always been a fan
of urban decay highlights like I just
can't really think about that many that
I've been super wild by I'm kind of
flashing back to that palette that they
put out around the holidays and it was
like a total no-go for me but what
they've got in here is really really
good and so my finished look using this
palette
I think I've got more you know contoured
and shaded skin definitely I've got this
whole variety of ways to achieve that
you know some days like today it's the
whole shebang some days I can just take
bits and pieces but I will show you what
it looks like with a blush added in
because I do think that adds a little
extra something and if I were to say
something was missing from this palette
which I don't know if that's really fair
to say that it's missing because this is
meant to be like a contouring product
put it this way the one additional face
thing that I might need in addition to a
foundation would be a blush and so today
I use this on bray radiance gns a quad
blush from it cosmetics it's beautiful
yes it is and so I just pop that on the
apples of the cheeks and finished look I
am very pleased with i'm matt where I
want to be matte i'm glowy where I want
to be glowy contoured where I need to be
contoured and I must say it's got good
staying power as well especially when
you are doing this kind of two-step
method and you're using creams and
you're setting it with some powder
everything's really locked in using this
light powder is kind of an under eye
setting powder really pretty effective
there as well oh my gosh
I almost forgot I can't use a
multitasking palette like this without
saying like oh and you can use it on the
eyes so I also used it on my eyes today
it's not even really tutorial worthy but
I showed you I put the lighter of the
two contours in my crease I also added a
little bit of the deeper one and the
outer part of the crease as well put a
little bit of the creamy shade all over
the lid and so that highlight shade just
around my inner corner and that is the
eye shadow look today so yes it can do
that too and just the icing on the cake
this nice compact design is really a
beautiful palette you can see there's a
texture there on the inside but then
they totally got this smooth plastic on
the outside the magnetic closure the
double mirror the full separation of
cream and powder and around you $45 and
I think that's actually a very fair
price for this product I think the
quality is completely there with both
creams and powders and it's just really
giving you a lot so that's my review
thank you guys so much for taking time
to watch and I will see you again very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
