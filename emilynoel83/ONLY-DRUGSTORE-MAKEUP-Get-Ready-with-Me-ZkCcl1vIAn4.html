joining you this morning on Saturday and
do you guys know how often like you're
the first people I'm talking to in the
morning outside of my cat it's like I
get up and I'm like good morning thank
you the first time I really get going is
that Pierre with you all and it's
Saturday and it's early but I just
thought this would be a good time to do
it and I went to bed last night thinking
I want to do an altar up store get ready
with me tomorrow and so I was excited to
do it when I got up this is from Catrice
this is the prime &amp;amp; fine
smoothing refiner it says for invisible
pores and lines and I was talking about
this in a recent video makeup that seems
more expensive than it is this is a
really beautiful texture on this primer
it's kind of thick but yet it sort of
melts into your skin and I see an actual
difference once I start putting it on
like it it kind of mattifies it blurs a
little bit in terms of pores so have you
guys been doing what's the deal with
your New Year's resolution
so you keeping them are you struggling
with them well I can tell you one small
very specific thing I've been doing and
kind of struggling with is no night
snacking so once we finished dinner it's
like no no snacking you think it might
be known as like a 12 hour fast or
something where you don't eat for
another 12 hours so in the morning it's
like no big deal for example I was
really craving a snack last night I'd
say around 8:30 or so but now here I am
up and it's like six o'clock and I'm not
even the least bit hungry that's always
how it goes for me in the early morning
though but I've been doing that for a
week now
so yeah do it alright what I'm hoping is
is that it's one of those things that's
gonna become such a habit that it's
gonna get easier and easier you know
because food wise I just think that's
where I really do myself in is it's not
like I'm always eating a lot but what's
reaching for something usually something
that probably makes me wake up bloated
and yeah I'm still nursing and
breastfeeding makes me really hungry and
thirsty and all that but if I'm honest
with myself I still feel like I don't
truly need that nice
and Tyler's doing the same thing which
helps a lot because when you're both on
the same page you don't have one person
tempting the other okay so my skin is
all prepped and now I'm gonna use
something really random here it's the
Maybelline fit me shine free Balance
Foundation so there's stick foundation
this was one of the first ever Beauty
Beauty broadcast Express reviews that I
ever did was on this product actually
not this specific one since I
repurchased it recently but the reason
why i repurchased it was ahead of the
Emily awards I was thinking about stick
foundations and there's all these
different ones from high-end but the
drugstore hasn't really jumped on that
train as much as high-end brands have
but this one's been out for a while and
I thought retry it and I wasn't feeling
necessarily super strongly about it
obviously it didn't win an Emily award
but I'm still in this mode of wanting to
see what it's got you know so I'm using
that today and I am in classic ivory
the line runs a little bit dark so I'm
not always ivory when I buy stuff but
here I am
so just draw on that on all over and
then I'm gonna use my little Real
Techniques guy here it's just handy
whereas right as I start blending my
foundation out my memory card fills up
Oh or talking about New Year's
resolutions I hadn't really decided
about that no night snacking thing right
off the bat you know I went into the
year with a vague like I want to get
really fit this year a solution and that
one just kind of stumbled in maybe about
a week late but that's fine and then one
thing I have been doing I actually
started this on Christmas and this is
something that I've done periodically
and I've done different like books and
things that kind of guide you through it
and whatnot it's something I'm really
aiming to keep up consistently just on
my own doesn't take anything special is
journaling slash gratitude journaling
every single day and I started on
Christmas and I'm keeping it going um
then at everyday sense I really like to
do it in the morning and I just I don't
know I'll write a little bit about
what's going on you know what the latest
big thing of the day that I did was or
whatever sometimes I write a little
sometimes I write a lot but no matter
what every day I include three things
that I'm grateful for and that could be
little things huge things just whatever
it always needs to be something
different and according to one of
Oprah's life class people if you keep
stuff like that up for 21 days or
whatever you create a habit of positive
thinking I feel like I'm a pretty
positive person in general but you know
you can always use more gratitude and
the habit of practicing gratitude in
your life it is something that you
actually need to practice and it really
is cool because instead of going through
your days and like I don't know there
are days where you just set off more
easily don't we all have those days
where it's like something small just
gets on your last nerve you know and
you're gonna just be a little irritable
yeah you'll still have that but I mean
more often than not I find myself going
through my day looking for things and
thinking about things in such a way
where I'm like oh my gosh there's a
great thing to write in my gratitude
journal you know like oh my gosh this
snow falling today looks so gorgeous
that's going in the gratitude journal
we're like Eve came over to bail when
she was sitting on her little chair and
just laid her head down in her lap and
it was the sweetest thing ever like
that's moments you know you're looking
at moments small big
just whatever comes to mind but you make
it something different every day three
different things and I think that's what
it's all about it affects your daily
mindset in terms of what you're looking
for in the world because you will find
what you're looking for you know if
you're looking for negative and
somebody's you know kracken over here
you're looking for that stuff you will
probably find it but if you're also
looking for positive and good and happy
and soul filling you will find that too
so I do that's what I love about the
daily gratitude journaling and it
doesn't have to be complicated you can
do it on your phone on the Notes app you
can do it on just any random notebook
you can find in your house anyway I'm
doing it I'm loving it and no joke I
think it's life changing
so anyway move it along here I'm going
to do some concealer this is that makeup
revolution conceal and define full
coverage conceal and contour in c4 and
this is real similar in terms of the
claims and stuff that heart-shaped tape
has I'm not calling this a dupe but you
know they kind of claim to do the same
sort of stuff on your face and I'm gonna
use this as my concealer today and I've
been using this for on and off for a
couple weeks and I feel like it's
definitely thinner than shaped tape for
sure like it's a more lightweight
texture and I'm putting this anywhere I
want it brightened because as you can
see the shade is a bit light and then I
take sort of a fluffy brush and go over
it here but the coverage to continue my
thought there the coverage is really
pretty good like I think it's covering
actually really well and what I need to
do is find like a little on my lower in
a rim lift I need to locate a shade of
this that's like an exact match to the
shade of shape tape that I normally use
and then really do some hardcore
side-by-sides but it's more lightweight
yet it's really good coverage that may
play well for a lot of people who have
struggled with shape tape and thinking
it's dry me I really haven't had that
issue with shape tape so much but I feel
like this you can kind of get away with
using a little more if you like to use
more
like I feel pretty full covered right
now I still see a little bit of dark
circle you know you hold your head just
right you'll find the dark circle you'll
find what you're looking for like I said
earlier right so stuff like that kind of
makes me wonder is it quite as
full-coverage shaped tape but you know
what I'm gonna leave it at that
concealer wise and I'm gonna bake it and
we'll just see like how the look
develops that my Maybelline fit me here
shake it up I got fair shades fair I
love this powder I think it does a
really good job and I just Pat right
here get all up in that lovely area but
no I have had really good luck with this
powder it works quite well and this
particular shade like you end up feeling
really bright and really mattified
perfected not that you'd have to bake
with it I'm just I'm going for it today
I just feel like it but you can also
just lightly put a little on with a
brush I wouldn't call it a Laura Mercier
powder do but I would call it definitely
up there it's you know it's doing good
things you might sometimes see me
holding princess coffee mugs I got a ton
of these like I don't know it was when
Belle was really little and one has just
bail on it and then one has the
princesses and I think I got him for
like TJ Maxx or Ross or something you
know those are places where you go in
and meet yeah maybe you have one need
but you come out with like all this
other stuff and so when the kids like
one and a half I'm buying her coffee
mugs like in anticipation of the days
when she'll be using coffee mugs knowing
full well that's a long ways off but I
went ahead and bought him anyway and
look at me I'm just using them in the
interim let's talk about brows for a
second I got something here when I did
my little like it was my birthday night
and Tyler and I ended up at Ulta I don't
know I just don't know how that happens
people but this is the aisle or and and
Vegas named brow and shadow Pro palette
so she has this and then I later went on
to purchase the brow highlighter in
shadow palette because I realized like
this is a substantial palette right
there's a lot in here this is a brow
primer kind of like wax down here at the
end but then all these brow shades that
I guess can also be eyeshadows so
they've devoted a lot of space to shadow
in here it's like Urban Decay Naked
sighs palette but I guess strategically
there is no highlighter shade here like
you're gonna give all this stuff but
then nothing that can be like that under
brow highlight or the issue I ran into
was I was trying to use this for a full
eye shadow look and I was without the
highlight and they claim it's a brow and
shadow palette oh but here's where they
got you they've made a separate palette
for brow highlighter and shadow shades
so there you go at separate palette just
for the little bit of shadow you're
gonna put up under your brow and then
maybe a couple deeper shades that you
could work into a shadow we're gonna use
them today I'm gonna quit my kracken
about it but it does come with a nice
angled brush and spoolie and then
another good point about this is that
the brow primer is in here so I'm gonna
run my brush through some of that and
just get it going in my brows so that
way the shadows have a little something
to cling to I've always said brow colors
brow shadows if you're using a shadow
it's got to have a little something on
there to cling to and then I think I'm
gonna start off with this shade called
cappuccino it's a very topi kind of
shade but I'm gonna work that in oh it's
a little darker it goes a little darker
than you think actually right here in
the front of the brow another brow thing
I've been experimenting with which is
kind of cool you know it makes a lot of
sense but again it's just powder and
they're lacking some sort of way for it
to cling into your brows but it's that
benefit product that looks like an
eyebrow it's like the pan of shadow is
shaped like an eyebrow and the first
half is a lighter shade and the second
half is a deeper shade because you
usually you know go a little lighter on
the inner part of your brow and darker
on the middle and the tail let's work on
that tail shall we I'm gonna use hot
chestnut for that nice cool dark brown
my tail these shadows or these these
products in here are really pigmented
I just don't understand why they
couldn't throw us a bone with one white
shade like highlighter shade because
that would make this so much more
well-rounded as an eyeshadow palette
what shape did I use at first
cappuccino I think it was mmm cappuccino
speaking of cappuccino I got the best
unlike Keurig coffee sampler my parents
like every Christmas I get some sort of
thing and it's like this
best ever variety pack of stuff for the
Keurig like if you like things that are
coffee but also beyond coffee like tea's
hot chocolates cappuccinos apple cider
x' things like that it is so cool and so
much fun you know I'll do a coffee in
the morning always but sometimes later
in the day I'll get something a little
bit fun if it's still available I'll
have to link below to what they ended up
getting me because it has been
absolutely delicious and there's so many
random things in there like yesterday I
had a red velvet latte or something
while watching Muppet family Christmas
on a snow day with my children that's
what I'm talking about
now snow day I guess we used that term
loosely it was just snowing that's all
it takes to be a snowed in my book kids
aren't quite to the age where they're
getting out of school for it you know
but we just declare it a snow day we
stay in pajamas watch fun stuff on TV
did you have any snow day traditions as
a kid like did it really really excite
you when school would let out for a snow
day when you were younger because it did
me like I was super pumped about it part
of it too was that my dad all through
elementary school and junior high my dad
was my principal so he would know right
away like when the superintendent called
he'd be the first to know that school
was indeed gonna be canceled and we
would both get so excited about it and
just you know really have a good time
yeah the hot chocolate sit around the
wood-burning fire it was just a
wonderful situation yeah what do I do
with this cuz I don't really want to use
it as my eyeshadow today I want to use
something else
so we'll just just so you know this is
where the highlighters are in their
separate bang palette yesterday I made
bail her first let's not her first
grilled cheese she's eating a whole lot
of that
but her first time eating grilled cheese
and tomato soup together dipping it's
important yes she did that and she loved
it and Eve likes it too
Eve will try to eat every dang thing
that Belle goes after with their two
teeth the other day Belle walked into
the room and she had a like little bowl
full of some pretzels and he freaking
tackled the bowl like she grabbed what
she had won in her mouth so fast and I'm
like you can't like yeah maybe it might
eventually dissolve but that's a choking
hazard I don't think I'm gonna risk I
mentioned a little bronzer this is the
Lottie London tan time bronzer tan time
in light/medium it's actually a pretty
dark bronzer but I remember liking this
and I haven't really powdered all over
on the skin just the places where I
baked by the way this is actually like
6:00 a.m. date night makeup because I am
gonna be having a date night tonight and
I am hoping this makeup lasts me the
entire day I can't remember which
magazines Twitter feed was making a big
deal of this but apparently kendall
Jenner when she does her bronzer and she
goes in her cheekbones she pinched her
brush and they thought that was just the
most amazing thing ever I mean it is a
good idea but it gets funny but look at
me now I'm doing it and I don't even
need to do it with this brush
quality bronzer for blush I'm also gonna
use Lottie London and this is the blush
crush in Drake I really like this blush
a lot so you look at that it's like
really pigmented but yet this is a very
approachable shade
and then I just talked about this in a
video but the better highlight in pink
from Physicians Formula take a little
bit of this and then just like very
lightly I kind of start small and then
work out a little bit over the apple of
the cheek and it's like you got this
beautiful radiance suddenly right there
it's a blush top or y'all that's what
this is and then I'm going to use
something that my girl Erica Jones sent
my way how exciting is this wet and wild
mega glow highlighting palette yeah this
is fun for tones I'm gonna do this one
up here not that I really need more glow
even on top of what's on the apple of my
cheeks but I want to just play with this
a little bit Oh watch out Saturday 6:00
in the morning world
frosty er than that frozen sleet on my
doorstep I like this though I'm trying
to keep it light and kind of buffed in
but that's pretty yeah she also sent
this this prime and fine from Catrice
multi-talent fixing spray probably
because she thinks I'm multi-talented
and it smells so good you might think
like it's purple so it's gonna smell
like lavender but that's not really what
it smells like it just smells fresh like
what do you smell like like a body mist
that I'd used way back in the day like
it has a light very pleasing not
overwhelming scent I swear it reminds me
of some classic body spray that used to
wear since do that since really take you
back like when you smell something
that's even like a little bit kind of
like something you used to wear it
doesn't matter how long ago it was like
your your mind will make the connection
just had a burp etaf happen there sorry
so here's the deal guys here's what I'm
itching to use and dig into more I found
the newly formulated wet and wild quads
and also these bigger pallets well this
was the only one legit the only one in
stock was this shade in this not a basic
peach so I could use that right now I
also have walking on eggshells which I
had a little demo with that in my last
video so I won't use that
TEDA let this plummy one or I've got
silent treatment which doesn't look just
like the old silent treatment did but
that's okay I think I'm gonna use this
one it offers the most opportunity and
wet-and-wild gets their palates stuck
down on like two sides and I'm not gonna
complain about that because I don't like
my stuff getting compromised in the
drugstore I don't like to see people
busting into pallets and swatching them
and now it can't be purchased by anyone
so I respect you for this wet and wild
even though it is a bit of a pain in the
butt think I almost broke the hinge off
that thing oh and you know what can also
use my wet and wild I shadow primer it's
like I said turning over a new leaf
trying to experiment with some new
products I have been experimenting with
the Marc Jacobs one that I said I would
- we're all about drugstore in this
video let's don't be nice just to see
how it pairs with the brands eyeshadows
kind of sticky like it's not quite as
silky gliding across the lids not
necessarily have a problem with that
because shadow will no doubt cling to it
well but it's taking some time what I'm
gonna do is start off with this kind of
beige color here and I'm using this it
cosmetics brush the superhero four and
one I'm using it in its most fluffed out
state there so you can see I've got a
little like light creasing this going
this is a very light shade so I'm kind
of surprised it's giving me any contrast
I'm gonna go ahead and use this light
shade up under my brows one thing I
really like to do when I have the
opportunity is to just use a palette on
my eyes before swatching because it's
most important what it you know what is
capable of doing on the eyes that's the
number one thing I don't like it when
people get overly consumed with the way
a palette swatches before they've ever
attempted anything like that on their
eyes it just doesn't make sense now I'm
making the brush a little smaller to the
crease size and I think I'm gonna use
some of this right here that picked up
nicely so I'm working some of that into
my crease I think I might just have to
order the other um palettes if I want to
try in any way order him off of wet and
wilds website is clearly my Walgreens
was out of stock and I thought I was on
it you know I thought I was
johnny-on-the-spot like I had
looked for him before I hadn't seen him
wait a couple weeks go back there's one
left but they did have all those quads
now I want to use a flat brush and gosh
what shade what shade should I use I'm
kind of intrigued by this color right
here this sort of mauve with gold
shimmer
can't quit til what it's doing it's
looking more mat than I expected as its
laying down on the lid
this is kind of a cool unexpected color
combo and the warm brown the dusty plum
it's like a version of the look that I
really like but just a little more muted
and I'll pull in a little bit of this
lightest shade right here
hmmm just a bit of this dark brown and
want to see what that's made of right
outer corner
for Christmas the lovely Cristen game
gave me several beautiful Wayne Goss
brushes one of them here is number 20
and it's like a small crease brush and I
always crave a really nice small crease
brush and I've been liking this just for
pulling the shadow out exactly where I
want it in an outer corner I just took a
little bit more Brown on my brush to do
that
it's a really soft nice feeling brush
that like it's very luxurious and I'm
using this 19 brush which kind of
reminds me of Sigma Z 36 a little bit
only it's thicker and bigger you know
but I'm using it for the same type of
purpose I guess and I'm taking that
shade right here this color called
transition and this looks just becoming
a little deeper than I expected it would
but I kind of like it
here's a major shot my stash moment I
found this Jordana eyeliner called cat
eyeliner I don't even remember when I
got this
but the Shae is black brown it's not
pure black it's black brown you know I'm
trying to distance myself a little bit
from black yeah it did since myself
about an inch from it right I just don't
want a loud color with this particular I
look okay the brush is really similar to
color Envy I think I will wing it out
some
I'm really wanting a nice solid line
because I have a fun lash that I'm gonna
try today that I also got on my birthday
today I'm going to use my ultimate brow
highlight here in the lower inner rim
waterline area and then on the lower
lash line I'm going to start on the
outside with the dark brown
then maybe for a little something fun
going inward I'll try this this shade is
like coral with gold Sparkle
I'm just gonna curl my lashes tweezerman
pro curl lash curler by the way swear by
it love it better than anything ever I
had a really crazy thought this morning
while I was nursing Biddy we call her
MIDI or a little bit feeding her this
morning and I was opening Instagram on
my phone and I see this video of Britney
Spears and she's like she's all about
like trying on different dresses she
appears to be maybe in her home I guess
and she's like voguing for the camera
she's like spinning around and having
like seemingly the best time ever like
she seems like she is really living her
best life like loving every minute of it
and she's just trying on various skimpy
dresses for the camera like skimpy you
know and it's just this total montage of
her doing that and I'm thinking like
what if one day out of the freakin blue
I showed up on my Instagram page doing
that like what would how would my
audience react would y'all be like what
in the world are you doing or would you
just like applaud me for that or laugh
your head off that's what's gonna happen
y'all I'm gonna be like okay it's been
six months and I haven't snacked at
nighttime I'm gonna celebrate by putting
on skimpy dresses on Instagram I'm
joking I don't really see me doing that
at any point Gold Faithful here on the
lower lashes do I even need to say what
it is well I will in case you're new
here it's covergirl clump crusher water
resistant but you know what skimpy
clothes Instagram shoot would not
literally even be possible in my house
because I'm thinking okay I unless I
just want to get the house totally to
myself and do it like can you imagine
the hysterical laughter if Tyler walked
into that or you've got two little kids
like crawling into the shot like
wondering what the heck is mommy doing
here in front of the mirror I've been
trying to hit my inner most lower lashes
a little bit better because I feel like
I never paid attention to those for like
years now these are the lashes that I
have here again from the Vegas nay
line they are called what are they
called absolute allure and I really like
how they're so long in the middle and
they're tapered at both ends so they're
gonna be really eye-opening I think so
I'm just gonna go ahead and put these on
and get my camera a little rest here get
my memory card a break from filling up
and then I'll be back with the finished
look and we'll do some lips you guys I
don't know if I can do this these lashes
they are a total flop for me I have
never tried a false lash so straight
what the heck they're straight there's
like no curl to them at all so I've got
this one on here and it's like poking
down like it's really full it's a
beautiful cut but it's it's just no it's
not happening
got to find another lash I'll be back
okay I put on a random lash that I have
up here that I I don't really like I am
NOT nuts about this lash look this lash
was kind of also very hard to work with
although it is curled it's just huge and
long and just I don't know I'm not a fan
it's clean color angelic wink number 118
just a super cheap lash and the other
lashes that I would have naturally gone
for like they're downstairs cuz I take
them off you know at my bathroom sink
and I just didn't have any others I
really wanted to where I had high hopes
for these I thought these were gonna be
perfect but that's okay if I keep like
the inner part kind of tipped down they
look a little bit better but I don't
know let's move on to lips we're gonna
do our Dell and it's their matte whipped
lip stick liquid lipstick I was playing
with a deeper shade of this the other
day and I actually really liked how it
felt and it wore decently well like
really dark shades of liquid lipstick
are always gonna I don't know I think
come off a little patchy eventually but
this I thought kind of would look nice
with the eye color on my lid it goes on
very liquidy I don't really get the whip
name because it doesn't seem whipped
like for example the julep does but our
Adele has come out with a ton of eye on
lip products so if you want more info
let me know cuz I've got a lot to try
it's just standard doe foot applicator
on this by the way
really love that color I hope it doesn't
dry down to something way way darker
than that though cuz I really like that
shade so there's my get ready with me
for today the foundation I really do
think it goes on well I'm gonna pay
close attention to how this wears
throughout the day but I thought it was
actually pretty decent coverage and it
paired nicely with the makeup revolution
concealer like that combo I thought gave
me really nice coverage over all the
color products on the face the Lottie
London bronzer and blush I've used those
before and I really liked them the wet
and wild this new palette mmm I'm not
over the moon with it like I think it
definitely has some pretty shades and I
thought certain ones definitely blended
out easily the shimmers sorry I'm just
like combing through my hair with my
fingers the shimmers that I used in here
weren't quite as brilliant as I would
have expected given wet and wild Zolder
formulation like they weren't quite as
metallic as I expected them to be but I
thought the mattes did pretty well so
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you had fun I definitely did I love
doing these get ready with me videos and
I will see you very soon bye so just a
little follow-up on the makeup and the
staying power and everything I switched
up my lip color by the way this is from
the kathleenlights the new collection
it's the satin lip and then with the
gloss over it I think that's really
pretty I did change out my lashes cuz
that other set was just really annoying
me they were starting to come I just I
couldn't deal with those these are the
huda beauty Samantha lashes I only just
slightly touched up a little bit with
powder on my forehead and nose so little
t-zone area there but overall I feel
like the longevity of the makeup has
been really good another thing was even
though that shadow that I put on my
lower lash line seemed to have a lot of
sparkle in it I didn't notice that
really like transferring down onto my
cheek at all so that was good news as
well the liquid lip color that I had on
earlier I thought wore off pretty
quickly I had some leftover Thai food
for lunch and breakfast and it really
broke it down fast I don't know I think
that's to be expected just you know
whatever you're putting a product
through sometimes it's more sometimes
it's less so that's my follow up for the
look guys hope you enjoyed and I'll talk
to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
