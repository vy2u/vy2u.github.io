basket filled with things that are
overlooked at Ulta how do I know they're
overlooked well I asked on Twitter and
you guys told me y'all we're talking
about so many different brands that you
feel like don't get enough attention or
just don't generate a lot of buzz in the
social media beauty community I'm always
out to find a hidden gem so I thought I
would get some of these things try them
out thank you so much if you shared your
input with me when I asked that question
on Twitter I wasn't able to try every
single brand that was suggested but I
could totally see there being a round
two of this in the future maybe three or
four also it's dark it's raining outside
it's all cozy got my coffee we're gonna
start on the video should I give you
guys a brief preview of what some of the
things were that were mentioned Pacifica
was a huge one also the Ulta house brand
we'll call it I got this box called meet
our faves I thought this would be a
great way to sample some of the things
that are maybe what they see is their
best product so we'll work some of those
into the love japonesque soap &amp;amp; Glory
essence so yeah this is gonna be fun I
love videos like this we're full facing
it I think I got everything I would need
here except I forgot a brow thing and I
mentioned essence and that one I was
kind of like you know I feel like maybe
just recently your essence has launched
quite a few different things so they're
definitely on my radar I feel like I've
talked about them quite a bit I do think
it's like bits and pieces of their line
you know it'll be like this good mascara
over here this really good lip liner but
they now have a foundation and this was
under the new section of Ulta site so I
thought let's try that let's test a new
foundation let's try a brand that some
people feel is overlooked and we'll lump
it all into one also speaking of essence
it's not gonna be in this video but they
have a new kind of customized palette
thing that I think I'm gonna get into in
another video soon but anyway this is
fresh and fit awake makeup it says
healthy glow with vitamin complex and
cranberry water I have it in 20 fresh
nude they talked about having a
breathable texture with wakeup effect I
need some wakeup effect today medium to
high coverage without mask effect we
want the wakeup effect we don't want the
mask effect and this really is packaged
nicely it has a glass bottle little cap
here I can't remember
actly what I paid for it but I'm about
certain it was less than $10 so we're
gonna pump out some a full pump I
realized this yesterday when I was using
it a full pump of this gives you quite a
lot like way too much so you might go
for like half a pump I'm gonna just
start blending this in roughly I like to
patch it on first somebody asked me why
don't you just put that on your hand and
pick it up with your Beautyblender from
your hand and kind of use your hand as a
pallet but I always feel like my hand
absorbs some product that way so here I
can get it straight to my face and I
know that it's kind of getting right
where it needs to go this is my NYX
sponge that I talk about often I'm just
gonna pop this into my skin or bounce it
in is what I usually say yesterday I
used to brush with this I thought a
brush did fine I just kind of wanted to
see if there was a notable difference
it's just a really natural looking
foundation I wouldn't say it's anywhere
close to high coverage like they call it
they say medium to high coverage I would
say maybe I can get a medium out of this
when I build it a little bit now I've
been really making a point to moisturize
well under my makeup and I think it
makes a difference for just the
appearance of fine lines when you're
teetering on the edge with with real
fine lines like I'm not talking deep
deep wrinkles but evidence of
dehydration on the skin basically I feel
like you can do a lot for that under
your makeup with really good pre makeup
hydration so what I'm getting at here
was the other day when I was wearing
this I knew my skin was really hydrated
it almost felt kind of supple to the
touch I expected to look up close to
this foundation and see some major wear
as a result of that but actually it
looked very nice it looked very even I
didn't even see it wearing off of my
nose and nothing looked patchy or oily
but the coverage is really really light
in my opinion like I just put that on
and I feel like I'm getting the result
of maybe a tinted moisturizer so I'm
gonna add a little more and maybe it's
that I'm getting even lighter coverage
than I got yesterday because I'm using a
sponge instead of a brush but I want to
hit kind of like my redness and darkness
trouble spots here a little harder
and just see how it goes
I said what shade I have in this fresh
excuse me fresh nude
it's an all right foundation for me guys
it's not moving mountains but it's
definitely not the worst thing I've
tried either for a concealer I got
something from the Ulta beauty brand
this did not come out of that little box
by the way this is the full coverage
liquid concealer waterproof I got it in
light cool don't you kind of feel like
every brands trying to bust out their
best like liquid IDO foot concealer you
know kind of competing with shape tape
so I thought we'll see how this goes I'm
gonna really attempt to hit that inner
corner darkness here I'll blend that out
and then we'll try to get some other
areas of the face lending it out just
with a brush yesterday I thought the end
result looked a little heavy but the
Beauty Blender is actually looking
pretty good
only trouble is the coverage like I'm
really seeing it in person I can see a
lot and you can probably see that too
yeah a lot of darkness still there so
I'm gonna need to build just a little
more and I want to go too far here we
may just have to take what we get but
I'm just gonna see if I can get a little
more out of this a little better
slightly
so as you can see two layers of the
product and I can still see some
darkness through it now I granted I
realized that's not a corrector but if
it was anywhere close to the coverage
shaped it gives that wouldn't be their
shape tape really gives me pretty good
coverage so I don't know maybe that's
not the best concealer that Ulta has
maybe they have something else that's
better but that one's not really working
for me I have a pretty little powder
here
from Pacifica their packaging is so cute
and this is called the mineral
neutralizing mattifier with cherry and
minerals 100% vegan cruelty free I have
shade one in this it has a pretty soft
texture to it I thought it could just be
a nice little setting powder so I'm
gonna use it with my ELF small tapered
brush and I'm gonna just gently gently
set that under-eye area there
and also set the t-zone which maybe I
could credit this powder with some of
the staying power ooh I forgot to get
that zit down there with my concealer
oops rewind sorry
now you guys said you wanted to see more
from soap &amp;amp; Glory so I have a little
compact here it's called the mighty
contour and my shade is fair's fair and
it's just really small like it's not
even as big as a typical powder compact
you've got cream bronzer right here on
top and then underneath there's this
little like highlighter and then also a
blush now the highlight is more it's got
a slight yellow tone to it and it's just
kind of like a cream brightener it's not
like a shimmery highlight so I'm gonna
do what this is take my synthetic brush
this one's from Tarte and I'm gonna work
this kind of as a contour I really liked
the way this applied the other day cream
products like this can be so so touchy
it needs to blend easily on the skin
with just light pressure you know this
really is very easy to use the color of
it isn't like especially cool though so
if you really rely on a borderline gray
looking pool tone contour this might not
do it for you and this is the fair
option that I got
see I think that gets a very very
natural effect and there's no like
shimmer in the cream either the next I'm
going to go to this blush here it's kind
of a nice corally pink dip into that
with my ELF small stipple brush see how
that blends in very nicely as well
playing very light pressure super fresh
I mean I tell you if you're struggling
with your concealer some day you just
don't feel like you got yours it covered
up effectively or whatever you pop some
blush on it can really make you at least
feel better about things beautiful tone
and like I said I'm not really gonna use
that highlight today I think when I was
more in the coverage phases of the look
that might have helped or maybe I don't
know we could just see like just put a
little bit there
not too bad I mean like I said it would
have been most effective I think if I
put it on right after the concealer but
for a highlight I grabbed this out of
the meet our faves box that from the
uLTA Beauty line it's called illuminator
sheer radiant finish and I have this in
the shade pink diamond and when you
swatch it out it does kind of have this
soft peach look that you see in the pan
but kind of a golden sheen or shimmer to
it but it looks like it's gonna be
fairly subtle so I'm gonna go in with my
highlight and glow brush from Mota tap
off a little excess that's down here on
the top of the cheeks can you see that
I think it's looking really nice from a
distance I'm kind of making an effort
not to get too too much on my skin but I
look up close and I was kind of noticing
this the other day that gold Sheen in it
is pretty strong and it's not really
doing great things for any little
texture is you kind of squint your face
up you know little lines you can start
to see right in here it's not doing
great things for that area looking a
little more metallic than you might
think
one last powder type thing here that I
need to put on because I need you guys
to see what's happening here this is
from japonesque it's the ku Midori
luminescent finishing powder okay
luminescent was in the name I I assumed
there was gonna be some luminosity to
this and I thought I can just use this
it's a little light finishing touch
after my look it's a really nice
container here nice lid with a mirror
and then here's your sifter as I
immediately look at the sifter I can see
the little sparkle it feels like one of
those really silky like you know Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD type powders except
within it is a little bit of sparkle
gave this its first shot yesterday I
thought oh dear I think this is a bit
much I'm gonna try it today I'm gonna
try it with a softer hand and we'll just
see how it goes I've got this little
brush from Sephora it's called the pro
mini flawless light powder brush and
it's so cute it's got a nice little
shape there so I'm gonna dip in tap off
the excess till the cows come home and
then I'm just gonna lightly graze this
across the skin you see any additional
Sheen coming off of that you know on top
of what we had there from the highlight
I can see it okay let's get a little bit
more for the other side just kind of
graze it across
honestly you guys I don't think this is
as bad as I thought it was I think I
just tried to like Glahn it on a bit
much the other day but actually looks
kind of pretty here's the kicker on this
powder this was $32 and for just for a
little light sheen on the skin it's not
really like knocking my socks off here
and I do know that I can get a nice
little finishing touch Sheen from
something like my Milani prep set and
glow powder which is a nice little
pressed powder this is kind of messy it
kind of is so lightweight like you just
tap into it stuffs going everywhere I
just don't think it's worth that price
we've had some hits and misses here
today have we not and how we're gonna
move on to the happy essence I need some
happy essence right now it's the hydro
mist refresh and fight the look of
fatigue has coconut water green tea and
very happy extract is that really a
thing Pacifica okay it's for all skin
types it's 100% vegan cruelty-free again
Pacifica came up many times when I was
asking for overlook brands certificate
also makes this and a couple of lip
balms oh that I need to pop on here in a
second also says you can spray on a
foundation brush or a sponge to use with
foundation for extra moisture it says to
shake it up and this does have I think a
very nice scent to it like yeah that'll
make me happy I like that am i happier
now than when I first put this on my
skin is certainly starting to look a
little more refreshed I think this is
one of those sprays that really adds the
look of moisture immediately you know
how urban decay all nighter or D slick
they're more of like yeah they set
things that they don't really give your
skin that dewy look I'm seeing some dewy
look here I'm kind of familiarizing
myself with the sprayer because it sort
of goes a little higher than you might
think I'm kind of trying to hit that
under eye area damp Beauty Blender my DK
come on Durai just a little bit too here
we go I'll give a couple spritzes to the
beauty blender go to town Beauty Blender
yeah that helped a lot
I mentioned a couple of lip balms from
Pacifica and how cute are these let me
zoom Union and these lip balm smell so
good they're so nice this greenish one
is Hawaiian banana and then I got
rainbow watermelon mmm I think I'm gonna
do one on one lip one on the other
because I'm just I'm just wild and crazy
like that
banana right there nice scent nice
sweetness to it but not overly sweet and
then the watermelon I think the
watermelon might be my fave mmm but you
mush them together nice kind of lip
primer texture to that you know it's not
too slick it's not as slippery as a lip
smacker or some other balm she might
have tried and I feel like they're
really trying Pacifica is with the
packaging like everything that I have
that I got from this brand is so cute
and I have another thing from this line
it's kind of like a multi palette I
actually thought I would throw this into
my look now this is a rediscovered thing
from my collection and I remember
talking about it quite a while back when
I was mentioning all in one like
multitasking palettes but this is the
Pacifica natural minerals it's called
the solar complete color palette you've
got like kind of a rusty colored blush a
bronzer there's some creamy highlights
up top and some eye shadows and I
thought those shadows might be fun to
use in my look today because I recall
really really enjoying their texture so
as I mentioned I don't have a brow
product so I'm going to do my brows put
on some eye primer as well and then
we'll jump into that palette now we're
ready for the eyes and something to note
about all of these shadows is that they
do all have some element of shimmer to
them so that doesn't mean you can't use
them like in your crease where I'm going
to put this bronzy color but it's just
something something to be aware of if
you really enjoy matte shades these all
have a little bit of shimmer but when
you sheer them out it's not necessarily
a pronounced thing like look what's
happening in my crease here with that
bronze
the important thing I think that can
either make shadows like this work or
not work in in the manner I'm using them
is texture you know if it's gonna be
something that is just flat out gonna
only really look good if it's applied in
a very hacked on you know build it up to
a full-on metallic look if that's the
only way it's gonna look good then
they're not quite as versatile but this
kind of color the texture is really nice
it can look kind of deeper in the crease
it can be sheared out sort of around the
crease and you might not even know that
that was a shimmery shade that I just
put there I mean you look up really
closely you can see a little bit of
shimmer it's not super pronounced then I
will use this light color this is super
pretty right up here is a highlight
there's a little pink in this shade and
then I think I want to do some peach on
my lid you'll notice there's a nice
softness to these shadows you do want to
tap off some excess I think when you're
working with it
but that being said they build up easily
with very little effort
and I think I'll go back to the light
pillar right here there's that little
bit of pink in this color is very
eye-opening I'm going to do a touch of
the dark brown just in my outer corner
here just so you can get an idea of what
kind of look you would get out of this
see what I just put here in the outer
corner was done with very little product
on my brush so this dark shade
definitely has some potential and I
think it's less shimmery actually than
some of the others like once it sheers a
little bit on your skin you see very
little pearlescent quality to this color
I am gonna do a little light liner on my
lower inner rim my wet and wild ultimate
brow highlight great for that not a new
product but this works great there
and yes I'm gonna use some of that blue
why not
it's kind of a blue with a little golden
sheen to it it's a gentle color though
like can you see that it's soft we're
gonna just get this all up here on the
lower lash line would probably make more
of a statement if you patted it all over
your lid but I'm just going for a small
bit of color today
if you've never tried Pacifica
eyeshadows before I think my bottom line
coming away from this is that you will
probably be pretty surprised at the
quality there's a nice softness to them
they're easy to work with they blend one
into the next very easily and even if
you end up with some shimmery shades
they're not so like off the wall or you
know have some funky texture to them to
where they couldn't be sheared out in
your crease because they definitely can
now I got a new black liquid liner guys
it's from essence and it's called the
super last eyeliner in matte black I've
already used this and I do have
complaints I'm sorry to say that while
this looked really good after
application I am one who you know I
definitely start my liquid liner way way
in here and midway through the day the
last time I wore this and it wasn't an
emotional day it wasn't crying or
anything but just regular wear it
transferred down here onto my lower lash
line like in that inner corner onto my
lower lash line visibly like it looked
like something was wrong with the look
you know so that's kind of upsetting
this is not gonna be something that I
will wear like day to day also I thought
it had a brush but it has a long felt
tip it's still pretty easy to apply but
you know I'm truly just putting this on
for the sake of this video cuz anything
that's gonna transfer down onto my lower
lash line for my upper lash line is just
a no-go for me but the intensity is
fabulous look at how black that is and
it really is matte
yes that was more of a wing than any of
us were expecting it's juic okay it's a
brand-new liner
taking a little more dark brown also
this is I always think this helps my
wing kind of blend in with the full look
the mascara I'm gonna put on is the
maximum lashes defining and lengthening
mascara from Ulta so this came out of
that box and the brush is so incredibly
spikey like see what I mean there's a
lot of length coming off of the wand
there in terms of the bristles
but this did give me some surprising
definition and length like I was really
kind of shocked it just takes a little
getting used to because the brush is
kind of big and those bristles come out
so far but they do kind of function to
comb through things rather nicely
like there I just poke myself in the eye
see it's pretty good length it's just
kind of bungle some to use you know it's
kind of a pain in the butt but in the
end you still do kind of like it and
this war well on me too like yesterday
it didn't flake off I don't know if I'm
ready to put it on my lower lashes in
fact I think it would be kind of hard
because of the just the size of the
brush I'm used to something so compact
that clump crusher water-resistant brush
is so small for me I don't think it's
gonna replace lash paradise that I love
on my upper lashes but I don't think
it's a dud
it just takes a little getting used to
on my lower lashes by the way I'm going
to put on some of the clump crusher I
was mentioning got a fresh tube of this
it makes that blueish shadow look even
prettier to have just a little fan of
lashes in front of it now I got some
lashes when I made these purchases from
Ulta I got some of the new kiss blowout
lashes not really because I thought they
were especially overlooked at Ulta but
just cuz I wanted to try them and so
this is what that style looks like
they're pretty fluffy and very long left
to right I've worn them once before and
had to trim them down quite a bit but
I'm gonna pop those on and then we'll
play with some different lip products
there's the finished eye look with the
lashes very fluttery and nice and full
and now I've got several different lip
products to try here there was a gloss
that came in the Ulta box I also got two
different glosses from essence two lip
liners from essence and a lip plumper
from soap &amp;amp; Glory the sexy mother pucker
one now I was told in my lip gloss video
that I needed to try that and for this
video I was also told to try that one I
think y'all just want to hear me say
sexy about the putco so we're just gonna
try on a few of these shall we I'm gonna
use the uLTA Beauty shiny sheer lip
gloss first so this was in that meet our
fave set and this color is called blush
and it has a little bit of shimmer to it
like maybe a little blue tone shimmer
and the applicator is teensy it's a
teeny tiny little brush so we're gonna
put it on it feels pretty thin smells
kind of like I don't know candy cotton
candy it's odd how small this brush tip
is it's nice and comfortable but as you
can see it's completely sheer like there
is no real color to this as it's sitting
on my lips a little bit more it's
feeling less than
and kind of moisturizing like I don't
hate that gloss hold on
am I getting a little just a little hint
of a tingle off of this I think I am
that's a lot I don't know if that's
irritation cuz this did not claim to be
a plumper it's just doing a little
something there now I'm confused we're
gonna take this one off let's try the
sexy mother pepper you sexy mother
pucker or mother sexy mother pucker who
else here this is in the shade rose and
shine and it seems just like a creamy
color they're like no shimmer and when I
put this on the other day I thought man
I wish it was more opaque are there any
shades in this line that are really like
full colored glosses cuz look at how
sheer like there's just a little bit of
milky color to this but not much texture
of it feels really good though nice bit
of thickness the scent oh man does that
remind me of the scent I've smelled
before reminds me of the smell of a like
a plasticy toy cherry Mary muffin or
something like that there were dolls
that like flipped over and they look
like cupcakes like they would transform
their dress into a cupcake or down like
a dress they had a scent a very
artificial kind of sweet scent and
that's sort of what I'm giving this
that's a weirdest description ever I'm
waiting for the tingle there's almost
like a buzz type of feel that comes off
of this one it's not like the buxom
glosses where they just had this cooling
feeling this just slowly and it's
totally coming on me now it's it feels
like it's coming from within the lips
outward are they plumping are they
getting plumper they might be they're
tingling
you feel surprised to look at your lips
in the mirror and see like are my are my
lips standing still right now because
there's all kinds of activity going on
in there for what I can feel is it
plumping I don't know it might be
plumping a little bit and I take it off
for now so we can try on some other
things and it's often it's still
tingling I got a couple lip liners here
from essence they are the soft
contouring lip liner I mean they're
basically just standard lip pencils I
don't know if the lip contour thing is
just kind of a trend but this softer
colored one is called big proposal and
then I have going steady and I thought
these looked beautiful beautiful colors
to wear I'm just going to go ahead and
fill in basically all over with the big
proposal shade
see isn't that just a pretty color all
over the lips just in general and then
I'm going to take going steady it's a
little bit deeper berry and kind of just
go outside inward a little bit with that
I like those lip pencils a lot even with
nothing else at it and you know what I
think that sexy mother pucker actually
did um plump my lips because going over
them now they seem different they just
they seem a little fuller than usual and
then I got these two products from
essence one is the shine shine shine wet
look lip gloss this is just a standard
gloss like it applies with you know a
little bit of thickness a lot of shine
it's a really nice natural color the
color anus the colorless the color is
called happiness in a bottle and so that
one's good this one called water kiss
glossy lip color this I'm a like in a
lighter shade I have this in aquatic
chic and this is interesting because
it's so thin like you honestly feel like
you're putting on like a super thin
watery liquid lipstick but it never sets
so it's meant to have that shine and
that kind of move ability of a gloss but
being as dark and plumy as it is I'm
kind of uncomfortable wearing a shade
that feels so thin and liquidy you know
on my lips like that so maybe in a
lighter color that might work for me but
for now I think I'm going to take the
shine shine shine and I'll just put this
on top these liners this smells really
good to just kind of lightly sweet
and this color by the way is pretty
opaque even like put not putting it over
lip liners you wouldn't have to do that
to develop this color I feel like I got
one little end of my lash that's sort of
spiking out but I promise it's all laid
down on my lash line there so guys what
do you think about the overall look I
mean did we try some hits and misses
today or what I mean I definitely tried
some things that I did not think we're
worth it
I tried some new things that I really
really loved I just want to go back
through and discuss a little bit and
show you what else was in this Ulta
beauty box in case you're interested it
was 1999 and they also have a clay mask
a detoxifying charcoal mask there and
underneath that there's a little coupon
here for five dollars off any uLTA
Beauty Collection purchase of $20 or
more I have tried and enjoyed so many
uLTA Beauty masks so I'm excited to try
that I think that's great to have in
there there's a sweet grapefruit back
fist which I've obviously not yet used
you saw the mascara at the gloss the
highlight there's a little individual
shadow which I was playing with
yesterday it's in the shade whatevs and
it feels really nice a very creamy
shimmery highlight would be great to
just pair in with any palette where you
felt like it was lacking that sort of a
shade it's really a nice texture and
they give you a travel size coconut
cream moisturizing body lotion fun fact
I actually already have the full size of
this in that scent coconut cream I have
the body spray - I heard Malley talking
about it like a long time ago it's a
great coconut scent just a nice kind of
lightweight body lotion you know it's
not thick as a body butter but it smells
awesome I love using it in spring or
summer and it's nice to have a small
size of that but all in all I feel like
this collection of Ulta thinks was
pretty darn good the other Ulta thing
was the full coverage concealer that was
a no-go for me like it's just not enough
coverage basically and even building it
up I just wasn't that happy with it the
foundation the essence fresh and fit
just okay for me dog like I want a
little more coverage and if it's not
gonna give me that coverage I want it to
look like just beautifully radiant or
something like that and even though this
wears well I'm just not a big fan huge
miss for me was the essence super last
eyeliner
but I did like the lipliners these soft
contouring lip liners were very pretty
shades the shine shine shine gloss is
what I ended up putting on top the water
kiss again very unusual texture for
something that's just a gloss because it
kind of feels liquid lipstick II this
japonesque powder the KU Midori
luminescent powder was just like okay
but not worth the $32 stuff in glory
stuff the mighty contour a really cute
compact design here I thought it was a
very effective like trio of cream
products I don't have as much experience
with the little highlighter in here but
the blush was really nice and so is the
bronzer contour shade with the lip
plumper the sexy mother pucker I just
wish there was more color to it like I'd
like to know if there are any shades in
this line that are more opaque because I
do like what it did for the lips and I
found the tingle to be interesting it
was intense it wasn't painful you know
what I'm saying but in my opinion I
think the big winner of this look was
Pacifica I mean the biggest surprises
here I felt like the happy essence this
is totally gonna be in my rotation of
like setting sprays refreshing mists I
think that's great I love their lip
balms the banana and the watermelon they
make a really nice mattifying powder
here that wears very well you know have
some powders you feel like just kind of
cling on to your foundation and there's
sometimes kind of a chunkiness to the
wear down you know this I think helped
things we're very evenly and this all in
one palette that was kind of
rediscovered from my collection in fact
I'm gonna take some of that blush I'm
just gonna add a little bit of that into
my look today cuz that's the kind of
color I just love a little bit of bronze
a little bit of rust in that shade so
pretty but anyway thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you enjoyed this if
you'd like to see more of this kind of
video or you have any requests for a
future video like this let me know um it
might be fun to do this kind of thing
with brands at Sephora I don't know
maybe Target really any retailer that is
selling brands that you feel like are
just somewhat unknown I want to know
about them I want to talk about them
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
