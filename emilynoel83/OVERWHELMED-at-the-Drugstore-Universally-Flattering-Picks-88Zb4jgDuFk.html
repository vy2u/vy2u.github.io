this video I wanted to address something
that comes up a lot on my channel people
who I have never met I've never seen
your skin type I don't know your whole
story but I get asked for a product
recommendation here they're a specific
item maybe it's a foundation a lip
product blush and you want it to be from
the drugstore and I try to give you my
best suggestion so I thought what about
doing a video where I cram all those
suggestions basically just into one
place because I know the drugstore can
be overwhelming I feel like new products
are launching faster than ever before
and that goes for high-end as well and
well I think a lot of people who are
here at my channel watching videos are
pretty makeup obsessed and really into
this stuff you have a lot of makeup
there are so many people who arrive here
and they're just starting out like I
hear that story a lot and they just
don't know where to begin so if you've
got a friend who's kind of in that boat
definitely refer them to this video and
have them subscribe and thank you for
subscribing as well in this video I will
be running down a list of ten products
that I would put under the universally
flattering category I've been thinking
about this now for the last one and a
half two weeks trying to come up with
some things that I think really anybody
could pick up and have good luck with a
good gauge of this as I think about
things that work well on me but have or
would also work well on my mom you know
she's used a lot of products that I've
recommended to she's 70 had different
kinds of skin concerns and staying power
concerns so I'm going to be sharing with
you ten great products it's not
necessarily every single product to do a
full face and I'll probably kind of
explain why as I go I think it's really
hard for certain things to be
universally workable and sometimes I get
going on these video ideas and I don't
want it to become a thing where I'm just
coming up with a recommendation just for
the sake of recommending it I just want
these to be like the handful of things
that I just know to be really really
good right so enough with the intro
let's just jump in I do have a
foundation that I feel comfortable
recommending and calling it like across
the board a good pick I truly think this
could work on any skin type the one
downfall of this line would be the shade
range particularly where the darker
and tones are concerned that's the one
issue you're going to run into with this
if you are a darker skin tone but it's
the Rimmel lasting finish foundation
guys this has been a great foundation
from the start of my channel that was
years and years ago I wear this in the
shade soft beige there's nothing really
gimmicky about it I mean it's just a
liquid foundation it feels pretty
typical in terms of the consistency it's
not too like thin and watery but it's
not ultra thick and mousse like either
used to be in a squeezy tube which I
actually preferred but I am wearing this
today I wear this a lot and it's just
kind of one of those foundations you
keep coming back to how my mom was more
mature skin she is also used and enjoyed
this she's also a fan of the cosmetics
CC cream as well this does contain SPF
20 I like applying it with either a
brush or a Beauty Blender I think it
really looks beautiful either way and
what's so interesting to me about this
foundation is its work for my skin as
its evolved for different skin types if
you were with me like right when my
channel started I was definitely a combo
to oily type skin type and this was
really my go-to it works so well it got
me through like long days at work at the
TV station and stuff out in the elements
it's still really wore well and it
looked good on camera I've had times
where I've gone through dry patchiness
on my skin and this still even looked
good and almost managed to conceal or
balance those areas a little bit more
which was really strange but it worked
and for now I would say most of the time
over the past couple years I've been a
pretty normal skin type and this is just
fine for me too and I find myself
looking up close at my skin right after
I put it on and I think yes this looks
so good looks so natural this is one of
the cheapest foundations in the
drugstore it's not going to get you up
to that $10 mark you know but above all
it lasts I mean this kind of reminds me
of the look that that new covergirl
elixir foundation is giving me right
after application you know it looks kind
of fresh it's not exaggerating any of
the bad stuff and it's not looking too
makeup II and I love those foundations
for that but this one can wear all day
on me that's the difference so this is
my plea to Rimmel please put out more
shades of this product because you've
got a fantastic formula and maybe if you
couldn't even find your perfect shade
you could do a little mixing
Foundation cocktail type deal and create
a shape that would be really good for
you I don't know but if you can find
your shade this is a really great
foundation another thing that I think
really anybody could pick up and use and
have great success with is the
maybelline instant age rewind eraser
product here and the reason why this
stands out to me so much is it's kind of
like my gold standard of drugstore all
over the face type concealers and it
says eraser for dark circles on here but
I can use it anywhere on my face it
comes in a range of skin tone shades and
then there's a brightener color and
there's also this shade that I've been
using most late Lance called neutralizer
and as you can see I've used about a
little over half of it and it's a really
great shade on me for this whole area
down the nose it really seems to do a
good job on dark circles and what's so
special about this is it manages to be a
really thin consistency but still good
coverage so many drugstore concealers it
seems like they thin out to nothing and
it's like okay this really does have
good coverage I don't think it gets
clingy to areas where there's a lot of
texture it's totally the type of thing I
feel like I could give to Mom and say
here you want a good concealer try this
cuz I'm not sure that she's tried this
one now a powder the kind of powder I
feel like I could recommend to anyone is
definitely L'Oreal True Match I'm
holding this here in the shade buff
beige wearing us today as with all of
these products and this is one of the
best
I think drugstore powder textures
another texture that I think is really
good from the drugstore is the Revlon
nearly naked but that comes in like only
three shades so definitely a better
shade range here here's what you do grab
a L'Oreal true match foundation and mix
it with some of this because that's a
decent formula as well if you need a
darker shade try that see how it goes
but this powder is so velvety and soft
it makes a really nice touch-up powder
or today for this look it's just my
all-over setting powder this has been
one of those things again for years I've
been using this and enjoying it and
frankly sometimes I feel like I apply
too much of it and it still saves me
because it doesn't look like too much
really at any point so I love that stuff
let's talk universally flattering blush
I went back and forth on this one quite
a bit but
the more I kind of wear and test this
one the more I think this is the one and
it's the Milani blush and romantic rose
hair is just floating behind my face now
this line of blushes as a whole is very
like top-notch quality we're talking
matte blushes but they don't look like
overly dry on the skin they're just
nicely pigmented rich blushes if you're
a rich or skin tone and you need
something brighter or more vibrant they
do have other shades but this romantic
rose I really do feel could suit most
people and I'm wearing that today I just
think it's just about perfect you know
it's that rosy flush it can work with
any kind of lip color I wouldn't feel
funny about wearing a red lip with this
on my cheeks I wouldn't feel funny about
this more nudey pink lip that I've got
today and it's that not gorgeous I mean
who doesn't want to look at that and pop
that compact open every time Milani has
made some standout blushes in the past
and this continue to do so with these
rose ones so snatch one of those of a
universally flattering highlight I've
talked about this one in the past too
it's the essence pure nude highlighter
the shade is B mine highlight 0-1 and it
looks
I think borderline golden you see when
it's not in direct light it looks like
maybe is that 2d but what's special
about this is with the application from
a brush when it gets sheared out on the
skin it looks like just a transparent
glow across your skin you know what I
mean I don't see a thickness of gold any
color I just see this really natural
looking glow on the skin and yes I would
even recommend this to my mom who is
definitely not trying to exaggerate any
sort of lines on her skin but certain
places you know you pop a little bit
right out here on the fullest part of
your cheek and I don't care what skin
type you are that's going to look
radiant it's going to look really nice
on top of a matte blush just could make
it pretty glowy just quick swipe it on
as eye shadow type thing too it's
buildable so you can add a little more
if you want a stronger type of glow but
it can also be very very light and just
like I said keep in mind when you apply
this in its lightest sense I don't think
it shows up as color it just shows up as
this wonderful little bit of a slightly
do a sheen on the skin going into some
ice stuff what's the first thing I'm
going to recommend anyone anyone who's
got the answer out there this Milani
eyeshadow primer
everybody needs to be using an eyeshadow
primer you don't need to be spending 25
30 bucks on one just get this one from
the drugstore I've gone through I'm not
sure how many tubes of this but yet I
don't go through it super fast because I
only use a little bitty amount like one
small bit between two eyes okay
rub between your fingers tap it all over
the lid through the crease up to the
eyebrow and what that's going to do is
allow your powder shadows to be more
intense because they've got that little
teeny bit of tackiness to cling to
that's the fine line that some primers
walk is because some will be too tacky
and then you just end up with a creasing
mess this allows those shadows to adhere
last better throughout the day but also
seem more intense so your cheaper
shadows that just look like nothing when
you didn't have a primer first they will
actually show on top of this there's a
reason why I give this things such high
praise all the time it was a major
player in the Emily awards this past
year it is just one of those standout
basics that everyone needs
now eyeshadow is there a universally
workable eyeshadow for everyone from the
drugstore I do think there's something
you can grab that everybody would be
impressed with quality wise and the
tones would be workable for everyone so
I think I found it and it's the Milani
must-have Naturals everyday eyes palette
these palettes are really great are
definitely plenty of other shade options
and I know some people prefer to go warm
but this very neutral color palette is
something I think everybody can use and
look good in and talking for any
occasion you want a smokey eye it's in
here you want everyday look for work
that's Matt that's in here you want
something with just a little bit of a
fun shimmery pop on the lid you can do
that with this palette seriously these
are so good and for the size of this
palette it's so small and yet you're
getting a fully matte black and a matte
brown so those are two great like
standard things to have that could be
your eyeliner you know this could be
your smudgy liner to this Matt kind of
transitioning shade these two are
shimmers right here so kind of some
accent colors and this one with just a
little hint of peach in it and so I am
wearing that palette today I've got this
color on my lid a mix of these two in
the crease so I like to kind of
a band dad right between those two and
it's my perfect brownish crease color
this shade is my highlight and then I've
got a lot of this brown like just
smudged on the lower lash line giving me
that nice kind of smoky effect so good
great quality and just workable for any
circumstance mascara is one thing I've
learned in all these years on YouTube is
that you're never going to please
everybody with your mascara pick you
know you might find something that a lot
of people like but there's always that
group of people that it's just not going
to work for and that's not about someone
trying to be difficult and they say it
or anything like that it's that we all
have different hair for our eyelashes
you know some people have curly some
people have straight some point down
some point ups and that brunette lashes
and that blonde lashes we've all got a
really specific and different need I
think for our lashes you know how I feel
about covergirl super sizer that for me
works really well I love the length I
love the application but it's not
everyone's favorite what I am going to
throw out here for you though is if you
need something that's waterproof you
want the covergirl clump crusher water
resistant this would be the universally
flattering option for that specific
purpose and I use it pretty much daily
on the lower lashes but if it's a really
important event and I suspect there may
be tears I'll wear this all over there's
not a bride who I've put this on who has
had mascara smudges I've worn this
through funerals I've worn this through
childbirth it does not go anywhere until
you take it off and even then it's not a
huge pain in the rear to take off so
yeah maybe for your day to day mascara
what's going to work best on those upper
lashes we all have a different idea of
what's great for that but I do think if
you need a waterproof mascara this is
the bomb and an important detail about
this not only does it last but it's very
easy to apply that brush is definitely
not too big it doesn't have super huge
long obnoxious bristles so you can
really get in there close to your lash
line and not be scared about like that
dreaded you know tapping the mascara
wand on your skin and stuff like that
lips I thought long and hard about
because my mom and I are kind of in two
different worlds on lip products she is
a die-hard fan of the cover
out last type of thing like the liquid
lipstick world that's happening right
now that is my mom's jam because she
does not like a lip product to budge
anywhere and she feels like fine lines
around the lips can start to collect
product and starts to drift outside the
lip line and she always claims that as
you get older you start to lose a nice
strong lip line anyway but the problem
with some of those outlast type products
as we all know they can be drying and
sometimes the way they wear off is not
always flattering so here's my
universally flattering lip pick if you
have not yet done so everybody needs to
try a NYX slide on lip pencil these
things now these are not brand new
I have probably had these over a year at
this point and they still glide on every
bit as buttery creamy smooth as I could
want but they actually set and do not
move outside the lip line I am totally
going to get my mom on board with this
idea because I think you know she could
fill in her lips she could have all of
that precision you know that she wants
for the lip line but I really don't see
these drifting at all because sometimes
I'll see drifting if a product is going
to be prone to doing that I can see that
on my own lips too these never do that
even in the deepest richest colors in
this line but if we're talking
universally flattering I think nude
suede shoes if you really like light
soft neutral lips this is beautiful or
if you want a soft pink I think bedros
is the best pick and these are going to
be the kind of pencils that you sharpen
they're not retractable and I am wearing
a mix of these two on my lips today the
majority of the colors that you see on
my lips right now is coming from a combo
of these two if you want to just put
these on and wear them alone you will
have a pretty like matte lip look your
lips won't feel overly dry but they will
stay in place for sure and they won't be
peeling off in that kind of like
separate layer of product coming off
your lips the way some liquid lipsticks
do but when I'm also wearing on my lips
and what is also I think a universally
flattering recommendation here in this
video is that Neutrogena revitalizing
foot balm I talked about this in my last
haul this kind of a rediscovered item
that I went out and bought again it has
the SPF 20 sunscreen in here and you
might be saying well why is this and not
one of those you know jumbo lip pencils
that Neutrogena puts out the moisture
smooth color sticks you know I love
those but
and I come back to thinking what about
people of a certain age who have a lot
of trouble with drifting outside the
lips that might be even too creamy
especially if you get into some of the
really colorful shades but these bombs
you know they're not too much color wise
so if you just wanted a slight tint of
something on your lips that's kind of
what these give you but you see what I'm
saying here because they're not too rich
and intense I think anybody of any lip
type could wear them so I've got the
soft caramel and that's what I put on
top of those lip liners so what I end up
with is a really comfortable feel this
is such a comfortable lip balm to have
on it's not too thin not too thick and
does it not make the most beautiful nude
with a hint of pink I'm telling you
you've got to try those lip balms and
put them on top of a great lip liner and
I think you'll have a really
long-lasting but good feeling look I
think that's the gist the cocktail for a
great lip color right there so that's it
my friends for ten products that just
happened to be ten universally
flattering products I think anybody
could pick up from the drugstore and
have great success with again I thought
about this list a lot but I didn't want
to really think it out to the point that
I was recommending thanks to you that I
was like trying to come up and dig up
something I wanted it to be like
naturally great products again with the
mascara you might like super sizer the
way I do you might have to do a little
more digging and trial and error to
really come up with a great mascara that
you love same deal with eyeliner like I
love my Jordana color Envy and black
envy it's a great waterproof black
liquid liner but there are some people
out there who say I never want to use
liquid liner so there's the creams and
then there's the pencils and then it's
there enough color selection so I just
wasn't really settling in on something
that I wanted to recommend there and
kind of the same deal with brows also so
many brow needs you know dealing with
those brow hairs some people are
starting from nothing some people have a
big brow they just need to fill in a bit
none of these things you've heard my
recommendations on in the past but for
to really hone in on something that's
going to work specifically for you there
might be some trial and error involved
but hopefully this video can take away
for the most part a lot of that trial
and error for you so thank you so much
for tuning in and I will see you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
