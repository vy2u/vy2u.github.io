with this video I'm really excited to
share it with you this is going to be
like a whole review tutorial all rolled
into one on a few different products
from benefit what sparked us all were
some questions about an older product in
the line that I had never picked up
called dr. feelgood so I'll explain more
on that as video goes along but as I was
browsing ulties website to pick that up
because it's not sold in my local store
I was stumbling across all these other
kind of older products from benefits
line that I feel like I've missed out on
over time you know I think is the
YouTube beauty world got all started up
we tend to be really on top of the new
things that come out but sometimes you
missed those like older classic products
from certain lines so don't be surprised
if you see me start doing more videos
like because I think it's really
compelling to learn more about some of
those classic products that certain
brands probably like built themselves as
far as benefit is concerned I'm pretty
sure one of their first products if not
the first was Benetint and I've talked
about these before on my blog I've
reviewed the different tints and beams I
really like them but that's not in this
video because I had already tried that
let's just jump in and I'll tell you
about what I got how it's been working
for me and show you some little demos
too but one of the things I decided to
check out was this little duo of the
benefit buying it concealer and also the
eye bright I think those are two
products that have been around in this
line for quite some time I tried the
Boyne concealer I think in some other
face kit quite a while ago and I kind of
wanted to refresh my memory on them in a
little box like this the boying is in
shade 0-2 so keep that in mind I don't
think there were any other options on
that and then the eye bright is like a
really light pinky colored cream and if
it actually has some really good
concealers in their line I am a huge fan
of the erase paste I've talked about
that a lot I love the salmony tone it
works really well for correcting the
melasma that I have kind of on top of my
cheekbones slash under eye area and
paracin the Boyne concealer is a much
much drier consistence well I think it
has really good coverage it's not really
my favorite thing to get up or
lines and creases that I may have around
my eye area today first off I had put on
kind of a you know medium coverage type
foundation it was the l'oreal visible
lift blur so that's what I had on my
face first and then when I go to start
applying this I just used my finger to
kind of warm up this concealer a bit
break it down a little bit on my skin as
I patted it as far as the melasma that
you can still see you know it did a
pretty good job of covering that up
actually like I said just not my most
favorite texture didn't do quite as well
coverage wise as the array space does
but still pretty good and did a fine job
around other areas of my skin like my
nose where I wanted to conceal some
redness it was great then then for the
eye bright I feel like this consistency
is very similar to the Boyne concealer
you know it's just a little bit dry
since I was really trying to get into my
little can turns on the inner most parts
of my eyes I used a brush to help me get
it in there just brightened a little bit
around the tear duct I took it up under
my eyebrow as well you know it did okay
there I'm not really complaining about
the finished effect that I got I do
think a lot of brands now are coming out
with more eyebright nning products I
know Milani has a great like double
ended brow highlighter type tool and
it's really easy to use it's really
inexpensive and I think I like it just
as well as something like this my
overall opinion here on this duo and you
know a good coverage concealer not my
favorite concealer from benefit but
definitely something I'll continue to
work in from time to time maybe with
other products the next thing that I
wanted to try that I had actually seen
in action from huda beauty she is
gorgeous check out her channel I will
link below to the video where she
demonstrates using the lemonade and this
product is actually called a color
correcting eyelid primer but the way she
was using it in a video and what got me
really like intrigued and inspired to
want to try it myself she used it kind
of like a highlighting tool on her face
she just dabbed it like right in here
right on the sides of her nose and I
think it served as color correction for
redness but also really like brought
that out area forward highlighted it and
just in contrast to the rest of her skin
it made
area looks so nicely brightens so I
wanted to do the same thing you can see
it is a pale yellow color there's no
shimmer in this it's just a creamy
consistency product it was a little bit
creamier to me than the texture of that
Boing concealer and the eye bright that
I just mentioned but I have used this
for its intended purpose which is as a
color corrective bait it has worked
great in that respect for me you know if
you've got that little bit of redness on
your lids or if you've got some veins
and discoloration on your lids this
really wipes that out quickly this has a
lot of coverage in it actually then like
Hooda said I also padded this basically
on that area on top of my cheeks on the
sides of my nose and kind of patted it
in with my fingers also I find a flat
foundation brush can be kind of handy to
help you blend that in without over
blend you don't want to mess up the
concealer that's underneath it but I
think it gives a really nicely
brightened look and I'm not one who
really loves contouring the sides of my
nose but if I also just put a little bit
of this down my nose a little bit on my
chin it's like even before you've
contoured anything on your face just the
contrast of this with your natural skin
to give such a nice effect and then if
you feel like that's looking too
dramatic for you or I would really
advise this anyway you know just set it
with a light amount of powder go on with
your bronzer your blush that's what I
did to complete the face look and I
really really like the way it came off
so I'm very happy with that lemonade
product and again this is the kind of
thing that I think has been part of
benefits line for a long time but I just
kind of overlooked it you know grabbed
for the newer things you know the latest
releases but this is another total
product success for me from benefits
line it's definitely one of those why
did I wait kind of products because I
know I've seen this like years ago and
it's the big beautiful eyes eye contour
kit really if you glance at this on the
website I don't know that it really
comes off is that spectacular but when
you see it in person and hopefully my
video can do that somewhat justice these
eyeshadows are absolutely a dream to
work with they're all so soft they're
great shades I
like they're super flattering on my eyes
it's just a nice little kid if you don't
really care to have all the options that
like a giant palette gives you you just
want okay what's that quick look no
brainer look that gives me the three
shades I need to throw it together and
go it looks so beautiful every time this
middle shade here is like a rosy taupe
that's the shade that completely won me
over
but the pearly color is great the matte
Brown is just a perfect dark matte Brown
plus you know that crazy Boing concealer
in shade zero two that I mentioned at
the start of the video that's in here is
Wesley in the instructions they just say
use that first and get rid of your under
eye circles and then go on with your
eyelid I'm not super pumped about the
fact that there is concealer right next
to eyeshadows that could create a little
fallout and possibly get into my
concealer I don't love that idea same
assessment of this concealer applies to
as what I said earlier you know kind of
thick good coverage might be a little
drying around the eye area but if you've
wanted to try it you know you could get
it in this kit and try both the eye
shadows and the concealer it does come
with some little applicators that are
usable one that you could use as like a
tiny concealer brush or maybe you know
right around the inner corners of your
eye and then you've got a very soft
brush here that you could use to apply
shadow all over your lid finally a very
stiff liner type brush I would have
preferred that that be cut at an angle
just because I think it's a little
easier to use but you know it's in there
I've been playing with this for a few
weeks now I was wearing it in my best in
beauty video if you were wondering what
was on my eyes then I wanted to show you
in this video my favorite way to use
these shades it's so easy you guys like
really really simple here's what I do I
take that middle shade the rosy taupe
apply that just all over your lid with
like a flat brush then take a fluffier
brush I use my Sigma e25 with that same
shade and get that all up in your crease
and just work it up as high as you feel
comfortable depending on the amount of
space you got between like your eye and
your eyebrows I grab a different fluffy
brush and go into the highlight shade
this is my Sigma e-40 and I use that
right up under the eyebrow also you can
just dab a little bit of that on your
inner most corner for some added
brightness there then the
at Brown love using this with my Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush I pad a little
bit of that in that outermost corner and
then you know maybe go back to a fluffy
brush like the Sigma e25 to add a little
bit to the outer part of the crease just
to deepen things up slide on the lower
lash line I'm smudging some of that dark
brown on the outer core and then
smudging the rest of the way in with
that rosy taupe should finish the look I
do nude liner on the inner rim some
black liquid liner on the upper lash
line do mascara if you want to do false
lashes if you want to but the finished
look I think is just so flattering no
many of us love our large palettes I'm
probably one of the biggest pallet
freaks out there's still these quick
easy no-brainer type trios that just you
know you can count on every time are
great to stumble across so I'm so glad
that that won't work finally the whole
motivation behind this haul to begin
with was the dr. feelgood product this
is another older product and benefits
line and the reason why I was asked
about this was in my colourless makeup
must haves video I had mentioned right
at the tail and how much I liked Mally's
poreless face defender you know it's a
clear product kind of like a solid gel
type consistency you can pat it on your
skin after you've gotten shiny and it's
like it it doesn't give any added weight
tears it doesn't give any appearance of
product on your skin but it just kind of
perfects everything and so after
mentioning that several people asked
have you tried benefits dr. feelgood and
if so how does that compare to Molly's
and the description on this product it
says the silky refiner blended with
vitamin C and E helps to mattify shine
smooth away the appearance of fine lines
so same kind of claims same goal
basically as Mally's product and this
says it's a colorless weightless miracle
worker to use Pat and smooth under or
over makeup with its accompanying sponge
or wear it alone so yes comes in a
little tin I think the packaging is
adorable here's the sponge and then
here's the product so as opposed to
being completely clear this does have
that balm type appearance when I Pat my
finger in it or if I were to swirl my
finger in it I can see the product on my
fingers see that kind of whitish looking
residue that just patting into it gives
you so texture
seems to be a creamier product than
Mally's and then when I rub it between
my fingers it definitely goes to a
totally dry like a classic feel of
something that goes cream to powder you
know what I mean
completely dries out between your
fingertips been using this consistently
at the end of the day to try to see what
kind of effect this has on the shine I
will develop on my t-zone I'll take my
sponge I'll dab into it a little bit and
then just dab it right on my nose or
wherever the issue is always mattifies
it totally delivers on that claim but I
can't help but notice the fact that I
feel like it's removing some makeup from
my skin I don't know if it's that this
is a thicker product as I dab it on it's
like it's not just doing something about
the oil but when I get a good close look
at my nose it's like it takes on a bit
of the patchy appearance and it wasn't
like my makeup was totally broken down
before I started to apply this so yay
for being able to mattify but I don't
love what it does to the overall
appearance of my skin after I use it's
unique about Mally's is that it's such a
thin texture and it is totally clear
like you're able to get the bare minimum
amount of product on your skin and still
get a positive effect from it away the
shine but it does not alter the look of
your makeup one bit with any other
similar product that I've tried I think
the issue is that it's too creamy
there's too much product getting picked
up and then it's not totally looking
flawless on my skin afterwards so
hopefully this video just gave you some
insight on some of these different
products from benefit that aren't
necessarily front and center on YouTube
all the time I just had a lot of fun you
know trying some new things discovering
some new products for myself I think the
biggest hits for me out of these four
things that I talked about
definitely the lemonade really enjoying
that and the big beautiful eyes palette
you know if you'd like to see more
videos like this from other brands and
