thought this would be a really fun video
to do to just kind of round up all of
those little things that I do usually
when I'm shooting a video that you
actually never see in the video little
makeup tricks quick little things I do
some of them without even thinking a lot
of times if it's not you know
specifically relevant to a tutorial I
don't even include it in the video and
then I start thinking hmmm if it's
something that I actually do so
repeatedly maybe it is worth mentioning
first one is tweezing after I put my
moisturizer on sometimes after my primer
goes on I will tweeze the brow area you
know not really to completely alter the
shape of my brows but just to get all
the strays that crop in you know under
the brow and actually right between the
brows that's always growing you'll also
tweeze the upper lip area as well so
that is a daily daily thing lip
exfoliating this is something I know I
have referenced in different lip type
videos but you don't usually see me
doing it but I use a lot of times my elf
lip exfoliator which is a great little
exfoliating stick and I will run that
over my lips and I do this usually after
I tweeze and moisturize and that kind of
thing and just go like maybe 20 30
seconds on top lip and then again on the
bottom lip and I just feel like it
really smoothes out my lips it makes
them appear fuller because the surface
is just really smoothed out and then I
just top that with some sort of bomb I'm
actually experimenting with a lot of
different rose broadheads now I'm loving
the rose scent and testing out different
Rose bombs against one another and so
the one I use today is the Dior creme de
Rose balm facial mists oh my goodness I
have been crazy about these lately I
think years ago when I first started
using like a setting mist I thought of
it is something I would strictly do at
the end of my makeup routine just to set
the look right and take away the look of
anything really powdery on my face now
I'm realizing it's a really great thing
to do just throughout my whole makeup
routine and honestly I'm really
preferring the ones that give me some
sort of rosy really nice said the rose
water mists I think
great because they're hydrating they
take care of that powder enos on the
skin but it's just a great sensory
experience when you put those on the one
I've been using today is the rosewater
mist from glossier and just you know
putting it on pretty much after any
powdery step of my makeup and just
whenever I feel like it throughout and
I'll use sprays like that throughout the
day as well and like I said I am
comparing a lot of these rosy rosewater
products so I'll have a video on that
combing through the lashes using my Real
Techniques lash and brow comb this is
something I do all the time I think it
might only occasionally slip into a
video but I love that little metal comb
on the Real Techniques lash brow comb
because it doesn't have any borders on
it it doesn't have like a thick bristle
on each end like some cheaper ones that
I've had do so what I love about that is
that I can totally get it up to the
lashes and completely comb through them
so especially on lower lashes this is a
nice thing to do because I think we get
used to seeing a little more thickness
in the upper lashes and that doesn't
bother me too much but I really like to
see definition on the lower lash line so
that's a great little tool for that
eyeliner over the lash band when I'm
using false lashes this is something
that I don't always do but sometimes if
I'm in a hurry or if I feel like the
glue on my lash band is looking a little
imperfect maybe an extra little glob got
on there that isn't drying perfectly
clear I'll take just a liquid liner
usually the kinds in the pin form are
really nice to just go over little spots
or maybe you want to go over the entire
lash band like I used one from NYC today
it's really nice too if you've maybe
placed the lash band on in a way that's
not perfectly like straight or parallel
to your lash line and then you can kind
of go over and give the appearance of a
really nice smooth edge to your lash
line under brow highlighting really
perfecting the edge of your brow this is
sometimes something I do right after I
do my brows which is usually before the
I love other times like today I realized
I kind of skipped it until the eye look
was finished and I realized I wanted
just a little more brightness there so I
loved the Milani brow and I highlighters
these have
both a matte side and a shimmery side
using the matte cream luminous lift
shade and just go right up under the
brow as close to the brow as you can get
and then just take a little brush kind
of blend over it or just smudge it out
with your finger and it gives a really
nice finished look to the eyebrow and
the whole eye look this may be the best
trick of all this is a q-tip under the
eyes after your look is finished to blot
out the concealer that has settled right
under here because pretty much any
concealer will do that you know if
you've got that crease under the eye
which I have it you know right under my
lower lash line assuming I've put on
concealer that day which is pretty much
every day you know you get it right up
to that area and the reason why I wait
to blot this area until like my whole
makeup look is done is because it does
actually take a little while sometimes
for that to fully settle into that line
you just grab a q-tip and just literally
blot right over that line and it will
lift out the excess product and for some
people this might even be something you
want to keep a q-tip handy for and do
like midday if you notice a problem with
it but for me I noticed that if I do
this at the end of my makeup look I
don't notice any problems later in the
day with settling concealer and lastly
the thing that kind of prompted the idea
for this whole video because I think it
did get captured on camera at one point
in time and it's like right at the tail
end of my makeup look or right before I
shoot the video I go over my under eye
area with just a quick and very light
dusting of powder it doesn't necessarily
matter which kind like today I was using
this bareMinerals bare skin perfecting
powder and just a small dome brush like
Sigma f-35 elf has a great brush in the
same style as well and just kind of blot
over that area and I feel like it adds
an extra modified look and an extra
perfected look for the camera
specifically I don't know what it is but
I feel the need to do it like every time
now it's kind of like a safety blanket
type thing and it's not a large amount
of product but like I said it's just
enough to really make everything look
nice and smooth you know so there you go
now captured on camera all of my little
things that rare
if ever get included in a video so thank
you guys so much for watching I hope
this helped you out and maybe it even
helped those of you out who are in the
news like I used to be you just need
those few little tips and tricks to
finish your look maybe try a few out and
see if they make any difference for you
but thank you for watching and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
