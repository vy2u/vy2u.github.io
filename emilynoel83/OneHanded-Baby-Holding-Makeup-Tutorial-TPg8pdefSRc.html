unusual angle in this video but as you
can see I've got a guest who is going to
be joining me for a little one-armed
baby holding makeup tutorial this is
actually something if you were brought
up to me and I kind of thought oh that's
kind of an unusual idea and then I
realized oh I'm totally gonna need that
I need that little trick in my beauty
arsenal and so miss Belle is joining me
for this I wish I could say this was
foolproof I wish I could say do
everything I say
and it'll turn out great because we're
not dealing with like holding a lamp or
holding a vase we're holding a baby I
don't know what exactly she's gonna do
but some of these tips are things that
will at least give your one arm the
ability to hold that baby and you can
free up this hand to do what you need to
do makeup wise there are literally going
to be only maybe a couple of occasions
where I need to twist something open
with my left hand otherwise everything
is really going to be using this hand
and normally I'm doing videos and
getting all this stuff done kind of
somewhat at my leisure in the morning
hours while she's napping but if she's
up she really likes to be held and
another thing I've taken into
consideration is I've practiced this
look with her is that you need to take
priority with certain things maybe she's
going to have a really great day where
she's just enjoying sitting there
watching being calm and you can go back
and do some other steps but I think you
need to go into it assuming it's going
to be maybe a little bit of a difficult
process and start off with as much as
you can the things that kind of take
priority
so one thing it's very important is a
foundation stick and I just undo that
with one hand this is my Bobbi Brown
Skin Foundation stick in natural tan and
I'm just going to draw this all over my
face
draw it all over my face and yeah sorry
there's gonna be a lot of singing but
using a stick is great and I'm also
working from a little basket here that's
another big key for speed because you're
not going to be reaching all throughout
your collection and having to dig for
things but I just buff that in with a
brush that I already have handy buff
buff buff buff it on
and and also maybe have a toy that they
can you know play with a lovely viewer
sent us that giraffe know you want the
giraffe not the brush right yeah that's
what I thought she likes that little
Sophie giraffe thingamajig and I will
list all the products below in case I
fail to mention any of them while I'm
doing this
oops there went Sophie there went the
Soph Soph and then I'm going to use a
stick concealer noticing a temper with
the sticks this is the Rimmel hide the
blemish stuff just use this real quickly
up under the eye area I'm going to use
its center of the face hide some redness
had some blemish
boom-boom-boom and again dabbing over
that with a brush that I already had
pre-selected and ready for occasions
such as this this is an elf studio
concealer brush you know the muffin man
the muffin man popping open a powder
compact here it helps to have a surface
where you can kind of sit that so you're
not holding it with your other hand
because starting to hold things with
this hand means they're going to want to
grab for them so elf complexion brush
maybelline matte and poreless just
dabbing over the skin real quick Oh big
sigh yes also I could do the full blush
bronzer highlight but for me talking
priority wise blush is going to be the
priority mmm so I'm going to be taking
the peach blush blush brush already
handy tapping in tapping off excess just
a little bit of that on the apples of
the cheeks makes you look alive are you
over it
next up brows and I'm using this NYX
tinted brow mascara this is in the shade
I actually have it in black it seems to
be more of just a dark brown and using
the other hand to take this off and then
I'm going to set that product out of
reach of the baby just going to run this
through the brows real quick like this
is nice because it can provide a little
bit of color and also set the brows okay
now what we do and now I do want a hand
when I made myself this solemn vow I was
gonna be a lady someday though I didn't
know when or how the kid liked some
old-school country what can I say
next up mascara simply mascara for me
and it's going to be a lash curl gotta
do it I mean the mascara really doesn't
matter if I don't go ahead and give
myself a curl so yeah you can chew on my
hand that's totally cool I love you
Nagar I love you angel and we're gonna
unscrew this mascara this is covergirl
super sizer my current fave out of reach
and just give a quick coat look at this
stuff
this really does some good things for my
lashes oops I may have made a mess there
I'm not sure I'm so far from my mirror I
can't even do only gonna worry about the
top lashes here again priorities what
you looking at over there
what is back there are we watching okay
we're gonna again pull the tube out set
it aside she is being exceptionally good
right now
this is like the best she's been I think
she wants to make me look like what I'm
like I'm a restless child sometimes or
something
finally a lip product is from Almay this
is in berry medium this is one of their
smart shake butter kiss can easily be
opened with one hand and just throw the
cap on your surface but a little color
on the lips never ceases to amaze me how
you finally look a little bit done up
right once you put something on the lips
even if you did hardly anything to your
face bada boom bada bang what do you
think about that what do you think about
that doo doo what do you think about
that
still AM and she's reaching over fate
auditioning and off-the-shoulder dressed
up with her hair down and a bone camp
yep now you guys melasma played a fun
trick on me it said oh you're gonna be
out in the Sun sometimes you better get
SPF on that all the time where I'm going
to creep back through so I'm noticing a
little bit of melasma creep through so
I'm going to add a
extra concealer there actually just a
little extra I don't know what who you
talking to over there who's over there
who's that baby who's that baby up there
I do you see another mirror oh I love
you period
do you love me question boy and please
please exclamation point oh no would you
in parentheses yes it's parentheses
indicates anybody was wondering ah okay
y'all so there it is is it a perfect
face of makeup no does it need to be no
that's what you need to remind yourself
up sometimes it's just about getting it
done pulling something together no no
give you a little more spring in your
step when you walk out the door it
doesn't take long it definitely took me
longer today when I was explaining
everything but if you can keep some
songs going if you can keep talking to
them don't just treat them like they're
not even there but pull them into the
experience something I've learned as a
mom is there are so many everyday life
situations it's like life doesn't stop
on chores don't stop everyday around the
house things don't stop just because you
have a baby so try to include them and
involve them as much as you can and make
it a fun thing so they'll see it as
something they don't mind doing and
there's lots to look at in this room
isn't there there's a lot of things over
here oh yeah he shows Oh what was that
shade of butter lipstick I think I might
want to wear that sometime she says
there's actually a bigger mirror back
here did you know that mommy I'm gonna
apologize now for all the times that my
nursing bra has been exposed in this
video should I take my hair down or
should I leave it up I think I might
bring it down oh yeah that's why I
didn't choose to bring it down in the
first place but anyway you guys thank
you for watching anybody who's got a
little one out there I hope this was
somewhat useful to you like I said may
work may not work but might at least
give you a starting point and some ideas
for that one-handed makeup
it's a my my and say bye-bye I went to
the animal fair the birds and the beasts
were there the old man by the light of
the moon was going his on forehead and
the itsy bitsy spider went up the sound
