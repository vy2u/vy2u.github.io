videos I talked about using shadows that
can give you a good one shadow look and
what I mean by that is when you can just
use one shadow and maybe you pat it on
the lid blend it out in the crease and
it can have kind of a multi-dimensional
really pretty look but you're only going
to the effort to use one shade and
that's budget-friendly that's time
friendly in a lot of cases so I'm going
to show you how to get that look in this
video really quickly as you look in your
own collection for shades that might
work for this think about mid-tone
shades something that's not too light
not too dark and I find this works
really well with shades that have at
least a little bit of shimmer to them
because it'll really catch the light on
your lids and give you more of a
shadowed look in the crease also I have
a companion blog post to this where I'm
recommending ten great standalone
shadows that'll work for this link to
that below I'll also link to the video I
did on this topic back in 2011 a lot of
people said I should update so here's
the update I hope you enjoy the look so
first off I've primed my lid with an
eyeshadow primer then I am taking this
L'Oreal infallible shadow and the shade
is bronze to taupe and this is one of my
absolute favorites to do this technique
with and I'm just going to take a flat
shadow brush here and pick up some of
that product tap off any excess and just
with this flat brush start patting the
shadow all over the lid
you can really start to see the shimmer
coming through where it's catching the
light so that's what we want then I'm
using a fluffy brush like this and going
back into the product just getting a
little bit on my brush and I'm going to
use this to just blend back and forth
throughout the crease I'm not really
doing anything fancy I'm just sticking
to where that natural you know socket is
in my eye and as you pull upward ever so
slightly you start to see the color
shear out a bit more and kind of take on
a different tone you know it's not
looking quite so metallic anymore starts
looking deeper there because the crease
recedes and so therefore the shadow is
going to look darker but as you pull it
up just on top of the crease so the
shadow is kind of visible when your eyes
are open you can see it shearing out and
looking you know a little bit more of
that bronze tone is coming through on
this so that's why I like using shadows
to have a little bit of shimmer because
usually they have a bit of a
multi-dimensional look and once you've
got that blended out as much as you want
I just take a bare fluffy brush and
blend out the edge for a highlight you
can just use your face highlight up
there and skip using another shadow
under the eye going back to that same
shadow and using a little smudge brush
this is going to give us a really
concentrated application and I'm just
putting a little bit of this shade right
down under here going about halfway in
and really concentrating most of the
product on the outer corner next I'm
just doing a little bit of black liner
really close to my lash line given the
lashes a quick curl and then apply some
mascara
it's just that easy thanks so much for
watching guys all the products I use
will be listed below in the info box
don't forget to check out my blog post
with 10 shadow ideas for this kind of a
look and I'll see you again next time
