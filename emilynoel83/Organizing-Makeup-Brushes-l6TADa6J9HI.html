with you the new way that I'm storing my
brushes and I have to give full credit
to encore on this one I was watching
some videos on his channel which I just
love and he had this way of storing his
brushes he calls it a Sephora inspired
brush holder and basically you're taking
a container you're filling it with um
like sort of a craft sand or beads or
whatever and your brushes just stick
right down into it and it holds them out
there real nice and you could do any
size any shape that you like so I just
want to go ahead and show you what I did
because I'm really proud of it and
really excited and I got all my stuff at
Walmart for this and it was very very
cheap all found in the craft section so
let's go ahead and take a look at what
we got here here I have I put used all
my brushes in this except for my bare
minerals ones I may further split this
up down the road and you know make
different containers for them all but as
you can see I've used a I've got these
square jars and they were under $2
apiece
and I filled it with what's this thing
called
dacor sand and what it is it's like I've
pulled some of them out here I don't
know if it's focusing in real well but
they're like little bitty shiny pebbles
this is the bag that it came in and it's
just a nice little bag of the sand there
but it's really it really is as you can
see little pebbles and I also got this
um it's kind of like a hemp ribbon I
guess you'd call it in several different
colors that I thought coordinated with
the rocks and I just kind of tied it
together as a little decorative bow
around it all and so I've got my face
brushes here
and my eye brushes and as you can see
you just you take one out and it just
sticks right back in there and none of
them touch or anything it's really cool
and very very cheap to do this as well
and then look at this little guy I'm
really proud of this woman this is like
actually a little votive candle holder
and as you can see it's got that sort of
cracked glass effect on it this was
probably $0.99 if that and I filled it
with the same kind of rocks and I'm
using like any of my short short brushes
like I've got a mini concealer brush and
some of those L'Oreal hid brushes that
come with your pigments or your shadow
pink or things like that and my lip la
lip brushes they stick down in there so
good and I think that is just the most
adorable little jar so just an idea like
I said I got it from encore you can
check out his full video to see exactly
how he went about this but I just
thought this is a really neat way to
store your brushes and keep them nice
and also you know kind of spruce up your
makeup area at the same time so thanks
for watching have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
