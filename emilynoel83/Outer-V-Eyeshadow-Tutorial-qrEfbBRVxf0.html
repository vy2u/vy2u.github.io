how many times have you heard me say
outer-v
in my tutorials I do it a lot it's kind
of a standard look for me to sort of
bring the darker portion of the shadow
out just a little ways from the eye and
something that sort of resembles a V
like that and it's a really easy
technique to make your eyes look a
little more lifted and it can really be
done with just a couple of shades and it
does not take anything fancy in fact I'm
gonna show you how to do it with just
two eyeshadow shades all you need for
the whole eye look is two shadows one
media one medium to light shade in one
dark shade a liner and a mascara and
you've totally got this so it can be
very basic even though it's kind of a
different technique all of the products
I use besides of what I start out with
our completely drugstore so I think
you're really gonna like this look and
hopefully it sorts out a little more
clearly exactly how to do the outer V
his first step is to prime your lid I
went ahead and used a yeah I mean you
can really use anything you want a cream
shadow an actual primer I used my
rubenesque paint pump from Mac but you
just want something there so that it
will kind of grab your shadow just a
kind of a step that I always do for any
look then take your lighter tone shadow
that you're going to use for me I'm
using fine wink from wet and wild it's
kind of a dual toned um sort of a light
champagne color with a little bit of
pink to it and I'm just gonna use my elf
eyeshadow brush and get that color going
all over the lid and since we are
keeping this a two shadow look I picked
a shade that I could go up and uses a
highlight as well so I'm just going to
apply this all over basically my eye
area here so it will serve as my
highlight and my all-over lid shade and
keep in mind I mean you could pick a
different shade and make it a three
color look if you wanted more of a
neutral highlight and then a more
colourful shade on the lid but I'm just
opting to simplify it and use this shade
all over so I'm going to put a little
more on the lid here alright there is
step one for the eye shadow
step two is basically where we put in
that outer V shade and this is something
I questions on a lot because I do it in
a lot of my videos and I say okay now
time for the outer V and I think a lot
of people are wondering well what
exactly does that mean I'm going to take
another wet and wild shade this is
wicked it's one of the singles and it's
a nice rich black with some sparkle to
it
I'm gonna take my fine crease brush this
is a smallish crease brush from essence
of beauty that's a brand available at
CVS they make some fantastic brushes I'm
gonna get some of the black on my brush
and I'm going to go to the center of my
crease
the center part there and that's where
I'm gonna start applying shadow towards
the inside here I'm going to apply less
product I'm gonna focus it more on the
outside hence the outer V we're creating
make sure you're not only blending
side-to-side but you're blending a
little bit up and down to just to get
the blending going in that direction as
well but mainly we're focusing out and
you can see how I'm going not just right
in the crease but a little bit above it
more on top of that brow bone that sits
right here okay so I'm going outward and
I'm going to the point where it's kind
of in line with my eyebrow okay so I'm
going out and keeping it in that line
then I want to come up to sort of
develop the bottom the bottom part of
that outer V so for that I'm going to
the corner of my eye and going up and
you can see how we're basically creating
practically an arrow that's pointing to
the corner or to the outer end of our
eyebrow okay so just go ahead and this
is a I mean a technique that I've seen
used in makeup for a long time but I
also just recently saw Yves pearl on The
Today Show doing this as a way to sort
of give yourself a lifted look in the
eye area if you kind of you know would
like rather have a facelift but you know
don't want to go through the surgery and
all that you want to have
sort of that lifted look this is a great
way to do it so again I'm just kind of
going over that it's over and up just
like that and then you want to focus in
with even more darkness right here in
the corner okay
so concentrate it there and continue
blending out and then it might be nice
to bring in a fluffier brush I'm using
my Sephora rounded crease brush to see
the difference in size that's what we're
talking about here a fluffier brush too
and I'm using it bare just to diffuse
that whole you know all the color there
and then you may decide oh I want to go
back and maybe do a little bit more
that's totally fine you know I suggest
working with a light touch to start and
building it up because then you you know
you can totally see if you want to go
further you don't get overwhelmed by a
lot of color right at the start so there
we go that's basically our outer V that
we're going with again it's a lifted
look you could go more sideways but I
like the philosophy that a lot of people
use of keeping it in line with where the
outer end of the eyebrow is so anyway
we've done that now you kind of want
your eyeliner to follow suit so I'm
going to use a liquid eyeliner I'm using
this one from Revlon it's Revlon
Colorstay in the black shimmer
practically like their blackest black
alone with a little bit of shimmer to it
and basically just applying this really
close to the lash line as I always would
and then when we get to the outer end
here you may want to extend it out just
a little bit and kind of keep it in line
with the outer V okay so in other words
you wouldn't want to droop it way down
in this direction if this is going all
up here so just go out just a little bit
and you may want to thicken it you want
to go over the shadow to sort of fit
that one more time you're totally
welcome to do that you can just go to
the tip of the liner
and define that even more if that's what
you're with if that's kind of what
you're wanting just want it to all kind
of make sense and flow together then the
last thing I'm going to do is do a
little bit of lower liner I'm just going
to take my Revlon Colorstay pencil liner
now in black Brown connect it to the
outer edge of the liquid that you put
down and then really lightly no need to
go real heavy on this we're going really
light just go to the inner corner just
to give us that definition and everyone
here is my finished look just a simple
outer V look that I wanted to just take
a little extra time to explain exactly
how to achieve the outer V this goes to
show that you can pull it off just two
colors make it really easy to does not
need anything require anything expensive
I think everything I use besides the
Paint Pot was totally drugstore so
that's awesome
and also on my lips what I used here is
really affordable I know my Walgreens at
least carries a brand called Jordana and
a lot of their products are like 2 for
$3 and I have found my favorite duo for
I think a rosy pink lip out of that
brand and it's the liner in the easy
liner in baby berry so that's kind of
just a pretty medium pink tone and then
this lighter pink lip gloss in sweet
it's the pretty shine lip gloss and just
that over this liner looks really good I
think so anyway guys thank you so much
for tuning in for this tutorial I hope
you learned something new about the
whole outer-v thing and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
