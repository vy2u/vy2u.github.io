kind of dramatic on my eye makeup and I
thought I'd talk about first just a few
things key things that I wore on my face
I used one of these wet and wild new
baked pallets so I used the Blues on
there I actually wore them wet for the
most part so I really like that kind of
a peachy glow going on so I use this
product from Malley it's the 24/7
professional blush in pink satin so you
actually put down that little creamy
highlight first and then you top it off
with the peach and I love if I do
anything bluish on my eyes I like things
to be kind of peachy everywhere on my
lips I'm wearing one of the new Revlon
lip butters that this is in peach
parfait that's all I have on jewelry
wise I've got on some big silver stud
earrings and also on my wrist I've got
on kind of a big metal cuff bracelet I
got this from a store called Cato which
is full of shoes and women's clothing
and accessories and these came from
Claire's fit wise just to give you a
kind of up-close look at my shirt I got
this a while back from I believe it was
JCPenney and it's just a shirt with kind
of a cool print going on it's a little
bit floral a little bit abstract as well
but it's got pinks and blues and greens
in it and then I'm just wearing this
sweater over the top that actually has a
neat little like lapel going on so when
I wear this it reminds me of practically
wearing like an actual blazer so I like
to wear it with the sleeves kind of
pushed up a little bit you can see the
shirt comes down a little bit longer but
I'm just wearing this sweater open over
the top I'm wearing this shirt with a
pair of my favorite skinny jeans from
Wet Seal and some shoes that I got a
long long time ago from Fashion Bug it's
not really that cold here right now so I
still like to wear my open-toed shoes
while I can't ask me about my height in
my last video and I am just 5 feet tall
so usually when I have the opportunity
to have a little bit of a heel that's
something I definitely want to do I hope
you like this outfit guys it's kind of
casual just dressed up a little bit by
doing some layer there are any different
themes for outfits that you would want
to
see like work or something like that I
mean obviously I'm sort of dressed up
pretty much every day for work so um I
didn't really know if anybody would be
interested in that kind of thing or not
but if you are let me know and I'll try
to shoot some more of these so thanks
again bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
