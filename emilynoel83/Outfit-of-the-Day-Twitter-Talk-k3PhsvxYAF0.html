good mood today because today is
actually like my friday i have a
three-day weekend coming up because i
had to work on labor day so I get like
my labor day coming up this Friday so
which is tomorrow so I'm really excited
about that um wanted to thank everybody
for the really great feedback you gave
me on my review that I did of all the
physicians formula eyeshadow palettes um
I got some really just kind feedback and
supportive comments about the way I do
reviews and I just it really meant a lot
to me like when I read through those
comments so I just wanted to thank you
for that for taking the time to even
share any you know thoughts about what I
what I do I it does mean a lot so thank
you for that um also wanted to remind
you that on my blog beauty broadcast net
the game day a poll thing is still on
there that's where you guys pick which
team in which colors will inspire my
next game day tutorial at the end of
this week and the two teams are Oregon
which is green and yellow and Tennessee
which is orange and white so I think
those are either way it's going to be
kind of a tricky look to pull off but
they're actually the votes are kind of
close right now so if you want to head
over there and place your vote you met
you can help determine what the next
game day makeup tutorial is because and
some people have told me they're like
I'm not a big sports fan but you know
I'm interested in these tutorials and
really it's for anybody you know these
can be adapted to any occasion really
any colors if your school colors are
different you know just switch them out
so also with this video I am doing a
Twitter talk so I have just kind of
called out on my Twitter page for people
to ask questions and at the end of this
video I will answer as many as i can get
to so I'm already getting some of those
coming in right now but yeah I wanted to
do an outfit of the day as well because
some people have asked me to do an
outfit of the day and I've kind of been
like yeah okay that I just haven't
gotten around to doing it and I also
part of me thought well you know I'm
doing I throughout the week I work it's
kind of a lot of you know professional
or somewhat professional clothing that I
try to
air and I just didn't know how
interested people would be in that but
then someone on my Facebook page today I
just kind of came right out and said
that that is what they want to get some
more ideas on and so that I that really
kind of pushed me to just go ahead and
do it so yeah I'm gonna do an outfit of
the day and if you want to know about my
makeup of the day and check the info box
down below here because I generally put
a link to my dailybooth page where I put
all the makeup I'm wearing each day
almost each day on there so that'll give
you some ideas if you're sort of
interested in this sort of makeup look I
don't know
that in from information box I mean I
really wish people would check that more
often because oftentimes that will
answer all your questions if you have
any but anyway today's outfit um well
I've got these earrings on that i got
from Claire's that's like a ninety
percent of the time that's where I'm
going to tell you my jewelry comes from
but yeah just kind of a white hoop thing
going on I didn't go with the necklace
today because I don't know I just feel
like I held this hair going on and I
actually have kind of a striped thing
going on here which I'll show you in a
minute I have this dress that's all
connected I got it from JCPenney and
it's like there's this little cardigan
looking thing it's really long and it
turns into a dress and it's all
connected to the underside so that's
kind of neat um my nails these are
nailin glue on nails they look an awful
lot like the nails from kiss the kiss
everlasting ones that I love and there's
revlon ones that are like this too but
yeah I've just thought i would mention
that in case anybody was wondering but
yeah let's take a look at my outfit
alright I've kind of struggled to sort
of fit myself in the frame here for my
outfit of the day video but on this is
sort of like a little dress it's like
it's it's got kind of some ruffles on
the sleeves sorry about the shaky
camerawork this is like my first one
like this that I've really done but it's
it's all connected to this striped part
underneath so yeah that's all sewn
together but the belt you can take on
and off I've actually use this belt in
other ways but it came with this outfit
got it from jcpenney and I just like it
for the news because when I'm sitting
you can see you know the anchor desk
comes up to about here and so this
really pulls everything in right at the
waist so I think that's cute and it kind
of opens all the way down there and then
you can see where it's connected so yeah
this is the first time I've worn this so
i think it's it's cute and then my shoes
are just these sort of wedge shoes see
if i can step a little closer here i got
these from wet seal they actually have
like this heart on the side here sorry
but
that's just I need to come up with a new
setting for this outfit of the day but I
will don't worry it'll be good it'll get
better from here it's only uphill from
here right well I like i said i'm doing
the twitter talk and i've gotten some
questions accumulated here already so
i'll just start answering and I haven't
pre like I haven't like look through
them first this is the first time I'm
like reading them and seeing what it
says um on here i love makeup 12 says
what is your favorite mascara and that's
from Emma my favorite mascara let's see
like as far as a current favorite goes
one that i've been using a whole lot is
the regular l'oreal double extent not
the beauty tubes but just the regular
double extend mascara it's a really good
lengthening mascara and i used it quite
a bit a while back and then you know i
start experimenting and it was sometimes
a while before i come back to even a
mascara that i like just because I've
been busy trying other things but I've
been using it a lot lately and I've like
the length that's given my lashes so
I'll call that like a current favorite
mascara right now um Alison Green says
what is your favorite color um gosh as
this room surrounding me might imply i'm
going to go with pink I like bright pink
and i really like bright colors in
general like i don't know i also enjoy
i'm more and more i'm liking myself
especially seeing it on the news I like
the neutral colors the creams and browns
and stuff like that but at the same time
I will always love good rich red and
pink and orange coral just a good royal
blue of a big fan of bright colors but I
think pink is probably my ultimate
favorite next one memory 166 do you ever
use mineral or powder foundation I do I
generally won't use mineral makeup for
the news because I not a huge fan of the
coverage that it gives me unless i'm
using the intensive version of everyday
minerals i feel like that is some of the
best coverage mineral makeup and i will
use that from time to time on the news
but more often than not i go with liquid
for news and then maybe on my off days
like on the weekend
what my skin to breathe a little bit
more use something lighter i'll use a
mineral or powder foundation then next
question is from twigs kitty she says
where do you see yourself in five years
do you think you'll still be doing
videos um I don't see why not I mean I
love this this is like a passion of mine
doing these videos and interacting with
people and sharing makeup tips back and
forth with people so I don't see any
reason why I would stop I mean I just
hope YouTube keeps going there was one
day the other I think it was just a
couple days ago i was thinking like with
youtube like what away entirely what
would i do you know but I just I love
doing this and I really don't see any
reason why I would still have any pets I
do I don't have a pet here right now and
Tyler and I are kind of considering you
know what we're going to do here now
that we have the new house at the
apartment we weren't allowed to have
pets so that really stunk and I have a
cat that's living back home with my
parents mr. Nutt
he is precious and he's like 15 years
old and he is extremely stressed over
car rides and things like that so I'm
like kind of scared that if they brought
him down here like he might have a
stroke or something horrible horribly
traumatic might happen to him and he
wouldn't be the same because you kind of
a fragile cat right now um he sometimes
has issues with eating and this and that
he's just kind of finicky at times but I
love him and I have had that cat since
fourth grade and my parents have a
couple other cats that are kind of like
outdoor cats but he is a white Turkish
Angora long-haired cat so cute and I I
miss him a lot actually he is the
background on my phone so I I always
think about when i get my phone alright
next one is from jill strip hi Jill she
says uh what was your biggest makeup
mistake you've made over the years oh my
gosh and I have made mistakes this is
true um Oh thinking back I'm thinking
maybe it was around high snow was in
high school it was at some point in
college i'm thinking around sophomore
year maybe there's a time when I findout
my eyebrows a lot like they were just
really thin and looking I think I
thought they looked great but looking
back at pictures of you know certain
pictures in that time frame like looking
back I'm like why did you do that you
know like I browser so important and
they were just I mean sometimes I think
thin eyebrows look really good on on
some people it didn't work for me and
they were just too thin and as you can
see they had no problem growing back but
I think issues with eyebrows are a big
big deal and if I didn't pull up my
eyebrows i think i would have a unibrow
but getting them to thin i think it's a
is kind of a common problem for people
but yeah I these questions are so good
amanda nicole says what do you look
forward to on your days off sleeping in
it cuz i wake up at one thirty in the
morning for the newscast and cuz you
know I
get ready then I gotta get there early
to read over and prepare and everything
and so just the sleep is really good
which is kind of sad but yes I do look
forward to that a lot um spending time
with Tyler because as you know we're not
on really the same schedule during the
week so just getting to kind of live on
my own terms i guess and not feel so
confined to an early morning schedule I
do love my job and I love doing morning
news but being able to break out of that
routine on the weekends is really nice
um hanging out with friends that I don't
see a lot during the wait because I do
go to bed so early i mean i go to bed at
around you know say seven o'clock so it
does kind of cramped my style a little
bit but also getting back to watching TV
shows and doing makeup tutorials I do a
lot of those on the weekends so yeah
there's so much I look forward to on a
day off next one is friend shadow shadow
angel 613 if you had to choose just one
makeup product to use for oh I hate this
question have you had to use just one
makeup product to use for the rest of
your life what would it be I can't stand
that question because I've gotten asked
that before like what is the one brand
you would use or what is the one product
you would use it's so hard it is so very
hard um gosh I'm thinking I'm going to
go with a lipstick a sort of pinky
colored pinky berry colored lipstick
here's why I feel like putting that on
even if I had nothing else on my face I
think would brighten up my face and I
could use that as blush which i think is
another super important excuse me aspect
to make up so use the lipstick double it
up kind of as the blush and you will
really brighten up your face that's what
I'll say I guess sorry no I'm still glad
you asked the question but that's just a
really hard question to answer is one
famous person you love to me will you
ever do a robin meade makeup tutorial
that is such a good idea that is a
really good idea i do fashion a lot of
my day to day makeup kind of after what
I see on robin meade so
um maybe just doing a daily like make up
for news tutorial but really with her in
mind that would be awesome she is
probably the famous person i would love
to me like if I met robin meade i would
be like
I don't know I honestly don't know what
I would do I think I would like I would
probably say something kind of stupid or
and foolish but I would be so excited
and I would probably never forget that
moment so I really like to meet Robin me
um was asked I think it was on
formspring yesterday so people were
asking like who are your favorite famous
people or the looks that you like i
enjoy the look of i like Carrie
Underwood's look I like Kim Kardashian
Lea Michele and of course Robin me those
are some of my favorite kind of
celebrities and I really like their look
that they have going on as well I think
that's about all the questions I have
time for today thank you so much for
participating this is so much fun to get
to kind of just see the questions come
in Bam Bam Bam answer them without
really thinking about it in advance so
thanks for participating I will continue
to do these outfit of the day videos on
occasion and I'll try to come up with a
little better venue for that but thanks
so much for watching guys have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
