hi everybody I'm about to go out and do
some shopping this morning and I thought
I would just go ahead and do a little
outfit of the day for you to show you
what i'm wearing since i gotta like this
out as far as jewelry goes i'm storing
some like jumbo size princess cut cubic
zirconia earrings there i've also got my
little a butterfly necklace that's kind
of gold and has some rhinestones on it
that i got from forever 21 outfit-wise
am I wearing these denim jeggings here
that I think I may have found them at
wet seal like a couple seasons ago and
then my boots which are also from wet
seal and they're kind of a faux suede
look going on there and I feel you hear
the overall look that you get with this
so I'm loving the slouchy boo my sweater
the first time I wore this in a video
everyone told me that this was something
that Quinn had on on the show glean from
forever 21 it's navy and white just kind
of ties I tied it up in the front and
then I'm just wearing a red tank top
underneath so that's what I've got going
on they like the length of this sweater
because it does come down and cover your
rear in on my nails its essence date
with the night it's a great like
gunmetal silver color and I've had it on
for exactly seven days now and it's
finally starting to chip a little bit
but I love the way it went on and I love
how it's lasted me all week so that's
good news for my makeup its overall
pretty natural I went with a pretty
neutral I losing benefits they're real
mascara and I have sort of a pink lip
and cheek going on and I will list all
the products that I use down below in
the extra info section so thanks for
watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
