quick little work-related outfit of the
day video this is actually my very first
work outfit of the day but a lot of you
said you were interested in sort of kind
of work business casual type outfits so
that's kind of what I have on I incur a
morning newscast and so there's sort of
a little bit of strategy that goes into
my outfit and my look day to day in
terms of just hair and makeup I mean it
tends to be a pretty polished look
you're in front of HD cameras you know
your makeup is pretty carefully applied
I guess you might say but you also want
to usually wear a little more color just
in your face your lips your eyes because
the lights can kind of suck the life out
of your look even when you think oh you
know this might be good day to day you
know just walking around it probably is
fine but under those lights a little
more sometimes I may share a few key
products that I wear one is you know a
blush that's maybe a little brighter
than your average blush and this might
scare you a little bit to see it just in
the compact but it goes on more sheer
this is Mac blush in dolly mix and it
does have a little bit of shimmer to it
but I mean this is a a relatively sheer
blush on the cheeks but it gives a great
pop of color there on my lips I'm
wearing a lip color I'm loving so much
this is one of the Milani HD advanced
lip colors in lovely Rouge and so as you
can see it's kind of a nice sort of
berry toned lip color and it actually
feels a lot like the Revlon lip butters
so if you still haven't found Revlon lip
butters and you want something similar
those HD advanced lip colors come in a
lot of really nice kind of vibrant
shades and there's also a great nude
shade called classy nude as well I am
wearing some false lashes today too
they're a little more on the subtle side
they're not super long but they add some
thickness and they are the salon perfect
lashes I got from Walmart number 109
jewelry wise I feel like I'm very
conscious of not wanting to wear too
much jewelry now when I'm on the set you
know people are seeing kind of like a
head and shoulder shot
me and I try not to overload by wearing
you know big necklace big earrings big
bracelet and all that because I think it
can look a little cheesy or a little too
much so I really try to balance it like
for example today this shirt is from TJ
Maxx it's kind of a cardigan 3/4 sleeve
sweater type thing but it's got some
ruffles it's got some details up here
around the top so I thought I'm not
gonna wear a necklace today I'll just go
with you know maybe a little bigger
earring these are from Claire's and then
I balance that out with a cuff bracelet
here's another look at my sweater I have
this actually in two colors I liked it
so much when I found it at t.j.maxx but
I'm a huge fan of just royal blues and I
also got this in coral but I think I got
this for around $20 or less and it's
just got a great little ruffle I'm
always looking for things that have like
an interesting neckline or something
that just gives a little interest here
on the upper body as far as my pants go
I generally they're not quite as
exciting you know as what's on top but
what I'm wearing today these are
actually a pair of I think they're
called trouser pants or trousers or
jeans I got them from JCPenney
and so you can see I'm missing one nail
one popped off on my glitter nails I
blogged about those but they have that
sort of denim look they are a super dark
denim or practically black Jean
basically they they are kind of a more I
guess generous or looser fit in the legs
but you know you don't want something
that's going to be super super tight
fitting but they fit great they're a
good length for me I found these at JC
Penney in the petite section so a lot of
people are asking me they're like you're
five feet tall how do you you know find
pants that are the right length as you
can see the length is just perfect on
these and I found them in the petite
section at JCPenney and then my shoes
I'm loving these shoes that I got their
little flats and I got him from shoe
carnival and they just have a really
cute little like jewel the detail on
there I was saying the other day I hope
that never falls off because these shoes
are gonna be a whole lot less
interesting but I love that pretty much
sums it up for my work outfit of the day
probably would have been cool if I shot
this at work maybe I'll do that
sometimes it's kind of about being sort
of simple Paul I like wearing bright
colors
I think bright colors solids come off
really well on camera so that's what I
try to do a lot of the time and I'll try
to make some more of these videos in the
near future so thanks so much for
watching guys talk to you later so lots
of people have been wanting to see some
cupcake cam and just thought I would
show you her one of her favorite
activities which is spending time in the
sunbeams here
cupcake loves laying in the sunbeams
that come through the window it's kind
of her morning hobby she just can't get
enough of it she will usually oh my gosh
now she's jumping at it reflected that
the camera is creating on the wall see
that little face there it's doing
baby
