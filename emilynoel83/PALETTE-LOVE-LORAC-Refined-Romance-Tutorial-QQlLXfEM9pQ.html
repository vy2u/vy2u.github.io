gonna be talking about a new palette
today actually it's a palette I've
talked about before talked about this in
the Nordstrom sale beauty finds video
and it's from lorac it's called the
refined romance eye on cheek palette I
got this palette for 18 bucks in that
Nordstrom sale and I believe that's
still going on for like another week or
so maybe a little less than a week now
so check it out it's an eye and cheek
palette all of the quality you would
expect from lorac and their eyeshadows
is right here with some deep Burgundy's
Gold Toe awesome rosy beige color in
here your shimmery white and then you
have a couple of highlight options and a
blush that's really nicely pigmented too
the mirror is here cute packaging on the
outside so it's been an awesome little
fine to get a la palette like this for
18 bucks exclusive to Nordstrom very
very pleased with it and in this time
between my Nordstrom video and now I
have heard from so many people who have
purchased this too and they're like I
love it I want to see a tutorial and I'm
gonna be using one of my favorite shade
combos in the look which involves the
gold and the burgundy and it's just I
think so pretty very fall-like too if
you're into that and I'll show you the
cheek and the lip also I'm gonna use my
Milani eyeshadow primer and just get a
teeny bit out really doesn't take much
of this product and take it all over the
lid into the crease and dab it right up
underneath your brow I'm going to get a
little bit of light crease color going
there is a gorgeous shade in here it's
kind of like a rosy beige and it's matte
I'm using my Sigma e25 brush and you can
see this is a shade that for just a
really subtle day like this could make
just the greatest natural little hint of
a crease and then it's also nice as
you'll see later in this look for
blending out the edge of darker colors
so I just kind of wanted to show you the
two ways that I find this color most
useful so just starting out in the
crease next for my under brow highlight
there is this light shimmery white and
it is very bright so you really want to
tap off the excess there to avoid
getting too big of a you know frosty
white look
then all over the lid I'm going to use
this shimmery gold it's a great gold
love this I am using my Sonia Kashuk
small shadow brush and we're just going
to Pat this all over the lid will
overlap a little bit with a brightening
shade there around the inner corner but
yeah just really carry this all the way
across the lid
and to brighten up that inner corner I
am just going to take that lightest
shade any small brush that you have will
work well here and just kind of take it
right around the tear duct and it's
so-so brightening I feel like this look
is all composed of my favorite favorite
shades in the palette because we're
going to go to another favorite which is
this beautiful matte burgundy color
surprisingly this is not a shade that
I've seen in like my other lorac Pro
palette sand I'd expect I would just
because I think these kinds of tones are
really popular on the eyes but it's
great to see it in this palette and I'm
patting that on the outer part of my lid
and you notice I build up shades pretty
slowly like I don't go full-on with the
fullest amount of color right at the
get-go because then you just end up
battling with more fallout and you know
it's it's easier to add than it is to
take away everybody says that but it's
true now as you can see I'm over lapping
the gold and once I've got that on the
lid as much as I want it I kind of flip
my brush over and I use that little flat
side to kind of wedge into the crease
and pull the shadow upward I use this
technique a lot and I think it's just
great for targeting shadow exactly where
you want it so as you can see I'm kind
of lessening lessening the darkness as I
get more toward the inside but keeping
it kind of dark out here and then
something I did on the other side is I
just really shaped this shadow outward
like I practically felt like I was
drawing in a bit of an outer V just to
get a lot of intensity over here then
I'm gonna take a bear brush and lightly
blend over the edge of that and when
you're using you know bear full brushes
like this make sure you're not raking
all over the entire look or you'll muddy
up that gold and the burgundy we just
want to stay on the edge something I did
on the other side and I'm gonna do it
again I just take my finger into this
gold because you know maybe some shadow
heads do testified the gold just a
little bit that we've used around it and
just dab it right there on the kind of
inner part of the lid so pretty I love
this burgundy and gold combo when y'all
are asking me in the fall for a full
makeup tutorial come back and watch this
because I think
be busting this out in the fall quite a
bit as well then kind of a last step on
this part you know on the upper part of
the eye I'm going to go back to this
shade this rosy beige and use my Sigma
e30 six and I'm just gonna really gently
blend this color on the edge of the
matte burgundy that we blend it out and
it just seems to make the blend look
even more flawless and you can take it
way down in here it won't look too dark
but it's a really great little tool to
have and then a lot of times I like to
go ahead and do my upper liner because
that ends up shaping how my lower liner
in the lower part of the eye turns out
so I'm using this two-faced sketch
marker it's in the shade black their
package just like little pins and it's
just a felt tip liner and they have all
kinds of fun shades I like the color
intensity and I like the staying power
so far my gripe is just that I wish the
tip was a little more flexible you know
like I've gotten used to that Physicians
Formula that nice little brush tip pen
and the brush tip I tell you it makes
life so easy because it just kind of
lays right in there right up against the
lashes and you just get the best line
and with this you know you're gonna work
a little harder I feel like it's just
I'm not quite used to just the standard
felt tip anymore I'm gonna pull my liner
just straight out and then come up from
the bottom and I make this little
triangle but all you have to do is fill
in and you can say like practice makes
perfect with liquid liner and liquid
liners do get easier with time you know
you just build up a comfort level with
them but you're still gonna have those
days even if you've been using makeup
for I don't care how many years you're
gonna have those days where you struggle
with the liner or getting the same wing
on each side because that still happens
to me then I decided I would do a nice
dark rich brown in my lower waterline so
I'm using my smashbox always sharp liner
and this is in the shade sumatra it lays
into that waterline so effortlessly it's
also nice for a little smudge and then
i'm gonna go back to my darkest shade in
the palette with an angled brush that's
this matte burgundy and as i often like
to do i just love the way this looks
love the way it finishes the look i'm
going up under
winged getting a little bit of that
burgundy burgundy in there and then I'm
just kind of taking whatever's left and
pulling it in and then a little extra
thing that I did to make it even more
smudgy smokey on the lower lashlines I
took this more shimmery burgundy and I
just kind of went right over everything
you know very same tone as the other
shade just something about the shimmer
and it makes it a little less intense
next up I am going to curl my eyelashes
and I know I often fast-forward through
this a bit but I generally hold it on my
lashes for about 15 seconds and today
I'm using my cosmetic superhero mascara
sample which I was really impressed with
if you saw my it cosmetics superhero
palette review I referenced that kind of
helps the curl of my lashes hang with
the curl of the false lashes and I'll go
ahead and do my lower lash mascara which
is my covergirl clump crusher water is a
separate coat of that and then lastly
the false lashes I'm using are my huda
beauty Samantha lashes so I'll pop those
on and I'll be right back okay I look is
done now we're gonna use the cheek side
of the palette and I gotta say I am a
little surprised that they didn't put in
like a warmer colored like more peachy
blush just looking at all the warmth
that's happening with the shadow
selection but it's cool this is a really
pretty shade it is very pigmented it's
like kind of a rosy mauve color so I'm
gonna dip into that I'm using my Milani
blush brush it does not take much
product so beware and I'm just gonna
blend this right here on the kind of the
outside of the apple of my cheek and
this shade is totally matte which I
appreciate because they've included not
one but two highlights in there with it
so it's nice to you know kind of be able
to go with the matte cheek if you so
desire
and then I will show you the difference
in these two highlights you can see one
has a little bit more of a pinky tone
one is kind of a just a white shimmery
very basic highlight both are super
pigmented but I'm gonna go with this
very softly these could also double as
shadows too so don't forget that I'm
going to start up here on top of the
cheekbone and I like to take it just a
little right on top of the apple of the
cheek because I think that always makes
like your full coverage your matte
makeup look that's the glow that I think
happens right there that really shows to
people when they're looking right at
your face head-on and it makes
everything look like oh that's nice skin
and anything left on my brush I will
just take down the nose for the lips for
this look I am torn because I could see
it going rich and deep and dark and
looking so great with this eye look but
the nude soft eye could be so beautiful
also and kind of with the shirt I'm
wearing it's got this kind of like nude
and black thing going on I think I kind
of want to go nude so I'm gonna go matte
and I'm going to use my daringly nude
shade from the maybelline creamy matte
line and I have prepped my lips with
just a little bit of lip balm which it
does help everything feel nice and extra
creamy not talking about peanut butter
here talk about lipstick and this is
just a great shade love this color I
forgot to finish my face with a little
setting spray I use the hard candy sheer
envy hydrating primer mist 3 spritzes
seems good and just let it fall right
onto the skin not from too high up like
just go right above your face and it's
perfect so thank you guys so so much for
watching I hope this tutorial was
helpful for any of you who might have
this palette and you were looking for a
little bit of inspiration I did fall out
you know a format that I really like to
use for my eye shape and you know the
way I like to do my shadow but feel free
to do the kind of look that you like
best I will say I've used this topi
shade in one of my recent videos I had a
lot of questions about the eye look it
was in the nude lip drugstore nude lips
video I had used this shade this color I
think this just a little bit of the
burgundy to deepen up the crease but
there was a lot of the taupe happening
that look being more on the cool side
and this look with all the gold any
warmth there's a big difference
so I think there is quite a spectrum of
what you can create with this palette
and then you know it's great to have the
blushes and the highlights in there too
so I think that about covers it
oh I was gonna tell you that's all I say
it's like I'm gonna wrap this up and
then the next thought comes into my head
but the foundation concealer everything
that I had on my face like before
starting the eye look that's basically
the routine that I had on in the
ultimate full coverage video so that
Urban Decay all nighter foundation the
Tarte shake tape concealer if you want
to see how that all applies I'll refer
you to that video and you know there's
the face and
now here's the ion lips so thank you for
watching again I will see you very soon
