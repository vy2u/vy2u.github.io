powders and powders that really defy the
expectation many of us have of powders
these are all powders in this video that
I feel can be applied in a reasonable
amount a light to medium amount of
product on the skin and they really
don't look powdery but they perform all
of the functions that you would want a
powder to do they make your skin look a
little more even they might add a little
coverage to your skin certain ones they
might decrease the amount of shine you
see on your skin but they don't have
that telltale powder sitting on top of
the skin type of look that a lot of you
know very random and average powders
could give you these are all powders
that I think do a good job of becoming
one with the skin so I did a video not
all that long ago on foundations that
don't look like foundation and I think
this video on powders was probably even
more requested might have been because
of that video or just you know powders
or maybe a little bit more intriguing in
this respect and it was harder it's
harder to come up with products of a
powder texture you know that really
don't look like their texture so I've
got varying price ranges varying
finishes on the skin and varying
coverage levels as well so I'm going to
start out with a couple that I see as
being capable of being a powder
foundation so giving you the most
coverage out of anything I'm going to
mention they can be used in conjunction
with other foundations if you really
like to layer them up or you could try
wearing them on their own it kind of
depends on what your expectations are
for coverage and just you know what you
want to do on a day to day basis but
first what I want to talk about is from
it cosmetics and the celebration
foundation illumination so celebration
Foundation has been a long-standing
powder foundation in the it cosmetics
line and then in more recent years they
have come out with the illumination
version and I don't think the word
illumination should scare you at all
from trying this product because it's
not like overly glowy glittery particles
you're not going to swatch this and be
like oh it looks like a highlight no
it's very much the coverage the softness
really rich texture that you would
expect out of a powder foundation but it
just had some more natural look on the
skin I think it looks more natural than
just the original that it cosmetics put
out and I wear this in the shade light
I've got this on today and I feel like I
put it through the true test because I
am wearing a very matte foundation
underneath I'm wearing the Catrice matte
mousse all over my skin so my skin was
already just super flat and then putting
this on top instead of adding to the
flatness I feel like it actually gave my
skin just a little more dimension a
little bit more of a skin like
appearance so I can't say enough good
things about this product definitely one
of my favorite powder foundations the
way I like to apply a lot of these
foundations generally speaking is with
this elf complexion brush $3 brush as
you can see there's a little flatness to
it when you turn it sideways but the
bristles are tapered all the way down
here so when you just kind of lay it in
powder like that see how it picks up all
along the side and then I just kind of
apply that in a light sweeping motion
all over the skin and I should have
pointed this out in the beginning but I
think these products are probably as
close to foolproof as you can get but I
hesitate to say that because I still
think certain powders that I'm going to
mention can be over applied pretty
easily and still got to look powdery so
you've got to exercise a little bit of
self-control as you do these products
start small see you know is that enough
is that giving me the desired effect on
my skin and also realize that not all
powders need to be applied all over the
face there are so many times when I will
just you know hit those areas where I
know the powder is going to help my
makeup last the most it's going to have
the most impact for me maybe on the
t-zone you know and maybe sides of the
nose those are effective areas for me to
apply powder but the thing I really want
to point out about this it cosmetics is
a similar product on the market that
I've been using even longer and that's
the NYX stay matte but not flat powder
foundation fantastic product so so worth
mentioning here the reason why I don't
have it is because that's one of the
very few products that I have completely
used up like I was scraping the outer
edge of the pan to get all of that
product out so when it comes down to it
and I use the
one up I will probably go and repurchase
the Knicks because they are that similar
I think in texture in the way they look
on the skin I truly feel like that one
has essentially all of the same
qualities is the cosmetics so throwing
both of those out there for you as an
option now if even the thought of a
slight glow on the skin from your powder
foundation is a turn-off to you you may
want to look into this puppy this is the
Chanel double perfection Lumiere long
wear flawless sunscreen powder makeup it
does have SPF 15 in it I wear this in
the shade 32 beige rose and this is
super impressive because I do feel that
it is a matte finish powder that does
not look powdery it's probably the most
skin perfecting powder that I'm going to
mention in this video it's just really
special I mean I know several of you
have tried it you've commented on other
videos where I've mentioned it you said
yeah that stuff is the real deal it's so
nice I would say kind of an
across-the-board thing that powders that
I really like have in common
is when you touch them when you feel
them between your fingers they have a
velvety smoothness that stays even as
you continue to rub your fingers
together and some powders just totally
rub away and it's like okay I can't feel
anything there anymore how does like
this one or like the it cosmetics you
continue to feel them becoming one with
your skin and actually smoothing out the
texture of your fingertip so I could go
on all video about this stuff but this
would be the powder foundation this or
the NYX for the subtle hint of glow this
is your matte powder foundation that I
don't think looks like foundation or
powder let's move on to more of a
middle-of-the-road coverage wise powder
I would say this is like your classic
pressed powder and this one has I think
an across-the-board different feel from
so so many drugstore pressed powders and
it's the Revlon nearly naked and I have
this in the shade light I think this
line runs a little bit dark because I
mean I don't know I would glance earth
at and assume maybe that's medium you do
have a mirror although there is a clear
window right there and this powder is
crazy smooth I would call it like a
natural matte finish so you can put it
all over you can tell that you have done
away with some shine let's say you're
using this is a
but it doesn't look entirely flat and I
don't know some people might feel they
could wear this like a powder foundation
maybe just pair it with some concealer
on a light day and you know you check it
out see if you like that coverage level
but I would say it's less coverage than
the last two that I mentioned it still
just has that really high-end softness
to the feel it's so so different from a
lot of drugstore powders now something
that is really new to me that kind of
kicked me in the butt instead go ahead
and do this video and make sure you
include this product it's the Too Faced
primed and poreless skin smoothing
pressed powder
I love the soft pink and gold compact oh
it's so pretty and I believe it was
makeup by Tiffany D who inspired me to
go ahead and make this purchase
I think she's talked about this product
several times and I went ahead and got
it and I was so thrilled with how this
worked on my under eyes so as a setting
powder or as a touch-up type powder so
something you could take with you on the
go dab over the t-zone I really feel
like this looks so invisible but it
really is doing something you know it
can modify that under-eye area and just
not look too heavy at all it really I
can't identify the powder even being
there it's a powder that doesn't look
like a powder so the way this is
packaged you've got the product here it
looks like one of those classic white or
near white translucent powders and then
there's a puff in the bottom part I was
kind of fearing when I got this or when
I ordered it that it would be kind of
like maxed prep and prime powder which i
think is okay but sometimes I would
struggle to feel like I was picking
enough product up on my brush and the
overall effect on my skin would just be
kind of underwhelming I didn't feel like
it was really going there and helping me
out this I can see it mattifying I can
see it perfecting but I don't see
product and the brush that I've been
using with this pretty much anywhere I
want to put it like on the under eye for
sure but even if I go elsewhere on the
face I seem to just use this small brush
the small tapered brush and you can see
you dab into the product it definitely
does pick up on your brush but it
doesn't look white on the skin and you
can just dab this boom-boom-boom on the
under eye or I might also take it around
the t-zone yesterday I not only set my
under i with it but I used it later in
the day after I was already looking a
little shiny around my nose and it just
looks so perfect it didn't look like I
caked on a bunch more powder it just
looks smooth so if you're looking for a
good translucent colorless option plus
having it press makes it really travel
friendly you might look into this
pregnant poreless really good stuff
Thank You Tiffany and finally I want to
mention a loose powder here and this is
the one loose powder that I feel like
requires no special steps no you know
you got to do this and this and this
before you put the powder on and then
afterward you got to do this like it's
just straight-up like invisible powder
that still does what you want the powder
to do and I think used on the under eye
area that's a very touchy zone for
powder and this does really well there
it's the by Terry hyaluronic hydra
powder so this is a powder that actually
contains I think they called it like
little Spears tiny minuscule spheres and
it's the finest powder ever so these
things must be just the teensiest
spheres of hyaluronic acid and it is a
totally white powder it is just light as
air when you put a brush into this
expect to see a small cloud because it
is so light and it can go airborne so so
easily a lot of really light white
powders you would put on your skin and
really be able to identify what you just
put there you know you might have to go
to a little extra work to make it look
more natural this I swear it just kind
of goes invisible on the skin but it
actually does mattify it does smooth it
does seem to do I think a little bit of
blurring if you've got some fine lines
in this area and for me I kind of feel
like the two-face is surprisingly
capable of doing a lot of what this is
doing but it's just in the pressed
version so it's kind of like which
format do you like but I know this would
be less expensive than this one but it's
truly like a devious little loose powder
I mean it goes anywhere on your face and
you're like what what where is it but
wait oh I look good okay and these are
not the only powders that I like there
are other powders a prime example would
be like the Milani multitask powder you
know this is a good one but it certainly
looks like powder it will do everything
you want coverage wise but you'll just
see it more on the skin you'll maybe go
to greater lengths to make it not look
like powder by
layering other stuff on if we're talking
baking you know the airspun loose powder
the NYC loose powder those can do a good
job for me and look pretty darn fresh on
the under eye but really only under that
special circumstance where I am doing
the baking method putting them on top of
a very emollient concealer letting that
process take place and then dusting away
it's like a real distinct thing has to
happen with those for me to love the way
they look on my skin I wouldn't really
feel like I could casually dust those on
all over and think oh that doesn't look
like powder yes it does and one
honorable mention to this video would
have to be the L'Oreal True Match I feel
like it's really close to that Revlon
nearly naked and this comes in a
fantastic shade range this has been in
on the market for a long long time the
True Match powders I'm honestly kind of
surprised that they don't market these
as powder foundations because I think
the coverage is really good it's a
little more matte I think on the skin
than the nearly naked not quite as
downright buttery on the skin is that
one you have to maybe watch yourself
just a little bit more as you're going
to down applying this all over the skin
but it's still a really strong contender
for this type of powder I'm talking
about so maybe you're saying Emily I'm
not in the market to pick up a new
powder I've got to use what I have so a
few tips I think to making the most of
any powder would be number one don't
overuse realize what your skin needs
powder wise you may not need that powder
everywhere and you may not need a lot of
another little trick here would be some
highlight on the skin taking it on top
of the cheekbones and all the way down
to right in this area I'm not saying you
need to get right up on the sides of the
nose where maybe you're prone to
noticing a lot of pores but get it down
at least into this area because then
when people see your face there is some
glow happening you're taking away some
of the madness that powder has created
so like today I'm wearing this makeup
revolution vivid baked highlight in
golden lights whatever highlight you
have I'm not saying you need to lay it
on thick or anything but just a light
amount taken right down in here can make
a world of difference for the overall
look of the skin and then a setting
spray there's nothing like a setting
spray to take away a powdery look with
these special really wonderful powders
that I've mentioned in this video
oh I'm not saying you would absolutely
have to use a setting spray on top but
for me it's really become that part of
my routine where I'm like what have I
got to lose you know it always seems to
help a little bit so I like this hard
candy sheer envy hydrating primer mist
12 hour power so that is what I have to
say about powders and I hope this was a
useful video for you again I think most
any powder has the capability of being
screwed up of being over applied of
being caked on a little too thick but
these are the closest to being foolproof
as I can find and I'm just really
pleased with the results that I get from
these and I hope you'll like one or two
of them as well thank you so much for
spending a little time with me today and
I will see you very soon in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
