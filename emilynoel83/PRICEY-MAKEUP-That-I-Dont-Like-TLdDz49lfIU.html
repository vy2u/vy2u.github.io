gonna start out with the classic
disclaimer when you talk about a bunch
of things you didn't like these are just
my opinions
some people might love them if they are
to your taste or your liking that's
great but I'm just gonna get the apology
out of the way now I don't want to
offend anybody with my opinions here but
I do think it's important to share the
things that you don't like and the
reasons why just so people having better
understanding of products and also it
kind of gives you a little insight into
my preferences so you know a little bit
more where I'm coming from when I give
different reviews and I know some of
these things I've seen lots of positive
stuff said about them so they're not
necessarily all while like the worst
things ever but they're just some things
that I didn't light and for me I tend to
get more disappointed the higher the
price tag of the item when it doesn't
end up working I think it's just maybe a
little higher expectation that you have
the first thing I'm going to mention is
my Lancome juicy shaker and this is so
cute
like packaging it looks like a little
drink shaker it's got the like two
layers of product your pigment and the
oil that's supposed to mix together when
you shake it I have the shade called
walk the lime I think these come in a
bunch of different names and scents and
colors and stuff absolutely wanted to
love this because I wanted to be like
shaking this little bugger I don't drink
shaker all the time but I really just
don't like the feel of it on my lips it
feels really really greasy to me and so
I'm going to shake it a few times here
so it can start to combine the shaking
action and the little clicking that you
hear there is combining the pigment with
the oil and I have done a little trial
and error with this I've continued to
shake it more in hopes that that mix the
product better and made it maybe feel
less greasy on my lips but it is just
kind of a thin greasy feel and as far as
lip oils go I have been using these
Milani ones so much and granted they're
not pigmented and they're not meant to
be colorful in any way but the
consistency of this kind of oil is quite
a bit thicker and it's not in an
uncomfortable way for me it really feels
to me like moisture is being locked in
and it's not gonna just immediately
drift outside the lips I could even
sleep with some of this stuff on and not
be too worried about it getting messy
you know with this um just the thinness
of the product I like that it gives that
little tint of color
I do enjoy that and this color is pretty
as you can see it's a reddish shade and
what you have is this kind of spongy
really wide pointed sponge and you would
just kind of dab that on your lips to
make some of the color come off and it
is sheer you know it's not gonna be like
a super opaque look but you can see
there when it's not fully catching the
light that's the kind of tone it takes
on on your lips mine does have kind of a
limey like margarita type scent and I
like that I like the look I like the
concept but when I put this on my lips I
just immediately want to take it right
back off and I don't feel that way about
a whole lot of lip products absolutely
adorable I just wanted a little thicker
more like stay in place consistency so I
think I was talking about this on
periscope recently but I'm not planning
to purchase any more of those another
thing that I was kind of disappointed by
and I will explain I know a lot of
people might really love this palette
this cheekathon palette for benefit and
if you've got it and you enjoy it you
know keep on doing your thing tune me
out here if you want to I feel like
there is a lot of inconsistency with
these powders these box powders that
they've put into their own little
full-size pans in here I think there's a
lot of difference between these and the
originals I have identified one as being
in my opinion better than the original
one is the same and then three I think
are quite a bit different it's not like
it takes a really keen eye to identify
that they are different from the regular
box powders that I have now in this
products favor I absolutely love when
brands
take products that are part of their
regular line put them into a pallet you
know I like having that compilation of
things that's not limited-edition and I
think it's a great value for people
because you are getting lots of product
here - these are full sizes but I can't
help but mention that there is something
off with the quality on set
of these now first off dandelion I feel
like the dandelion blush in here is more
bold and comes off with more pigment and
more pink eNOS on my cheeks than the
original bit I felt like the original is
like a very like watered-down didn't do
anything for my skin this looks more
like a pink blush on me so okay thank
you for that change hoola seems to be
the exact same tone as the regular hoola
that I have but rocket or Dallas and
coralista all seem different rocket or
this one's more faint than the one that
I have in the regular box powder format
not that this tends to be a very bold
blush anyway it's a very like shimmery
almost blush highlight hybrid in my eyes
but this one seems much more faint not
as pigmented Dallas which I love Dallas
but this one comes off more brownish and
it's kind of lacking that little soft
dusty plum eNOS that the original has
also I don't think it feels as soft as
my original and coralista this comes off
just kind of light and shimmery and not
nearly as much pigment and depth and
actual coral tone as the original one
has so I just you know maybe I'm the
only one who's picking up on this I
haven't heard a lot of negative reviews
on this product and like I said if
you've got it and you're using it and
you're loving it go for it you know
enjoy this isn't the kind of like
disappointing product where I'll set it
aside and never pick it up or never want
to use it again because I think they're
decent they're usable but they're not
the same as the original and in a couple
of cases particularly with rocket or
coralista and Dallas I think they're not
quite as good as the way the original
ones were so another thing here that I
have from benefit they've come out with
a whole bunch of new eyebrow products
and this brow foe which I think that's a
really cute name the conditioning primer
number one I don't really see the point
it's kind of awesome that they've
released so many brow products but at
the same time another part of my brain
says is it way way over complicating a
very simple thing and I
feel that way with this product like do
I need a conditioning primer on my brows
and anything I've read about in the
claims says that it will like make your
brows appear to be thicker healthy or
whatever all the claims that I've seen
have been in relation to appearance of
brows not like it's going to actually
make your brows thicker or do something
for them in that way but my issue here
and it is just a little you can see the
product clicks through this kind of
rubberized silicone feeling tip and you
just brush that through you're supposed
to click it up once and go through your
brows and what I don't get is that it
kind of makes my brows very stiff maybe
I've just got like way more brow hair in
there than its intended to be used with
this product but I get this in there and
after about you know 30 seconds when
it's had a little chance to dry down my
brows feels stiff almost like I've
sprayed a hair spray on them and I touch
them and they feel kind of hard and I
don't see that is really conducive to
putting more products on top which is
the claim that you can use this alone or
you can use this underneath products and
it's going to be a good base type step
when my brow hairs aren't just soft and
normal I mean stuff I put on top of it
doesn't go on very evenly so I didn't
see this as a really good priming step
and even when wearing this alone it
doesn't really make my brows look
thicker what it does is it makes the
individual brow hairs stand out a little
bit more or kind of like chunk together
and look a little darker but in my eyes
it makes it look a bit more patchy but
I've tried their little cream pomade
type product I liked that they have kind
of an angled thicker brow pencil that I
didn't think I was gonna really enjoy
but that worked pretty well for me too
and of course gimme brow has been kind
of my gold standard when I look for
tinted brow products that can really
hold and have the tint and you know have
the small brush and all that that works
great and I know there are even more
products that I haven't tried in this
new brow line but as far as what I have
tried this seems to be the thing that I
think you could totally skip and be just
fine another thing that I have had
around for a little while I haven't used
until just recently it's from makeup
forever and it's called the ink liner
and I know I have heard people say some
really great things about this eyeliner
it's a matte black liquid eyeliner it's
got kind of a long felt tip I know you
can't quite see where the wand leaves
off and the felt tip begins but it's
pretty stiff except for right at the tip
the tip is just a little bit flexible
and as I applied it it was so black I
was like yes okay I get it I see why
I've heard people rave about this but
then I start wearing it throughout the
day and I could not believe how I guess
fragile might be the word for this
product aware of this product was so
like flimsy for me I had a little like
eye watering moment you know I'm right
at the corner of my eye kind of strange
but whatever and I had a nice wing
created with this liner and I just kind
of rubbed it away and I looked at my
finger and I had all this black just
immediately coming off and it's not that
I'm really asking this thing to be
waterproof I just want it to be
something that's going to be a little
bit resistant to you know just the
common wear of the day I'm not asking to
jump in the pool with this stuff on and
still have it looking great when I come
out but it was like once it started to
smudge a little bit it was all downhill
from there I ended up with smudges like
above the eye it was starting to
transfer up into that crease area I
never had that problem with eyeliners
and this was so black it was just very
obvious I was glad I was just at home
while this was all happening because you
know if I would've been like this would
have been kind of a debacle and I did
ultimately end up removing all my own I
think up here um because it was just so
weird and messy I just think if brands
are gonna create a fabulous black
eyeliner that looks so black and so rich
and creates just such a wonderful line I
do think they have maybe a little bit of
a responsibility to make that wear a bit
better
some products annoy me some products
actually cause pain and that would be
these products these glam glow plump
rages products and it's lip treatments
they say and one is the brilliant or
shiny plumping lip treatment and one is
the matte so I do think it's cool that
there is a matte finish lip plumping
product out there I have never seen
anything
like that before having that kind of
claim and the packaging is really cool
once you figure it out once you stop
twisting it the wrong way or stop just
trying to pull it out you twist it a
little bit there so your little wand
becomes exposed and then you just pull
it out so this is the mat that I've just
pulled out here that's a little like
silicone tip and you put it on your lips
and it really is free from shine but it
totally does have plumping action and by
plumping action I mean a sting this is
the most painful lip plumper and I've
tried lip venom I've tried a lot of
different lip plumpers I can take a
little bit of tingle and I don't mind it
let's just say if I were wearing this
out in public somewhere I don't think I
would be able to really disguise the
fact that I was in pain while wearing it
just burns a lot and both of them burn
on me but the glossy one burns even more
and I will say the glossy one seems to
have more of a plumping effect on my
lips as well and it looks like it has a
little bit of a yellowish tint there but
I tell you what once this is on your
lips for a little while my lips become
really rosy not from this changing
colors but from whatever stinging
activity is happening on my lips they
just naturally get this pretty rosy look
to them I like the look I like the way
they look a little bit more plump when
I'm wearing it but I cannot handle the
feel it's just too much for me and also
if you should happen to inadvertently
lick the product even after you've wiped
the lip plumper off your lips because
you're like it's good enough you're
still gonna feel some of that burn and
if you happen to lick your lips it
tastes so bitter and your tongue will
start burning too maybe you're into that
kind of thing if you are
it's the glam glow plump rageous
products that you want to look into but
if you prefer to have a pain-free lip
product experience you may want to look
last thing it's not necessarily an
all-out failed product it's more like
something I just want to ask about if
anybody else has had this experience
because I've found a way to make this
product work for me but it's kind of
like a mechanical packaging type fail
and it's this hourglass veil mineral
primer it says oil free I love the way
this primer feels it's so like silky but
yet I feel like it's still a little bit
nourishing hydrating for the skin it's a
really interesting fine line that it
seems to walk there and it is pretty
packaging you know it's got this pump
style now watch as I pump some out here
on my hand it's coming out as pure
liquid it's just running off my hand
like milk now that's not the actual
consistency of the product and I've
cleaned my pump out if there was a clog
in there I think I would have been able
to deal with it so what I do if I want
to use this is I kind of like work this
little guy around and I will get some
off on my hand and that's the actual
consistency see how it's not running
anywhere it's a little more like a just
a cream so I don't know what's happening
with that like I said I don't think
there's anything clogging the pump but
at the same time I feel like that that's
got to be the only thing happening cuz
what's down here in the bottle seems
fine it's not like something changed in
the formula it's just something with the
pump and I would say the first maybe
dozen times I've used it it pumped out
just fine and then I started having that
issue so I don't know if anybody else
has had that problem with this and it's
not a huge gripe because like I said I
can still get into the product and get
use out of it but at the same time it's
an expensive product and when pumps are
on product you want the pumps to work
thank you guys so much for watching this
video I hope these insights maybe in
some way helped you out maybe you just
come away thinking hey she's picking
every product I pick up I use it with
hopes that I will love it and get
excited about it and enjoy using it and
have good experiences with it but it's
just not everything is that way or some
things just have that little like quirky
you know why did it do that type thing
so I'm here to keep it real for you
thank you for watching and I will see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
