I'm bringing you today but I thought hey
it might just be helpful if no one else
helpful for me because I'll be ridding
some things out of my purse I have been
toting around way too many lip products
and I would encourage all y'all to lock
in your purses and see what's exactly
hiding in there because I used to be
really good about only pretty much
taking the product I was using for the
day the lip product I was using for the
day with me in my purse and then at the
end of the day I would take it out and
put it back you know with my makeup and
everything was hunky-dory I only had
like one maybe two products in my purse
at a time and what products were really
the main thing I would take with me to
touch-up anyway I do keep a compact in
my purse but really lip products are the
extent of the touching up that I might
do on the go I know in the past I had
taken a lot of makeup with me like years
and years ago and I realize like I'm
just not gonna touch up my eyeliner even
if it does look faded I'm just not gonna
take the time on the go to touch up my
eyeliner or redo eyeshadow and stuff
like that you know I will take some lash
glue if I need it that is something that
also lives in my bag but I have still
been carrying my nice Turin bag I think
that was the name of it I got for
Christmas and it still looks like brand
new even though I take it absolutely
everywhere it's a great size for taking
any amount of toys or books for Belle
that I want to carry with me but not
looking like I'm carrying a massive tote
or even a diaper bag and then of course
it holds all my stuff in there too a
wallet my phone anything else I might
want to take I could do it what's in my
bag if anyone's interested and like the
little go-to things that I usually have
on hand for me and for Belle but always
in the bag is this little thing which is
a newish edition it's called the mini
Pichette and I thought this would be
great to have my keys in here and I
could also put my phone in here and if I
just want to take you know not not take
my whole purse in somewhere I can have a
few essentials like my cards my phone my
keys a lipstick you know something like
that and I can just grab it and go and
it is so functional in that way and it
really holds a surprising amount
and I just I love the quality I love
this red lining that's in there too
but here's the issue I have loaded this
down completely loaded it down with lip
products to where I probably couldn't
fit anything else in there like we just
need to weed these things out so I've
got this thing full of lip products and
two more that I found in the side pocket
of my bag so I thought I would just go
through and show you what lip products
are living in here and what I think
about them maybe some mini reviews so
first thing this was just kind of
lurking in the purse and this is in the
shade lust for blush it's one of those
matte one of those wonderful matte
Maybelline lipsticks don't you love
these if you have them there are several
that I think are just amazing the
daringly nude touch of spice and then
this would be another like major
frontrunner from that line it's a
beautiful pink kind of a cool pink eye I
do love that line of lipsticks they're
so opaque and they're creamy they don't
have a big like dry down
uncomfortableness to them so that's
awesome still doesn't need to be living
in my bag but it's awesome
another thing oh this was what I got
from my late-night Mac haul that I
mentioned in another video when I
couldn't sleep and saw they had free
overnight shipping this is the huggable
lip color in bear-hug I don't really
hear anybody talking about these too
much I don't think but they are like
kind of a lip balm sort of a tinted lip
balm type thing is what it makes me
think of and this is a light like
corally pink color very shiny super
comfortable so yeah if I do want to take
something to slap on on the go I mean I
definitely reach for this many times
when I've forgotten to throw something
in my purse and there is a swatch of the
lust for blush by the way beside that it
always it's a little bit darker I think
sometimes swatched out and put on the
lips than it looks in the tube okay
another thing that I decided to actually
wear today this is from Clarence and
I've got several different Clarence
things that I'm testing out right now
and this is the instant light natural
lip Perfector in 0-8 I think is the
shade and I'm wearing it with my spice
lip liner perfect spice lip liner from
Too Faced really pretty shade it's very
sheer its kind
like a sheer berry and I really love how
it's like that spongy applicator but you
squeeze it and the product comes through
like multiple little holes there and you
get a really nice even application but
there's a look at that it's very shiny
but it still has an element of Sheerness
to it if I wear it over a lip liner like
I feel like it looks like a little bit
more is going on on my lips and my lips
do look a little bit more perfected but
just alone I mean if you like sheer lip
colors it's nice but I would almost like
a little more color coming out of that
also coming out of this bag I've got
this makeup forever this is one of the
artists flexi glosses in number 204 this
is a gorgeous shade love this color
really creamy rosy shade absolutely I
think works for just about any outfit
any look that I might do see how it's
got a lot more warmth than that berry
shade beside it love the shine and the
staying power the applicator is just
genius with these two I've talked about
this before but it's like a flat little
spatula and it just really takes the
product right out to the outer edge of
your lip and you really get a nicely
defined edge with a lip gloss so that's
very cool
oh this shea moisture this is the shea
moisture like jumbo lipstick pencil in
the shade Sarah and I remember reviewing
this and my big Shea Moisture video and
I kind of think that the Jumbo Stix are
a similar formula to the actual
lipsticks which I love I think they're
so comfortable so moisturizing really
pigmented and this is kind of an
interesting like hot pink but it has the
slightest like bluish reflective quality
so definitely a little pop here going on
from all of these a little bit more
natural everyday type shades got another
Clarins lip product in here um real
fancy looking gold lipstick it says
Rouge it clay is that how you say that
I don't know 26 Rose praline is what it
says and here's your kind of soft warm
pink it's very pigmented even though it
feels lightweight and shiny I really
like this color I've got several other
colors that I'm excited to try but I
feel like so many people would enjoy
that like kind of
t'rul warm peachy-pink these kind of
remind me of wearing a Revlon lip butter
though because those I feel like always
gave really full color but they were
shiny and they were kind of marketed as
a non lipstick lipstick you know so I
like that oh speaking of that same idea
I've got this this is the one that from
the beginning was just gonna be the
thing that lived in my bag because I
love this shade it's so light it's
definitely a no mirror required type lip
product and this was the only one that
was like invited to stay in this bag
okay everything else just kind of crept
in oh there's one gloss that I also
invited to stay in there but all this
other stuff is just kind of riffraff
they just found its way in just kidding
I like you I just don't need to take you
everywhere this is the Elm a smart shade
butter kiss lipstick in the shade light
love this stuff this is so so like my
favorite on the go lip product you'll
see when I swatch it out it's like it's
got a little bit of a golden eNOS to it
it's definitely peachy it just looks
really radiant on the lips I'm a little
bit of my natural lip color shows
through and it just looks so pretty
super comfortable you don't need to be
in perfect lighting or have a mirror
even to put this on so I love that and
plus it feels really really moisturizing
and then the other thing that I was you
know kind of keeping in there is a nude
gloss that I love see I think new you
know regardless of what my cheek or my
eye look might be for the day this gloss
will always look good and it is my nude
balle l'oreal extraordinaire lip gloss
this is just this is the perfect nude
gloss I've said it before I'm saying it
again I know you people out there gonna
want a good nude lip gloss and there it
is
ooh it's so good I love it so you could
layer that on top of this for a little
extra shine or wear it alone it's great
alone as well or on top of your favorite
nude lip liner awesome and now all I
have in here are my keys
and a little bit of change and that's it
so I think I am going to put these two
puppies back in the nude ballet and the
Almay new light just because you know if
I am
somewhere and I need something to touch
up with I think those are ideal I could
totally once again fit my phone in here
some cash some cards or whatever it
might be so yay
back in action but some of my favorite
other things that I pulled from the bag
love like I said certain shades of this
plexiglass this was 204 from Make Up For
Ever those are awesome the maybelline
creamy matte lipsticks are great Shea
Moisture jumbo lip pencils this is the
only jumbo lip pencil I've tried but I
love this and the lipsticks from this
line are great as well MacLaren's stuff
I've been trying like I said I got some
more shades to experiment with that may
you know make me feel like oh my gosh
this particular shade is a total
must-have but I have a sense that I'm
gonna come up with some lower-cost
things that work kind of just as well
we'll see though these are pretty
low-maintenance nice quality they feel
nice on the lips I just need to do a
little more investigating so if you guys
are watching this and you're kind of
inspired and you're thinking hmm I may
be hoarding a whole lot of product in my
purse as well show me what's in there
like take an Instagram picture tag me in
it or even do a YouTube video and send
me the link because I think this is just
how real life happens you know time gets
away from us and before we know it we've
got how many things were actually in
here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 lip products
randomly in our bags thank you guys for
watching and I will see you soon in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
