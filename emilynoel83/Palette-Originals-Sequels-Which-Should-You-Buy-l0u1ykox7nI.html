great to have you here this video I have
been thinking about doing for quite a
while and I've really been kind of back
and forth on it because I think palates
can be really subjective when it gets
down to what you like over the first
edition of the palette and then the
inevitable sequel to that palette
because a lot of times quality will be
consistent for example you like the
quality of Urban Decay eye shadows the
ones in The Naked 2 palette are probably
going to be really similar to the naked
one but it's more about what you prefer
in terms of shade selection I think with
a lot of these and so I thought if it's
just going to be me given my opinion on
what shades I like best does anybody
really care but I do get asked these
questions a lot which should I buy so
we'll go through these kind of
rapid-fire I'll let you know which ones
I like best and as far as my opinion on
them you know you can take it or leave
it maybe this video will just give you
some things you might not have thought
about before if you're considering that
second palette from whatever line it
might be in a lot of cases I got to say
I like the first one's best it's
interesting to really lay everything out
and look at them Andres top and realize
that the original that I got is the one
that I probably use the most and like
the most so I'm going to kick things off
talking about the lorac Pro palette and
this is the first one that came out and
I absolutely fell in love with this
palette I continue to love it I think
it's great quality eyeshadows very soft
very very pigmented and the kind of
shadows you're going to want to tap off
some excess you know because your your
brush will really pick up a lot when you
go into these but I just loved how it
was one row matte one rose shimmer but a
lot of the basic shades people would
want got that dark matte brown the black
the really true black by the way light
brown a really great mauve a gold a
taupe in there I mean there's just so
many fabulous things happening in this
palette and I almost think it's like the
more I enjoy that original the more
critical potentially I'm going to be of
whatever comes out is the second edition
so I of course got the lorac pro 2 and I
do like it I think it's great quality
super pigmented the shadows are soft and
easy to work with but it's
our shade selection goes I don't think
it's quite as essential as this one is
you are getting some interesting shades
that Navy I mean gosh this palette is
growing on me and it's primarily for
this Navy shade here it's gorgeous
just more kind of like in-betweener type
accessory shades in this palette it's
like this is the beautiful dress these
are some of the accessories you'll put
on with it does that make sense at all
while we're on lorac let's talk about
the unzipped palette I like this just
about as much as I like the lorac Pro
original palette I think the shades in
here are just stunning this palette
awakened me to how much I love a golden
e or rose gold shade paired with a deep
rich burgundy type color because you can
do that with this palette I have done
some of my most favorite eye looks ever
with this palette I just think the
shades are stunning lovers of rosy
shades of rose gold shades this this is
amazing quality so more recently lorac
comes out with the unzipped gold
yeah these shades are beautiful I can
rally around a great dark brown I can
rally around a beautiful gold but the
uniqueness for me is not there with this
palette this is special to me because
it's got rosey and mauve shades it's got
gold any shades like the shade uncovered
right down here but you're pairing it
with something that's a little different
than just deep brown this super dark
burgundy shade unbridled here is
exceptional and it makes such a
beautiful partner to these metallics
here I mean I've done looks that I like
with this but it's just not as special
as this one just my opinions just
tossing this stuff out there food for
thought okay we've got Urban Decay Naked
this is the original Naked palette I
love it it's my favorite of the three
main naked palettes versatility is the
big reason why I like this best I think
you've got a couple of really great
essential basic mattes in here like
naked and buck and then you've got fun
shades to go in so many different
directions with half-baked a fabulous
goal you got some purple a tones you've
got some tones that even border on cool
bluish colors um you can go very deep
and dark very light and natural Naked 2
comes out not saying I dislike it
because it does have
the great quality that I've come to
expect from Urban Decay but I think
you're loaded with mid-tone shades in
here that don't give you near the
variety of looks that the naked one does
it's an overall cooler palette I think
if you really like topes you might enjoy
this it doesn't give you that one matte
black in there that is nice to use as a
liner or something to create some
contrast but I just find I can't get as
many different looking looks with the
two as I can with the one then they came
out with the Naked 3 and it's all things
rosy and this again does not give me as
much variety as the naked one but I do
love the color selection I personally
like the rosy tone shadows a whole heck
of a lot so my ranking on these would be
the naked one is my favorite this is my
second favorite and this is my third
favorite I'm going to move on to the
balm and nude tude new tube palette is
amazing I love the bombs palettes I love
the creativity behind their palettes
just like packaging concepts and
everything but the quality of the
shadows really does back that up no it's
not all totally cutesy frills but the
shadows are actually really really good
this really is one of my favorite
neutral palettes I love the variety of
finishes in here they really do a good
job of sprinkling in fully matte shades
dark shades and light shades and even
some shades that have like a little bit
of an interesting sparkle going on as
well you've got super super dark black
and brown I love the shade cult sexy
here it's a great dark berry wine type
color it reminds me a lot of lurex
eyeshadows in terms of the quality and
then they came out with nude dude and so
this is a fairly recent release here
nude dude also gives you some incredibly
dark colors but in terms of the
mid-tones I think they do a little bit
more with rosy type shades and this was
one palette where I thought the second
edition I'm not saying is not pigmented
but I didn't find these particular shade
to come off as I don't know intense and
beautifully rich as the first one did I
really really liked that about the first
one and I just found a few of these
shades to just not come off as bold it's
one of those situations where yes I'm
glad I have
because I just I'm kind of a collector
of the ball my shadow palettes I really
enjoy them if somebody told me you know
you can only keep one I'd go with the
first one there's just a buttery
creaminess a beautiful texture
especially with those shimmery shadows
that's just really exceptional let's
talk about Too Faced and the chocolate
bar palette the packaging could not be
cuter I mean for those of us who love
chocolate this is just a great thing and
I also love that the shadows of course
smell chocolatey as everyone and their
mother has probably pointed out it's a
nice mix of basic neutrals with a few
interesting pops you know some shades
that give you a little something
different than just the typical Brown
look I like the plum I like this gold a
whole lot but I think it's overall a
brown lover's palette with just a few
extra pops and I really really like it
so then the semi-sweet palette came out
and this is a situation where I think a
packaging improvement was definitely
made with the second edition I like how
this is slimmer but it still gives you
that kind of chocolate bar feel that the
first one had and whenever I look at
these side-by-side my eyes just kind of
keep going back and forth and I'm
thinking you know gosh I see a lot of
similarities but I kind of see just
enough differences you know what I mean
at first I really wasn't all that
compelled by the semi-sweet palette i
shocker was even thinking about not
buying it oh my gosh should I went for
it and I've kept pulling it out and I
honestly really liked it this nougat
shade up here may not look like anything
too fancy and special but I think that's
just a great like soft pinky beige color
that's so so necessary it helps in
transitioning and blending things out
and love peanut butter in here it's one
of those fantastic kind of Terra Cotta
type colors a double whammy down here
your gold your rose gold love that
something I loved about the original
that might take it just a teensy step
above the second one was that I love
this shade right here this burgundy I
thought was great and I loved pairing it
with that gold and this shade up here
was kind of plumbing as well so if you
really like plum colors the semi-sweet
doesn't have that going on at the same
time I still really like this I like the
mixture of shades it's kind of hard to
define this palette but I would say this
is a brown lover's palette and this is a
brown lover's other palette I like them
both a whole lot and finally for the
lovers of all things in that you've got
the it cosmetics naturally pretty matte
palette here it's a great grouping of
matte shades that aren't all completely
just brownish neutrals you know what I
mean you've got some fun shades like
this one right here sunset gorgeous kind
of orangie warmth coming out of it
you've actually got plums and navy blues
I think there's a lot of directions you
can go with this palette and I think the
texture of these shadows is incredibly
easy to blend one into the next it's
just super easy to work with then around
the holidays they came out with the
celebration palette which this is one of
those that I have the full review on so
if you saw that you already kind of know
my feelings I'm not sure if this one is
still available and by the way both of
these have that shimmery transforming
pearl type color that you can work with
- I don't know accentuate some of these
shadows go over them give them a
different kind of finish but I just
really prefer the shade selection in the
first one over this one I think there
are more unique things going on in the
first there are more pops I guess of
colorful shades here you've got some
really nice deep and dark colors you've
got some nice quality neutrals but
there's just not enough jumping out at
me in this palette you can get some
pretty looks with it but not the kind of
special different type looks that you
can get with this one and as a whole I
really like the first editions of these
palettes best and it might have just
been that the shade selection and those
happen to appeal to me more might not be
that way for everyone but hopefully this
video gave you some info so you could
maybe make some decisions for yourself
the sequel's that I have that I really
am enjoying almost as much as the
originals right now would be that
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette I
really like that and also the lorac Pro
- like I said I'd if I had to choose
between one and two I would pick one but
this one's really growing on me again if
I have specific reviews and tutorials
using these palettes I will link to them
below and thank you so much for watching
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
