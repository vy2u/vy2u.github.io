be comparing two pretty popular pallets
and they are both pallets that I have
done two and one tutorials on somewhat
recently and one I just did last week
it's the Too Faced natural eye kit and
then the Urban Decay Naked palette which
of course has been talked about a lot as
well so as soon as I kind of turned out
both of these tutorials a lot of people
asked me so christmas is coming I really
want to get one of these palettes
which one should I get cuz I'm not going
to get both and so I thought maybe just
do videos sort of explaining the
differences and maybe why you might want
one or the other and which one is that I
think I print that I personally think is
the best value so yeah let's get started
first off on the Too Faced natural I hid
the packaging is really cute and I've
always been impressed with Too Faced
packaging as you can see here you know
you've got like this little box and it
opens up like that has kind of a
magnetic opening there and up in the top
it's kind of neat because you have a
little guidance with this kit it's set
up pretty user friendly in terms of how
you use it as well because you've got
looking across it says dey plastic and
fashion so you've got three different
looks easily mapped out for you going
across and then there are three cards
that show you how to put that together
so in that respect I find this palette
pretty easy to use but at the same time
you have a few less options there aren't
as many shades in this palette as there
are the Urban Decay Naked palette have
some matte shades so you have like a
really nice white here this kind of
neutral shade and then a very very deep
dark brown which really serves as your
smokey shade in this kit because you
don't have a black in here either but
then looking across you've got some
really nice shimmery shades I love these
two I think they're pretty unique and
then down at the bottom and really ultra
shimmery shade there with nude beach
some people say that's too shimmery to
use very well and then
a nice gold and then this shade called
Coco Puffs down here so I really can't
complain about the pigmentation of these
I find them all to just be really great
color wise and I have no complaints
about the way they go on or how well
they last I mean I just really like this
for a neutral natural look I think it
definitely delivers on its own on its
goal or its per the purpose of this
palette I think it's definitely achieved
so now the Urban Decay Naked palette
packaging wise it's got like kind of
this velvety sort of feel on the outside
and you are getting more colors with
this one you're getting I believe it's
twelve one two three four five six seven
eight nine yep you're getting 12 just
had to make sure it didn't like mislead
anyone there but you can see the colors
there inst in terms of the range it is
basically most things that the natural
light kit has and a little more so
you're going through and you're getting
you know soak up a few matte shades
thrown in here with shades like naked
and buck for you know things you can add
to your look just for a very natural
contour of something and then you've got
some high chamois shades you got like
sidecar is really pretty you've got a
nice gold bear with half-baked smog and
dark horse kind of lead you to that
smoky look it's kind of a smoky Brown
not quite as dark dark horse is not
quite as dark as the deepest Brown in
the natural eye kit but it still works
for like a brown smoky eye I think
and then you've got toasted and hustle
which kind of get you into more the warm
plummy tones and then what the other
palette definitely doesn't have is a is
the shades here creep and gunmetal which
almost a border on having a blueish
undertone but it's kind of like a great
shape for your smoky eye very pigmented
and gunmetal it's very beautiful as well
so I mean just watch a few of these for
you they these are very rich I feel like
they always kind of felt that the Too
Faced shadows are kind of similar to
urban decay shadows really a good
with these shades you know you put one
on part of your lid and then it's very
easy to kind of blend them together and
get a really finished polished look
without a whole lot of effort so great
pigmentation once again not upset with
the quality of either of these pallets
however you're looking at the naked
palette you get more shades you also get
a double-ended liner which is really
nice I was really excited to try this
because I had never tried the 24-7
liners whiskey is the brown and Xero is
the black so that's nice to have and
also it comes with a little Urban Decay
primer potion now I believe I'll have to
double check the cost on this I believe
this one is a little more expensive than
the natural eye kit but you are getting
quite a bit more and you think about
what you pay for you know the individual
liner or the individual prior potion and
that kind of stuff can add up so those
sorts of things are what give you like
the total eye look so it's nice to have
that all together you can get the brown
eye you can get the golden kind of glowy
eye and you can get the smokey eye even
plum colors with this palette but you go
to the natural eye kit yes they're great
shades and I really enjoy them and I'll
continue to use them but I don't think
that this is quite as versatile you're
gonna be staying mainly in that neutral
brownish range with this and that's
basically you know what you probably got
it for if you do have this unlike it I
like them both I think either one would
be you know good to get but if you're
looking for probably the best value and
the most options I would say go for the
Urban Decay Naked palette so hopefully
guys this helps sort out some of the
questions I was getting after I did both
of those tutorial videos and please
check those out if you're looking for
ideas again both were two-in-one
tutorials so I showed two ways to use
the Urban Decay Naked palette and two
ways to use the Too Faced natural eye
kids so hopefully it helps you out
thanks so much for watching I hope
you're having a great day and I will
have more videos to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
