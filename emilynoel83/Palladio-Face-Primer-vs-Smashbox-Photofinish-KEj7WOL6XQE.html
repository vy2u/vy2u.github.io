for this video I am so excited to tell
you about the Palladio herbal foundation
primer I feel like I have found
something that is rivaling Smashbox
photo-finish which I have in the small
size because I ran out of my larger size
but you've heard me pretty much since
I've been doing videos talk about how I
really enjoy the Smashbox photo finish
primer I feel like it gives my face the
feel of silk you know it's like what's
the benefit to a foundation primer well
you're going to put your moisturizer on
put the primer on and it's going to give
you more even skin texture and that in
turn is going to kind of create that
barrier between your skin and your
foundation and keep that foundation from
like kind of seeping back down into your
pores and just give you a more long
wearing more even finish so it helps an
application and helps in state power
those are the benefits to a primer so um
yeah I've used Smashbox photo-finish for
a while and I just love how you put it
on it's clear it's gel like and you
don't feel like you're really adding
another heavy layer to your skin
sometimes you put on your moisturizer
and then it's okay I've got to put on
another thing now but this goes on so
smooth and so just you know wonderfully
well and I've yet to find anything that
really is just like Smashbox
photo-finish
um in my quest for this I picked up the
Revlon beyond natural smoothing primer
you may have seen this in your stores um
I really thought maybe this will be like
Revlon or like Smashbox just because it
is that clear gel like consistency but I
put this on and gosh it just does not
apply it all the same it feels you
rather than having silky smooth your
skin still feels like there's some
moisture on there and it just does not
feel nearly as smooth it's it's almost
like you've put on some kind of
moisturizer and it just has sort of a
like if I was to run my hand over that
hand that I have the beyond natural and
it kind of catches if I run it over this
hand gosh I couldn't stop my hand it's
so smooth with the Smashbox on there so
it's just not at all the same it feels a
little heavier you definitely feel like
something is
sitting there on top of your skin then
to my point of my review I got the
Palladio herbal foundation primer and
this stuff is as close to smashbox as
i've ever seen and my goodness it's a
fraction of the price i mean
even one of these small ones from the
smashbox is going to run you I think
maybe around $15 and then the large
sizes of course more expensive than that
but um yet comes in a little squeeze
tube like this you get some on I'll try
this on my wrist since it's the bare
area I'm smoothing it on and it feels so
much like Smashbox it's not even funny I
mean once you rub your hand over it once
it's been rubbed in it's like it doesn't
feel like anything's on your skin but
your skin feels smoother I've worn this
ever since I picked it up I've been
wearing it under my foundation and
getting you know the similar results to
what Smashbox gives me sorry I'm like
looking kind of closely in my mirror
right now I feel like um I feel like
it's keeping my makeup looking fresh
throughout the day I mean I feel like it
has the same staying power benefits that
photo finish gives you but bottom line
is cheaper and it feels so so similar
it's great um another primer that I'm
impressed with pallate from Palladio is
the eyeshadow primer I know I've talked
about that before but that's really
really good too and I'd say that's
better than ELF that's better than
L'Oreal decrease and it's rivaling more
like your Urban Decay primer potion and
Too Faced shadow insurance so Palladio's
got some good things going on here with
their products they're available at
Sally Beauty Supply when I found this
like I was so excited and I remember
telling Tyler I was like I found
something like Smashbox photo-finish
Eddy was probably like whatever that
means but I was really excited to tell
you guys about this there is a little
buzz even started I noticed on the
Beauty broadcast facebook page about
this so I would really suggest checking
this out if you've been curious about
Smashbox or if you're just sick and
tired of paying that amount of money
this is going to function basically the
same so thanks so much for joining me
for this review on the Palladio herbal
foundation primer available at Sally
Beauty Supply and by the way you get 20
ml
leaders 0.674 fluid ounces in one of
these so thanks again for watching guys
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
