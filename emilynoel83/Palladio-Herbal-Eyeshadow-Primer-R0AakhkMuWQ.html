tuning in for this video um this is
going to be a fairly quick review
because I have a really Scratchy sore
throat right now I think I've been
dealing with some allergies or something
because if you're a friend of mine on
Facebook or if you just follow me on
Twitter or something you probably have
heard me kind of say like ah got a
really scratchy throat right now and it
really kind of hurts to talk and
definitely to swallow but I thought I
would be able to do this quick review
for you because it's a product I've been
using for probably about the past three
weeks pretty much solid and I really
like it a lot it's from Palladio and
that's a brand that's available at Sally
Beauty Supply and it's the herbal
eyeshadow primer this is really really
good not too long ago I did a big review
I think I called it my massive eye
primer review and I reviewed like at
least four or five different eyeshadow
primers and I know my favorite one has
been two faced shadow insurance for
quite some time because I feel like it
really has the best staying power it's
in a nice little squeeze tube and it you
can really get all the product out and
it just really helps your you know
whatever kind of eyeshadow you use helps
it really last throughout the entire day
so I really really have been a huge fan
of this one but until now I mean this is
probably one of the only ones this one
from Palladio that really is just about
as good as this one
which this one is going to cost you
close to 20 bucks and this one is less
than ten dollars at your local Sally
Beauty Supply there's an obvious
drawback to this one which you can
probably see I mean if just by looking
at it it's the issue most people have
with Urban Decay primer potion sorry if
it just escaped me there but and it's
that it's in this sort of tube with a
wand applicator which does make it
harder to get all the product out I mean
with a squeeze tube you can really get
get all the product but I guess
considering that this is a lot lower
cost and it's still
works as well if not better I mean
staying power wise I've had this on all
day my eyeshadow looks like it did when
I put it on and sort of texture wise if
I put some on here it's kind of like a a
creamy nude color if I just put it on
kind of thick there you can maybe see
just a little bit but you you rub it out
and it maintains just a little bit of a
somewhat tacky feel to touch it but it's
overall really smooth it gives you a
nice smooth feel and that slight bit of
tackiness that remains which is not a
lot it's not like greasy or anything
like that but there's just a little bit
to give that shadow of something to
cling to so not only is it increasing
the wear of the shadow but it's helping
it be more bold and vibrant as well I've
used this with some not so pigmented
shadows and it still really helps them
stand out one of the ultimate test of
this was actually a couple weeks ago and
I was having additional I don't know if
it was an allergy related issue or there
was just something in my eye and my I
was really watering and I was sitting my
desk I was trying to type at my computer
and just kind of forget about it
eventually went to the bathroom and
looked in the mirror and I'm thinking
like okay this is my eye makeup is going
to be done for because I just kept
rubbing it and touching it and messing
with it and that's one of the classic
things that kind of causes your makeup
to wear off if you are like touching
your face a lot that kind of thing but I
looked at my eye shadow and my eye
shadow was still the same like you know
I looked down and looked into the mirror
and I'm like okay this is a seriously
good product because I know there was
moisture in that area and the fact that
it could hold up to that was really
great so this is a really good product I
definitely think that if you are
considering some of those more high-end
eyeshadow primers and you're thinking I
want that effect I want that really long
wearing you know a finish and just
something that I'm not gonna have to
worry about fading as I go throughout
the day but you don't want to pay that
price this is definitely at a drugstore
cost without a doubt one of the best eye
primers I have used and talking about
L'Oreal decrease I know that's a
comment primer in the drugstores but
this one works definitely better than
that one for me and probably a little
better than the elf mineral eye primer
as well so this is definitely right up
there with Too Faced shadow insurance
which is one of my favorites so thank
you so much for tuning in for this video
thanks for bearing with me through my
big like swallows and you know just try
to get through this a couple days here
where I've had this horrible sore throat
so thanks again for tuning in and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
