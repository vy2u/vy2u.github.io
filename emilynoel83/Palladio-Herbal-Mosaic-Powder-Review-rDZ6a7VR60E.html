tuning in for this video I'm gonna be
telling you all about a new product that
I recently tried but first I have to let
you in on something that I did today
that was so cool so different something
I've never done before I got to ride in
a monster truck it was for a live report
I did for my newscast that I do and so
got to go out and like stand right up
next to the truck I'm like five feet
tall the tire was like almost as tall as
I was like this truck was gigantic I
have some pictures I'll show you
but I got to ride in the truck I got to
get in there with one of the drivers and
climbing up in it it's like a task it's
like kind of a jungle gym inside the
thing and anyway there's some big show
coming to our area this weekend so they
were kind of in the in their region and
it's just we like to do fun visual
things like that if we can it's a
morning show so we get to have a lot of
fun with it
so it turned out really well it was just
really entertaining and just something
that you don't see every day I mean the
trucks these are the kind of trucks that
like jump way up high and like crush
cars and stuff and I really hadn't been
exposed to anything like that before
really knew nothing about monster trucks
but it was just definitely an awesome
experience to get to see it up close and
see how gigantic it is so anyway how
about makeup
for those of you who are more interested
in makeup than Monster jerks the product
I'm going to be talking about today is
from Palladio that is a brand available
at Sally Beauty Supply it may be
available elsewhere but I know for sure
that you can find it at Sally Beauty
Supply and Sally Beauty calm but the
product is the Palladio herbal mosaic
powder and the shade I have is desert
rose and this is a you know one of those
neat powders that you can like swirl
your brush through and just wear it all
over your face so it's it's very
different it's very unique in that this
powder is not 100% shimmery a lot of the
different mosaic things that I own are
like you know each color in it is
shimmery so it's like basically purely a
highlight you couldn't feel like you
could just wear it as a blush or wear it
like all over your face because you just
be too shiny and what's neat about this
at least this shade that I have in
Desert Rose like a couple of the shades
have shimmer these two right up here but
these other ones are just very pigmented
colors and you could wear it as a blush
or you could wear it wear them as
eyeshadows
and there's a pretty big variety of
colors so you can get some that are more
like neutrally and they could totally
work as eyeshadows themselves but the
colors are very just silky smooth to
touch them to your finger and the way I
like to wear this is to just take my
blush brush and swirl it in all these
shades and what you wind up with is a
really pretty
like peachy type blush so I'm really
enjoying this so far I just like that
it's very multi-dimensional and you
don't get like a 100% matte blush but
you don't get a too shimmery blush
either so it's nice that it kind of is
able to give you the best of both worlds
where that's concerned in case you're
not oh it's too familiar with the
Palladio line they're known to be very
um very natural products they have a lot
of vitamins herbs and just natural
ingredients in them the brand does not
test on animals so if that's something
that concerns you as well that's good to
know and it's just they they sell a lot
of different things that I've been
interested in in the past I have loved
the tinted lip balms that they sell they
are absolutely fantastic they have other
lip glosses and like baked products but
just wanted to talk about the mosaic
powder because it's sold for in the
ballpark of seven to eight dollars
sometimes you can get a special deal or
discount that knocks down the price a
little bit but basically its price like
other drugstore products are and it's
just a really fresh powder I have it on
my cheeks today and it's just I feel
like it gives a real natural pop of
color without being too blush like or
too highlighter like and that sometimes
a complaint that I feel like I get from
people that are struggling to find the
blush they like I really like covergirl
cheekers blush but some people are kind
of put off by the scent or they just
don't like that blush for one reason or
another and I just feel like you do want
your cheeks to have a little luminosity
but too much shimmer just makes your
pores stand out it highlights wrinkles
it does a lot of bad things so the fact
that this incorporates just some true
pigmented color
is a nice blush and you're kind of able
to like I said swirl swirl them all
together and get your own unique shade
or you could use more so on the lower
ones here and get like a totally matte
peach shade but again my color is desert
rose you can browse the website to see
what else they have to offer but it's
just somewhat of a new product that
Palladio is offering now so I hope you
enjoyed this review I know it's not too
controversial like my 5 what did I do
recently I did the 5 products I regret
buying and it's just a really negative
video so this one seems very happy in
comparison but thank you so much for
tuning in guys and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
