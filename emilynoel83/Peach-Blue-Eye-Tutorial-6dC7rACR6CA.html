for this video I'm excited about this I
tutorial its kind of inspired by the
shirt i have on which heads like some
orange and blue in it so it's kind of
like an orange on the lid blue for the
liner and sort of the smokey effect so i
think it's a good look for summer or
really any time of year even if you're
not wearing those shades you of course
don't always have to match your
eyeshadow to your outfit but sometimes
it's your outfit that just inspires you
to do certain things like this tutorial
for me so if you want to see how I put
it all together keep on watching first
step I'm going to take my Coastal Scents
creative meet palette and I'm going to
use this kind of pretty metallic peachy
orange shade and by the way this is the
creative me number 2 palette from
coastal scents and I'm just going to get
some of that on my elf I shadow brush
just any kind of regular flat eyeshadow
brush will do kind of look down into my
mirror and pack on that shade if you
want more of like a sheer peachy look
just do a little bit otherwise it's
really buildable so like I'm going to go
back and put a little more on and you
can see that it's really building up to
be like a nice peachy orange color once
you've built up your desired level of
color there on the lid I'm going to take
this write-up from the peaches this
coppery shade right here in the palette
I'm going to use my Smashbox number 15
brush it's kind of like a wider crease
brush get a little bit of that copper on
there and just apply that to the crease
so that's it's going to be deeper than
your orange and it's still going to have
like kind of a metallic look but I just
want to use it kind of to get the color
a little more intense there in the
crease and just kind of use you know
windshield wiper motions back and forth
to blend that and then I'm going to take
a larger brush I'm going to use my
Smashbox number 10 brush just a really
full brush with no product on it and
just use that to kind of blend it out
further all along the edge from there
I'm just going to apply a really light
highlight shade I'm going to use this
color
X and it's called my favorite color and
you can see it's got kind of like that
pearly light sheen to it so you could
pack the shade like this on like for
example if you put it on your lid you
can get a really light shimmery color
but for this we're using a really fluffy
brush just to get a wash of light color
up I'm going to pull out this color from
glam couture isn't it gorgeous it's a
shade called mystery and it's just a
beautiful blue eye shadow and so I'm
going to use my medium sized crease
brush from in that it's the larger of
the two and the essence of beauty crease
brush duo you can find that at CVS and
just get some on the brush they're kind
of looking down and I'm putting this in
the crease and it's basically like
you're going to get sort of a just a
deep color there it's going to just look
like your your crease has a deeper
contour to it but as you get out to the
outer v area I think the blue is going
to show up a little more so just
continue to get more on your brush and
kind of work up from the outer corner
and kind of down from the top so you can
kind of start to establish that outer V
this there you go as you can see as you
continue to build up the color you get
more of that bluish tone and the sparkle
on this I don't know if you think this
is a good thing or a bad thing but the a
lot of this sparkle doesn't necessarily
come through on the look like you make
it a little bit but unless you
absolutely pack this on you're not
necessarily going to get like that kind
of a look so just keep that in mind next
I'm going to take a navy blue cream
shadow this is from Smashbox and it's
the jet-set waterproof eyeliner in
midnight blue I'm just going to take a
smallish brush like this i think this
one came from Coastal Scents there's no
like label on it so I don't quite
remember but just take any small liner
brush you like to use and really any
cream liner will do
it's like a navy shade and I'm just
going to line all the way across my
upper lash line i'm just going to kind
of start in the middle here just to sort
of get it going and then i'll start you
know bringing it into the inner corner
here and I'm trying to keep my line
fairly thin so I don't cover up too much
of the orange that we've got on the lens
I get to the outer corner I'm making it
a lot thicker and I'm building it up in
that outer V you can kind of see there
it's starting to blend in with the blue
shadow which is what I'm going for there
so you can see just kind of carrying it
out from straight across there and
you're getting a nice amount of like
definition there on the outside then I'm
going to take a little bit more on my
brush and just for blending purposes I'm
going to take this down just a little
bit under the lash line and just kind of
connect it right there in the outer
corner just so it all really blends and
then I'm going to finish the under eye
with some more of the mystery shade that
we used in the crease and so that's
basically going to be like on our
natural lash line but i am going to also
use the jet-set on my waterline so I've
got a low down into my mirror I'll be
right way I've just got jet set now on
my waterline and I'm taking some more of
the mystery shade the mystery shade the
name is actually mystery and I'm just
using an angled brush to sort of get
like a smoky appearance to that shade on
the lower lash line there now it's just
a little detail brush you can also use a
q-tip going back to that orange shade
that was all over our lid and I'm just
getting a little more of that and
putting it down around the tear duct
area next I'm going to curl my eyelashes
and apply some of the lash stiletto
voluptuous mascara to the top and bottom
and I'll join you with the finished look
alright guys this is the
finished look I hope you like it it's
really not too hard it's got using kind
of wide combination of different
products but of course you don't have to
use the exact same things I use if
you've got to shade that's similar or
liner that's similar you can definitely
use those colors you don't have to use
just what I did but I'm on my lips I am
using a couple different things gotta
grab my lip gloss that I used here I
used this to face lipstick and celebrity
meltdown first off the packaging is
adorable here and the lipstick is really
unique it kind of looks like kind of a
dark color but it actually has this
really pretty I don't it may not show in
this shot that has a really pretty like
gold undertone that I like so playing
off of that I used a gold lipstick or
lip gloss it's the Rimmel vinyl bronze
in golden goddess so it's kind of sheer
but over the top I think it works and it
just kind of really mixed the lips pops
so thanks again for watching everyone I
hope you have a great day and I'll see
you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
