this video how to get a really wearable
peachy brown look mainly peach on the
lid Brown sort of in the crease
and I think it's just a really nice look
as we sort of start to head into spring
and it's nice because you can make the
intensity like kind of a smokier Brown
or a more natural Brown so it's really
one of those looks that you can totally
customize and make it however you want
it to be but first before I get into the
eyes which I'll go step by step on I
wanted to tell you about a few of the
products that make the whole face work
with that peachy look and on my lips I'm
using my Revlon matte lipstick in nude
attitude and so that's just a nice matte
shade but I went over it with a pretty
peach gloss from Smashbox
it's called glide and so it's a nice
like peachy with some gold any tones to
it so yeah it kind of takes away that
matte effect but I do like having that
it's sort of my base color just to
lighten my lips overall this was part of
a I think it was a limited edition
actually kind of Christmas bunch of
things but just you know kind of a color
suggestion for you if you have anything
it's like a peachy gold floss that'd
look good as far as the rest of my face
you know I went went with some different
products to accent the peach enos I used
my golden pink blush yeah do I need to
get some more of that or what from
covergirl I use that as my contour shade
and then I used my Rimmel blush in peach
I don't know if you can see that that's
just kind of like a nice peach shade
just on the apples of my cheeks and I
kind of dusted it all over and another
really really neat thing from Physicians
Formula this is new I don't know if
you've seen their shimmer stripes or
shimmer strips that's what they are
it's a neat combination for a for a
bronzer palette and this is the peachy
glow set it's an it's a new one that
they've put out and the camera may not
be picking it up super well but this top
shade is really pretty peachy and it's
called Waikiki strip and
so I used that like just on the tops of
my cheekbones there and kind of up in
here actually before I went on with the
eye makeup so anyway just a little
rundown of what's going on on my face
and now let's get started with the ice
we applied some Too Faced shadow
insurance to this eye and so the next
thing I'm going to do since this is a
sort of peachy warm look I think the Mac
rubenesque
Paint Pot would be the perfect sort of
cream shadow to prime my lid with um
kind of on top of my just just as a
cream shadow base not necessarily like a
um a primer in itself but I'm just
putting that lightly
all over my would it's just gonna goes
right along with the tone we're working
for with this which is really just nice
and warm and peachy on the lid okay the
next thing we're going to do is reach
for our 88 shimmer palette and the shape
we're gonna be working with the peach
shade that I'm sort of surrounding this
look on is right here it's kind of a
light peach and we're also going to be
working with this sort of kind of stone
color right next door to it this one
right here so this is the peach and then
this one next to it but for that peach
color we're going to just apply that all
over our lid and it's sort of a peachy
orange it's in that orange row on the
palate so just going to apply that all
over my lid
and that you'll see that it works really
nicely with the Paint Pot and if you
want more the more orange you look you
want just the more you can keep building
this for just a sheer peach just do like
one or two you know kind of applications
of that then we're gonna take that shape
right next to it that I was trying to
describe to you it's sort of like a
medium taupe shade right there and sorry
my nail polish is chipping off right now
got to redo that did I do
I'm gonna use my sort of medium sized
crease brush and I'm gonna dip into that
and just use this as a wash of color all
over the crease and this just just nice
shimmery sort of shade but shimmery
shades that are a little bit darker I
think are really fun to work with in the
crease so so just use that all over to
kind of deepen the crease go back for
more if you want and this is a would be
a if you wanted to use this look for
daytime this is where I would stop on
this color for the shadow I think it
would be perfect time to incorporate
that matte brown shade which I'm
obviously not gonna find in the 88
shimmer palette so I'm gonna use it in
my L'Oreal hip duo and foxy it's this
nice just matte brown shade and I'm
gonna take my fine crease brush dip into
that color a little bit and use this to
sort of start developing an outer V here
so kind of putting it in the outer part
of the crease outer part of the lid I
just work it up as far as you feel
comfortable we're kind of working up
from the outer corner of the eye and
then over from the from the crease so
over from the crease up from there if
that little diagram just made any sense
I don't know
and like I said just get that as deep as
you want it to be I'm gonna stop there
and then I'm gonna go back to the
shimmer palette and I'm going to go up
to the very top shade in our little
orange e peach row that we've been using
that one right there and so this just
tents still had those has those nice
peach tones but it's not quite as
colorful I guess and I'm just gonna take
my fluffy rounded crease brush and just
use that to not only go all over my brow
or a brow bone I'm not gonna put it all
over my eyebrow but I will go on my brow
bone with that and use it to sort of
just with a really light touch blend
over the border of the darker shades we
we've applied there and there you go
that's your shadows we're gonna move on
to liner I'm going to be using a new
product it's the Revlon Colorstay liquid
eye pin yeah sounds really promising
doesn't it and considering how much I
love Revlon Colorstay liners you think I
would love this too but gotta break the
news to you guys I do not really like
this I don't like how the intensity is
just not what the the regular Revlon
Colorstay liquid liner in like with like
the little inkwell you know although you
have a ton of control with this format I
feel like it's more it's more diluted
and just not as black and I thought
maybe it was just this is the second
time I've used this and I thought maybe
it was just an issue with it being the
first time I was using it and maybe the
product wasn't really filtering all the
way down as much as it should to the
absolute tip but um no it's still acting
the same way but either way I'm gonna
use it at least for now and just be
aware that if you're trying to go over a
very shimmery shade especially like what
we're using now um it just doesn't seem
to handle that well it can't totally
block out the shimmer and just be black
like the other so expect a review on
this
more in-depth later on the more I use it
plus I'm going to have to wait around a
little while to see if it actually dries
up quickly like other pins I've use so
love the pen concept but just haven't
had a ton of luck and in case you I was
kind of talking off topic that whole
time but I just kind of winged out that
liner a little bit then I'm going to go
for an old standby that I love my Revlon
Colorstay liner this one in pencil liner
that is in black brown and so for that
I'm just gonna kind of connect it up
with that liquid and then just line all
the way to my you got that liner all
taken care of we're gonna go back to the
matte brown shade in our L'Oreal hip duo
and get my angle loops get my angled
liner brush here just dip into that
matte Brown and and set the liner that
you just did okay now I'm gonna go ahead
and curl my eyelashes with my handy
dandy elf eyelash curler next I'm gonna
apply a quick coat of my L'Oreal lash
out mascara alright guys the next step
is to apply a set of false lashes
they'll turn out to look like this side
over here they are Ardell fashion and
number 106 and I do have a false eyelash
application video so just to keep this
one a little more concise I will just
put the link over there so you can check
that out if you're curious as to how I
apply false eyelashes I do it pretty
much the same way every time in that
video covers alright guys there is the
finished look a nice peachy Brown look
that you can just make pretty much as
intense as you want to add some false
eyelashes and really tops off the look
well I think so I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
