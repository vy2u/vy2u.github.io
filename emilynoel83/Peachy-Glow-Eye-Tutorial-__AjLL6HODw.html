probably winding down your summer and
heading back to school or you're
continuing to go to work like i am and
you just want a look that is easy pulled
together and very very simple to you
know you don't have to put a lot of
thought behind exactly every step that
you're doing and this look that i'm
going to show you today uses not a lot
of products and it's not a lot of
products throughout the entire face
because i'm using this palette from
physicians formula it's the shimmer
strips in waikiki strip it's their
peachy glow bronzer but it functions in
so many ways is a highlighter as I
shadows it's a very like monochromatic
look meaning that I've kind of used from
lips to cheeks to eyes it's all the same
sort of golden a peach color family so
if you want to see how I pulled this
look together and created a super
wearable look for almost any occasion
keep on watching one is to prime your
lid and I'm going to use my Mac
rubenesque Paint Pot that color just
really is right in line with the look
we're doing today with these peaches and
bronze tones so just get that all over
your lid they're pretty golden II base
and then I'm going to take my physicians
formula um this is the shimmer strips in
Waikiki strip this is the peachy glow
bronzer and so you've got like a peach
tone up here at the top and we go down
to like a sort of a warm brown so
basically I'm going to start out by
taking the second strip which is the
most sort of golden e of the bunch and
I'm going to use my elf I shadow brush
and I'm just going to pack that on all
over my lid so you can see how well this
works with the rubenesque Paint Pot
underneath it's really grabbing those
gold tones and making a stand out I'm
going to kind of work that in right here
in the inner corner as well
go over that some more with another
product later next I'm going to take my
flat Sonia Kashuk I shadow brush I'm
going to go down to the very bottom
shade which is the deepest of bronzy
brown in the group and just get some on
that brush and this isn't going to be
like a really deep contour it's going to
be like a super run like natural crease
shade I really like it because you're
getting the effects of like you know any
kind of contour shadow but just for the
fact that it's so warm and really just
meshes with the skin so well it comes
off in a really natural way keeping the
eyes really just bright and kind of wide
awake looking so just pack on as much of
that as you want keep in mind the more
you put on you know your shade is
getting a little deeper but you also are
adding more shimmer to it so one or two
kind of sweeps of this should be fine
then I'm going to take my Sephora
rounded crease brush just take any
fluffier brush that you have and go to
the shade right above that just a little
bit lighter this is so easy this palette
is so easy to figure out what to do
because I mean the shades are placed in
a nice range for you so you can easily
see if you want to kind of fade up to a
color which is sort of what we're doing
right now by taking that shade right
above the deepest tone and kind of just
going right above what we've done there
blending it all out getting almost right
on top of our brow bone there you can
see that we can create a really nice
fade I'm going to go up to the pretty
gold chains like kind of these two up
here sort of blend those together and
use that as a highlight you're just
getting a flawless flawless blend of
color here and then I'm going to take
that peach shade which is kind of on its
own up there at the top in terms of
peachy the rest are kind of golden I'm
going to use that right under the peak
sort of my eyebrow okay now you want to
start thinking about liners and I am
do something a little bit special with a
liner that I have it's from em use a and
it is in metallic gold it's this really
long ultra fine eyeliner i got it from
cherry culture a while back but it is a
pretty golden shade and i'm going to go
right around my tear duct area with this
and go about halfway in on the lower
lash line ok we're going to overlap that
with some more of the shadow but that's
going to kind of lay the foundation
there for that and then what i want to
do is grab some smashbox cream liner
this is in like a just a deep brown
shade i think this was a limited edition
a while back and i'm going to use my
Smashbox number 21 brush with the nice
little bend in it here that makes it
really easy to apply there so i'm going
to apply this um pretty much all the way
in just a really thin line of this brown
all the way to you know across my upper
lash line so i'm going to go ahead and
do that so i've gone from my outer to
inner corner with that deep chocolaty
Brown and I'm just going to connect that
with the outer corner kind of on the
lower lash line and just you know kind
of make both ends meet there and then
draw it in a little bit to where I did
that gold liner so I'm not making this
very harsh at all I'm just kind of
drawing into meet so you almost can't
even tell kind of where one begins in
the other end so it's really easy to do
that with this brush it's easy to give a
little bit of a smudged effect on top of
it so anyway once you've done that
you're pretty much done with this brown
now and I'm going to take my almay
eyeliner in black and this is going to
create a really kind of stark contrasts
with the whites of our eyes by just
going over our water line here
so just kind of draw all the way into
your tear duct area just stay right on
the water line so now we've added a
little more drama to the look by kind of
lining our water line but keeping
everything else a little bit more
natural and something I've just been
loving to do lately it's really
highlighting this tear duct area because
I think just sort of that central part
of the face you know we're kind of
attracting attention there and it just
gives a more wide awake look so I'm
going to go back to that gold that's the
second strip in this set and that's what
we put all over our eyelid and i'm just
going to overlap your call i put that
gold liner there so it's really going to
grab this gold shade and it's just
gorgeous especially in natural light I
mean I realized this is kind of like you
know i'm setting up sort of a lighting
situation so you can see as well as you
can you know what I'm actually doing but
in daylight this is just a really really
pretty look too ok so the next thing
we're going to do is just curl our
lashes I'm going to apply two coats of
the covergirl fantastic lash mascara I'm
using blackest black two coats on the
top and probably like one coat on the
bottom and then I'll join you with the
finished look and tell you what else I
used on my face
all right guys here is my finished look
this is super super easy to do and it
wasn't necessarily that this was the
kind of look that was difficult to the
point where you needed me to really walk
you through every single step but it was
really important to me to point out to
you guys how these pallets from whether
they're from physicians formula or I
have done this sort of concept with some
of the glimmers strips or glimmer
stripes from Milani these are a great
multi-purpose product because the these
pallets generally serve two functions
for your face in terms of bronzing and
highlighting but they also are a whole I
shadow palette in itself and a very easy
one to use that because you've got the
full range of color here you can easily
see how you would kind of fade and blend
from one shade to the next if you're a
beginner and you're also trying to cut
costs and sort of you know get find a
product that can work in more ways than
one for you these sorts of pallets are
great i know on the high end like Bobbi
Brown makes a shimmer brick and you know
these sorts of products are you're
seeing them more and more from various
brands but physicians formula is one and
you know they have sort of some
different tones that they have they have
blushes that are more in the pinks and
like I said Milan ease glimmer stripes
are great they have even more of a range
within the palette I found like a white
and a darker Brown and they're the same
texture is like Milani eyeshadows so
those are great so just keep an eye out
for things like this and realize that
they can make a great I look but also
their great all over the face so I'm
going to kind of explain what I've done
on my face here i used my sterling
minerals mineral foundation my shade is
I use the velvet formula in Hannah and
that's something I reviewed a while back
on my blog and they are superior quality
i mean the this coverage i mean i kind
of look at my face and I feel like I've
put a liquid on I'm getting that good of
coverage there it reminds me a lot of
the intensive formula for everyday
minerals but anyway on what else I used
was my bronzer I just dusted on my
maybelline mineral power bronzer and son
kissed and then i use my maybelline
mineral power blush in true peach so
then after that I kind of went in with
this and did some highlighting and a
little contouring keep in mind that when
you use a shimmery shade as a contour
it's not going to be a drastic contour
by any means I usually prefer to use a
matte shade as my contour but this all
over as a bronzer is great so I kind of
dust it all over my face once more to
give that really glowing look because
we're heading into fall are kind of
leaving we're starting to leave summer
behind but I think a great glowing face
is always in style I guess you'd say so
I use some of the Bronte shades kind of
all over and then I specifically use the
lighter shades too I like the cheekbones
here and just sort of a little bit above
my eyebrows you know kind of coming full
circle just really lightly is the key
and then I of course used it on my eyes
and on my lips I'm just using a simple
gloss from Revlon it's the super
lustrous lip gloss in foiled okay so
there is just a it's it's golden it's
lighted shimmery and it just follows you
know everything we're doing with this
look so super easy very appropriate for
work back to school whatever you're
doing I just really had fun with it and
I wanted to pass it along to you so
thanks for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
