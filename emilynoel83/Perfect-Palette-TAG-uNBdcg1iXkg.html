this is going to be the perfect pallet
tag when I saw the questions for this I
don't know who actually came up with
this to begin with
but I was like this is genius this is a
great way especially if you're a big
pallet junkie like I am to really take a
good hard look at your collection and
figure out you know what things stand
out in different ways and maybe what
things you're not even using that much
if you're a video maker or a blogger and
consider yourself tagged to do this as
well I think this is a lot of fun
especially if you've got a lot of
pallets in your collection first
category is best packaging and it
probably doesn't come as much of a
surprise that I think the best packaged
palette is from the balm and it's my
ball Jovi palette and gets really cute
and creative every one of their palettes
is different from the next so I just
love how the packaging is really fun
there are a lot of cute names and
everything also I think size wise this
is great packaging they got a lot of
different products in here without
making it an enormous palette another
little detail here which isn't really
rocket science but a lot of brands I
think overlook this there are a couple
of cream products in the bottom but
they've got their own flap over them
here in the balm jovi palette so all
your powder stuff the fallout from that
does not get into the lip and cheek
product I just feel like this palette is
full of a lot of great little details
and I think the balms packaging is
always like number one for best color
payoff I think I could have gone a lot
of different directions with this but
I've got to give it to the lorac pro
because this palette is so consistent
all the shades in this palette are like
a team that's full of MVPs you know
there's not one shade in here
that's a dud or that doesn't have a
strong of color payoff as the next shade
I mean everything from the white or the
cream down to the shimmery like grey and
purple everything is really really
pigmented and I use this all the time
but it doesn't even look like I've
really made a big dent in it because I
only tap just barely into these shadows
to put them on and I know lots of people
have talked about this and I'm sure
you're familiar with the concept but
it's half matte half shimmer and I just
feel like you could get the deepest
darkest like black smokey eye with this
or you could use the lighter shade
and still get a look that really pops
and shows up and you don't have to work
hard to blend them out so just an
all-around great pallet the most
versatile pallet I was like looking at
everything thinking oh maybe it's this
one maybe it's this one and a lot of
pallets like you know about this big or
something and then I thought no way is
there anything more versatile than this
and this is the 252 ultimate eyeshadow
palette from Coastal Scents and this is
just jam-packed with every possible
color and finish that you could force
three different trays here for example
neutrals pinks yellows it's not just a
few different shades but it's the
spectrum and absolutely every shade and
this tray here just has a huge variety
from yellows to greens to purples and
then you've got a lot of greens and
blues and even some neutrals in here but
what's really outstanding about this
palette that I don't think a lot of
people realize is that every single one
of these in each of these three trays
each shade corresponds to a full-sized
hot pot so those are the sides of like a
Mac eye shadow so if you fell in love
with one of these shades and you're like
man I wish I had a bigger size of it
because these are all like the size of a
diamond look online they've got these
all mapped out and you could find that
one shade that you were after so that's
just a cool added bonus to this but as
far as you know a versatile palette you
could get absolutely any look under the
Sun with this stuff apologize if it
looks like I'm talking any differently
than this video maybe you haven't
noticed anything but I got a root canal
last week and I've still got some
sensitivity on my back tooth where that
happens so I'm really babying that area
and I don't want to accidentally like me
talking to all of you talking and then
like chomp down on it really hard best
palate for travel when I'm looking to
take a pallet with me there are a few
things I'm looking for I want it to be
compact in size I want it to be durable
and also I want it to be you know the
shades that I'm actually gonna wear I
love to take with me and I feel like
this is so underrated like I should be
talking about this more because I love
this as much if not more than my naked
palettes and it's the Urban Decay smoked
palette this Thank You Leigh durable you
know it's a very hard palette and it
zips open to where it's not something
even have to worry
about a magnet you know coming undone or
anything like that it's got a good-sized
mirror that's another great thing for
travel and then these shadows I feel
like I could get any basic look with
this kit I can get the neutral look that
I want with anything up top and then
I've got a few little colors to throw in
but everything's super wearable love
mushroom that's a great taupe a great
matte brown a plum kind of a bronzy
brown down here so all these shades are
just so so workable and I just think
that's an ideal palette for travel
another one that I sometimes take with
me which is a nice multitasker because
it's got the blush in here that I would
use and a nice big mirror is my Mally
more perfect palette and I've got all of
Molly's perfect palettes and the more
perfect one is the one that I always use
the most it's got my favorite blush
shades in here I love that pink it's not
like bronzy topi purple kind of shades
really dark shades if you want to turn
anything into a smokey eye you got a
shadow base there a cream highlight I
mean it's just a lot packed into one
palette and by the way malee does have
the little window over um the cream
stuff too which is a very nice
consideration as we say okay biggest
regret this was the one I thought on the
longest because I kept looking at
everything I had and I thought you know
I don't really regret any of these
purchases like and it might sound
strange because you guys know I don't
love every palette I own but yet I feel
like where my channel is concerned I've
been able to pass along good information
even if it's something I don't like or
use it to compare it to something else
you know it's had a function it's had
purpose that's finally the thing that I
kind of ran into and thought you know I
really didn't need this it didn't serve
much of a purpose for me nuance I quad
so small palette I get that but this
little guy I mean I don't know it's
different in its packaging style but
these are four shades that I definitely
have a lot of already in singles with in
other palettes and when you put it all
together this is not easy to store like
there's no place in my drawers where
this really fits
kind of stuck it behind a little thing
there on my bookshelf it's different but
I don't find it to be especially cute
the quality isn't awful but it's just
one of those things where I'm like okay
here's another thing to figure out where
to put it right if I had that day at CVS
to do over again I might skip this
purchase love this category best color
name one that I think is just awesome
and you're going to see me reviewing
this one soon is from Too Faced and it's
the one called a few of my favorite
things this is one of the holiday
pallets this is kind of like the biggest
baddest holiday palette and that's what
it looks like on the inside a lot of the
shades in this palette are named and
through the lyrics of that song so
whiskers on kittens moon on their wings
blue satin sashes cream colored ponies I
mean even the blushes are melt into
spring and raindrops on roses so I just
love that it follows the theme of the
song not every single thing in here does
but most of it and I just think that's
adorable and think about it like when
I'm doing a tutorial with this and I'm
like okay now put cream colored ponies
all over your lid like there's something
fun about that my least used palettes I
determined that they are these and these
are the profusion knockoff naked
palettes that I got from Walgreens last
year around Christmas time and I did do
a whole blog post about these kind of
making comparisons and showing you how
they created looks and swatches and
whatever have both the naked palettes
and these while they do kind of come
close in some aspects they're just not
as good and I'm about positive I have
not reached for these since my blogpost
on them about a year ago this have got
to be some of the least used things in
my palette area and fYI these are out
again in Walgreens but in different
packaging so just be aware if you see
things that look like these I do have a
review on my blog I'll link to that
below because I'm pretty sure they're
the exact same palettes just in a
different like pattern on the outside
here's the one that I really had trouble
narrowing it down on it says most used
most loved desert island and I tried to
keep this whole video to things that
were currently available now so if there
was something that really caught your
eye you would be able to easily get it
but I do have to
mentioned a desert island palette that I
so wish they would come out with again
is the Smashbox photo op mega palette I
still have and still use this thing it
actually contains like all of the
eyeshadows that are actually in Smashbox
is regular line along with a ton of
other products like blushes and
highlights and brow products and lip
products and the whole nine yards is
it's a wonderful formula I know they've
come out with smaller versions but this
is like the mack daddy so I would not
want to be without this if I could only
take one thing but there are some other
palettes that I do need to mention for
most used one of them is the Too Faced
natural at night palette I fell in love
with this palette when I got it and it's
been one of those where I keep going
back to it all the time there was a long
period of time where I didn't use the
olive shades down there and then fairly
recently I did and I was like whoa those
are gorgeous too but they've got some
really nice Brown got a nice mix of
matte and shimmer in here like this
matte cream shade and this matte light
brown gorgeous shade called Eclipse
almost has a little bit of a burgundy
tone to it it's beautiful so I just love
the look of this palette and I feel like
those are going to be our most used
palettes are the ones that you feel like
make your eyes just look the prettiest
you know you can use as many crazy
colors as you want but what actually
like brings the beauty out in your eye
color this is one of those palettes for
me also more recently um the lorac
unzipped I do have a tutorial using this
but these shades just draw me in and
they look good on my eyes loved palettes
that incorporate a little bit of
Burgundy and this has that some gorgeous
topes rosy type colors or just grand I'm
going to kick myself if I don't mention
the nude too because it's got the same
kind of thing going on there great topes
Browns really nice deep dark basics like
black and brown and then a great kind of
gray P wine color I just love it so much
for like really important event you've
got to look your best what are you going
to reach for I love these and then
desert island packs as much into it as
possible got to go with the mega palette
so I think that is
now yeah that's the perfect pallet tag
thank you guys so much for watching
again if you'd like to do this feel free
it's a really fun tag and I'll talk to
you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
