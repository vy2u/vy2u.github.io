first day of spring when I'm shooting
this and I've got my hair like darker
than ever and it's snowing outside
so yay but this is the perfect palette
tag part two and the lovely ladies from
the Isle of faces channel actually
created this tag the first time around
and then they also came up with this
sequel which i think is really fun so I
will link below to their channel and
recently I watched Kristin game and
Krystal Miss from Miss crystal makeup do
this and I love them I love their
channels I will link to their videos
also and the part one that I did of this
video too but it's really been a while
since I've done a tag video and here
lately there have been two come around
that I really want to do there's this
one and then Erica Jones recently tagged
me to do the blush tag I watched her
video actually watch a bunch of her
videos over the weekend and if you like
somebody with that Kentucky drawl then
you're gonna like watchin her cuz she
just I love her voice she's beautiful
she's great anyway blush tag that's also
on my to-do list but I'm gonna move on
to the questions for this one and the
first one is eyeliner brush or nothing
included like included it's the little
extra with the palette and overall I
think I would say nothing included
especially if it cuts down on the size
of the packaging or like the overall
price of the palette I could do without
the eyeliner or the brush a lot of times
I think eyeliner would be my least
preferred thing just because I really
know what I like with eyeliners I'm kind
of picky with them a lot of times it
would be like a pencil liner included
with the palette and there have been a
lot just thrown in with palettes that I
have not liked very much and the same
kind of goes for brushes there have been
quite a few that I feel like I just
don't use except the brushes that come
in the anastasia beverly hills palettes
like the amrezy palette or the self-made
palette I've got one handy over here
their little double ended brushes and
size wise I think they're perfect like
this is a perfect little crease outer-v
brush and there's usually like a flat
side that might be good for smudging or
a lid shade and these are totally usable
I take them out of the pallets I keep
them out where I'll actually use them so
that's kind of a nice little perk to go
alongside those palettes something good
to know but
in general I don't like a lot of the
brushes that come with the pallets name
a pallet you have hit pan on this is
rare it's kind of rare for me to hit fan
in my pallets but I feel like I'm going
to mmm does not happen often for me with
pallets particularly eyeshadow palettes
but I just shot my stash for this item
and realized that I had hit pan in here
on this mat it's kind of like a matte
highlight type shade I don't know what
if I was setting all over my face with
this powder and this one's looking
pretty low as well actually it has been
a long time since I've used this palette
with any consistency but it's back in my
shop my stash drawer I'm going to be
using it more often now definitely my
first pallet that I ever owned that
pertain to contour next question asks
what is your favorite Naked palette for
me it would have to be the naked one I
think I've addressed this before in that
video where I talked about palettes
equals probably but I do have a soft
spot for Naked 3 because of the rosy
colors I just love those kinds of shades
Naked 2 is no slouch either I mean I've
gotten some gorgeous looks with that but
I think in terms of my like palette
priorities variety wins out a lot and I
think I can do the most different things
with this palette and just the quality
the textures of these shades are
wonderful or recently I feel like there
have been so many naked dupe type
palettes that come out and there are
some great ones don't get me wrong but
in times when I'm testing swatches and
just the textures of them side by side
this one just I'm always reminded about
how wonderful this palette really is
favorite holiday or limited edition
palette I'm going to answer both options
in that question for holiday this is one
that I have just not been able to get
rid of and it's been years that I've had
it on hand it's really just because it's
so beautiful kind of sentimental reasons
I don't want to get rid of it and I
could actually just keep the outer box
and use it for other things if I wanted
to but it's this lorac palette that
contains little mini palettes that look
like chocolate bars I could check back
in my videos and figure out exactly when
it came out but I'm thinking like three
or four years ago maybe
and it was just such a cute idea like
the cutest idea each palette had like a
different color theme and this was
before all the Too Faced chocolate bar
stuff so I remember it just really
struck me that they did this chocolate
bar kind of candy themed product and
then a limited edition palette that I
was really impressed with more recently
and so this wasn't technically holiday
but more just limited edition the Too
Faced Stardust by Vegas nay palette so
wonderful I really wish they would have
kind of adopted this one into the
regular line because it's just got so
many great things working for it with
mattes and shimmery shades the kinds of
color pops are just brighter metallic
pops that I really like to wear so I
have enjoyed this so much and it was
just a nice like kind of educational
palette set because I keep the little
cards out that show the different
eyelets it's like a legit eye not just a
drawn on eye and it shows like the step
by step kind of pictorial on how to use
the product so it was just a really
great kit name a palette you would
repurchase or wish you had a backup of
if it's no longer available this is a
situation where I don't think I'm going
to use up this palette to wear like oh
gosh I've run out of it I'd need to
repurchase but it's something that I
kind of wish was still available for the
broader makeup using public you know
what I'm saying like I wish it was just
still out there so I could continue
using it more frequently in my videos
and recommending it and then people
could have access to it and talked about
Too Faced romantic eye this palette
please to face bring it back bring it
back in the little like metal packaging
but please don't change any of the
shades it's perfect just the way it is
it's got beautiful matte colors just
that wonderful texture I know I've
recently talked about the Too Faced
matte eyes palette or it's actually
called natural matte and the textures in
there are so great and they're awesome
in here as well just beautiful pigmented
shades
I love the purples I love the unexpected
green pop there's like this dark
shimmery Brown that's stunning
you can go super dark with this palette
or much more light and airy I think it's
a great springtime palette X question
wants you to name a shade that you wish
was sold individually and from the lorac
mega Pro to
I would like to mention the shade called
olivine which is right down here it's
kind of like this platinum really
shimmery shade with the slightest hint
of olive green it seems like if you're
going to get into a really light
greenish shade it's going to be more
like a seafoam or a mint green you know
but here it's like light olive green but
with an ultra metallic shimmer it's just
gorgeous it's so unique it's definitely
one of the standout shades from this
palette which is loaded with gorgeous
colors but every time I see this palette
I love it I will have to link below to
the video where I did a look using this
shape this is so pretty and also from
this highlight palette that I have it's
the strobe of genius from NYX I think
it'd be really cool if they released
this shade this kind of really light
purple highlight it doesn't look like on
your cheeks when you use I mean I guess
you could apply it thick enough to where
you really would see it but just sheer
doubt on the cheeks I'm wearing it as my
highlight today it's just a really kind
of brightening catch the light type
highlight at a different level than
anything that's looking golden or peachy
or anything in that bracket this just
goes beyond even more so than just like
a straight-up white highlight number
seven says wildcard question pick a
question from the original tag to answer
I'll link all of the questions or link
them I'll post them on below if you want
to use these for your blog or a video or
something but from the first tag I'm
going to answer the question least-used
is this kind of sad because this is a
gorgeous palette it's the me vida loca
palette from Kat Von D and I got this
prior to the holiday season and it's so
pretty look it's really colorful it's
fun but I just don't find myself
reaching for this very much and it's not
because I'm scared to use the colors
because I've really been trying to work
in more colors lately the only thing I
can think of is a possible reason for me
not pulling this out is if I am just
kind of rushing through the makeup
routine a little bit this is kind of a
big bulky palette like I don't always
have a lot of surface area to sit it on
alright do I want to put it in my lap I
don't know it's beautiful it's pigmented
it's fun I need to be using it more
I guess this is me publicly calling
myself out that I should be the eighth
and final question says name the palette
you would recommend to a friend and I
got a name too because in reality I
probably would recommend two pallets to
a friend but this is the end the balm of
your hand palette you guys know how I
feel about this I love the idea of how a
brand took some of their most iconic
products kind of downsized the blush is
a little bit and put them all into one
palette and these are a couple of creams
over there so they've got their own home
but this is so great and I think it's an
awesome way to introduce anyone who
might be new to this brand I think the
balm is a great brand in general this is
like an awesome way to sample it so you
got hot mama blush the in stain blush
and Argyle cabana boy blush Bahama Mama
mary-lou manizer down here which can be
used as an eye shadow or a highlight and
you can really use any of these as eye
shadows up here but down here you've got
shadows that come from specific palettes
that the balm is put out over the years
it's just a really cool palette it's got
a mirror here it's travel friendly it's
fun and then I also wanted to
specifically recommend something to my
friends who are still in the TV news
business know there are some here
locally and some kind of sprinkled all
across the country now but I know when I
was on the news I really would have
gotten a lot of good out of this laura
geller and it's called baked color and
contour and it's got the bronze and
brightened up this gorgeous blush and
the french vanilla highlight three
reasons why this is great for news and
first off when you're in that really
bright studio lighting it can definitely
wash out your face so I was always
needing some kind of bronzer all over
I like the bronze in Brighton because it
can contour but it's a really nice just
healthy look all over the skin it's not
to like shimmery shiny but it just lifts
up your skin tone a little bit blush is
beautiful it doesn't take a lot but it's
pigmented enough to stand out on
anywhere from lighter to deeper skin
tones and then the highlight is
everything here this is the french
vanilla highlight it's sold individually
I've raved about this but I think when
you're on TV and especially those of you
who maybe you're doing a morning show
that goes like two hours or more you
don't have a lot of opportunities to
touch
up and shine really does show on those
cameras so having a highlight that isn't
so shiny but can really like lift your
features and just really give you that
awake and brightened look it's a great
thing to have you could use as an eye
shadow it's got kind of like this any
matte finish it has a little bit of
coverage to it even I just think it's an
ideal highlight also laura geller
products these domed up baked products
last a long long time even with regular
consistent use so that's that everyone
yeah that's the last question thank you
for watching this perfect palette to tag
I again will link to my perfect pallet
one tag and the other folks that I
mentioned at the start of the video I
hope you're having a great day and
thanks for spending a little time with
me I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
