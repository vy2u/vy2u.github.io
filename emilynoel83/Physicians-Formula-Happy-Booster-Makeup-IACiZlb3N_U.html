joining me for this review video this is
a review on quite possibly some of the
cutest packaged products and these are
from Physicians Formula and these are
called the happy booster face powder and
blush what you got here as soon as you
look at it I mean it it does make you
smile because look at this
it's little hearts so you know how
Physicians Formula a lot of times they
have their mosaic blushes and bronzers
and there's a lot of different colors
mixed in but I think this has got to be
one of the cutest little patterns they
have come up with so this is called
natural and this is the glow and mood
boosting blush so just to take you
through it I mean it's it's somewhat
smaller than there's the face powder so
you see it size-wise it's a little
smaller and you open it up with that top
level and then there's your pan of
product and this is the brush which
adorable brush however I do not like
using it for this product I just think
it's cut to blunt and it kind of cuts
into the product when you use it so I
prefer to just use a typical blush brush
but what you're going to notice when you
get this is that this product has a
scent there are a lot of products that
don't relate you know powders that don't
have much of a smell at all my Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer smells kind of
sweet and chocolatey and I love that but
this is one of the few other products
that I've seen that also there's an
emphasis on scent there so basically to
put it on I mean I just kind of swirl my
blush brush over all of that and put it
on for this rosy glow I already had kind
of a pinky blush on here but you can see
how that kind of amps up the look even
more to kind of see a swatch on my
finger you can tell there is a definite
kind of shimmery highlighter type
quality to that powder but basically
overall think light shimmery rosy
colored blush
with the powder and this is sort of like
packaged the same way so if you have a
bigger brush and once again I don't like
to use that but you can see sort of the
mosaic aspect there you're getting a lot
of different colors and you can see the
shimmer coming off of those that's why I
like to use this as sort of a highlight
POW sort of swatch that there's the glow
you're getting there this one was a
little more pinky and that one you can
see kind of a champagne with pink
undertones so for this you know I might
take my blush brush get a little bit on
there and sweep that just on top of my
cheekbones for a little glow so I really
like the look it gives because as you
look at this as you look really up-close
at this product
you're not seeing flecks of glitter
you're seeing sort of a pearlescent glow
and ash it a slight shimmer but not
chunks of glitter so I think that that's
helpful because sometimes when we're
putting on our makeup in front of our
makeup mirror we think oh okay I'll put
this you know shimmery product on and
then you get out in public and it's like
there was glitter in that but this one
really is kind of that soft glow that I
really like
I want to talk a little more now about
basically the claims of this product
it's said to be a mood boosting blush
has a mood boosting effect that's the
blush and same claims for the powder
just to read what they say experience
the mood boosting effect infused with
our happy boost blend featuring happy
skin and you for all natural plant
extracts which have been shown to
promote a feeling of happiness by
mimicking the effect of endorphins
that's what people talk about when you
workout you can endorphins and you're
feeling good and helping protect the
skin from environmental stress the sweet
scent of violet that much must have been
what I was smelling there I thought was
kind of a rose scent but they say violet
provides a feeling of joy each time you
apply it's paraben free non-comedogenic
and it says it's dermatologist approved
so um is this blush making me happier
when I put it on well when I am putting
on makeup I am generally in the state of
happiness I enjoy putting on my makeup
sometimes when it's early early morning
I'm still happy to be putting on makeup
but I may not be as happy but I don't
know I can't really say that this that
since using this blush my mood has
improved whatever amount I mean I really
don't know that I feel that way I think
I enjoy putting it on and that's what
makes me happy not so much that this
product has some magical ingredient that
just feels like you're walking on
sunshine every day you know what I mean
it's kind of like I don't know but this
does smell great it looks great and I
think when you put it on and you see how
you look and you've got that glow maybe
that does put a smile on your face and
make you feel a little better
um sort of an interesting claim that
they're putting out there I'm sure some
people will pick it up and think yeah I
want to be happy you know I had a really
rough day I want to pick this up and try
it and and maybe that's the motivation
for some people to pick this up for me
what motivates me is the adorable
packaging and the fact that you're
getting shimmer and glow without a bunch
of glitter so I would really recommend
these especially I mean this I've had
some good highlighters over time so this
isn't necessarily um oh my gosh I've
tried nothing like this before but this
blush and what I like about it is its
pinky and it's kind of rosy so sometimes
you try blushes with a lot of shimmer
and that's all you get is a bunch of
shimmer this has pigment and color to it
so you get a nice richness of color
shimmery rosy pop it on on Valentine's
Day you're going to be feeling great so
thank you so much for taking the time to
watch this I just kind of wanted to
inform you that hey that is out there
now in stores and I hope you get a
chance to pick it up particularly the
blush and let me know if you think that
this really makes you happier if you use
it so thanks for watching have a great
day and I'll see you soon
you
