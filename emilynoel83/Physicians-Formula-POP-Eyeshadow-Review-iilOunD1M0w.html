me for this video my voice has been kind
of strange today because I woke up I was
like so congested like I think it was
just some sort of an allergy related
thing I'm not sure what it was but I was
just like I have one of those little
Vicks vapor and inhalers sticks or
whatever but I was using that a lot
during the newscast cuz I was like I
need my nose to clear up so it's gotten
a little better but my voice still
sounds kind of low so anyway I'm not
gonna push it too much but I do want to
do this review for you today
and it is on actually four different
pallets so it's like a whole line of
products from Physicians Formula and
they are these shimmer strips pop
palettes so as you can see I mean you've
got one for blue eyes green eyes brown
eyes and hazel eyes so I'm gonna kind of
tell you what I think of these as a
whole and then point out individually
you know how I feel about each one
because I have you know some things that
I like about him in some things that I
don't not was I was set these products
by Physicians Formula but as you all
know I'm definitely willing to post
reviews that you know may have some pros
and some cons in them because I feel
like it's important to know sometimes I
hear people do videos then they say well
if it's a bad product I'm not even
getting you're not even gonna waste your
time reviewing it well I also feel like
if it's not a good product then that's
something you need to know about - you
know it's like okay so it didn't work so
I'm gonna try to keep it a secret from
you so that's not how I it's not how I
roll with my videos so I definitely want
to have complete disclosure here and
tell you everything that's going on so
anyway overall with these pallets I'll
just hold up one here to show you you
can see they've got nine different
shades and then all of them have nine
colors as far as the things I like about
them I think these are really fun colors
I mean these these just aren't the kinds
of shades that you see every day in
drugstore eyeshadow palettes so there
are some really interesting shades so I
think it's nice
those options with some really bright
colors I also think it's cool that there
are like some neutral shades mixed in I
think that's nice to have that option
you know you buy something with nine
colors you don't want to just have one
look you can do with it you want several
so I think that's good and I did take
two limits by the way cuz I was like I
got to talk about four palettes I need
to keep myself on track but anyway um I
like that some of them with the shimmer
they're all shimmery but there's like
kind of a complex shimmer to them that's
not like all of them like each one you
swatch is gonna have the same like
silver sparkle to it or something like
that like they all have their own unique
kind of quality about them and sometimes
like the shimmer is like kind of like
multi-coloured shimmer I'm not really
sure how to describe it I'll try to
swatch some for you by the way I will
have swatches posted on my blog I will
have a link to that in the sidebar so
you can really see what these look like
because me just going like that with my
fingers isn't going to do a whole lot
but I really think that the colors are
interesting you know there's an
interesting shimmer to them that you
don't see everywhere it's not like okay
I can pick up that shadow anywhere so
that's nice and I also do like like I
said there's nine colors per palette um
some things that I don't like first off
I kind of like my palettes I think it's
nice when they have a mirror to them but
this one doesn't so that's you know not
a big deal but it's just something I
prefer
also something that could be kind of
seen as a con is that there are really
small amounts of each color you know
like you're not getting very much here
and like if you compare that to say hey
covergirl quad just so you can have a
little frame of reference here open up
this quad food cover girl and you hold
them side by side I mean you can see
that the covergirl shades I mean you're
getting a lot more granted this is more
variety but um
trota color I mean you're just not
getting a whole lot same with Maybelline
I mean one shade gives you a lot here so
if you find like a shade in one of these
that you really like and you want to use
repeatedly um chances are you're going
to
and out of it fairly soon another
possible con could be the fact that all
of the shades in these pallets are
shimmery I say that kind of you know and
not too big of a con because it is in
the title they're they're they're called
shimmer strips so you kind of know what
you're getting into here assuming you
read the label of the product so it's
kind of like you know what you're
getting into but some variety maybe if
they made these down the road with a new
version like matte ones would be cool or
some a mix of shimmer and matte would be
kind of nice because they have smoky
ones and they have just the regular of
these so there's other versions out
there if you don't like all these bright
shades but still they're all shimmery
also one other con as I will mention
throughout this videos some of the
bright shades like for example some of
these purples like they're not as
pigmented and bright and colorful as you
would expect them to be so I'll get into
that that's more like on an individual
basis for each of those palettes so I
will address that as well I'm going
through all these palettes I mean I
obviously kind of picked out a favorite
and it honestly what was interesting to
me is that the one that turned out to be
my favorite is probably the last one I
would have picked up just walking
through the store and I'm not sure why
just this didn't stand immediately stand
out to me but once I started using it
and swatching the colors I was like okay
I really like this palette so and it is
the one for hazel eyes so here's a kind
of a look at that one and you can see
it's just got a gorgeous palette of
colors here but some reasons why I like
this I think the pinks and Maroons are
just fantastic in this palette um you
get you know some bright kind of like a
raspberry pink shade you also get like a
lighter sort of like a baby pink shade
you get this shade here right at the end
and I swear that is a dupe for matte
cranberry if you like Matt Grande that
is one of my favorite favorite matte
colors so like when I saw that there I
was like oh hey and then i swatched and
I was like that total is matte cranberry
like I put the swatches side by
and I got like really excited I think
Tyler was wondering like what was
happening to me at that moment but I
really like that about this palette no
two shades are exactly alike which I did
notice some overlap and some of the
other palettes but all these are kind of
different I mean you get some golds
this shade here is so interesting it's
like a neutral but I've got a little bit
of another shade on the underside of
that but it's it's neutral but it's
iridescent and as with the the top shade
and all these palettes like that looks
white but they all have like their own
little undertone like this one happens
to have a pink undertone maybe can't
quite see it there but it has like this
meet iridescent quality to it so I love
the pigmentation they were able to come
up with in some of these pink and
maroonish shades I think it's really
pretty I also like that I feel like
these shades can all be worn together
and give off a really pretty look like I
just like the way that you know the
whole composition of this palette and I
do have like I used like the cranberry
type shade kind of in my crease here and
I just was really really pleased with
the way it came off so definitely my
favorite palette is the hazel eyes and I
don't have hazel eyes that's the whole
kind of a whole big point that I needed
to make in this video is that I have
brown eyes and I love the hazel eyes
palette I will use all these palettes
regardless of what my eye color is so
anyway love that one then I have two
palettes that are kind of in the middle
for me the green eyes palette which is
really pretty again some shades you're
just aren't gonna run into in the
drugstore all that much for eyeshadows
so give you a look at those they're um
why I like this I again the really
unique turquoise type shades here just
very like this kind of like a seafoam
green type shade you've got kind of a
spring green and here's a pretty pink
there's like a darker teal they're all
really really pretty and they aren't
pigmented as a whole the Purple's in
this palette lacked a
a little bit of pop but there still I
mean they'll still show up and I also
like that all these shades do work well
together too you could pick any two of
these and you know the purple and the
Aqua and the pink they're all going to
look nice together no matter if you want
to put one on the inner partier
lid one on the outer part the way these
pallets are put together like if you
look at the packaging they kind of
outline it so like the top three go
together the middle three go together
and the bottom three go together but I
honestly just use them however I feel
like it I don't necessarily follow that
plan you also get one of these pointy
sponge tip applicator with it too which
I have gotten some use out of but one
criticism I have of this palette well I
like this little teal shade down here on
the bottom it really isn't all that dark
you know it's pretty at all but with all
this shimmer I feel like you need to
have a nice deeper shade that's really
going to show up deeper to create some
contrast so the colors don't start to
look muddy you know they're all shimmery
you need something to tone it down and
pretty much all the colors in this
palette have the same sort of level of
brightness and intensity unlike you know
going back to the hazel one this
cranberry shade down here at the end is
actually really nice and deep creates
some contrast with all those other pinks
and golds and stuff so that's kind of my
only complaint with the with the green
eyes palette I also like the blue eyes
palette so these are kind of my two
middle and middle-of-the-road palettes
but I really like him and I totally will
use them I felt like the Blues in this
palette here's a look they liked a
little bit of intensity I was sort of
expecting some more out of these just
because to look at them like where does
your eye go when you first look at this
I mean here or here maybe you know it
really catches your eye and to do a
swatch of it there's the blue I mean I
don't know I just kind of thought well
that's another blue that this blue on
this finger is right there and so I just
kind of thought it should have come off
a little brighter than that
I mean grand you still get some blue but
it's just you know to kind of just
understand that maybe they're not gonna
look just like that the neutrals however
in this palette are amazing I love the
way these bronzy neutrally shades come
off I mean they are intense
so I love those but the thing is you're
not going to buy this pop of color
bright palette just for you know the
Browns you're going to probably buy it
because you like the Blues too overall
though this is a great palette and again
with all these shades and the the first
ones that appear white actually that has
a blue iridescent blue undertone to it
so it's interesting I do like these you
know this palette a lot and I think if I
am reaching for blue and I want
something quick and portable this may be
something I go towards sometimes now the
palette sadly need to start why for this
better better now the palette that
really is one that I was not impressed
with sadly is the brown eyes palette
which would have been the one like if
you just go into the store and I'm
thinking well I have brown eyes so I'm
going with the brown eyes palette please
don't just have that attitude like
hopefully you've learned some things
through this video and you realize hey
you anybody can wear these colors but B
this palette um I have some issues with
the purples here are just not that
intense and bright um just to show you
one here like they're they're pretty
they're light but I mean for the pump
that this palettes supposed to have I
kind of felt like they all came kind of
came off looking somewhat the same those
are three different purples right there
and um so yeah there is like some
overlap in this palette as well I felt
like like this this shade and that one
they kind of look alike the Gold's
actually kind of come off similar to so
I didn't feel like whereas with like
this palette I felt like I was getting
like a ton like nine different totally
different shades here I felt like there
was a little bit of overlap and also
kind of potential for a muddy look like
I wore this
I got was getting like lightish purples
and then you've got some neutrals thrown
in which the neutrals are nice and all
but it just didn't make as much sense
together you know what I mean like these
colors looked great together
these colors look nice together there's
enough contrast between the blue and the
earth tones these all look nice together
and these I was kind of like not as
impressed with and it said like I said
because you want the blue or the brown
eyes to wear lots of people have brown
eyes but you kind of just have to really
test him out I was glad I had the
opportunity to try out all palettes and
really let you know what you're getting
into because I think sometimes brands
want to just tell you okay because you
have this color of eyes you know this is
the palette that's for you but you
really want the palette this is the best
quality I mean that's what I would want
so hope you learned something in this
video again if you know these are these
are good quality products but there's
just little differences in each one that
I've learned about so thanks for
watching I hope you have a great day and
a great rest of the week and I'll see
you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
