for this video I wanted to pass along my
thoughts on a product that I had been so
curious about so many trips to the
drugstore that I had made and walk past
it and thought I don't know if I want to
try it and then finally I gave in to my
curiosity and had to give it a go and it
is called the Physicians Formula bronze
booster self-tanning bronzing veil and
it looks like this I kept my packaging
there so I could read to you some more
information about it basically what this
is is a self-tanning formula with built
in bronzer that you can put on your face
and you're going to get that bronzed
look but you're also going to be getting
the effects of a sunless tanner as you
wear it now it claims to be mistake
proof you're not going to get stains
you're not gonna get orange or any weird
sense out of it it says it's a
lightweight formula you can it's
buildable so like one time you'll
apparently see results and then multiple
times after that it will only build on
itself and as different vitamins and
different ingredients that will help
give you that sunless tan and you just
click it through this brush and it comes
out the brush and this is a rather small
brush very small really I mean if I put
it up to my cheek you see how big that
is it's maybe the size of like certain
eye brushes you might have in your
collection
but you press this little button down
here and it ends up working its way out
the brush so um let me just show you how
that happens and I'll show you the
formula to on at issue here because it
does have sunless tanner and I'll need
to go wash my hands if I put it on
myself but I'm giving it a couple clicks
here with the little button takes a few
some times let's see if I've got
anything out here yet no needs more
clicks okay same kind of a lot this is
the kind of the annoying part especially
when you first get it takes a ton of
clicks okay still going
there we are okay so you can see some of
it is starting to come out of the tip
there and I'm kind of just spreading it
on this tissue so you can kind of see
what the color is it appears to be
pretty orange but really I mean it's not
in overall color it's not much different
from your typical bronzer what you get
but it is really it has a lot of like
golden sparkle to it you won't probably
be able to pick up on that through the
camera but as I look at it here there's
a lot of like reflective little golden
particles aka glitter that is in this
and they're pretty fine but they are
definitely there and when so many of
those collect together on your face you
get that effect of like a golden statue
which isn't necessarily something
everyone wants you know highlighting all
the flaws on their face and that doesn't
look good over blemishes and whatnot
when I use this the first few times okay
you click it out the top and then my
instincts since it gives me the brush
and it appears that that's what you
should do you apply it all over your
face with the brush well the brush
turned out to be pointless for me I mean
this might as well just be in a squeeze
tube honestly for all the times you have
to click it and be like is it coming out
yet is it coming out yet I mean why I
don't know I think they just wanted it
to be like oh that's interesting they
wanted it to catch people's eye but
really this could have been in a tube
and it would have been much easier this
brush does not spread the product I mean
it just this does not work all over your
face it's like a mini foundation brush
think of the family if you're one of
those people that uses the flat
foundation brush to put on your liquid
foundation think of that being half the
size would it really work as well
no and you want to use a tiny brush to
put on a darker than your skin product I
don't think so because that's what this
is this is a darker tone kind of creamy
bronzer with some in my opinion too much
sparkle in it and then you've got the
question of when do you put it on what's
the sequence of putting this stuff on do
you put it on before your foundation do
you put it on after your foundation
since it does have some
Tanner in it what I did is I put on my
moisturizer then I put this on and then
I've really lightly put my foundation on
but it felt really strange to be putting
it on something darker and it would have
been weird to put the sunless tanner on
on top of the foundation cuz then you
don't feel like it's directly in contact
with your skin I don't know if you
follow me on this but basically I mean
it there's some question there and
that's not really clearly stated to
those who use this product and the
concern becomes you know how well does
it actually live up to its claims does
it really tan your skin well I mean yes
you do have a more bronzed appearance to
your skin after you would put this on
you could of course just wear it alone I
suppose and then not have to worry about
the whole putting foundation over it or
whatever concealer over it or what
whatnot it does give you a nice bronze
to appearance however I really think
this is gonna be too sparkly for most
people I mean it's just it's a little
too sparkly for me a little too metallic
for me and the finish it gives off and
like I said you can't blend it with this
applicator I just had to kind of smear
it on my face with that and then just
blend it with my hands and I felt like I
didn't feel like I had any kind of
drastic sunless tan once I took my
makeup off I felt like okay I don't feel
like I'm any tanner then I really
started and then I used it for a couple
days and I thought maybe there's a
little something but it's not drastic
it's not like you're gonna turn into
some like pan princess after you use
this so I don't know I I'm not a huge
fan of it really I think maybe here's an
instance where maybe it could be a good
thing
the applicator in my opinion will never
be a good thing but here's my opinion on
when the product might be good a good
occasion for it maybe say you're going
out to the beach you put on your SPF
maybe in a moisturizer and you're not
planning to put any foundation on or
really do anything have it heavy with
your coverage but you do want a little
bronze color and maybe you can start
that little sunless tanning process
before you ever get out there to the
beach or the pool or wear
so you put some of this on and you've
got kind of a dewy bronzy glow and
you're not concerned about being super
matte the shimmer is okay that's maybe
an instance for that I don't know how
many of us are in that instance on a
daily basis I'm certainly some of us are
but for me in my everyday this did not
turn out to be a must-have product I
really be curious to hear if you have
this what do you use it for and how is
it best used I mean that might be some
useful information for others who like
myself have this but want to know the
best way you can continue to get the
most out of it it's not an altogether
bad product and I think it's a really
cool concept that it's sort of a you
know a creamy bronzer thing that also
comes with sunless tanner in it if any
companies are watching this I really
think that there is you know that would
be a great thing but I think you need to
specify you know how is this best used
in conjunction with other makeup because
God knows even though we want to be 10
we also want coverage and we want to be
able to use foundations and concealers
and it needs to all kind of work
together harmoniously there so anyway
very interesting very innovative product
but maybe not the type of thing that I
would use all the time so thank you guys
for tuning in for this video have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
