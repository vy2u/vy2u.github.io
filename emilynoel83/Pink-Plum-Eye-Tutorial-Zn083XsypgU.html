plumb look that would be appropriate not
only for work but for a night out I
think you will definitely like this
tutorial it's using a new palette that I
have called plum crazy from being
luscious and it's got some real a really
great selection of plum colors ranging
from your lightest to the darkest and
some really bright fun shades in between
some are matte some have a little
shimmer and they're just really fun to
play with there are a lot of variations
you could do on this look with this
palette or with other plum shades you
might already have in your collection so
I hope you enjoy this tutorial and
people step is to apply a primer to your
lid I'm going to use my delicious shadow
magnet in light it's just a really kind
of tacky primer it keeps just a little
bit of moisture on on the lid just to
grab that powder and some I find that
some primers almost go to a powdery
State and if you're looking for color
intensity I think you want one that's
actually going to be a little bit tacky
you just have to put it on really light
and you really won't get any creasing
with this okay so I'm just patting it on
super light layer there and then I'm
going to use my B washes palette here in
plum crazy this is another one of the
new ones I used the one called erotic
mermaid
it was the shades of blue that I used in
the smoke on the water tutorial and
these are a lot more pigmented than any
other palettes I've tried from them
other than Matt one of the neutral matte
quads that I had but anyway I'm going to
go to the light lilac shade that's in
this and they actually give you a little
brush that has two ends on it and this
smallish eyeshadow brush is actually
really good and really great for you
know just packing color on the lid so
I'm gonna go ahead and do that with that
lilac shade here mirror
and just pack that on all over the wood
and by packing I mean I'm just kind of
doing a patting motion with the shadow
not so much a back and forth blending
motion and we'll kind of deal with the
tear duct area in a moment but yeah this
has just a hint of shimmer to it but
most of these shadows are relatively
matte and that's what makes the
intensity a lot better to work with I
think so I've got that all over the lid
and I'm gonna go to this shade right
here second from the end and it does
have a hint of sparkle to it and it's
sort of like a deep kind of orchid shade
and for that I'm going to take that same
brush dust it off a little bit here get
some of that color and work that in on
the outside
really really pretty this can even make
a nice like subtle crease color this
shade can and I'm just putting it on you
can see the outer half of my lid and a
little bit up there into the crease if
you have comparable shades you know by
all means if you got a you know a
palette of purples that you like to work
with
maybe this will just give you some
application ideas with them although
there are some really unique colors in
this palette that you'll see me get to
in a minute okay so I've got that all
over next we're going to start working
with a little bit deeper color it's the
deepest shade in this palette it's a
matte really deep plum shade so I'm
going to grab my Sonia Kashuk medium
shadow brush just dip it right in there
get it sort of on the tip and then we're
going to work this right into our crease
just like so
kind of giving it a little lighter touch
as we get more towards the inner corner
but as far as the outside goes yeah I
just get it in the crease there I just
kind of pull out that little motion
we've talked about before I know just
kind of getting it right it right
concentrated here that's where you want
the most depth and then pulling it
pulling that color up and out next step
is really the color in this palette that
catches your eye it's this gorgeous kind
of magenta like violet magenta I'm
trying to get it so the light really
hits it right right in here and it's so
pretty it is matte and I just think this
color could be used in a very very
vibrant way I'm gonna take my Sephora
rounded crease brush get some of that
color on there a little bit goes a long
way and we're just gonna kind of overlap
that plum that's just some more of our
deep shade giving us contrast we're
gonna overlap that to give it a little
more color and punch up in here so you
can see it's turning more of a pinky
tone here oh nothing beats that warm
kind of you know purpley pink look there
love that and I'm just kind of going
over it I'm building up the intensity
this is a very buildable shadow here and
you're just building up that kind of
plummy pink look okay and then for our
highlight remember that lilac shade we
put on the lid very very light
application on the brush and we're just
going to take that right up to the brow
okay next step I'm just before we get on
with the liner I'm gonna also take that
lilac shade and my very very tiny detail
brush here from Coastal Scents it's the
C 148 mini contour and get some of that
lilac on there and just kind of use it
to brighten this inner corner giving you
that really pretty kind of wide-awake
look even though we are using some liner
that will really kind of still make the
eye look awake next I'm going to take my
Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in
blackest black and it's just got this
nice little fine pointed tip here I'm
going to go from the inner to outer
corner here
sorry deep concentration
well dot if something came off there I
can get rid of that in second huh
sometimes it helps to let any little
like dots like that that get on your eye
somewhere to let them dry and then it'll
just kind of flick right off with a
q-tip or like a pointed q-tip and I'm
just gonna extend this slightly right
outside the corner of my eye there next
I'm gonna use my Alma eyeliner in black
and this is just kind of a soft black
liner and I'm just gonna go to my inner
core or outer corner rather and just
kind of flick that up towards the liner
that's already there that liquid liner
that's like that and then just go in
just a little ways here on the line
sorry if I'm you haven't been able to
see them and then we're gonna go in with
some shadow to actually finish the liner
finishing off the liner look I'm taking
my Coastal Scents taklon liner brush
going to the deep matte plum shade and
I'm just going to overlap what's been
done here with that softening it up a
little bit and just keeping the color
nice and deep there in the corner
and we're just going to about our
halfway point and that's when we'll
switch switch it up a little bit and I'm
going to go to the bright shade right
here that's the one that we kind of used
to give ourselves that warm color there
and he's gonna apply that right there on
the inner corner
we're overlapping some of that light
shade that we used in the tear duct and
meeting right up with the dark one
he is overlapping and don't just stop
where somethin else starts and if you
want to go through and just give a
little more brightness there feel free
to take any kind of detail brush or a
q-tip can sometimes work for this step
if you don't have one of these little
tiny brushes just kind of go over it
next I'm going to curl my lashes and I'm
gonna be using my Maybelline lash
discovery mascara it's got a tiny tiny
brush just absolutely teensy and I
really really like this mascara I think
it's really lengthening it really finds
every lash and so I'm gonna put that on
and then I'll join you with the finished
look
hey everyone here is the finished look
just a pretty soft plummy pink look that
you could take to school to work or
wherever you're going on my lips I used
my wet slicks by covergirl amazement
that's the kind with the real minty like
crest infused lip gloss and this is in
everything's rosy so I slicked that on
and then I took my Jordana lip liner
easy liner for lips in plush plum and
after I had the gloss I just kind of
lightly went around with that and it
just kind of managed to deepen the color
just a little bit make it a little more
plum tone and then on my cheeks I'm
using the covergirl blush in plumberry
glow so that has just a little bit of
shimmer to it gives you that kind of
radiant more pink toned look as opposed
to the peachy bronze II you know golden
a tone so I hope you like this look this
palette is really fantastic for the fact
that it has so many like really vibrant
matte shades in here that allow the look
to really pop on your eyes so thanks so
much for tuning in guys and have a great
day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
