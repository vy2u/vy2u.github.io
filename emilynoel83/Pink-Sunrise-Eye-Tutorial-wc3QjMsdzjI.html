this is gonna be a tutorial using my new
sugar pop palette from Too Faced I just
could not turn down these colors in here
I love the sort of random color
selection that's happening here and I
thought it might prompt me to try a few
new color combinations and in this video
we're having some fun with some pops of
pink on the lid also a little bit of
orange in this look and it's also a
really quick look to do I don't know
about you guys but sometimes when I feel
like okay I'm in a rush I need to throw
something together quickly I almost
always veer toward neutrals in that
circumstance I guess for some reason I
think I have to put a little less
thought into those kinds of looks but
this is definitely a quick fun colorful
look and this would be a great prom look
especially if you've got a pink dress or
a coral dress peach I look really
creates a fun sort of sunrise effect on
the eyes I hope you like it so to start
out I've already primed my lids with my
Milani eyeshadow primer and then I'm
gonna go to my sugar pop palette and I'm
using this black berry shade first it's
a really nice matte plum very pigmented
I'm going with this shade in the crease
first because what I put on the lid I
really want to kind of pop out more and
not get to cover it up by this shade so
once you've really got that laid down
there in the crease you can start
building it up a bit on the outside too
a little bit of an outer V those little
taps that you hear I am tapping off the
excess after every time I put my brush
in the shade just so I don't pick up too
much I'm really build it up little by
little type person with my eye looks
because it's just much easier to add
than it is to take away when it comes to
eye shadow and then I'll just use a bear
brush to blend over the edge this is my
e-40 and I'm also going to use a pencil
brush with black very real quick here
and I'm going to take it down below the
eye as well and I like using the pencil
brush here because it gives us a little
bit more diffused color we'll go in and
get a little more precise in a couple
minutes this is where the fun begins and
we start playing with some of the color
so I'm going to go into this
here it's a soft lilac called strawberry
ice using my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow
brush I'm going to Pat this on the inner
part of my lid and it's a very
brightening shade so it's it looks
pretty nice taken around your inner
corner as well then using my Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush for a little
more precision I'm going into bubblegum
and I'm gonna just Pat this on the outer
part of my lid it's a really fun place
to do a little pop of color actually
because it's not super in-your-face
being placed in this area but it
definitely will show I'm just over
lapping that lilac color a little bit
and this next part is really like the
frosting on top of the cupcake if you
know what I mean we're taking some fun
orange color here this is the macaroon
shade and it appears to have some
shimmer like a golden sparkle but that
really does not show up on my eyes it
basically performs like a matte shadow I
think it looks best when you really lay
some color on here and it looks kind of
like a sunset it looks kind of like a
creamsicle just applying this right on
the edge of that blackberry crease color
we use take it all the way in and all
the way around the eye I'm really like
encircling the outer part of the eye
here taking the shadow down a bit lower
than I normally might there's just fun
it's so warm it's a really pretty shade
so just fill as much space as you have
there and then I'm gonna use a little
rock candy with my e-40 just going right
up next to the brow and this will serve
to kind of blend out the edge of your
orange next I'm going to do a little bit
of nude in my lower inner rim this is my
Milani shadow eyes and almond cream just
gives us that nice bright wide open eyed
effect open eyed effect you could also
open your eyes and that would give you
an overnight effect then I'm using my
Jordana color in the liquid liner in
black Envy starting at the inner corner
pulling across and I'm trying to do as
thin of a line as I can get away with
because we are adding false lashes so I
kind of want to give them something to
sit on but at the same time I
want my line to be too thick to wear I
cover up a lot of the shadow so just
something to keep in mind as you do this
kind of a look and something I always
like to do to really finish off a winged
liner look is I take a deep shade in
this case I guess it'll be blackberry
with an angled brush and just connecting
right up to the wing just makes
everything look a little more pull
together there when you fill that gap
next up I'm just going to give my lashes
a quick curl I'm gonna apply a little
bit of this lash sensational mascara to
my top lashes not because I love it but
because I'm just trying to use the stuff
up covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant down on my lower lashes
because it does not move and then the
lashes I'm wearing here are my Ardell
whispies so I'm going to just apply
those to my upper lash line if you want
a full false lash tutorial check out my
false lashes 101 video it goes really
in-depth on choosing applying removing
and cleaning off your false lashes so
that would be a good thing to check out
if you're just starting so there's your
finished look and just a couple of extra
products to mention here my blush that
I'm wearing today is hot mama from the
balm and you could kind of go more
peachy I think with your cheek and lip
or more pink just depending on what you
want to do I went a little bit peachy
here so for my highlight today I'm
wearing this elf shimmering facial whip
I believe this shade is called spotlight
and I kind of wanted to see how this
would compare to my Becca shimmering
skin perfecter in pearl and it actually
gives me kind of a similar effect so
that's sort of exciting and then my lips
I feel like they're coming off a little
more pink on camera they look slightly
more peachy in person but I'm wearing
this MAC lipstick in sunny Seoul this is
a cream shine over the top of that I've
got my NYX butter gloss in Maple blondie
so thank you guys for watching this is
my third time doing this particular look
the first time I did it just as a test
run I didn't shoot it the next time I
tried it with my new lighting and
everything was way too washed out so now
I've adjusted my new lighting somewhat
and I'm not sure if it's perfect yet
I'll probably keep tweaking it but I
think it's a lot better than the last
time I shot this so thanks again for
watching and I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
