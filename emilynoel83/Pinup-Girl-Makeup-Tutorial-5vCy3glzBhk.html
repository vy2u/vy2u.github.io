this video this has been a really really
requested look a really retro style
makeup tutorial the pin-up girl look
it's definitely characterized by in my
mind flawless skin red lips and this
sort of cat eyed look that is really
characteristic of a different era in
makeup so I wanted to show you how I did
this look I'm not Nestle I cap row or a
guru on the retro styles of makeup but
this is just sort of the techniques I've
pulled together from looking at
different pictures and stuff like that
so if you want to see how I pulled this
look off keep on like a real trademark
of the pin-up girl look is matte
flawless skin so I'm going to use a
foundation here a liquid foundation that
is really designed to give off that
matte finish and help it last throughout
the day a mineral foundation if you're
into that that could work here as well
just make sure it's more the matte
finish than the shimmery you know dewy
finish but I'm using rimmel's stay matte
foundation my shade is number 200 soft
beige so I'm just gonna put that on with
my fingers and apply it all dotted all
over my face and just blend it in next
I'm going to conceal any problem areas
with my Bobbi Brown foundation stick my
shade is natural so I'm just going to
use my fingers and go over in little
imperfections here with that
while this is a foundation stick it
really feels like the consistency of
like a creamy concealer so it's very
good to use just on certain places
because the coverage is so good remember
that matte finish we're really going
after I'm going to set this with my mary
kate loose powder in beige one and just
get any powder brush you like I'm using
my Sigma SS 150 my travel brush here I'm
just going over what I've done so far
next just to get a pop of color all over
the face I'm going to use my NYC matte
bronzer and sunny again we don't want to
really go overboard with the with the
tan on this but I'm just gonna use it to
sort of perk up my face a little bit
just going all over we really want to
bring out the rosy cheeks I'm gonna be
using my Mac cream blush in Posie so
it's a really pretty you know classic
kind of pink rosy cheek color and I'm
just gonna apply some of that with my
finger right here to the apple of my
cheek just get a little bit on there and
then just blend it out kind of keeping
it on the outer part not right in here
so we don't want to attract any redness
to the nose area but right here on the
cheeks now to top off that rosy creamy
shade we put on our cheeks I'm going to
use what is it really intense shades so
we have to be really careful with it
it's the wet and wild silk finish in
Bury shimmer and so it's a really deep
shade it's not super shimmery and that's
why I felt like it would work for this
look because we are trying to keep it
kind of that matte look but I'm gonna
use my blush brush get just a little bit
on there and brush it on here because I
think sort of those really you know
glowing cheeks is part of this look
so we're gonna help them stand out with
this cutlery create a little contrast
I'm gonna use my covergirl cheekers and
golden pink this is my kind of usual
contour shade I'm just gonna go right up
under that just to get a lot of
definition there I really want to get
this whole look a nice flawless finish
I'm gonna use my L'Oreal they're natural
um it's the finishing powder in
translucent so this isn't really gonna
give me any color but it is gonna kind
of help set the look and just give it
that flawless appearance we're looking
for so I'm going like under my eyes with
this around my mouth just all over
everything we've done for high so we
really want to neutralize our lid so I'm
using my photo finish lid primer from
Smashbox and I'm just gonna get a little
of that on my finger and you'll see that
the natural sort of reddish undertones
on my eyelid they're kind of
disappearing as I apply that and it
looks a lot more neutral now and that's
gonna be good because we are doing like
a light shade on the lid and really this
is a fairly easy eye look there's just a
few different techniques you really want
to pay it I'm gonna grab my covergirl
quad in country woods this is just a
really light neutral palette and I'm
gonna take the lightest matte shade here
this cream color you can just use the
applicator get some of that on there and
we're just going to apply that all over
the lid just like so
okay just getting that light base in
there and then I'm gonna take a fluffier
brush and there's I'm sort of going to
blend this shimmery shade and the cream
just get a little of each and use that
as a highlight you don't really want
high shimmer here but do you want that
highlight there okay next step I'm going
to take sort of a medium sized crease
but crease brush my Smashbox number 15
I'm going to go to the deepest shade in
this palette which is this one right
here and I'm just gonna get some of that
on my brush and follow the natural
contour of my crease here it's not gonna
show up a lot it's gonna be really
subtle that's what we're going for here
so just go inner corner to outer sort of
building up on the inner part here
actually in a moment here after we do
our liner we're going to go in with a
little bit deeper brown shade just to
define the crease a little bit more but
for now I am gonna go to the liner I'm
using my NYC liquid liner in black upper
liner is very important for the pin-up
girl style look so what we're going to
do is go from inner corner to outer
corner sometimes you'll see me kind of
make a straight line so it looks like
it's coming out kind of straight on the
on the outer end of the liner but this
is going to follow a little bit more of
a curve here so just pay attention to
that I'm going to start on the inner
corner
okay just following the natural line
here at first going back for a little
more
okay
then for the outer corner I'm coming
straight from the outer edge and I'm
just you can see I'm just lifting it up
there I'm gonna add a little more
thickness to that line just by working
out from there that's basically the look
you're going for sort of that Marilyn
Monroe kind of bedroom eyes cat eye look
here that's it's not too hard to achieve
but I think the key is getting it even
on both both sides see how it almost
reminds you a little bit of it kind of
like a check mark that's what we're
going for there okay I mentioned we were
going back to a shadow shade because I
feel like the shape of the liner helps
you redefine your shadow so I'm taking
my covergirl single and brown smolder
I'm kind of a nice pretty for the most
part matte shade and I'm gonna put a
little bit right here in my crease and
kind of work it towards the very outer
edge of the liner there so this isn't
really an outer V but this is just kind
of me enlarging our eyes basically
because making it seem like our crease
instead of coming right in here makes it
seem like our crease is coming all the
way out to here we're just altering the
shape of our eye then I do want to keep
some of that Brown going right in here
in the inner corner to again this shade
could go pretty dark and smoky but we
are keeping it pretty light I don't
think you in the images I've seen you
don't see a whole lot of major major
dark colors and the outer V's and all
that with this particular um lower lash
line don't want to do much at all just
for definition purposes I am going to
take my Coastal Scents tackle on angled
liner brush and that Brown smolder shade
and just get a little bit of that color
right here on the lower lash line
just like that you can see how it's just
giving a little definition you can't
really point to it and say oh my gosh
there's a lot of liner there but I just
want it to kind of you know keep them
keep my eye shape very defined this is a
really defined look so want to keep it
that way just going about halfway in
like that alrighty next comes our false
lashes and I what I've used here is just
an outer set this is our Dell runway
collection in Giselle and these were a
full strip that I cut to make them half
strips really gives you that kind of you
know keeping with the cat eyed sort of
effect here but so I am going to be
applying those to my outer half of the
lash line there I'm going to first put
on some covergirl fantastic lash mascara
cuz it helps give them those lashes that
nice curl these will mesh in really well
with those and then I'll join you with
the finished look
alright guys here is my finished look
for my pin-up girl makeup tutorial very
retro going off of a lot of concepts
that I've noticed time and time again
and different to pinup girl pictures
that I've seen and so I just I the I
look is really basic and simple a lot
easier than some others that I've done
the lips it's all about the red lips I
went ahead and used two products without
really using a lot of gloss or anything
like that I used my Rimmel exaggerate
lipliner and ravish one of the best
probably the best red lipliner that I've
found and then I went over it with my
NYC lipstick here in retro red this
whole look is very affordable just keep
in mind the concepts of flawless skin
not overly done on say the bronzer and
stuff like that but just keeping with
sort of the rosy cheeks the cut that
contour cheeks the definition with the
eyes here but keeping it kind of soft in
the crease I think is one key as well so
thanks so much for tuning in for this
video guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
