we're going to be talking about one of
my all-time favorite styles which is the
ponytail but how do you set it up a
notch how do you make it appropriate for
even a dressy occasion well I've got a
couple tips to share in this video and
that is adding some height right here on
the top and also wrapping your ponytail
with your own hair to disguise the
unsightly band that you've put on to get
your hair up there in the first place so
the reason why I'm doing this tutorial
is because I went to that mally beauty
event where I got to meet mallet it was
amazing and so much fun and I met the
whole malli team as well or at least
most of the Mallee team and Devon one of
the members of that team asked me about
my ponytail I was wearing that day she
said was like I like how you do that
ponytail you should do a video on it and
so I'm like I need for bobby pins you
also need a brush to help you pull your
hair up it's fine tooth comb that you
can tease your hair with a ponytail
holder and also some hairspray so let's
get started we're going to begin by
sectioning off our hair to get that
little front poof and so what I like to
do is pull up an amount of hair that's
kind of going right here across the
forehead I would say go back you know
maybe just a couple of inches maybe
three inches worth of hair and once you
get that pulled up we're going to take
some hairspray give yourself a couple of
spritzes back behind this is going to
really help your teasing really hold in
there and then we're going to begin
teasing trying to stay right around the
root so that way when I let my hair come
back look at this lift we've got going
on here installing to take my comb right
over it and make sure all your hair is
kind of heading in the same direct like
to pull that up from right about here
and back now it's the time to kind of
look at this and also make sure
height-wise you've got everything where
you want it before you secure it i like
using bobby pins that are just a little
bit longer because I find when you
crisscross them to secure this top part
of this style they really hold very
nicely so I'm just going to put one in
here then I'm going to crisscross my
next bobby pin right over the top of
that we're making what looks like a
little X here and that's really going to
hold for us thing to think about really
with any ponytail you do is if you let
it go low it's going to be longer but if
you pull it up higher you know your
longest layer is going to be a little
bit shorter the more distance you are
pulling this up the back of your head if
that makes sense so higher ponytail
equals shorter ponytail I like this to
be kind of a little bit higher style but
I marry it from time to time and some
might say well why do you even bother
securing this front part with a bobby
pin you know why not just pull it back
with everything else and for me I have
such so much hair back here that the
weight of my hair pulling this back
would totally flattened what I've got
going on here I just went like that but
um if you secure it you're kind of
maintaining the height there and then
that's not going to move once you put
your ponytail up so take your ponytail
holder and undoing mine almost right
behind where the bobby pins are taking
all that hair and you know this is your
no-brainer ponytail right now I think
what takes this ponytail up a notch and
really makes it look finished and I do
this with almost any ponytail I do I
like to wrap it with a section of my own
hair I take a piece of hair that is
right on the underside of the ponytail
so something like this right here just
pull that up and we're going to begin
wrapping this right around our elastic
bands you can see we've got our own
natural hair band there and then I'm
just going to crisscross two bobby pins
and these pins are basically going to be
hidden underneath the ponytail so you're
going to kind of pick up some of what's
wrapped around and then cross another
one over now we've got our bobby pins
back there we've got our hair in our
nice little pony tail and we're ready to
go last thing to do I like to give
another spray of hairspray over any area
where I've used those bobby pins because
I really want to make sure they stay but
how easy was that to just give our
ponytail one more volume a little
finished look right here
you can go straight with your ponytail
curly also how much fun would it be to
maybe wrap this up into a cute little
high bun maybe put a little flour in
there I just wanted to give you an idea
of something I go for it on a regular
basis even dressy occasions to get a
nice finished look that I'm not going to
have to worry about for the rest of the
day so thank you so much for watching
have a great day and I'll talk to you
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
