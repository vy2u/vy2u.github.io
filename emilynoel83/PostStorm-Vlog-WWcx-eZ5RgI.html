this video I am so glad to be back in
doing videos it has just been the
craziest time having to go without power
without cable and internet and all that
kind of thing that we all have come to
rely on so much if you've looked at my
blog and sort of looked at that little
update video we did from Tyler's
blackberry we a huge huge storm rolled
through Southern Illinois it would have
been on May 8th and that was a Friday we
were traveling out of town for his
sister's graduation he had just
graduated the night before and it was
just awful I mean if you check out my
blog I actually posted a few pictures
from our TV station where we work which
we've been covering this non-stop
because obviously I mean you've got
trees down you've got power lines down
there's just you know an unlimited
amount of story ideas that come out of
something like this but it created tons
and tons of damage and it was just a
huge amount of wind it was being
referred to sort of ingest on the radio
as an inland hurricane because it sort
of resembled that on radar
of course our meteorologists and Goa's
say it you know it's it's different
technical terms that they refer to it as
but it's not an inland hurricane but it
was hurricane esque I guess you'd say so
I mean it was very huge ly windy very
very scary so lots of homes vehicles
yards obviously trees damaged
fortunately our apartment made it out of
that okay but it was really a crazy
crazy experience and we have been
without power for probably about trying
to think back look at my little calendar
over there
probably about six days we went without
power and then about ten days without
the cable and internet service because
that had you know the power crews have
to go and repair the basic structure of
the power and then these other crews
like you know some people's foam and
internet cable whatever has to come
after that point so I was so excited the
other day on Monday when it came back on
because I was like really really feeling
deprived from doing this kind of thing
but like I said I had posted some blogs
there are some pictures on there and
just kind of you know some reviews and
things that I was able to do with the
limited access internet access I had
from other places so anyway it's good to
be back to normal and I'm glad to be
safe and sound and just so fortunate to
not have damage where we live because it
definitely was extremely widespread but
I just wanted to talk about a few
different things here I am going to be
continuing to do the people 100 most
beautiful inspired tutorials I've done
Jennifer Lopez and now Carrie Underwood
which I filmed quite a while back and
have just now been able to post I'll
keep doing some more of those so be on
the lookout for that a question of the
week obviously we've been now that I
haven't been able to do videos it's been
a little while since I posted a new one
of those but I'm kind of like running
low on ideas for that so I would really
like for you guys in the comments below
to post your question of the week ideas
there has to be multiple choice because
that's the way they are on my blog so
they can kind of count the results and
everything so if you had some good ideas
and some possible answers or if you just
want me to come up with the answers and
you can throw me out some question ideas
that would be great and then I can get
started with that and excuse me next
week I can start on that I'm going to be
doing some more of those brand favorites
videos like you know pick a random brand
and then I'll tell what my favorite
products are out of that sometimes it
gets kind of confusing when you're in a
store and there's like 12 different
brands and you're like what's good here
so that should be able to help you there
as well I'm not really sure what else I
need to update at this point but like I
said I'm just so happy to be back doing
videos and thank you so much for all the
nice calm
and everybody kind of checking to see if
I was okay yeah I'm still here I'm still
alive so thank you again so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
