video I had some questions about I mean
I've showed multiple times how I do my
makeup in different ways and had some
questions about well what exactly do you
do before you put your makeup on how do
you kind of get your face ready to go
for that so um I'm just going to take
you through it from scratch from the
moment I would sit down at my um makeup
area now I've already done this but I
will um I've course wash my face in the
bathroom what you can kind of see back
there behind me um but I wash my face
and then I always whenever I sit down
here I notice I'm getting a close-up
look at my face I can still sometimes
see even n even if I can't see it a
little a little residue from I make up
there and usually it's barely visible
but once you use some eye makeup remover
i use this gentle eye makeup remover
from Rimmel once you stick a q-tip in
there and then run it around here even
if you can't see a lot you'll be very
surprised at what comes off even after
you've washed your face so just
something to keep in mind there
sometimes I also use the eye makeup
remover when I'm washing my face the
night before to remove the makeup but I
also think that those ol a daily facials
wipes are very effective in removing any
sort of makeup whether it's like
waterproof or long wearing or whatever
it works very well but I mean you know
there are always those little places
where maybe you didn't want to get the
clock right up next year I or whatever
so um so that's kind of first thing I do
when I sit down as I make sure that all
that is completely off my face so I'm
starting with a fresh clean palette I
guess you would say and then I usually
grab my tweezers my little pink blazer
and tweezers and I go over my eyebrows
which I just did a moment ago to spare
you guys the time and the boredom of
watching but just go over that I do that
on a daily basis just so nothing gets
out of hand and yeah it does take an
extra you know sometimes four or five
minutes or so but um you know obviously
won't require that for everyone but I
just like to really keep them neat and
clean every day and so then the next
thing I would do is
for my clan clear personnel and what
this does if I could describe this this
is like a it's a ten percent benzoyl
peroxide spot acne treatment and so what
I see this really doing if I put it on
an area and I've got a really annoying
spot riddles that I've got like one like
right it's not a cold sore anything but
it's just like a little little tiny bit
right on the side of my lip here almost
on my lip and I've got a little spot
let's see where was that on my nose and
I think that was a little place up here
but what I see this doing is kind of
just speeding up the process but that it
would take you know sometimes it's there
and then it you know kind of changes
looks and forms and and this just kind
of I guess speeds up the lifespan of the
blemish that you have and it it really
does you know take it away a lot faster
it'll it'll just I've Admiral having a
hard time describing this but um I just
find that it it really gets the blemish
off my face in a speed of your time than
anything else I've tried so that's the
Clean &amp;amp; Clear Percy gel so put that on
and then I've gotten really gotten into
using the mary kay um i guess it's
called the miracle set and because i
really like that it offers sunscreen i
like how the moisturizers work on my
skin and just works really good for me
it's really made my skin very very
smooth over time and so i used their day
solution which is a 20 and SPF 25 so
basically what you're putting on is the
sunscreen and yeah i know it's winter
but you still want to keep your skin
protected and so this step you know i
just go over my whole face just like
that
and then after that I would move on to
putting on my moisturizer so i use the
kind for combination to oily skin I'm
still finding that that works me mark
right now but probably later on in the
winter I've really noticed a change in
my skin and I may move to the other kind
which is normal to dry so that's a nice
option that Mary Kate gives you kind of
customizing it to whatever your skin
type is and well be normal to dry is it
obvious cream this this kind that I just
the oily combination I just squirted on
my finger looks creamy but as you kind
of spread it out and thin it out a
little bit it's kind of like like a gel
almost so I put that on everywhere I
particular dry area for me is right
around my mouth I noticed i always get
really dry there and sometimes around my
eyes and your eyes are definitely an
area you don't want to dry out I would
use an eye cream at night before going
to bed but I don't use that in the
morning because it can be so heavily
moisturizing your eye makeup can slide
right off so I would recommend something
like that for before bed so just make
sure your whole face is kind of gotten
the moisturizer on it there and then
what I would do the last step before I
go ahead and start applying makeup is
applying a primer and one that I really
like is the Rimmel fixin perfect it is
just great in my opinion it kind of has
a peachy appearance to it though it does
kind of lend out to match any skin tone
and I like that a lot however I am
almost out of this limit so I need to
get some more and something that I
gotten a free sample of from Sephora is
this laura geller spackle makeup primer
it reminds me a lot of Smashbox photo
finish which I like as well if only this
is just a tad bit thicker seems like it
hangs together a little bit more like
when you put it on your face you just
feel like it's kind of their incredibly
smooth I really like this i'm going to
go ahead
since i just opened this i'm going to
finish up my sample of this which is
just kind of has that gel sort of
appearance you can see that and i'm just
going to smooth this on all over and yet
it has a very smooth smooth and
consistency I noticed that Smashbox
photo finish when you put it on your
skin it almost feels like it disappears
immediately onto your skin this is still
like I still feel like a little bit of
moisture with it but in a moment here as
you rub it a little more it just goes to
smoothness and I love that feeling
really makes you feel like you're
starting off with a fresh smooth palette
before your makeup so and this you'll I
think you will notice the effects of
maybe the wear of your makeup with a
primer primers aren't absolutely
necessary but I do think they have a
definite place for when you're using the
mineral makeups because sometimes those
may not have quite the staying power of
other kinds of makeup so putting on
maybe a primer would not be a bad idea
and like i said i'm sure the laura
geller i'm not sure what the cost is on
this but obviously it's going to be more
expensive than your rimmel fixin perfect
or your and and another higher end when
is the smashbox photo finish which i
have that as well here so a couple of
options there for you this is obviously
they're your drugstore option which
works just great so anyway that's pretty
much my routine before i start doing my
makeup I hope this maybe answer some
questions or give GI some ideas on you
know what what the steps sort of our
that you go through before you actually
put your makeup on so thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
