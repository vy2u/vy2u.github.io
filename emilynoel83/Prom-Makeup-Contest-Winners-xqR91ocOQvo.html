this brief contest results video as you
may know if you look back through my
videos a little bit i launched a contest
not too long ago asking for your best
prom makeup look I know it is the season
where lots of proms are going on and
with all the questions I've been getting
asking for and you know ideas for makeup
and stuff I thought there's no way i can
fill all of these requests but perhaps
if people give me some entries to this
contest it will give some people
something to look through and I really
think that that is what happened with
this and I'm really glad for that but I
could not find a five winning entries
for this um I actually found eight hey I
you know at the people at crest that
I've been dealing with with a sort of
the PR firm for crest have been so
wonderful and nice enough to say you
know we'll we'll work with you on this
and if you need to send more you can
send more and so I it wouldn't be
possible without them helping me to
actually pull this contest off and give
you guys some great incentive here for a
great product the crested by advanced
strips or Craig I'm sorry crest advanced
seal white strips really awesome product
if you want to look back on my video
that I did on that in the past but yeah
I saw so many so many great entries here
and don't get discouraged because this
is not the last contest I will do I i am
planning to do more in the future but uh
wow you guys are really really talented
not just the people who won but so many
others so I just wanted to get out of
get that out of the way to start with
because I was thoroughly impressed with
so many entries and i have to tell you
if you are looking for a special
occasion look look through some of those
video responses because so many will
give you great ideas i found i was
learning so many things as i watched you
guys you're really fantastic and i
appreciate it so much that you took the
time to
do this and pull together a look for
this contest but I will I you know get
to the point here and tell you who the
winners are I will also inform them and
they will find out about this in their
email or their YouTube mail so the way i
boiled this damn was i as you know I
took submissions picture submissions
through email for those I didn't want to
penalize those who may be loyal
subscribers that maybe don't make videos
so i chose 4th root from my email and
for from video i had dozens of
submissions guys there were so many and
the email winners are Lisa R sandra p
carry be and kanessa okay so those are
the four email winners and now for the
youtube video winners those winners are
lynnie poisonous oblivion baby mommy
tube and alba mayo and those are in no
particular order those are just the way
i wrote them down there so
congratulations guys i hope you enjoy
your white strips i know that's a it's
gonna be an awesome prize and you're
just really going to love those when you
get them um but i know i'm not really
able to elaborate a whole long cuz i
can't like show you their videos and
show you their pictures right here so i
am going to refer you over to my blog
beauty broadcast dot blogspot com i'll
put a link on the side and you can see
and i will show pictures of the winners
um that sent me emails and links to the
winning videos and you can kind of see a
little bit more why I picked them and
i'll provide a little more explanation
there so you can kind of directly look
at them and see what I'm talking about
so anyway thank you guys so much for
watching and taking part in this contest
is a great thing and I will continue to
do more down the road and also thank you
so much to all of those of you who are
