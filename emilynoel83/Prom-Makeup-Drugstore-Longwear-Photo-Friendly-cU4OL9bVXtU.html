prom makeup look but make it all
drugstore and so that's what I've done
in this video it's a start to finish
you know foundation to lipstick type
tutorial here all the makeup is
drugstore and all my brushes are
drugstore so I wanted everything to be
just really accessible and I know when I
was getting ready for prom in high
school I was only using the drugstore
stuff so you can definitely get a fun
look even just with drugstore products
my thought process with this particular
look was that I wanted the eyes to
practically be like an accessory in
themselves you know something kind of
interesting going on there a fun pop of
sort of silver on the lids that I
thought would coordinate in a really fun
way with any sort of silvery jewelry or
anything like that and you could totally
sub that in for gold for a different
look I also really tried to concentrate
on face products that I thought would be
long wearing and would photograph well
and eye products that would also be
really long wearing it wouldn't smear or
smudge throughout the night so I hope
you enjoy the look alright guys so
excited for this tutorial I already put
on my eye cream and a moisturizer to get
my skin kind of prepped and I also use
this Garnier five-second blur eye focus
that around my t-zone area so my nose
anywhere where I feel like I maybe have
some visible pores this is really good
about kind of prepping that area and I
think it makes the skin looks look extra
flawless once you put your foundation on
top so the foundation I'm going to be
using is one that I think photographs
really well I've used this Revlon
Colorstay whipped on lots of different
people in wedding situations and the
photograph just came out really really
nice so the shade I have here is warm
golden it's in a little jar like this I
like to take it out and just kind of
roughly patch it on my skin so I'm not
really blending it in but just kind of
getting it placed can you hear all the
birds chirping today they are going
crazy now you could use your fingers to
go ahead and blend that in I'm using
this brush from Real Techniques
it's actually a stipple brush but I kind
of like the way you know you can blend
in circular motions with it and get a
really nice kind of airbrushed looking
finish so I'm just blending that in all
over you want to pay really close
attention to these areas around your
hairline your jawline don't let it just
stop on your face definitely bring the
makeup down a little basically if you're
not seeing where the product stops and
starts you're in a good place then I've
got my covergirl plus ol a concealer
boom and I'm going to be using this
around my under eye area I just want to
really brighten this part up and I like
to take it even here like kind of on top
of the cheekbone because as you can see
maybe you can sense that this is just a
hair lighter than my skin tone so it's
gonna be nice to use for brightening any
redness you might have that your
foundation didn't quite cover up you can
also kind of take this down the nose you
know use it almost as like an extra
highlighting tool and this is a neat
little brush that I found at Target it's
from the up and up brand just a few
dollars and it works really nicely too
blending concealer without like over
blending it sometimes when I use my
fingers I mean I'm not saying fingers
are always a bad thing but sometimes
with concealer you can apply a little
too much pressure and sometimes pick up
more product than you're actually just
blending in so for maximum coverage I
have been liking using a brush of some
sort now I would like to set that
under-eye concealer just a little bit
and kind of modify this area make it
look really nice and flawless and even
on the under eye so if you've got a
really fine lightweight loose powder
that's a good product to use here I'm
using this product from ELF it's called
the mineral booster in shear getting a
little bit on this elf small tapered
brush I'm just gonna start dabbing that
here on the under eye see how it just
adds that little something extra to your
concealer that you put there oil control
and getting a nice matte flawless finish
is something you want to step up a
little bit more I love this dream wonder
powder from Maybelline I also loved
L'Oreal True Match
powder both just really nice quality
drugstore powders and I'm using this
brush from Ecotools this is the custom
coverage buffing brush see I just dabbed
it into the product and you can kind of
stipple that on areas that you concealed
so as to not blend the concealer away
but then elsewhere on the face I kind of
like to just buff this in and circular
motions and I get a nice really really
even palette I guess for the rest of my
makeup my blush my bronzer stuff like
that so cool it like really turns this
into a very full coverage look if that's
what you want but the skin still looks
nice and natural actually so I'm
impressed with how these products work
together next we're gonna do some
bronzer and this is my Milani bronzer
excel and fake tan this is a great
contouring shade on this side and then
on the other side it's got just a little
bit of shimmer and it just really perks
up the complexion when you use that and
the brush I'm using is a really soft
angled brush this is from Walmart
Walmart actually has some fabulous just
it's not really a name-brand you know
it's just the brushes they sell there
and this is a nice kind of multitasker
brush it could be blush it can be
bronzer it could be your highlight you
know whatever you need I'm gonna take
this right where you know my cheek is
kind of giving me that hollowed look and
apply the product there to accentuate
that and then really buff in circular
motions over that to make sure there's
no harsh line on my face I'm gonna do
the same thing here on the other side I
sometimes just kind of pull my lips over
to the other side of my face and that
really shows me what my bone structure
is and so we apply the product right
here giving us that shadow and then buff
very easy also taking this just under my
jaw and then I kind of swirl these two
products take them all down your
collarbone area and also I'm gonna do a
little contouring with this matte shade
right around my hairline and for a
little added glow eNOS I'm gonna go over
to this side I'm gonna kind of buff that
in center of my forehead I'm also gonna
take a little bit of that shade right
here on top of my cheeks down the nose
right over here just think of where the
Sun would naturally hit that's where I
like to use that second shade I'm gonna
stick with that same brush and I'm using
this Milani matte baked blush the shade
is delicioso pink it's a really pretty
fresh pink shade just get a little bit
on your brush tap off the excess it
doesn't take much with this color and
I'm gonna just blend on the outer part
of the apple of my cheeks I mean this
spot right out here not too close to the
nose because you know we concealed some
redness there already we don't need to
put it back
this brush buffs in beautifully then I
would like to do a little highlighter
the one I have here is from Physicians
Formula it's the happy booster powder
and translucent and I'm using that elf
small tapered brush that I used earlier
to set the under eye what I like about
this is that it does give you a little
glow but it's not too metallic like if
your skin tends to get a little bit oily
this isn't gonna make you look like
prematurely shiny you know so I gotta
dab that all around these different
colors tap off the excess and I'm going
to start off by taking this right on the
very top of my cheekbone that gives a
really pretty glow on top of the cheek
there and on also gonna take this just
down my nose and right up here in the
center of the forehead first thing I'm
doing for eyes is I'm taking my Milani
eyeshadow primer and I'm just gonna
apply a little bit of that on my lid up
through my crease and up to my eyebrow
then I'm actually starting off with my
waterline and I'm going really really
bright here I want like a lot of
contrast with this look so I'm using
this mark no place to run eyeliner in
white on and it is really really white
and very long where I'm applying this to
my waterline first and then the reason
why I did this step to start off with is
that I want to kind of take this right
around my tear duct tear
here kind of like a base so just right
around there then this is the
wet-and-wild trio in spoiled brat and I
wanted to use a really bold silver and
so that's in here I'm using my Sonia
Kashuk this is like the medium shadow
brush and I'm going to start by patting
that color right on top of the white
first so the inner corner is gonna pop
even more then I'm going to pack the
silver right onto my lid and we're gonna
leave the outer part bare then I'm using
a matte black shade this is also by wet
and wild and it's called Panther any
matte black that you have will do and
for a little more control I'm using my
Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush and I'm
applying that first on the outer part of
the eyelid and you can go just up into
the crease with that as well but keep it
on the outer part here then I'm taking
this black with some sparkle in it with
the same brush and with that I'm gonna
kind of go over the top of the matte
black and carry that part inward and I'm
not going down on to the lid I'm really
keeping some definition between those
two parts and I'm kind of getting it in
the crease there but also pulling up
slightly and then I'm just taking a bear
crease brush this is from the up-and-up
brand from Target and I'm just going
over the the edge of that black and
charcoal kind of color then just kind of
finishing off the top part of the eye I
have an accent color here I'm using pink
if you don't have this trio you could
find another pink I think wet-and-wild
has a pink single or maybe pink has
nothing to do with your look and you'd
like to pull in some other shade like
teal or coral or whatever it might be
but I'm just taking this shade really
lightly again seven whatever color you
want I've got this on a different crease
brush here that's a little more full and
I'm just gonna take this and build up
the color slowly this is a very bright
pink and it can be like really intense
but I'm gonna just slowly keep adding
more and see how that's just going right
on the
order of that black it's adding
something different and kind of fun but
in a way it's also softening a deeper
shade at the same time next I've just
cleaned that brush off a bit and I'm
just gonna go into the highlight I used
on my face and that's what's gonna go
right up under my breasts we're gonna do
some eyeliner and kind of finish up the
remaining parts of the shadows so the
liner I'm using is from Milani it's the
ultra fine liquid liner in black vinyl
this actually dries to a matte black
finish it's incredibly incredibly long
wearing that's why I chose it for a prom
look but if you've got another liquid
liner you prefer feel free to do that
I'm starting it in my inner corner here
and just taking it all the way across
the upper lash line and then I am kind
of winging it up here on the outside and
you'll see how this kind of fits in in a
second
next I'm using a liner brush an angled
liner brush I can't remember where this
came from but it was just real
inexpensive and I'm going into the matte
black and what I want to do is kind of
create a real like distinct darkness
right here on that outer corner like I'm
kind of starting right here mid crease
and pulling it back toward the wing just
giving this look a little different
shape than what I might normally go with
and you can always pull on your blending
brush to soften your edges back out
again if you need to now on the lower
lash line first off angled liner brush
matte black I'm gonna go right kind of
on that wing and get that darkest color
right here on the outside then I'm gonna
take this black that has some shimmer
and I'm gonna go under the rest of the
lash line up until I hit the white stuff
clean off my brush real quick and then
we're going to the silver and see how
it's nice and bright under there we're
gonna do the same thing on this side
just kind of carrying that whiter color
over here and brightening it up then I'm
going to curl my eyelashes and I'm using
covergirl clump crusher water resistant
I'm using this on both my upper lashes
just get it co2 that on there and also
on my lower lashes and the false lashes
I'm using are from I'll or they're the
natural lights line of lashes and the
style is called length and now using my
Revlon precision lash glue on the and if
you want a really detailed lash tutorial
I have one I'll link to that it's called
false lashes 101 and it's like
everything you need to know about false
lashes but if you're planning to wear
these for prom I suggest not making that
night be the first time you've ever worn
them practice a little bit if you have a
chance ahead of time you know in the
days leading up to it try if you feel
totally uncomfortable with it still then
skip them but if you feel like it's
something you want to try I say go for
it
I mean if I could have done something
differently for my high school prom I
would award some false you let the glue
get tacky for like you know 30 seconds
40 seconds or so and then you just
attach both ends and I like to apply
these right on top of my eyeliner very
close to my actual lashes so you let
that glue start to dry and then just do
like one more quick coat of mascara at
the base of the lashes so they're nice
and like form together for lips I'm
going pink and I'm starting out with
kind of a base of something that's
pretty long wearing and then we'll top
that with a gloss I'm using the revlon
colorburst matte balm and this shade is
called showy and you don't have to top
this with any gloss but I just want a
little extra shine on top of it on top
I'm using this Neutrogena moisture shine
gloss and the shade is called neutral
berry it's kind of a sheer pink with
some shine it's just so comfortable on
the lips just a really easy gloss to
wear so that's the look everyone just
something a little more fun and
different from the average everyday
makeup and keep in mind that little
accent of pink up there could be
substituted with any different shade if
you want to and if you don't have the
exact products or brushes I use look for
your collection you may have something
really similar as far as my hair I had
it in some roll early and when I
them down from those big velcro rollers
and this is kind of the end result just
really loose weight and I had curled up
the bottom part and I have a full it's
called updated velcro roller tutorial if
you want to know about that because even
if you are going into some sort of updo
or half up or half up and like a side
ponytail or something anything where you
want a little bit of volume up here at
the crown I would highly suggest those
jumbo size velcro rollers I will link to
that video if you want more details but
thank you so much for watching and have
a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
