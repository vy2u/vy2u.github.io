tutorial with you today I know
everything is going the pumpkin-spice
direction this time of year and I
thought it might actually be fun to do
and I look in that theme because I love
that warmth of color so much it just
made sense to do it I look like this you
might remember last year I did a caramel
apple themed to look us so if you're
interested in that the greens and kind
of bronzy tones you can check out that
video today it's really all about the
warm kind of orange e tones a little bit
of gold thrown in I wanted to do this
themed look and make it fun for fall but
still make it something that you would
feel comfortable wearing out of the
house it's a warm smoky eye with just a
touch of sparkle and so I'm using a
couple of shades that I really love from
colour-pop I'm also pulling in my Vegas
nay Stardust palette and at the start of
this look for the tutorial I already
have like my foundation and concealer on
but I'm going to go through the eye look
and then finish up with some of the
different things on the face that I
think really help enhance the look like
bronzer highlight blush and the lip
color as well so here we go I hope you
like it
first off I'm taking my Cutler pops
super shock shadow in Melrose I'm using
my finger to apply this all over the lid
it's a great matte really orangie Brown
type color I've called this pumpkin
spice and an eye shadow and then I'm
gonna take my Sigma e25 brush and blend
that up into my crease as well just get
it really nice and soft and then I
pulled in my e-40 brush just using that
bear to soften up any edges there and
then I'm gonna apply my highlight I'm
using chandelier from the Stardust
palette and just dabbing that right
under the brow with a flat brush I'm
going to go ahead and line my lower
inner rim with my Milani supreme Kohl
Kajal blackest black eyeliner take that
just in between the lashes also on the
outer part of the lower lash line then
with my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush
I'm picking up the shade called girls
night and I'm just going to dab that on
the outer part of the lid I'm going to
pull that up into my crease as well and
also blend that a bit with my e25 brush
just to get a little more depth it's a
bit more brownish
Mill roses and then I'll take that as
well with a smudge brush on the lower
lash line overlapping more I put the
black liner and then I'm gonna pick up
the shade called millennial which is
more peachy a little bit lighter using
that with a pencil brush on the lower
lash line to just kind of buff over
everything there I'm also gonna use that
with my Sigma e30 six brush which is
nice and wispy and I'm just gonna apply
that it's sort of a light sheer border
now this point you could really leave
the look as is if you wanted to but I
wanted to pull in this color called
crimper it's from colour-pop and it's
just a really fun sparkly golden shade
and this is a very buildable shade so
the more you add it'll go from being
like sheer to a more solid gold any
looking shade so just keep that in mind
you can apply as much as you want next
I'm just going to go across my upper
lash line with my Kat Von D Mad Max
Brown tattoo liner it's such a black
brown I find myself reaching for this
all the time just because it's so easy
to apply a really fine line with and
then I curl my lashes I apply my
covergirl super sizer mascara to the
upper lashes and my clump crusher
water-resistant to the lower lashes I
just love using that down there because
it doesn't transfer off and then I'm
using my Koko lashes number 201 they're
a nice soft wispy but very full lash so
once the glue gets tacky I lay that on
my upper lash line and once that starts
to really adhere to the lash line I
apply just a little bit more of the
super sizer mascara to make sure all of
my lashes are kind of bonded together
then I'm pulling in kind of a
rediscovered product as my bronzer it's
the it cosmetics CC plus radiance ombre
bronzer and I'm just dipping into this
matte bronzer side of the product with
my ELF complexion brush applying it
around my hairline also into my
cheekbone area a little bit and I'm
gonna apply it down on to the decollete
area as well just warming up the whole
skin tone and then there's a really
great highlighter at the top of that
product so I'm using this highlight
brush from my up-and-up complexion set
and I'm using that primarily on top of
the cheekbones you can also take that
down the nose
on the Cupid's bow is a great place for
it as well and then I think just the
perfect blush for this look is this I'm
kind of terracotta shade in my ELF blush
palette it's matte it's really pigmented
I may have knocked the shade actually
when I first reviewed this palette but
it's just great for this look is what
I'm realizing and then with the lips I
kind of wanted to go soft and natural I
used my Rimmel show off lip velvet which
is matte in atomic rose and then topped
it a little bit with my ELF matte lip
color in the shade praline so that kind
of deep and sit up neutralizes a little
bit of the pink in the lip velvet shade
and I think just makes it a really nice
wearable color and so that's it guys
that's my finished look for this pumpkin
spice tutorial I hope you enjoyed it
again put your own tweaks on it use your
own products but maybe just the overall
concept gives you a little inspiration
for the fall and just in case you're
wondering my foundation today is my
Revlon Colorstay for normal to dry skin
and fresh beige an old favorite that I'm
bringing back and I'm combining it with
a little bit of my cover FX custom cover
drops this is in the shade in 35 couple
of reasons why I'm doing that first off
it deepens this foundation just a bit
which is something I'm needing and then
I'm also just kind of testing this out
to see how much added coverage it gives
I think it does a really nice job so
thank you again so much for watching
this video I hope you're having a great
day and I will see you again very soon
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
