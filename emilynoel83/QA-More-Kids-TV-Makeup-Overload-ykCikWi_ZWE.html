I've been wanting to do one of these for
a while I've seen some people do some a
really fun snapchat Q&amp;amp;A and several of
you have said you should do that too
because I'm very active on snapchat
these days and so I'm gonna do that I
also wanted to open this Q&amp;amp;A up to all
of my social medias so I've got
questions from Facebook and Instagram
and Twitter as well and I'm just going
to I guess turn the volume on my phone
way up thank you so much my favorite
drugstore mascara I got the drawer handy
here it's the covergirl super sizer
right now this is the one that I am
using all the time I need to repurchase
it I think it gives great length to my
lashes anytime you see me like not
wearing false lashes and I just want to
throw on mascara this is what I want to
use because it gives like the best just
length definition makes me look like I
have a lot of lashes so this has been a
real game-changer for me I really like
it and I have a full review on it if
you're interested
oh that's always such a hard hard
question because I cannot confine myself
to one brand mmm it's too early for this
kind of question I'm thinking of a brand
that has just the most vast amount of
products and that's always coming out
with new things so there would
constantly be variety and you wouldn't
get bored and I guess I would have to go
with NYX off the top of my head here
because I know they've got a lot of
things that I do love and there's just
so much to choose from so if I had to
just stick with one brand it would have
to be a brand like that that just has so
much going on
thank you so much that's super sweet and
that has been a question I've gotten a
lot not necessarily that I'm doing you
could jump with it but just like you
know asking about what life has been
like with all of these different
elements and honestly it's been tricky
it's definitely not the kind of thing
where you know the more you think about
it during your pregnancy or the more you
make little plans for yourself once the
baby comes then everything will be
smooth sailing it's just not baby comes
into the picture and it's like gods just
laughing at your plans right there and
that's someone who has gone many years
in their marriage without having a baby
you can get kind of set in your ways and
also now a couple years away from a
traditional job you know I've been here
making my own schedule doing things
exactly the way I wanted to do them and
really being able to get into a routine
and it was almost kind of hard to let go
of that feeling mentally even after
having the baby it was like I still part
of me thought well I should still be
able to you know do my work during the
nine to five period you know and it just
wasn't happening
do you like my tuft by the way that just
wants to why every video there's no
template that's gonna just work well for
everyone but I can tell you what has
worked for me is to work on video stuff
early in the morning she tends to go
back down for a nap like after her very
first feeding around you know six
o'clock in the morning or so between
5:00 and 6:00 she'll have that and then
go back down to sleep forever sometimes
a good long while and so I'm able to
shoot videos during that time while
Tyler still here so he's kind of on hand
if she gets up I find myself doing a lot
of editing after she goes to bed at
night and I also do a lot of video
shooting on the weekends too so we don't
have anybody extra coming in here like
nannies and sitters and things like that
so it really is on Tyler and I to juggle
this and make it
and sometimes she'll take a big long nap
like midway through the day and that'll
give me some time to do some editing but
really like while she's up and
especially now like she's walking and
she's getting into everything like I
can't be thinking I'm going to have some
big chunk of time during the day when I
can do video related work so while
working at home with a baby is hard you
do have that ability fortunately you
know the flexibility with this kind of
thing in YouTube to just let your duties
kind of flow into those parts of the day
where you know the baby is not taking
center stage does it make for very long
days yes and do I feel absolutely
exhausted at the end of most days
absolutely sometimes I feel like my
pillow could be a cement block and I'd
still sleep but one overall thing that
does help me umm it's having kind of a
priority list not getting down on myself
if certain things don't get done because
I used to be a very like use my planner
and planning today but that just became
frustrating with the baby because so
many things we're getting switched
around or skipped or missed and so I
just kind of go buy a big list and try
to just knock off as many things as I
can and sometimes I get more done some
days I get less done but what having
that list does is kind of remind you of
the tasks or the videos or the blogs or
whatever it might be that you were
hoping to do and you can glance down at
that because you won't always know when
that child is going to give you some
spare moments in the day so when you
have them you can jump to your list and
actually have something kind of ready to
bust out thank you so much umm okay so
yeah now she's walking do I want another
baby
um well now that she's walking you
really realized how difficult and
exhausting things can be because she's
just so curious she's everywhere she
started climbing the stairs and she
wants to do that like non-stop and I
feel like I've known even before having
her that I wanted her to have like a
brother or sister you know maybe
multiple I don't know
I would love to have a family with
several kids that was definitely like
the most frequently asked question out
of anything I have another child I am 31
years old so obviously I don't have
forever or I can't be like putting
massive gaps you know between them like
I'm not pregnant now but it may not be a
long long time before another one comes
around I hope God willing you know right
question absolutely not I do not feel
guilty one bit I make no apologies for
the amount of makeup I have because it
is what I do it's how I make a living
you know it funnels directly into
reviews tutorials and just my whole
education in makeup the more makeup I
try the more educated I become in what I
sit here and talk to you guys about so
being able to make comparisons being
able to compare a high end to a
drugstore item and just you know even if
you're trying things and you're not
always talking about every little thing
I feel like I'm still taking in so much
information and becoming more and more
informed all the time so I would
definitely let Belle know that you know
this is what Mommy does for a living
this is not what everyone does not
everyone's like daddy and needs to have
a bunch of legal books we've all got our
craft and I think it's easy for people
to look at well you have a lot of makeup
and look at that in a critical or like
in a very you know you're so
materialistic way for having all of
these things but you know the purpose of
all this again twofold I'm contributing
an income to this household and I'm
contributing thoughtful honest
well-informed reviews to the people who
watch me so that is what my bagel
collection has done for me and I feel
not one regret about it in fact
I feel great about it for what it has
allowed me to do over the years
false lashes okay winged liner you may
have seen this in some of my tutorials
but I love making like the little
triangle in the outer corner it's going
to be hard for me like sitting here
right now to fully explain it but you
know I like to draw straight out from
like the top part of my eye out and then
up from the lower lashline and then fill
in that little triangle and that's
usually what works for me false lashes
my false lashes 101 video covers like
everything false lash related in super
detail so I hope that video helps you
but really I think glue is huge for
false lashes I think it can make or
break the experience so get Revlon
precision lash glue it's great about not
getting too much on the lash band let it
get tacky and use one of those false
lash applicators like the one from BH
Cosmetics or I just saw
I think our Dell is making one that
looks very similar that I saw in CVS the
other day and then you mentioned color
pop eyeshadows one of the easiest ways
to work with these is adds the actual
pop of color like on your lids so if
you've got a really shimmery they do a
lot of great like sparkly shades pick
them up with your finger and absolutely
just pack them on and press them on your
lids with your finger and I've had
really good luck with a lot of the
shades I've had that way that was a
question that I saw had been asked a lot
on Instagram too my favorite thing about
being a mom I just had to speak those
words and I feel like I'm gonna get
tears in my eyes now but there is so
much love in my heart like I mean I love
Tyler I love my family and now I feel
just unbelievably connected to this
little human being and I just I love
that and the most fascinating thing is
just seeing her just go through these
different progressions and
grow and learn new things in her
curiosity and all bad and I know a lot
of times you hear people saying like
time slowed down you know because
they're already walking or they're
already doing this than that and I mean
I I get that because she's she's little
and cute and it'd be fun if she was
little and cute for a long long time but
at the same time like I can't wait to
have a conversation with this kid but
you know really learn what's going
through your mind because she fascinates
me I think the other part of the
question was about like maybe the most
challenging part about keeping up with
videos and really I think it's just the
different kind of schedule overall like
I said before you know I've gotten in a
habit and kind of a swing of things with
basically working like nine to five five
hours before on YouTube and now
everything I do kind of shifts into
various parts of the day and sometimes I
get frustrated when I start a task and I
can only get it like halfway done and
it's like wait I would just get into
that and then something else happens
over here he coming more flexible is
probably the biggest thing and I do feel
like I'm getting better at that all the
time but I didn't start out it's like
I'm naturally super flexible whatever
happens it's you know that's not always
been the way I am especially with
YouTube it's like I want to do things
how I want to do them so letting go of
some of that has been something I've
been learning to do so thank you so much
to everybody who asked a question on
snapchat there were many more that I I
know I couldn't get to for this video
but hopefully I could do this again
sometime because that was really really
fun move on to some questions on other
social media Phoebe says she thinks it's
great that I made a full-time career out
of being a youtuber but I would be
freaked out about what the next move
might be maybe YouTube will last forever
but if it ends or isn't a viable career
option because policies change what
would you do
well that's a good question too and I
really think that thinking about job
security really that's a concern I think
could be a concern in any field I mean I
just think back to the news and all the
stories we've done on this plant closes
this business shuts down these federal
or state jobs are being cut due to
budget concerns and you know they're
just
and when you really think about it who
knows exactly what's going to happen for
the future of the job that they're
working it with YouTube goes there's a
good chance something's going to pop up
in its place or you know maybe the
median changes but you know if I've
still got a message to put out there I
may look into another way of doing it
you know they're a financial standpoint
I mean Tyler's offering an income to
this household as well so that's a
comforting thing and I do have a college
education I mean if I wanted to do
something totally different or take what
I do on YouTube and form it into a
different type of thing I feel confident
in my ability to do that so no I'm not
worried about it
actually says talk about your hair
routine you have long beautiful hair
really thank you what changes did you go
through during your pregnancy what hair
changes did you go through oh man it was
alright during pregnancy I felt like
everything was pretty smooth sailing
with my hair right after having her
things were kind of cool hair wise that
I remember right around November
December I started dealing with such
oily hair like I've never had this scalp
that was so oily and I didn't know what
to do about it and I was looking up like
remedies i rinsed my hair with Listerine
like all these different things that I
had found and you know use really really
clarifying shampoos and I honestly think
in that time I may have even made the
issue worse by stripping my hair so much
really what I use is my suave two and
one it's the almond verbena I've
reviewed it on the Express channel it's
seriously like the cheapest thing ever
but it's two-in-one shampoo and
conditioner and I remember thinking
maybe using that that has a little bit
of replenishing quality with the
conditioner built-in they just like even
out my whole oil control issue and that
has been the one thing that I've used
and I felt like my hair ends up really
clean you know it's back to slick shiny
clean when I wash it again but it's not
too dry not too oily it's just right so
that's working out well but I have lost
a lot of hair and that kicked in it
seemed like after the six month mark you
know just losing a lot in the shower so
that was kind of crazy and I guess I was
losing it from all over because I never
noticed like a patch of my head the
world
Oh my parents gone I guess that's the
good thing I can tell like just pulling
my hair up into a ponytail you know you
yank it all back and it's like I feel
like my handful of hair isn't quite as
big as it used to be but I do notice now
I'm in you know baby hair phase so I've
got a lot of little hairs sprucing up
everywhere Bridget on Twitter what are
some life lessons you want to teach your
daughter kindness above everything
making people feel important and helping
other people is so important I feel like
there will be such a temptation people
talk about you know spoiling a kid
rotten and you know like wanting to give
her everything I feel like that
temptation will be there just because
she's her little girl and you just
wanted to have everything but I think
really instilling in her that she is not
the center of the universe and that all
the other people in the world are
equally important and what can you do to
be of service to be of use to you know
let your light shine a lot of mud like
that song I think is everything in this
world you know how can you take what God
has given you take your gifts and spread
them Valerie says would you ever
consider doing Mommy Awards monthly or
as a part of the Emily Awards I think
that's a fabulous idea I think now
especially maybe this coming Emily
Awards I will have built up some ideas
on what things have really worked well
that's a great idea what was the song
you and Tyler had your first dance to as
husband and wife that that's from Erica
Jones hi Erica it was Billy Currington
must be doing something right must be
doing something right I just - just son
you love that song at that time like
that was the song of that summer for us
so it just it became our wedding dance
song tons of people asked on Instagram
about missing the news or will I ever
return to TV I know I've said this
before but one of the biggest things I
miss about the news would be the people
I worked with because I feel like it's
rare to go into a workplace and
genuinely feel like the crew of people
you have around you like you just love
them like they're just all awesome so
that was the place I was at with
I left the station like I really just so
enjoyed everybody still do I say this
now and they say if you want in your God
laugh tell him your plans you have said
that a million times but I don't really
see myself returning to a traditional
workplace especially after being in this
work from myself be my own boss mode for
so long and now having a baby too it's
been my personal decision to want to be
at home with her and I want to continue
to do that and if there are more babies
you know I feel like my role in the home
is going to be even more important in
that way but what I do with YouTube just
allows me to be so flexible like I said
I can take what I used to do in a
relatively normal schedule and and
really push it out to other parts of the
day and that's just been handy and
important for me but away from just you
know those practical aspects here's the
thing the ability to sit here and just
talk about whatever I want determine my
content I mean that really when I was on
the news and my co-anchor Kevin and I
when we would have a moment where let's
say the teleprompter went down or we had
a situation where it was breaking news
or just an ability to kind of riff off
of one another you know those were our
strongest moments when it was just all
the ad-libbing and that was so fun I
really preferred that over being
scripted which a lot of the news is
scripted so this being able to sit here
in front of my camera and just ad-lib at
all times it's great for me I also miss
interviewing people the least glamorous
moment of motherhood that first week
right after having a baby like that was
really down and dirty not glamorous not
sleeping feeling dirty wearing the same
clothes over and over again like that
was kind of rough that is repeated
itself at various times throughout her
early early childhood now but also when
you got the blow out diaper and so you
got the messy diaper you got to get that
all cleaned up and then there's a mess
on the ones the and a mess on the
changing pad and you've got like this
baby partially dressed and you're
running over to the laundry room with
all the poopy stuff and it's just you
know that's not
glamorous moment either favorite silly
cute thing Belle does right now I love
when she peeks around like she doesn't
need anybody to start doing peekaboo
with her she will just get the game
going if she that's what she wants to do
so she'll be on the other side of a
chair and she'll peek around and she
gets this huge smile and I love that are
you worried Belle will grow up thinking
her name is nook yeah well her nickname
honey you don't even know the extent of
her weird nicknames
berto which started with Pooh Bear and
then we called her Boober toe and then
Queen berto and all that's craziness I
mean the kids got nicknames I grew up
with a lot of weird nicknames too and I
still went to school knowing my name was
Emily and I knew what to like write on
my papers or how to sign my checks and
you figure it out nicknaming is just a
big part of my family it's like
everybody's got a nickname describe the
perfect plate of nachos Lindsay Britt
Moss great question okay you got your
layer of chips I'm gonna go with some
ground beef seasoned I want some nacho
cheese over that I want several dollops
of sour cream or guacamole I will take
either some pico de gallo all over the
top of that for some tomatoey spice and
a sprinkling of black olives that'd be
perfect what attracted you to Tyler um I
think the most outstanding thing about
him and the most unique thing about him
it's important to know like Tyler is
six-six he is a big tall guy and I'm
just a little 5 foot tall thing he has
always had this what I would call it
quiet confidence about him um even like
back into high school where a lot of
kids get defined by you know he was
playing football he was doing basketball
and I think kids kind of get their
identity from a lot of the things
they're involved in whether that's a
good thing or a bad thing I think that
is kind of what happens he was always so
well liked like people just kind of
gravitated to him other guys just really
wanted to be friends with him and I
think it was because he never ever came
off as cocky or arrogant or anything and
I think that's one of the most
unattractive qualities in a guy is when
they act like they're the shiz you
I always felt like he was really
confident with just who he was and
that's a very attractive quality I think
he has taken that with him throughout
his whole life and I feel like he just
attracts people to be his friend just
set you down to earth like quality human
being and I'm thinking like back to high
school and colleges I talked about this
but if I would have known like what an
amazing dad he was gonna be I mean I had
my hunches over time but if I would have
known what just an amazing father and
husband this guy would be like I don't I
would have been proposing to him I guess
walk around bald for the rest of your
life or never wear makeup walk around
bald yeah I makeup is always taking
priority over hair for me favorite emoji
um well okay there's the emoji I use a
lot which is like the pink heart which I
really like and you know are you set off
and but my favorite one is really the
smiling Pooh
because that's the one I will send to
bub like if he's still in bed or
something and I've been up I will like
text him multiple smiling boosts and it
just makes this phone blow up and I
think it's hilarious and it's just it's
just funny any traditions with Belle I
feel like we have really developed in
the past month or so a tradition in the
evenings like before I feed her like in
her high chair her dinner there we go
out to our swing we've got this great
swing kind of up on a hill in our back
yard and it's kind of like porch swing
style but it's got its own little what
is like a mini pergola type thing over
it I just love swinging out there with
her and she is so all over the place
these days and so energetic that that's
one of the things where she can kind of
sit back and chill and she's not
sleeping you know she's totally awake
and she can watch like cars go by and
kids go by playing and she just really
enjoys that but it's like our moment to
just chill and I find myself looking
forward to that moment at the end of
every day you know every nice day when
we can go out there and do that and I
feel like it's kind of become a little
ritual be Mathis 86 fellow southern
Illinois girl Walt's Maggie's or
Quattro's those are all
two places in this area I gotta go with
Quattro's I love me some deep-dish how
do you discreetly breastfeed what kinds
of tops should I buy where a like maybe
a little bit looser fitting top and
where your nursing bras well the nursing
bras are really handy because they just
you know
unsnap right there and you've still got
a bra like hooked on to you but the flap
comes down and out comes the sustenance
so if you've got a bra like that that
you can quickly work with and you're not
fumbling with the ones that I have like
best have actually come from Walmart
I've gotten a couple from Target they
were okay but my Walmart was just for
whatever reason I like the fit but when
you're wearing a looser top as you can
imagine you know you can lift it up
without exposing your entire midsection
so that kind of gives you some coverage
and then the bra part comes down and you
can stay very covered up feeding in that
manner also I just always keep in my
diaper bag a lightweight like receiving
blanket or swaddling blanket type thing
the lighter the blanket the better
because I've been in some hot sticky
outdoor situations bill doesn't love
being covered up completely while she
feeds but I kind of like if I'm holding
her right here I just tossed it over my
shoulder and I let a lot of her face
still be you know out to the open she
doesn't like being totally covered up
but the actual boob and nipple area is
all covered by that and that could still
be awkward but you get quicker at it and
especially as she latches more
effectively and stays latched on like it
does get easier I but I know it can feel
very awkward starting out someone just
woke up hi how you doing speaking of the
swing look at this picture I took last
night while we were on the swing look at
that this is gonna be the last question
cuz I've been shooting this video for
like literally an hour yes he Brennan
says and this was on Instagram I
remember you said no one ever needs
makeup but did you feel like you needed
it when you had melasma I'm asking
because I've dealt with really bad acne
while pregnant breastfeeding I felt so
ashamed it would not go anywhere with
make up I feel so grateful if you
answered this and um I totally get what
you mean by that because it's like
you've got something where you feel like
extra extra different from your normal
self you know and you just feel the need
to cover it up and I remembered feeling
the need to cover up like when I had my
dark melasma type stripes on top of my
skin I did feel like self-conscious
about that and I felt the need to cover
it up I mean obviously not to the extent
that I wouldn't show myself without
makeup on and you would fully see that
in my youtube tutorials so I mean with
you guys I guess I've had a certain
comfort level with showing that because
it's makeup is what it's all about but
just out in public I think that was a
circumstance where I was wearing the
makeup for other people it was almost
like I don't want them to have to wonder
and ask about what they see on my face
because it really stands out so just to
bypass that whole topic let's just cover
it up you know it's like that was just
the easier thing to do but I do think I
just felt a little extra self-conscious
with it and that's just the way it was
you know I think we all have our things
like that from time to time but I cannot
thank you guys enough for your fabulous
questions even more than I was able to
answer in this session of answering
questions I really enjoyed how
insightful how kind you were thank you
so much for watching and I will talk to
you all later bye
you bake it yourself in that mirror love
you love you love you we pop it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
