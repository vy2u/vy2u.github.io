I asked for your questions in several
places hopefully you didn't miss it I
asked on Twitter Facebook and also
YouTube under the community tab so I
think it came up probably in your
subscription feed that I was gonna be
doing this I thought this week would be
a good week because I'm giving myself
this whole like colorful
I challenge you'll see more about it in
Saturday's video but this thing that I'm
doing is keeping me in a certain kind of
look all week and so it's hard to do a
lot of other kinds of makeup application
or tutorial videos so I thought this
would be a good time but there are so
many great questions you guys I'm gonna
try to get to things that I feel like
I've seen asked a lot and I mean I first
compiled some different things off of
Facebook and one of the most liked
comments on there was from Julie and she
was requesting to see makeup on my mom
and product recommendations for mature
skin so I totally hear you on that I
think that's really great that so many
people are interested in that I have
been playing with some different
products on my mom here and there and
that will be a really fun video and just
a nice like kind of ongoing thing to
offer here again on my channel seems
like once the babies came along we kind
of like any spare time that we had
together was kid related but I think we
will definitely make time for that so
thank you for that request Bethenny said
how do you feel about morphe and
colour-pop I feel like a lot of gurus
worship those brands but I barely hear
you talk about them if at all love your
channel and have been sub since the
beginning thank you so much Bethany and
while colour-pop is definitely something
i've talked about i have several videos
that i've done on the brand i use
different products just here and there
sprinkled randomly throughout videos and
i think they've got some really great
things some unique textures some really
affordable products so thank you for
bringing that up because they have
released I feel like a lot of newer
things and I think a new look at the
brand just in general really focusing in
on their products would definitely be a
good thing to do as far as morphe goes
morphe is a brand that i just kind of
got turned off from really from the
beginning because i felt like there was
so much hype and sometimes when things
get overly overly hyped that's where I
sort of start to shrink back from them a
little bit because it's just kind of a
turn-off to me and I feel like when the
hype is also accompanied by like
use my code for blah blah blah I wonder
when people be raving about this stuff
if there wasn't a code to attach to it
and then like the Jacqueline Hill
palette came out which looks like a
fabulous palette and so many people
loved it and I think that's great but at
the same time I saw video after video on
it for a period and I thought do I even
have anything else to offer if you've
been with my channel for a long time you
know like I don't necessarily love to do
exactly what everyone else is doing and
to top it all off until just recently I
haven't felt like I've had a lot of
people really asking for my opinion on
morphe but I've had some very sincere
requests from viewers who seem to be
very curious about how that line stacks
up with other things that I like so I
did place an order and I have a few
things and I will definitely let you
know my genuine take on them you know if
they are great great if I don't enjoy
them you know I'll let you know that too
but yeah you guys ever like that like
you you see something getting so much
attention so much hype and you're almost
like okay I'll just I'll just wait on it
Heather says how do you feel about
getting PR and has any company been
nasty to you for not giving their
products positive reviews I personally
don't think I've really had any nasty
mean super defensive response from any
brand more than anything I think I've
seen some really mature responses from
brands sometimes in the comments of a
particular video that I do about them or
a personal email saying like thank you
for taking the time to thoughtfully
review these products you're giving our
team some things to think about with our
future launches and stuff like that and
I think that's really cool when brands
see youtubers not so much as a vehicle
to just spread the word on a product but
also something that they can take
feedback away from and actually grow
from somewhat so I think that's really
great if there have been times when I
haven't liked a product and I've noticed
I've stopped getting PR from a certain
company so they've just like said nope
not worth it or anything anymore I guess
and that's fine if I'm interested in F
in a product I will definitely buy it
myself and how do I feel about just
getting PR in general I think it's been
a wonderful thing for my channel and
doing product reviews and being able to
get a full line of lipsticks and try
them all on for you and just understand
more about this or
that product in just a more
all-encompassing way not that you can't
give a quality review having just a few
shades of something because let's face
it that way of doing things was what my
channel is built on basically but now I
feel like when I do have the full range
it allows me to give a more educated
opinion the thing that I don't like is I
think when reviewers get swayed by a
really elaborate PR package you know
with so many extra goodies thrown in
let's say that a viewer would never
really have access to I think we as
reviewers have a responsibility to
really separate ourselves from that and
think okay this was nice and fun and
beautiful and all but exactly how good
is the product Becky says how if it all
have your feelings toward your work and
your passions change since you've had
your children I have two little ones of
my own and find that my perspective on a
lot of things has changed yeah I think
that's really true I feel like having
kids has actually made me appreciate my
passion which is you know makeup YouTube
all that stuff I think they've caused me
to appreciate it more I feel so grateful
for the time that I have to come up here
and work on a video people say how do
you wake up so early to get started on
all this stuff and it's like I'm
genuinely happy to be doing it and I
knew it like back when I had Bill and
like a week it passed and I hadn't done
anything on YouTube and I really felt
this feeling inside like I miss it I
miss getting up there and playing with
makeup and so I think while you have
kids in it you know they become your
world and just your total top priority
in life I think I've come away feeling
really grateful that I still have this
hobby that's just for me I'm just really
happy about that and in another sense
they've shaped my perspective in the way
that like let's say you get a negative
comment one day and sometimes yes they
do get to me I'm human whatever but
generally speaking if there's some sort
of negativity that comes up that I see I
care so much less about that than I used
to
it's like having these kids has put into
perspective what's really important like
I could sit here and worry about this
one mean thing that this random person
said to me or I've got these two healthy
kids laying on the floor right now like
what is more important in this world
having kids you know it's like well I'm
excited and love my hobbies and love
getting into that stuff
in a sense it's also made me less about
myself in a very good way because little
things that would have gotten under my
skin before now they just don't even
make the priority list and that's a
really great thing nicole says i
recently moved out of my parents house
and I'm learning how to adult what's the
best advice you can give someone like me
wow I'm thinking about the first time
when I felt like I really grew into an
adult and it was probably the summer
between my junior and senior years of
college when I had an internship and
that was one of the first job type
things that I'd done that I felt really
really pushed me as a person not just in
terms of abilities or like this was a
hard sport or this was a hard subject in
school but as my whole who I am as a
person that internship made me become
more independent it was at a newsroom
and a TV station learn about deadlines
getting out like this is before you had
like a super smart phone where your GPS
would talk you all the way to the place
you needed to go like they printed me
out a map for MapQuest go find this town
shoot this story bring it back by this
time write it edit it we'll have it on
the news by 6:00 having that kind of
expectation on myself where I really
felt like people were definitely relying
on me my job really had importance you
know as a small newsroom small market
they needed me that summer to go out and
report and I guess my point here is that
I'm not sure what kind of line of work
you're into as you're out on your own
adulting but I hope that it's something
that does make you slightly
uncomfortable that does push you out of
your comfort zone because there was
nothing like that summer to push me and
it made me come away feeling more
independent more capable and like I
could tackle darn near anything so
Nicole make sure whatever you're doing
is something that challenges you because
I think you will see so much growth from
that and also have fun now before you
are I hate to say tight before babies
come into the mix and all kinds of other
things that enrich but do inevitably
complicate life like have fun go out
enjoy yourself live it up enjoy that
freedom I'm not saying you'll never have
freedom again in your life even if you
do get married and have kids or whatever
I mean life for me now is truly better
than ever but it's different and so I
think we need to enjoy and appreciate
every season of life that we're in so
soak it up have a lot of fun I would
work hard play hard dawn says how do you
keep your marriage going with two
littles also is having your parents
closer so much better do you ever have
bad parenting days and where do you see
yourself your channel in five years lots
of good questions I feel like once you
have kids you have to have just such a
high level of confidence in your
relationship because there are a lot of
things that take the attention off of
just you know the two of you and you've
got to be able to look back at that
relationship with your husband and think
you know maybe we don't have as much
alone time as we once had before of
course we don't we just can't go out on
as many dates or do all these different
things but I know how he feels about me
and I know how much he cherishes me and
that knowledge really helps to keep
things going also make sure you know
what your love languages and make sure
your significant other knows too because
I think that sorts out a lot of things
as well for example my top love language
is words of affirmation so the way love
is most effectively communicated to me
is through words and so Tyler is aware
of this and that is not his top love
language so when yours is different from
your spouse there's a little learning
that has to take place his like number
one love language I think is quality
time so for me I think he's come to
realize how much it means to me to like
send me a text message out of the blue
like love you so much thinking about you
or just something little like that goes
a long way for me because that's my love
language so I think it's about having
that knowledge making the effort even in
small ways and don't you guys also think
that it's just the recognition of this
is the season of life that I'm in right
now and I've got the confidence that
this person is my person he's in my
corner he loves me more than anything
but some of the things that we used to
do are gonna have to take a little bit
more of a back seat and that can be okay
it's having your parents closer so much
better yes my mom and dad gosh it was
last toward the end of last summer
midway through last summer they bought a
house down here near us and it's been
absolutely amazing they also still have
their house in my hometown and they go
back there frequently and you know they
see other family and there's time spent
there as well but it's kind of this
mutually awesome thing where they can
you know
see and spend time with their two
youngest grandkids who are going through
so many life changes at all times it's
amazing to see that from my perspective
and to have their helping hands at times
has allowed me to do some big things
behind the scenes that you haven't even
seen yet on my channel but it was just
one of those things where when they
decided that that was something they
wanted to do it was like all the
dominoes just started falling so easily
and everything just happened so
seamlessly and nicely and it's just been
a wonderful wonderful thing do I ever
have bad parenting days yes ma'am I have
days where I think maybe I'm not cut out
for this like I seriously you know two
little kids one is three one is one
there are days where things magically
run like a well-oiled machine and I'm
like gosh I could I could handle a few
more of these and then there are days
where I am like dear God can I just go
to the bathroom alone can I finish my
coffee can somebody stop needing
something every two minutes there are
hard days there are days when I lose my
cool there are days where I have to sit
back and think like gratitude gratitude
gratitude yeah if anybody wants to tell
you they don't have a bad parenting day
then be very wary of that person and
where do I see myself or my channel in
five years and I just I want my channel
to keep going I want to be able to reach
more people I'm not given myself any
kind of like number milestone that I
must meet by some certain time because I
think that sucks the life and fun out of
everything numbers really do I mean
honestly I just want to keep doing what
I love hopefully getting better and
better at it above all else I hope I
have two kids who are healthy and happy
and gosh by that time both in school
Jamie says do you think Tyler will ever
quit his job and stay home with you and
the kids since YouTube has become your
career um no I I mean Tyler has his own
career and that is that is a really
attractive thing to me I love that what
I do while he's been very supportive of
it has been part of it in many ways over
the years it's been a great thing for
our family and just our whole dynamic
this flexibility of YouTube I love that
it hasn't dictated really what he's
wanted to do with his life I like that
he's got his own goals he's an attorney
his mentor the attorney he works with is
just a fabulous example for him highly
respected incredibly skilled it brings
me so much joy to see him in his arena
doing well excited about it continually
learning doing great things like that is
attractive to me like that feeds me when
I see that in a person my thing doesn't
have to be his thing and I like looking
at his thing and thinking you know what
like how in the world is he dealing with
some of these topics that he's coming
home and telling me like he's working on
this you working on that like how in the
world I have so much respect for him and
what he does and I love that it's his
I'm insanely proud of the work that he's
done the deuce that he is paid in his
career and it's just fun to see him grow
and grow in that both in his job and as
a person Lindsay says what's been the
hardest thing balancing life with two
instead of one I feel like I've had that
question a lot with a husband and work
or I guess how you balance it we've got
two and a half and seven months 5:00
p.m. to 8:00 p.m. is pure survival mode
thank you for your videos it's crucial
mama time thank you so much for making
me part of those sacred minutes of your
day where you have some time to watch a
video the the hardest thing going from
two to one I think is just it's very
physically demanding I thought that the
change from going from no kids to one
kid was a real emotional thing for me I
felt like I had this whole leap of
emotional growth as a person and just
realizing how much our life would be
completely turned on its head that was a
huge emotional leap and then with two
it's like you know what's coming
basically you understand the demands
that a new baby brings on your life but
it's more like just the physical grind
like actually physically keeping up with
both like you're feeding one I remember
the hardest times were when I was like
feeding Bell a meal you know like
regular little food and then I've got
this crying newborn where you've still
got to like support the neck and
everything it's like she needs to nurse
and I'm trying to get food for bail like
that was so hard and now I've got new
like hard stuff in terms of Eve being
one and walking and trying to do like
every dangerous thing in the book with
two it's it's about like the physical
demands on you
the stamina like you said 5:00 p.m. to
8:00 p.m. I so get that you reach that
hour of the day we're like Tyler when
are you coming home and exactly because
I am duh as a whole I mean once you get
out of that delicate newborn stage I
think that was the hardest thing was
having a toddler who was running around
doing everything and then having this
delicate newborn once they get out of
that and they're moving more they're
playing more I'm seeing so much more
ease just in play time between the two
granted Bell will you know have her
little people set up just so and then
Eve wants to come over and like whack
him all over but all in all they can
relate to each other a little bit more
and they can have a little bit more
interactive playtime as times going on
and that's really really fun to see so I
have seen things steadily get easier as
that second baby becomes able to handle
a little bit more do more Christine says
Emily you're a YouTube Oh G how do you
feel about the way YouTube is changing
do you feel like there's competition
amongst Beauty YouTube channels love you
I'm a longtime fan and never miss a
video thank you so much Christina as far
as competition among Beauty channels
yeah I think there's competition in the
sense that people can only ingest so
much video content in one day like
there's only so many minutes in the day
so they can't watch everybody even if
you really like set in for an entire day
of YouTube watching you still couldn't
watch it all so yeah I do think we're
somewhat competing for people's time but
in the same sense I find YouTube to be a
very flexible thing in that you know
we're not just live for a little bit you
know our videos are out there and if
somebody doesn't watch it on the day it
comes out that's fine they might stumble
upon it a couple weeks later and then
maybe watch four or five videos of yours
in a row and that's just what's gonna
happen and you see channels with massive
growth on YouTube and you see obviously
a lot of interest from people in
watching youtube videos and this is a
good thing and I'm a highly like just
competitive person kind of by nature
just generally speaking if you want to
play hide and seek with me like I will
find the place in the house that nobody
else will look I will always win in that
game
I get so into watching sporting events I
and like once you engage me in something
I'm in it I'm in the moment and I'm in
it but one thing I'm really able to see
here as far as the YouTube landscape
goes talking you know having been on
this for 10 years it's good to see that
there is such an interest in YouTube and
channels are blowing up all the time and
that's great because that shows us that
the presence is there from the viewers
and let's just throw out a name here
let's say somebody came to YouTube and
discovered YouTube beauty beauty videos
through Geoffrey star and then maybe
because of him maybe they're searching
through YouTube and they happen to
stumble across me think of it like your
channel is a store in a mall it's very
encouraging to see a lot of foot traffic
going through that mall because there's
a chance some of its gonna come over to
you so we as creators should all want to
see great growth happening among YouTube
channels and hopefully that carries over
to our own because the more people who
are out there on their YouTube apps and
on their computers watching you know
there's that chance that maybe they'll
find you one thing that I might complain
about a little bit I think in terms of
the YouTube landscape the changing
landscape you do have some massive
channels and I feel like sometimes these
people are a little bit out of touch
with what else is happening on YouTube
like you'll see people with millions of
subscribers getting on Twitter and
complaining about this or that or like I
remember seeing a tweet a while back I
don't even remember who and they were
talking about what a negative and
terrible space the beauty community on
YouTube is and how he really feels bad
for anybody who's part of that I was
left feeling like how out of touch and
sort of I hate to say arrogant can you
be to think that that's the only layer
of what's happening here because there
are god knows how many thousands of the
smaller channels out there who are
putting out amazing content have
supportive viewership bases like I'm not
out there to be the biggest youtuber in
the world and I may have had that goal
float through my mind at some point in
my earlier years but now I feel like I'm
really in a place where I just I want
people to view me who want to be there
who want to take in what I have to say
not who just felt like it was the fad to
subscribe to me so okay they'll sit and
reluctantly watch for a while like I
want people who are in it and share my
same level of passion for
this and those are the people who I want
showing up to my party you know I want
people who are receptive and enjoy my
message Josh what was I don't even
remember what the question was but I
guess my point here is that there's a
ton of fabulousness happening on YouTube
one thing that I almost wish people
could do is like imagine if your numbers
were erased if nobody could see what
your subscriber count was if nobody
could see how many views your videos
have or how many thumbs-up or
thumbs-down that you have like how would
you feel about your content then like
think about that how would it just
personally make you feel would you feel
like you are doing your best job I wish
people with really large followings
would just open their eyes and look
around and see just how much real kind
of old-school so to speak YouTube is
still out there and is really being
appreciated I think by viewers who kind
of long for the og days so that was just
a handful of questions from Facebook I'm
gonna have to make this be kind of a
multi-part thing I think that'll be cool
like I can sprinkle in you know a video
like this every now and then we'll
definitely be addressing the Twitter and
the YouTube questions that I had also so
thank you guys so much for your time
your feedback your kindness is so
important to me it says so much more
about you than it does about me so many
sweet comments that I came across and I
just thought these people have a light
these people are letting their light
shine like they have positivity they
have love for themselves and they're
able to share that love that's what it
says about you and I love you for that
thank you so much and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
