joining me for part two of my little Q&amp;amp;A
session here there's actually a few
weeks back I announced that I was gonna
do a Q&amp;amp;A video and it's turned into a
little bit bigger thing than that and
the first part of it was questions from
Facebook so I'll link to that video
below if you want to check out those
questions at video turned out to be like
20 minutes long so I thought I want to
you know get to people who asked
questions on other platforms as well so
well let's just split it up and just
kind of space it out so these questions
came from YouTube I had actually posed
the question on the YouTube community
tab and got a lot of great questions
there so let's just get a little warmed
up okay this first question I've been
thinking about this test sunrise says if
something happened to your makeup
collection and you had to start from
scratch what are the first 10 things you
would buy good news bad news here on
this question the bad news is I'm not
gonna answer it now the good news is I'm
gonna make a whole video about that I
think that's a great idea
totally doing that so Thank You Tess
I've already like formed my list of 10
things although I'm going back and forth
on a few but that was a great question
Arina says if someone was going to make
you a sandwich right now what kind of
sandwich would you want
well grilled cheese always sounds
appealing maybe even a grilled cheese
and it's a little tomato thrown in there
something that sounds really good
especially like crisped up perfectly and
maybe a side of fries or something
weight fries weren't offered okay or a
burger does a burger count as a sandwich
that sounds really good right now and
it's only 641 a.m. oh here's what I saw
just a couple times
Malia says do you and Tyler plan to have
more kids if so how many here here's
something I've I feel like I'm back and
forth on it quite a bit like I find
myself imagining like looking at my
current life and being in various
situations usually like really stressed
out situations and I'm like how could I
do it with one more kid does anybody
else feel that way sometimes like you
just you can't quite imagine it just
like I had trouble imagining how life
would be once Eve came along and now
that she's here it's like just like
she's always been here so it's funny how
that stuff works and you also have to
remind yourself like things aren't
frozen in time you know Belle's not
gonna be three forever Eve's not gonna
be one forever you know
the whole family dynamic is evolving as
everyone gets older so there are times
where it seems like gosh that would be
really hard and then guys there are
times where I think I can't imagine not
like nursing another baby and like just
having another little newborn baby I
can't imagine not going through that
situation in life again and I've asked
Tyler about this he's like but lately I
mean we both like the idea of it but I
would never I never underestimate the
amount of work it is to put another kid
into the mix I greatly greatly respect
the mothers who have this whole big
group of children they're juggling all
their needs and they're getting them all
met and doing everything like that's
amazing but I'm not against the idea
I'll say that and thank you also Malia
for not saying like are you gonna try
for a boy you get what you get you know
I truly feel if you're gonna be blessed
with another child baby's gonna be
whatever they're supposed to be for your
family as far as girls or boys like
Tyler and I absolutely love having girls
and if we had another girl like that
would be amazing and if we had a boy
that would be awesome too that's the
god-honest truth if you're at a point in
life where you're thinking about having
babies you you come to accept that it's
gonna be whatever it will be and that
will be right for you um there's a lot
of Em's interning mb says how did Tyler
propose this is actually on video here
on YouTube I can't remember if it's on
my vlog channel or on this channel it
might be on this channel back what I did
the m's world videos but wherever it is
I'll find it I'll link to it below
because that's really the best done
description of the moment but I'll just
tell you it was in college it was our
senior year in the fall homecoming pep
rally I was a cheerleader and I was very
very hyper focused on this huge routine
that we had to do that night and once
that was done Tyler and the football
captains got up and they each got to say
something some little thing about the
season or the game coming up or
something Tyler told them that he wanted
to go talk last and he said a couple
things about football and then he
mentioned the cheerleaders and then he
called me up there and
I believe his words were you don't need
to give a speech one word to be fine and
he went down on his knee he took the
ring out of his pocket and the crowd
went bonkers like my cheerleading family
my old girth the people down here was
like jumping around it was one of those
unforgettable moments surprising because
I think it was very out of character for
Tyler to do it that way
shock the pants off of me and everyone
else it was just truly quite a moment I
feel I always feel bear by the way what
I'm sitting here in my videos and I have
like no earrings on no rings on I have
those all downstairs in our lower
bathroom it's connected to our bedroom a
nice crib is still in there and so if at
all possible I hate to get in there and
like disrupt anything in the early
morning hours at that ring and that
semester talking about we're talking
about this the other day like he worked
a job in the college he had an
internship that semester he also worked
a job outside of school and he was
playing football and he I'm sorry
and he got me that ring I will always
have that ring and that ring only I mean
here's a guy in college making these
sacrifices in his life to do something
like that and to pull that off and be
able to to do that and he worked all
summers to but anyway he means the world
to me that moment was incredibly
unforgettable we actually met in high
school that was when his family moved
near like my hometown and his school and
my school were together for sports so
his like sophomore year it would have
been you know he started him with
football and I remember meeting him
through his sister and other friends and
just kind of the same friend group and
it was like February of our junior year
of high school was when we went to the
sweetheart dance together and that was
kind of like the kickoff official hit of
our relationship and it's never ended
since then Kylie says any particular
reason why you don't do sponsored videos
other than just trying to keep an open
and honest platform part of it might be
just me being on YouTube for as long as
I have and I've kind of just seen so
many things like run through my email
inbox but long before sponsored videos
became a thing I felt like I became very
engrained in the way I like to do
things here on my channel like before
you get an email saying hey we want to
pay you six grand to review this product
and it has to have these ten talking
points and we also want a minimum of
this many posts on Twitter and Instagram
and blah blah blah and long before stuff
like that was happening like I realized
how much I loved having full control
over my content here basically and that
was part of like leaving the news was
being able to be part of a format here
that I could say what I wanted to say
that I could have total creative freedom
here and all that and choose what things
I want to talk about on my channel and
not talk about something because a brand
told me to that's really really
important to me but the thing that I've
noticed I'm not saying this has been
everyone's experience with sponsorships
because I don't know exactly what
everyone else is doing exactly what
everyone's been offered but in my
experience the vast majority of the
things I get every single day in my
email inbox have so much control over
the brand seem to really be wanting to
control the message right down to I mean
some of the most ridiculous ones were
saying like we want you to take our
product like here's the whole outline of
the video that they give you we need to
take our product compare it to this
other product and have ours come out on
top because of these reasons a B C and D
like oh my gosh that's just not what I'm
here for you know I'm here as an
advocate for my viewers would I ever do
a sponsored video it's like I don't know
what that with the right opportunity
come along with a brand ever say this to
me would I ever get the email from a
brand that says hey would you agree to
do a video on our stuff and say anything
that you want like positive or negative
no talking points no further
requirements as far as social media
postings or any uncertain amounts that
you have to do or things you have to say
you can just say absolutely whatever you
want and we will pay you for that that
has not happened in my world yet but you
know if that did happen
why should I say no I guess if somebody
is really eager for me to be completely
transparent and say whatever the heck I
want is just understandably most brands
are expecting that if they're gonna pay
you you're going to deliver something
that's going to benefit that brand in
return obviously positivity Katie said
what kinds of videos do you have the
most fun filming watching any videos
that aren't your favorite to film or
watch I really have fun shooting like
get ready with me type videos they're
kind of a bear to edit because they end
up just being so darn long but I really
like just casually putting on makeup
chatting with you guys it's not being
too formal about it you know just
enjoying myself I really like doing that
videos that I like to watch I think are
definitely Q&amp;amp;A videos that's kind of
what drove me to do this because
sometimes when I'm having trouble coming
up with video ideas I go back to this
place where I think well what would I
want to spend time watching and I really
do love watching Q&amp;amp;A s because it's kind
of like seeing a person get interviewed
sort of you know by their viewers
basically and I used to be in news for a
while
I loved interviewing I loved asking
questions and I think any person that I
watch who I feel somewhat connected to I
enjoy watching their makeup videos any
person who I really like watching I'm
gonna be interested enough in them to
know like tell me a little bit more
about your background like who are you
what where do you come from what's your
story you naturally want to know those
things and I think it's just always
interesting to see like what people ask
and and just how people handles the
different questions and difficult
questions do and also off of the idea of
enjoying a Q&amp;amp;A and learning more about
people this quote comes from brené Brown
she says people are hard to hate up
close now I'm not saying I'm on the
verge of hating just all kinds of people
out there but I will say this it's easy
to be critical of people when you I
guess don't really know the whole story
and you're maybe you're just basing your
opinions off of some vague assumptions
or you know you just saw this one little
snippet of this person's life so I'm
gonna go judge that when a person opens
up and you really learn more about what
makes them tick and why they are the way
they are it's hard to hate you know it's
hard to dislike it's hard to be critical
and judgmental when a person is opening
up and being vulnerable to you and I
feel that way so much why I think about
gosh wouldn't it be great to sit down
with some person who supposedly is a
hater you know of my channel and
couldn't I just sit down and get to know
them and talk to them a little bit and
just figure out what makes them tick and
maybe they learn what makes me tick and
odds are we'd probably get along great
I truly carry that hope in me across the
board that if people took the time to
get to know one another better
understand each other's struggles and
issues and whatever it might be it's
hard to not like them and develop some
form of compassion and empathy and
understanding for them so yeah I guess
bottom line there I think we should all
strive to get to know one another better
and kind of let people in because as
brené Brown said people are hard to hate
up close Susan says favorite guilty
pleasure meal weirdest pregnancy craving
a guilty pleasure meal nachos really
come to mind I love nachos I love it
when the cheese has has soaked the
nachos it has penetrated the chip to
therefore compromise the crispness of
the chip and it has become what I like
to call soggy nachos so you know like
that is so good to me like maybe it's
not just the cheese doing it maybe
there's a little sour cream maybe a
little salsa maybe a little guac mmm yes
I would like some nachos that would be a
guilty pleasure meal another guilty
pleasure would be onion rings in any
form rings haystack style pound they're
all like tangled up give me some money
give me some Southwest ranch with that
business and I will definitely be your
best friend we're just craving that I
had back when I was pregnant I don't
feel like I had super odd like food
combos that some people talk about like
the pickle and ice cream thing like and
that didn't happen for me but I felt
like everyday things became like
freaking gold to me during pregnancy
kamek chicken sandwich became like oh my
gosh this is just the most delicious
thing ever and white cheddar popcorn was
out of this world and give me some kind
of chewy gummy candy and I'm just like
it's gonna floor me to a whole nother
level that was kind of what happened for
me during pregnancy but I will say this
what I think beats pregnancy cravings
y'all are breastfeeding cravings you're
ravenous your body can also take in more
because you're not housing a beach ball
in there I found outside of like the
first week after giving birth when I was
oddly like not hungry very much I got
over that hump but it must have been the
milk coming in and whatever I felt so
hungry and thirsty all the time and just
had a much bigger appetite in general
and I felt like I would have certain
cravings for things and beasts
favorite step in your makeup routine and
in an unrelated question how do you stay
away from drama and controversy well
favorite step in my makeup routine
lately I have really been gaining so
much satisfaction out of the process of
putting on foundation and that was not
always my favorite step I'm not sure if
it is currently my favorite step I
really like putting on lip products too
but I makeup it's also so much fun I
would say right now right now it's
foundation like I've really liked
popping it on with different methods and
seeing like does it go on better with a
Beauty Blender or a brush or you know
whatever that's very satisfying to me
especially like you get a good really
good coverage foundation it's going on
really well like that's fun how do you
stay away from drama and controversy I
feel like I'm just kind of in my own
little world here I don't hang around
with controversial and dramatic people
is probably the shortest answer to that
question I'm in it for the makeup I
really am I'm in this channel in my
thing here for the love of makeup and
sharing that with other people who feel
the same way I do I'm a complete geek
when it comes to makeup and that's what
it's all about for me I'm not on here to
do something ridiculous and get some
sort of huge reaction and draw people to
my channel because I said something way
off-the-wall I'm just here to be myself
and I'll let the chips fall where they
may you know people will come for that
people will not come for it that's okay
but I mean I'm this makeup loving girl
in the middle of the Midwest and it's
may be easier for me to stay away from
controversy than people who are I don't
know in LA and just kind of in the thick
of it with a lot of other influencers
and then you get tied to this one or
that one I don't really know how that
all works so I'm in my own little world
here my own happy place and and it is
possible to do that cat says how do you
stay positive and how do you manage your
time well I think a great way a great
like actual practical thing you can do
anybody can do to help themselves keep a
more positive mindset and actually train
your brain to become more positive I
learned about this on an Oprah's super
soul Sunday podcast is to actively
practice gratitude this means like
taking just a short amount of time just
a couple minutes per day to write down
let's say three new things every day
that you're grateful for and they can be
big things
things whatever comes to mind that you
can feel appreciation for and happiness
for and I think that is huge I've talked
about this on and off on my channel if
you feel like you've heard this before I
feel like I've said this frequently over
you know the last period of months here
but it makes such a difference because
what you're doing there you might think
well what's just a couple minutes a day
writing down a few things I'm happy
about what's happening is that you don't
even realize it but then in your time
when you're not actively writing them
down here just going about your day you
find yourself looking for the gratitude
points and you will find what you're
looking for if you're going out into the
world and you're looking for positive
happy good soul filling wonderful you'll
find it if you're looking for something
to bitch about something to hate
something that you can just really start
complaining to somebody about you're
gonna find that too okay set your mind
out for what you're looking for I'm
looking for waking up in the morning and
where's those birds chirping oh I love
that sound oh what a beautiful sunset
that is outside oh my gosh the smell of
that coffee coming out of the coffee
maker and that sound that it makes as it
trickles into the cup I mean I'm talking
small things if you can find joy in
those small things you are set and this
may not come naturally to everyone and
that's where the writing of the
gratitude points the training your brain
spending a little time every day here
that with some prayer morning and night
just reflecting and being still and
quiet and for me it's thanking God for
these moments in my life that I get to
enjoy every day and you know just really
sink your teeth into that and people see
pictures of my girls and they say you
know enjoy every moment I wholeheartedly
feel like I am you know I am because I
am thinking about it I am I am writing
it down I'm reflecting on it at multiple
times during the day just be present
live in your moment put the phone down
turn off the noise look around you and
honestly the positivity and the things
that you can be grateful for will come
raining down how do I manage my time
well it's not always easy and I'm not
always good at it but I think that what
I do do is wake up early every day and I
try to get a lot of work done in the
still quiet time of the day when I'm
with my kids I want to be with my kids
and that's a choice that I've made and
when people say like how do you get up
so early like you know it's it's a joy I
love doing videos this is this is good
and this is fun happy good times are had
in this room this is great
so I am eager to get up and put my
makeup on shoot these videos and then
know that I've gotten a big chunk of
productivity knocked out at the start of
the day and once a nap time comes I'm
gonna you know do some editing and get
some work done there get a video posted
do whatever I'm not the biggest like
calendar like mega planner person cuz
some people have like they're really
nice planners and they're all cutely
like sorted out and I think that's
really neat if you can get into that and
for me I'm more of like a check off the
to-do list for a day kind of person I
use the notes feature in my phone and
you know I'll have a list of things that
maybe I need to get done on a certain
day or even just within a certain week
you got to prioritize like I said wake
up earlier start doing things in the
early part of the day if you feel like
you're always running out of time at the
end of the day and ultimately don't beat
yourself up if not everything gets done
I spent plenty of time beating myself up
when Belle was very little and I was
trying to deal with that whole
transition of my in my life of having
complete control over my time to very
little control over my time because I
had a new baby and you know just seeing
things not get done and seeing my house
and not get clean and things not get
cooked there's a little coping that you
go through there and then you realize
you're just sucking zapping positive
energy out of yourself by beating
yourself up for not being productive
enough because sometimes life happens
and things just don't get done and
that's okay
Selene says do you and Tyler ever have
any arguments you two seem like the
perfect couple and well I don't think
anybody's perfect I'll say that and I
also don't think that arguments are as
are a sign of a problem in a
relationship I think sometimes arguments
need to happen in any kind of
disagreement make this your goal don't
make it your goal to be right just make
it your goal to be understood you know
get your point across
I do think
to heaven though because sometimes I
think this depends maybe on personality
type and just what your tendency is but
I do think there are people who will
tend to hold things in and then it can
fester and build resentment and I don't
think in any important relationship in
your life whether it's with a spouse a
friend or anybody you don't want to
thank anyone's building resentment so
sometimes things need to be hashed out I
mean with Tyler and I I would say
arguments can come back to communication
sometimes with us like why didn't you
tell me like you had a zillion things to
do I have to work today and you weren't
going to be home till 8 or 9 o'clock
like why is this all just piling up on
me late in the day when I'm really
hoping that I can you know at some point
put my feet up here and have a break
because I'm exhausted I think it's
normal things that come down to to busy
people like not always communicating
well enough with one another when am I
the worst offender and probably when I'm
going through some sort of hormonal
issue like you know your hormones are
always like kind of changing after
having a baby and then you're
breastfeeding then maybe you're not
breastfeeding and going through another
hormonal shift and stuff like that and I
feel like I've been on a hormonal roller
coaster probably for the past few years
you know going in and out of pregnancies
and nursing and just all that stuff and
then you pair with that some sleep
deprivation and you best believe I can
make a mountain out of a molehill you
know I could see like three dishes and
two cups sitting on one end table and I
can say well what could you pick up your
own cups for good sex there have been
times you know there have been times
when I'm not trying to make this seem
like like those are huge issues or
anything we have been fortunate to not
have like some major issues a lot of
stuff with relationships I do think
comes back to love languages which I
mentioned was it the last Q&amp;amp;A video you
got to understand not just how it's
comfortable for you to give love but how
the person you're with needs to receive
love and are you delivering on that well
enough for them and if you are I think
that takes care of so much and helps a
lot a sweet text message a really kind
sincere compliment or something like
that can go a long way from you like I
can ride high on that for quite some
time like for other people maybe you
need to actually carve out the time to
go do something special get out of the
house go spend some time just the two of
you doing some things if you're feeding
into the love languages I think you will
help the relationship situation and
bless guys like Tyler who I mean he seen
me go through like these hormonal
changes things that make me more
emotional than I might normally be being
completely exhausted trying to juggle
everything still just having his total
support in those situations has been
great not that we don't have little
squabbles here in there and lack of
communication in certain areas like we
can always do better with that but
overall I think at the core of it I know
I have all of his support and he knows
I'm behind him a hundred percent as well
tabatha says what nationality are you
and your husband Tyler is Norwegian all
the way whole family of blond-haired
blue-eyed people yes Norwegian and I am
I've been told that I'm heavily English
and Irish although and this is gonna be
fun too to do on the vlog maybe but I
have an ancestry thing I want to do that
kit I need to put my saliva in something
and send it off I guess and I'm gonna do
that and I'm gonna report back on what
exactly I am Katherine says what is the
best part about being a mother and the
worst the best part is feeling that deep
deep love that is just unlike anything
just incredible love I don't know how to
give it a greater more accurate
description than that but somebody woke
up early but it's feeling that deep
intense love for someone it's waking up
at the start of a day thinking I get to
make someone's day better I get to help
someone learn and learn something new
maybe that day and grow and watch them
learn and grow like it's just it's such
a blessing and a privilege but the worst
part is like the fear that inevitably
comes alongside that love you know what
I'm talking about knowing that these
little critters are like just so
amazingly precious to you and what if
anything ever bad happened to them like
it would it's unfathomable so I think
it's kind of that such a way
where if you if you love hard you you
feel like there's a ton of that stake a
ton at risk you don't want to lose it
and also I think kind of a hard thing
about being a mom is sometimes the the
slightly isolated feeling you get
sometimes from just being at home with
the kids working from home you're always
doing kid things which is great but at
the same time you're always doing kid
things you know there's two ways of
looking at that so on the whole it's
absolutely wonderful and being a mom is
the best thing I can ever think of doing
and I have been asked a lot what do I
miss about TV or would I return to TV
news and I don't I don't see that
happening really I feel like the further
removed I get from news or the longer
it's been since I've done it and the
more engrained I get in doing my own
thing here on my youtube channel just
the more into this I become and I felt
like I got out of the news to to not be
scripted and I just really appreciate
the ability to be here at home and and
have the flexibility to do what I want
to do to raise my kids to do the videos
I want to do and just talk about what
makes me happy the news is tough and
it's getting tougher and I don't know if
you all know necessarily how many times
a broadcaster is holding back tears I
mean you know what has been going on in
our world these days and I think when
you're sitting there on that anchor desk
I never desensitized to any of this and
I'm not saying like oh look at me I'm a
sensitive wonderful person and no I just
I never like got excited when something
came across the scanner in the newsroom
like oh there's a big fire let's go
let's go cover it let's go get our
cameras and you know that troubled me
when I would hear those things and
you're sitting there on the news desk
and I can hear my co-anchors voice
shaking when he has to say certain
stories and certain terrible things that
have happened and you just want to stop
and be real for a second and give them a
hug and say this is awful that this
happened like I am absolutely outraged
you know like that's what you want to
stop and be able to say but know you're
getting paid to sit there professionally
and not show emotion and
do those things you know what I'm saying
it's a tough job it's not a great paying
job and the hours were absolutely
grueling so do I want to get back into
it I'm not really jumping it but anyway
I would like to say thank you guys for
sitting through this epic Q&amp;amp;A video I
hear you guys on Twitter with the
questions that you've left for me and I
will do that as well in a separate part
this little bits being quite good up
here this morning but I think we're
gonna call it a day here in the makeup
room and I will see you guys next time
