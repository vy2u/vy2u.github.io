and I was thoroughly blown away by the
amount of responses or votes that I got
on this past question total of 816 votes
I think that's incredible and it was a
fun question this week it was kind of
like who inspires you in terms of makeup
or who do you look up to sort of in
terms of beauty and I had lots of
options in the question if you want to
look at the full answers just check out
the sidebar to see how it all panned out
but the top four well first off the
number one was actress with thirty
percent next was a beauty expert or
makeup artist with twenty-six percent
next was a friend or family member with
fourteen percent and next was an
everyday person with thirteen percent so
I I mean I kind of took that one in my
thought process when I put that down as
an option I put like maybe a person you
don't really know but you see and you
like admire them in terms of beauty so
um i just kind of put that option
there's that kind of surprised me that
that had that amount of votes but i
think that's awesome and i was really
happy to hear what everybody's ideas
were and the fact that so many people
look up to different actresses in terms
of beauty you know that may mean maybe i
want to do some tutorials that you know
feature some people in show business or
something like that that are kind of
inspired by different people so anyway
for this video I thought maybe you guys
could just learn a little bit more about
me and what my answers to that question
would be and I just thought the way I
answer this i answered for answered
friend or family member just because
over all these years you know the
majority of my you know 25 year old life
so far I think I've really looked up to
like my mom and my sister a lot in terms
of beauty just because those were the
people but I was I've been around ever
since the beginning and ever since
really before I even started trying out
makeup you know those were the people i
was seeing putting on makeup and just
kind of looking up to them in terms of
looks and it's interesting because my
sister has you know it kind of looks a
lot like me dark hair dark eyes
my mom has blond hair and a little bit
lighter look so it was kind of like I
had two perspectives there as might sort
of like my beauty influences but I
thought it would highlight but those
that's the way I answer the question but
then I have in a close second
considering what I do now is a
newscaster so I wanted to share with you
a product sort of from each person I'm
inspired by and for my sister um she
kind of inspired me in terms of lip
stuff lip stuff seems weird to say it
that way but um she tended to wear like
kind of plummy berry toned lip colors
she has kind of fit more fair skin than
I do really dark hair just a gorgeous
person and she were kind of like plummy
or berry tone lip colors and they always
look great on her and once I started
wearing makeup at first you know I
didn't really do too much in terms of
lips you know not much more than like a
stick of chapstick but once I got into
it more I realized how much I liked like
the deeper kind of berry tone glosses
like for example one of my current
favorites this one it's Revlon Colorstay
mineral lip glaze in perpetual plum so
that's sort of a something that when I
use these I honestly I almost always
think of her when I reach for that
little drawer in my makeup area that has
my plum colored losses in it you know
that's sort of the image I've got in my
head when I'm thinking about wearing
that for my mom she I remember her
always telling me like from the start
even when I was younger like like really
young I'm guessing like I don't know
before I would ever wear makeup like
waiting fifth grade and I was in a
wedding or something and before I you
know obviously I wasn't marrying any
makeup at all but um she had told me
like you know Oh everybody looks good
with a little bit of peach blush on and
so I remember her like putting some on
me or something like that very vaguely
and she had always said you know
everybody looks good in peach blush so
to this day whenever I put on my peach
blush this happens to be Milani minerals
in my tie I'm wearing it right now
I'm wearing it most days when people ask
about my blush so um that's kind of what
I think about there because she'd always
said it's a universal color generally
like peachy pink Slyke this so whoa
don't drop it but but anyway just a
couple of influences there and then in
terms of newscasters i love robin meade
on headline news i think she is awesome
but many I've learned this kind of threw
just little bits of research here and
there but I've realized that many
newscasters wear false eyelashes to kind
of especially you know your honor the
more you want to make yourself look a
little more wide awake or add some
interest to your eye area they'll put on
false eyelashes I don't happen to have I
just came from work and I don't have any
on today but um you know they are such
an asset and that was kind of what got
me on to trying out false eyelashes in
the first place is because I realized so
many people in my industry did that and
that's kind of like their beauty secrets
so r del I love the ones from ardell
that you can find at sally beauty supply
I like so many different varieties
there's one called it's like the fashion
lashes number 106 that's one of my
current favorites right now but I like
the kinds that are more flared out at
the end or the half lashes that give you
more of an upturned look at the end of
your lashes so anyway just a few kind of
random facts about me and where my
beauty influences come from if any of
you were wondering so uh that's my phone
ringing you have a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
