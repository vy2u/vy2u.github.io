time for our question of the week and
this week's question was where do you
most like to shop for makeup products
and overwhelmingly the number one
response was at the drugstore so uh
figures a lot of my viewers and blog
readers like the drugstore so if you
want to see the exact numbers you can
check the description box but um I was
kind of wondering you know what will I
do is sort of a video to represent this
question and the results and so I
thought since drugstore was the number
one response I would show one two three
four five six eight of my all-time
favorite drugstore items so these are
ones that just are really like
must-haves for me and keep in mind if
you're watching this like several months
down the road there may be even more
products that I would put on a must-have
list I had some that I had to like cut
out because I didn't think I'd have
enough time to talk about it also you
know yes I could still add more to this
list but these are ones I think will be
my favorites for a long time to come so
let's get started I'm not gonna give a
real detailed review chances are I've
mentioned all of these products at some
point in time in other videos so I'm
just gonna kind of put out the
information and then search through my
videos if you want to know more so first
off the Rimmel lasting finish foundation
my shade is 200 soft beige love this
wear this for work quite often I just
think this is such a high quality
foundation it's a 16 hour transfer
resistant formula and it truly will last
me throughout my whole day under bright
lights when I'm anchoring and it just
works so well it's a mineral and rich
foundation so I have not had issues with
this breaking me out or causing problems
on my face and I love the finish and I
love the staying power so that's Rimmel
lasting finish another one that I really
like this is a powder and the reason why
you probably don't see a little lot in
my videos is because it's kind of my
travel powder so when I keep in my purse
or it's one that I take with me to work
and before I go on for the news I touch
up with this and it is
loreal true match powder and my yeah
it's got a hit pan on that for sure and
my shade is sun beige w6 and i like it
to be its occasionally when my skin kind
of changes and gets lighter in the
winter this is a bit deeper but I'll
sometimes still use it just with like a
big fluffy brush you know to kind of
just all over my face it kind of warms
it up sometimes but it comes with a
sponge it's one of those that opens from
top and bottom and this one's kind of
old this one's been beaten up a little
bit but I love this powder nice coverage
gives a really flawless finish I've had
this on like this is the last thing I
put on my face and then had some of the
other people at the station asked me
like what is that that's on your face
you know what kind of makeup you're
using and you know they're like oh I
tried that and that's really good too so
anyway
L'Oreal True Match pressed powder is a
really good pressed powder I think a
good blush covergirl cheekers I like
several different shades
two of my favorites are plum berry glow
which is the one I'm going to show you
here and also golden pink as a contour
shade but this is a really really pretty
color for the apple of your cheeks kind
of a pinky plum shade little hint of
shimmer these are known to to be pretty
long wearing they've been given the
allure Beauty award numerous times as
far as I know and just a really good
pick for those who want a nice blush and
they have a really nice selection of
shades I think an eyeshadow that is one
of my all-time favorites I have a lot of
different eyeshadows I use high-end
low-end you name it so it was hard for
me to narrow this down and say okay just
one but I did manage to pick one just
one shade and it is the covergirl
single in golden sunrise and I don't
know how long I've been using this shade
as my brow bone highlight I just feel
like as opposed to using a super duper
light shade up there this warms up the
entire face sometimes I'll go over it
and do like a little bit of a lighter
shade on top too but this just works so
well and I mean you're probably seeing
that thinking that on your brow bone
isn't
dart but really you just like if you
swatch it with your finger it's just a
pretty golden shade and it can come off
really sheer if you use a big fluffy
eyeshadow brush and you use a light
touch I mean if you can really make that
shade work for you so if you like kind
of that golden and glow if you like
bronzy skin this can also work great
like on your just on your lid if you
wanted to only wear this shade I mean I
think it would be really pretty so I
really really like golden sunrise from
covergirl it also comes in a trio with a
couple of other kind of bronzy gold any
shades and moving on I've got a few more
products here for more another must-have
Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in
blackest black this is my standby
liquid liner I've tried other ones pin
form this form cream form I mean this is
just my all-time favorite so for a
liquid base liner that's what I love I
also love the color stay pencil liners
this one happens to be black brown I've
got several shades and I like them all
so far the best liner I mean I'm not
just saying drugstore but best liner
who's okay a mess Sarah and this is one
that you haven't seen me using recently
because I have run out of it and I need
to go repurchase but it's the hip high
intensity pigments mascara pretty much
as close as you can get to a false lash
effect in my opinion so I'm definitely
going to go out and repurchase this but
I love the hip mascara it's just one
kind that line that individual L'Oreal
high-intensity pigments line sells one
mascara and this is it and I love it and
now this last one is one that has made
its way into my must-haves very quickly
so you've got to note that that means
it's an awesome awesome product in my
opinion if I've already calling it like
my alt one of my all-time best and it's
the Revlon Colorstay mineral lip glaze
I'm not picking out just one shade
because I have several shades and I love
them all this one I'm showing you is
lasting shimmer and I have that on right
now
and love the texture love the staying
power like the shade colours a lot and
it's just a great product so I hope you
guys enjoyed hearing about what some of
my must-have products are from the
drugstore since that was overwhelmingly
