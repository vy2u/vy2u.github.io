having a good day this is the return of
the question of the week videos only as
you may know as I mentioned in a
previous video question of the week is
alive and well it is just not on my You
Tube channel it's on my blog so I have a
link to that on the right in the
description box so there's already a new
question of the week up for this week so
just check that out and vote there
reason why I'm doing it there is because
it totals up the results for me it can
just be more accurate and take less time
than me counting through everything so
anyway the polls closed on Sunday nights
so that means the following Monday I'll
be doing a video on based on that
question something just sort of along
the lines of that question doesn't
necessarily mean I'm just sharing
results but it could just be you know
the results plus something just semi
related to that question so this past
weeks question was what aspect of doing
makeup do you enjoy the most and here
are the results in case you haven't
checked them recently like peaking
around here foundation powder only had
51 votes
bronzer blush which was my vote I just I
don't know what it is I just really
enjoy putting on blush I think it's so
easy and creates such a difference in my
face but I had had 66 votes so if that
was second place of eyes look at that
289 Wow and lips 29 votes so a total of
435 votes so I can't say I'm surprised
that eyes was pretty popular I think
that's something that if you like makeup
you really do enjoy doing I like doing
eyes too I just I don't know something
about just doing blush I just find it so
easy and I'm kind of really into blush
I've quite a few blushes right now
actually so I don't know I just really
like that but I like all of it so we all
probably do like most of those things
anyway so anyway the question was though
I'm you know what do you enjoy about
doing makeup what part of the process do
you most enjoy and I think for some
people doing makeup turns out to be more
but sure than something they really do
enjoy so I thought going off of that
question I would give some tips for that
you can do without spending any money
and one where you could spend a little
money and just ways to help you enjoy
your process of doing makeup and the
first one is to change your organization
around or the way you're storing it
sometimes you know things just get so
cluttered to where it's like not even
fun anymore to mess with the stuff
because you're just like either looking
through a big pile or you know you've
dumped everything in this one big
container and you're just like digging
through it and you're not getting the
most out of the things you have because
you know I've gotten into that before
too like I've gotten you know a certain
kind of thing stored in somewhere and
because it's not I'm not making it
accessible enough to me I'm not using it
and it's really something I would like
to use so just kind of think about
changing your storage around you know
that's an easy way to switch up what
you've got and maybe use your products a
little more wisely
so there's one idea another idea to kind
of enjoy the process more might be that
sometimes if you have time take a before
and after picture that can be kind of
fun because if you're feeling like
especially kind of maybe you're just
starting out and you're feeling like you
put the makeup on but you maybe can't
see much of a difference or you want to
get a better sense of what that makeup
is really doing for you
you know just without your digital
camera and take a shot you know before
you get started and then take another
shot afterward and that can give you
some quick ideas for how you might
change things or do it differently that
next time or things like that so another
tip is to take you know a day off when
you have time when you really don't care
maybe how it all turns out and
experiment with with a totally opposite
look from what you wear on a day-to-day
basis and that might help you realize
you know maybe you like yourself with a
stronger eye or maybe you like the look
that you have with a whole lot less
makeup than you normally wear so but
sometimes you need to kind of force
yourself to go out of the box go
different from what you usually do to
figure out if something different may
really work even better for you you know
maybe
you're just around the house you know
ask your your boyfriend or your friend
or your roommate you know what do you
think about this do you like this better
than what I usually do and just get some
opinions and that might help you kind of
enjoy the process a little bit more if
you find something that's a little more
suited to you so that can be a fun
option though another thing just look
through magazines and look for pictures
you know cut out tear out pictures that
appeal to you that you instantly look at
but you just you know tear out and think
oh you know you're really drawn to that
pay attention to the pictures in the
magazines that you see and you are just
drawn to immediately there's a reason
why you like that and look at it and
think okay what is it about this is the
hair that I really like it's at the make
up and if you've done the beauty board
idea which that was a few videos back
but I showed you guys kind of what I do
there how I keep different images that
either inspire me or give me something
to shoot for as far as my makeup goes I
find I enjoy my makeup a lot more when I
have sort of that goal in mind or a
vision to work with so just just think
about that again these have all been
things that do not have to cost you
anything to do so you know something to
help you enjoy the process a little more
um now one thing that can cut I find is
I don't know if it's just more
therapeutic for me just because I like
shopping number one and number two I
like makeup but go to your drugstore or
your dollar store or your local Big Lots
anywhere where makeup doesn't cost a
whole lot of money and just pick up some
new and different things a new lipstick
shade a new kind of mascara maybe a new
eyeshadow quad or something like that
and just give yourself a little bit of
something new especially if you're not
the type of person that buys makeup on a
regular basis and you are feeling kind
of like you're in a rut a little bit
just picking up a few new things can
really help you out there so anyway I
hope this question of the week on what
part of the process of doing makeup you
enjoy the most
Houston insight into what other people
like and also if you really just aren't
enjoying it that much maybe a few of
these
we'll help you out so thank you guys so
much for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
