question of the week video in case you
can't tell i just got off work i've got
the whole suit and professional attire
on right now so i had a few updates
first before I got started um just a few
little things to let you know about some
of you may know about them already but
on my blog which I'll have a link in the
sidebar I now have a 24-7 beauty chat
going on there so at any point in time
you can log on talk to other Beauty
broadcast fans I am periodically on
there and can answer questions and stuff
like that but there is like when you
visit my blog you'll see a little icon
that's on the right hand side and it'll
say like beauty broadcast 24-7 and you
can click there and like I said just
talk about whatever you want to talk
about and it's really fun and I just
love how it's kind of a continuous thing
that anybody can take part in so that's
really cool also my contest the prom
makeup contest where you can win crest
white strips that is going to be
wrapping up on April eighteenth so I
just wanted to remind you guys if you
haven't gotten your entries in either by
email or as a video response make sure
you do that if you want to participate
I've gotten a lot of responses so far so
I'm really excited as I look through
them all and I'm seeing some really good
stuff so thank you guys and also I post
this on the sidebar just about every
video along with a link to my blog but
it's a link to my Twitter where you can
follow me there it's really it's a
Twitter page that I I mean I use a lot
at work too so you may see things there
about you know what I'm doing there what
stories i'm working on or things like
that because i do have people that
follow me that watch on our TV stations
so just a heads up that i do have that
if you aren't on there i mean it's
really fun it can be kind of addictive
so you've been warned but anyway back to
this question of the week and this
question has what's your favorite kind
of eyeliner and i just love coming up
with these random questions but I'm
always really interested to know what
you guys think
had 884 votes on this one and the number
one answer was pencil and that's what I
would have to say and some people said
you know it's any little messages saying
well you know I use pencil and liquid
and so I do too so this is kind of a
challenge you know if you could only
break it down to one favorite what would
you pick and i would pick pencil as well
really because ice would struggle with
putting liquid on my lower lash line
normally i do liquid on top pencil on
the bottom so um for this video i just
thought i'd give you my picks out of
each of those categories and kind of go
in order of the ones i like and don't
like the best or actually i'll go in
order of the way your votes were so you
can understand kind of what people
thought but yes i would say pencil
number one as well um my number one
eyeliner pencil is revlon colorstay
throw me any color this i'm going to
like it and I this one's black this is
what i use today for example i like
black brown i like blackberry but it's
just they're really easy to use they
have a little sharpener and they really
stay put and yeah if i was limited to
just one I mean I could handle using
this on upper and lower lashline
currently I just used it on the lower
but yeah awesome awesome product there
and then um then second highest was
cream and gel so that I mean I was kind
of expecting liquid to get a little bit
higher because it was forty-four percent
on pencil than twenty-five percent on
cream and gel and then the next one down
from that was traditional liquid with
only fifteen percent I was a little
surprised by that answer but because i
would put liquid at number two for me
but cream and gel on my favorites of
that i really like the l'oreal hip color
truth cream liner and this one in black
I mean this is one you can put up you
know upper lower you could use it all in
one and it doesn't smudge like it's a
really really long wearing thing and the
color goes on extremely black and I know
they do have other colors that might be
fun to use as well but i just used like
a a really fine tipped sort of paint
brush it's like in with the paintbrushes
section at walmart you can find just
little brushes that have
fine tips that are good use and i also
have a smashbox one that has that little
benton that little bent angle to it so
it's really easy to apply so that works
well for cream liners and i had to pick
a secondary one on this because i really
like my waterproof shadow liner from
Smashbox this shade i have is in
Hollywood which may or may not be
limited edition since it came with a
holiday set but it has just as gorgeous
bronzy brown golden a tone to it and
it's it's just really nice as a subtle
lower lash line type thing so those are
my cream liners I like number three for
you guys was traditional liquid and you
know you know I can't live without this
stuff my Revlon Colorstay liquid liner
black is black um they also have a wack
shimmer that's not too bad either but
just use this have this on right now so
i love this liner and just have gotten
along with it really well its last a
really long time i think i just
mentioned that in my video with my
sister that we did not too long ago so
next for you guys these last two were
kind of like really close together a
liquid pin form i don't really like this
form of liner so for me to pick a
favorite it's not really saying much
because i'm not in love with this but
you may recall that i reviewed revlon
colorstay sliquid I pin I guess now is
my chance to do a little follow-up on
that even though I don't love this I've
been trying to use it quite a bit
because I wanted to see what it would
dry out with regular use and it's not
dry yet I can't remember exactly how
long ago I did that video but it was
several weeks at least and it's got a
really tight cap and I'm wondering if
that may have something to do with it
like the cap is still tight so that's a
good sign but it's this kind of a tip
and the reason why I'm not in love with
it is because I put it on and I feel
like I have to go over it a little bit
more it doesn't draw over super shimmery
shadows all that well and it's just not
the same not the same dark black that
you get with the regular liquid but it
is easy to control and if you want to
practice with liquid liner and get the
effect of liquid liner
and you want more control and not have
to dip back into something go back to it
here you can just you know mess around
with it not ever have to you know take
the pin from your eyes so this is
probably the best one that I've tried so
far because so many of them conk out on
you you know with very little use so
this one has had the best longevity so
far because I know the products in there
with those other things it's just a
matter of and yes I've shaken them yes
I've tip to turn them and store them
upside down I tell you you know that's
just not the greatest concept in the
world but that is my favorite of that
category and the last thing was only six
percent was people who use shadow its
liner this is not a bad strategy guys um
and you got to find the right thing you
got to get a really dense rich and
usually matte shadow that will work to
give you the definition you may want and
something worth looking into is the
femme Couture cake eyeliner they come in
these duo's and this is black and
charcoal here and it's very black and
very very pigmented and these are cake
line eyeliners so you can use this and
put it on as is just take a liner brush
like I would use an angled liner brush
and use this as powder or you could wet
it and use it like sort of a you know
with a little more get the color a
little more intensity make it a little
more rich by wetting your brush with a
mixing medium or even just water so
these are neat they come in different
duos I think I have one that's like a
navy blue and maybe a dark brown or
something don't quote me on that though
I do like this charcoal and black one a
lot and then that would be my pick for
it like I using a shadow or a powder as
a liner so anyway um that's my little
update and question of the week video

love getting these numbers in the eighth
hundreds on people answering the
question of the week let's try to get
past nine hundred next time okay little
