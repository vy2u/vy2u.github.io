of the week video it's been a while
since I've done one of these since the
storm rolled through and that got me off
track and then I mean to post the
results video usually on a monday since
the voting period lasts a week and ends
on a sunday night but i went ahead and
posted a different video yesterday so
i'm going to do it today and the
question of for this week was what's
your favorite method of tanning and the
majority of you said that you try not to
tan if possible so i was a little
surprised by that answer the second most
popular answer was sunshine just regular
old son third most popular with
self-tanning products than tanning beds
then mystic spray tan booths and then
professional airbrush tans the category
i would fall in right now is definitely
the self-tanning products um I at one
point did do tanning beds for a little
while like it was high school at around
prom time and you know you want to look
tan and all that but um I'm kind of over
that whole thing right now because I
really don't want to get the premature
aging going so I figure if I can look
tan and not spend a lot of money and and
you know do it in a safe way that's what
I'm going to go for also then I I do
like the mystic spray tan booths because
that's once again not harmful to your
skin but it is a little more expensive
I've paid in the ballpark like I don't
know probably thirty dollars and that's
just a booth you go into and it just
sprays you down front and back it takes
no time at all um and I got a really
good result for my wedding I thought and
for I think a formal a sorority formal I
went to but in terms of something that
you know I can afford to do on a regular
basis the sunless tanning products are
definitely a top pick for me and get
lots of questions what's good out there
what's not going to make me look streaky
in orange so I thought I would address
that now my top favorite in terms of the
gradual tanners these are those tanning
products that claim you can just put
them on like a lotion you don't have to
watch too much what you're doing and you
know you're not going to get streaky
it's just like you put it on day to day
and it builds up the color gradually and
there are a lot of those out there right
now but my favorite currently is the
of energy globe and I use it it for
medium to dark skin this is the type of
thing I would put on like after a shower
or something and just put it on all over
and you just kind of build up that
gradual tan and it's really natural and
I believe they have this for like light
to medium too so if you're fair this
might be a good thing to try in terms of
the medium to dark I the reason why I
like this over other ones is because i
feel like it actually does give me a
little more color than some other ones
have at times it's like okay I feel like
I'm doing all this work putting it on
and nothing's really happening so this
does give you a decent amount of bang
for your buck but again it's still a
gradual tanner you're not going to see
like dramatic results overnight but
after a week's time it's pretty nice so
um yeah def vendors are those smells
good too um in terms of a gradual tanner
for the face I really like this product
i got from sally beauty supply it's also
available on Sally Beauty calm it's the
daily radiance facial glow and it's spy
company called skinned wrench and it
comes in a little bottle like this and
it's just a gradual tanner for the face
so it's a nice little on somewhat light
feeling moisturizer I will put it on
most nights before I go to bed and I'll
just wake up and feel like I have a
little better you know a little more
color to my skin and it hasn't irritated
my skin it feels incredibly soft after I
put this on and it kind of sinks in and
and you know doesn't have that sort of
once the moisture has sunk into my skin
it my skin feels very smooth so this is
a really neat product not very expensive
available at Sally's so we might want to
check that out now if you want more of
that instant tan look like say you
haven't been doing the gradual Danning
and it's like the day of a big event and
you want to look more tan on what I've
been using lately and I guess liking the
best out of anything I've tried is the
sublime bronze tinted self-tanning
lotion from L'Oreal and I use this in
deep natural tan because
my skin is not super fair anyway and if
i do if i am in that situation where i
want the instant tan this will
definitely give it to me it does have
some subtle shimmer to it so you're
going to get almost a little hint of a
golden eagle oh when you put this on as
well you're not only getting tan but
you're getting that little hint of
shimmer you do have to be careful when
you apply this though unlike the gradual
tanners you have to watch for streaking
getting streaks with your fingers you
really want to use the method of
applying where your fingers are together
and not like this because when they're
apart that's when you get those it's
like your painting streaks on yourself
so you really do want to be careful but
it is totally possible to get a good
application with this it just takes some
practice and you've got to just yeah
kind of get practice basically with
working with products like that but this
really is good it's quick-drying that's
something i really don't want to forget
to tell you guys it dries very fast
there was an older formulation of this
that i liked as well but it did not try
nearly as fast so what they're selling
now in stores should say quick dry
vitamin e down there really does fri so
that's great and especially because it
is bronze like it is when you put it on
it's a dark bronze shade so it's not
like you know some things are like a
colorless foam or whatever you when you
put it on this you can see where you put
it so that that is helpful another thing
that I like for face in terms of
something that's going to give you more
of an instant result is the sublime
bronze dual action instant bronzer and
self-tanning lotion for face I have this
in medium I really really love this but
I have not seen it in stores yet this
season if anybody has seen this let me
know because I would love to repurchase
but like I said I haven't seen it lately
it's basically two chambers here one is
a bronzer and one is a sunless tanner
and I just put it on and I'll put it on
before I put any makeup on let it sink
in or whatever and it really does give
you a nice bronze look there so if you
can find the l'oreal sublime bronze dual
action that is some good stuff and
lastly for those who
tan skin but do not want to mess with
any kind of sunless tanning product do
walk the brand that's available on
sephora.com has an incredible product
called revolution SPF 15 bronzing body
moisturizer it got an allure editor's
choice award and it is amazing basically
it's a product that it looks it looks
kind of like this shade it's sort of
deepens up or it seems to be a little
deeper once you get it all over your
skin but you just apply this all over
and you've just and it's just like
putting on a tan it's not permanent
it'll stay on till you wash it off but
it is like a wonderful bronze look all
over your body it applies surprisingly
easily I'll put this all over my arms
and legs and feel you know just fine for
the day and I don't use it every day
I'll use it for maybe a special occasion
or maybe if I haven't been doing a lot
of the sunless tanning and you just want
something really quick that's going to
show up instantly this is great stuff so
definitely something to check out there
I've heard good things about the st.
Tropez it's like a spray I think it's a
no it's a foam I think it's a sunless
tanning foam that some people have used
I really really want to try that so if
you guys have tried it and it works well
for you let me know very interested in
seeing how that works because I've seen
some people that have used it they have
a great great natural looking tan but
anyway those are some of my favorite
products guys I hope you enjoyed this
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
