time so thank you very much for joining
me and thanks so much for taking part in
these every week I think they're really
fun to do and I keep them posted on my
blog the reason why I had moved in from
my youtube to my vlog was because the
blog totals them for me soak in a poll
format so i really like that it makes it
a lot easier on me otherwise I probably
wouldn't have had time to continue doing
this because I was getting so many great
responses so anyway this week's question
was what do you generally do with your
hair on a regular basis and just to go
through the results of this I was really
surprised the top two were a tie and
exact time out of around 230 votes the
top two had the exact same amount of
votes for straighten it and let it go
naturally those each had thirty-nine
percent of the vote next put it up had
eighteen percent and curl it only had
two percent five people voted that way I
was one of them but I do curl my hair a
lot for work otherwise it is very very
straight on but anyway for this video I
like to do a video after the question
just kind of based on what the question
was about so i thought i would recommend
some tools or products that i use for
each of these things because they are
all something i do at one point in time
or another so for straightening up here
i really don't need to do too much like
i said i have really really straight
hair so um to do that is just not a
really big deal you know having
naturally straight here it's kind of
like a person with big curly hair what
do you do to curl it well not too much
but um I do have a straightener that I
like lately that actually serves
multiple functions for me this is from
conair this was really cheap i'm going
to say less than maybe even fifteen
dollars i got it at walmart and it's one
of these skinny straighteners so it's
not like the real i have had in the past
one of those straighteners that's about
like that wide excuse me of the hiccups
but I used that in the past and I don't
really know why because I really did not
need that much heat on my hair because
it was pretty much straight anyway like
I just did it just for like super duper
straight but on this will straighten it
for me but if I am going to wear my hair
straight I mean I will to get it that
way I'll blow dry it and then I'll use
this and like I said this is from Conair
it has multiple a little dial here that
shows up to 25 heat settings it has a
little turbo feature there and so I
would basically just go through my hair
and just kind of use this to make you
gently give it a turn under effect at
the bottom because this is just so easy
to control so I might turn under flip it
out or something but overall leave the
rest straight and sleek and this does a
good job of that for me I know there are
many many more and you know wonderful
high-end very expensive straighteners
but for me being that I don't straighten
my hair all that often something like
this that I can also curl it with to
which I might have to do a video on that
I don't know I mean if you guys want it
I guess request it through comments or
something but if you want a video on how
to curl your hair with a straightener I
can show you otherwise i'm not sure if
that's something a lot of you just know
how to do or have watched other videos
on it so you just have to let me know
what you want in terms of that but
another thing if I do just want to wear
my hair straight I can skip this all
together and just blow dry this is my
blow dryer it's the Revlon 1875 ionic it
is bright pink and i love that i
actually um this is a kind of a funny
story i had another blow dryer and one
day all of a sudden I was getting ready
for work not when I was on this morning
shift but some other time and it just
completely stopped on me like you don't
get any warning with blow dryers when
they stop they just totally stop and so
I was like oh my gosh you know soaking
wet hair and he'd get ready for work
what am I gonna do and Tyler being the
sweet heart that he is he went to
walgreens for me and I was like I don't
even care you know I just need a blow
dryer and this was the one who picked
out for me no guidance so that tells you
anything about how well he knows me I
love this pink blow dryer and it's
served me just fine you know its type of
thing yeah you could run to walgreens
probably find it or walmart i pretty
sure it was I don't one of those two
stores was probably where I went to get
this so guess I'll have to ask him for
sure but I really like this blow dryer
it does have the high medium and low
settings and also the button to make it
cool if you want that so like I said
straighten my hair I can do it just with
this or I can use my little conair
straightener or curler with that um the
next thing was just to let it go
naturally and I must say when I do that
often times you know it's just a matter
of blow drying it and my natural look is
a fairly straight look but um something
I do always like to do even if I do
nothing else to my hair is I'll put it
on kind of this smoothing cream that
kind of helps it give my hair a little
extra shine and it also reduces any
static that I have because I do have
really fine hair and sometimes it can
get really fly away when all I do is
like blow dry it and this is from John
Frieda the brilliant brunette satin
shine cream and so obviously blondes out
there watching I think there probably is
something similar for blondes in the
john frieda line but this is this type
of thing is something I really like to
use to give my hair that extra shine and
that's a product I might use with my
straightener who I forgot i also use a
heat protectant spray I like I think
it's called turn up the heat or
something I don't know why I didn't
bring that out here to show you but it's
from sally beauty supply from beyond the
zone and that's a really good one but
and one that i'm going to get is that
one from redken that my sister-in-law
Sarah came in and did a guest review on
the hot sets 22 I think it's called
because she says she can do really great
things in terms of curling or leaving
her hair straight with that and protect
the hair and lock in the style so a
little tip for you there and then as the
next pop most popular thing was to put
your hair up and I am a big fan of
putting my hair up um I like to do that
occasionally for work or just when
you're kind of on the go and a few
things that I would use for
that a lot our bobby pins because
sometimes I'd like to pull part of it
back and if i'm using the bumpit you can
do really cool styles putting your hair
up or back is that with the bump it like
putting it in here pooping that up
putting a couple bobby pins right in the
back and then pulling it around for a
ponytail or pulling it up like for a mid
ponytail or something like that so did a
video on that if you're interested but
um so i would use bobby pins to kind of
keep that you know section of hair up
when I poof it on or also just to keep
like little ends tucked away obviously
ponytail holders or I like cliffs like
these um like this one from Goody's just
kind of a mid-sized clip I can do a
really quick and easy bun with that just
by kind of you know taking my hair
twisting it around and then just putting
that clamp in it works really well
whether you're doing it low or high and
then for curling your hair for the five
of you including myself who do that on a
regular basis I have a lot of different
ways that I do this I have those
remington heated clip rollers which i
use and i alternate this stuff all the
time like I honestly couldn't tell you
one single way I curl my hair because I
do it several ways but Reddington hated
clip rollers love those did a whole blog
and review with lots of pictures on that
so kind of go back through my blog a
little bit and look for that if you want
to see pics and whatnot another thing
I'll use is my velcro rollers I keep
them here in this little basket I keep
the rollers and then a little container
with the clips clips that I use to like
hold them in my hair but these velcro
rollers like these that come from
Sally's are just really good if you have
a little bit of time to set your hair at
them it does take a little longer for
anything to take with these than does
the heated clips because obviously those
are hot rollers you're putting a hot
clip on the hot roller and that's that
takes five minutes you know and you can
get a curly style out of that so these
what you would do is use your curling
iron I used
one by revlon it's not very big it's not
like a super jumbo one it's just like
this sighs I don't know hopefully you
can get a feel for about how big that is
but it's like I can just I can fit my
hand all the way around I'm sorry I
don't have it doesn't have like a size
written on it so I'm not quite sure
exactly what they call that but I would
use that and then at once that curl is
hot then you would put your velcro
roller on and if you needed to put a
clip over it to make it stay so and
obviously what all any curly style if
you're trying to keep like anything
around your face looking somewhat normal
and for me I mean when I'm doing the
news I really want to lock in the style
that I have I want it to keep looking
the same way throughout the whole
newscast don't want it to move around a
lot so yeah hairspray is my friend a
couple of them that I've really been
liking lightly are both available at
sally beauty supply Sally's has great
hair products great great things and I
like their volumizing hairspray from so
gorgeous and that is actually a great
holding hairspray to so not only can it
do volume but it can do hold and it's
just nice if you are teasing your hair
and you want to spray a little of this
beforehand or you want to put it on your
velcro rollers as they set and then you
take them out and you've got a little
more volume when you brush through it
all that's a good thing and then just
for a finishing spray that's going to
give you a little extra hold as well I
love this kind from beyond the zone it's
called final take and it's a shine hair
spray so this is not so much majorly on
the whole but this aerosol can like I
think I've used shine sprays that are in
non aerosol cans and I feel like my hair
ends up looking too shiny or borderline
greasy because I think the way that the
product comes out it doesn't come out
diffused enough you know when you use
aerosol spray you can hold it way out
here and it's very diffused so you're
not getting too much product on your
hair that's a really good thing about
this when you're wanting shine and just
a light holds so that's a nice way to
top off any style straight curly wavy
natural
whatever so anyway guys I hope this was
sort of interesting for you in terms of
just some suggested products for hair
and and the different styles you can do
