question of the week video this past
week's question was asking what is your
favorite sort of makeup look for
Valentine's Day and overwhelmingly the
response was for a look that is kind of
that soft romantic sort of you know
really girly look some of the other
options that didn't score so how were
like add you know bold smokey eye and
light lips or a colorful I and then I
think the other option there was what
was the other choice that I had I liked
like a really bright like red or pink
lip so um I was kind of surprised that
it was so heavily toward just that soft
look and I actually have a look on there
and I promise I will you know get into
doing some more actual tutorials I don't
actually have the chance to do one today
so I wanted to refer you back to a look
that I actually kind of label those I
think kind of a a soft and romantic
Valentine's Day look on my blog i'll
post a link so you can visit that and
see exactly what I'm talking about
because I went step by step with all the
face products that I used for that face
and eyes and I was really really happy
with that look so you can see that and
get some really clear pictures of what
it looks like meanwhile i just wanted to
suggest some different products to you
guys that would help you achieve that
look um you know just other products not
just what i used in that tutorial so you
can get an idea of the different ways
you can achieve that sort of you know
light and soft look and and just just
kind of a brainstorming session i guess
and the first thing i wanted to suggest
you guys is these um i don't know if you
can tell but i am wearing some false
eyelashes today but they're not that's
like they're not the full strip of
lashes they're just the lashes that are
on the outer half here i don't know if
you can see it if I you know like
there's regular my real lashes but
they're right here they're like little
outer halves and you get that sore
of you know sweep up look and I love
that so much and the good news is these
are by far easier than any other false
lashes to apply what I'm wearing they're
called salon perfect lashes they come in
a container like this sorry i got my
glue up there and they're 30 ones so i
thought found these at walmart for right
around two dollars and they're so easy
to apply because think about it rather
than fitting a strip that you kinda have
to worry about the inner part of your
eye and the outer part um you're dealing
with something that is literally like
how long all right like like that long
okay so you just put a little glue on
there so easy to place on and I think
they're just if you're just starting out
these are easier to work with I think
than the individual lashes and they are
easier than the whole strip so and it
does give you sort of that nice I think
kind of a feminine look I think you know
you could wear them with them with even
a lighter I then I have right now and it
could be just a really really soft nice
look so I wanted to recommend those um
some other things I have I cheek and lip
products here so I better kind of start
getting through this sorted quickly I
will just mention the eyeshadow that I
was using in that blog fotd face of the
day it's this L'Oreal hip metallic
shadow duo and in sculpted and if you
can see that what you're getting here is
a pretty shimmery deep plum along with a
light pearly lavender and that created a
look that I was really happy with on my
eyes for that blog that i did so just
wanted to make sure i mentioned that
seeing you about that um another great
one is the this NYX single and the color
is burgundy pearl and this is kind of
like a pee on let's say sort of a tone
down magenta I would say almost it's got
a little more violet in it and what I
love using this for is you put you know
a shade in your crease that might be a
little deeper say like right here
and then you lightly with the crew with
a crease brush just kind of brush over
that with this warm shade and give you
the lightest dusting of a pretty sort of
pinky purple over it it's really nice so
I like that one another great duo that
I've gotten some good use out of is from
that Smashbox rapture set that I got it
was like a bunch of duo's I got it for
Christmas if the duo in splendid and
what you get there is just like a light
champagne sort of color and then a
medium brownish taupe it's just like a
great great neutral set to use I've
gotten a lot of use out of it it's so so
easy to use and I love how the Smashbox
smash box shadows are just you know you
get you get such great color off of them
so um if you have access to that kit I'm
not sure if it's still being sold
anymore but I mean this these are not
necessarily rare shades so just keep in
mind that you can get that soft look you
don't have to go with purples and pinks
you can do something neutral like that
uh what else um I have a couple more
shadow suggestions here for you guys um
a great kit that is especially I can
also I could speak to the fact that this
is very long wearing is the Revlon 12
hour eyeshadow in Barry bloom I love
this set it you get a nice from the
bottom up you get a pretty deep purple
you get a pink shade a sort of a sort of
grayish color their second from the top
and then the top shade is actually a
light lavender I don't I think it's
looking a little white but it's actually
a very light sort of shimmery lavender
and that makes it very that romantic
kind of soft look that we're talking
about um and another option very
inexpensive option at sally beauty
supply is those Sally girls singles I
put together a little trio here that I'm
liking a lot it's I've got champagne let
me pop them open for you this is
champagne this light kind of parole
color I'm really having trouble keeping
track of my
because it doesn't say on my little flip
around screen on this camera so I'm just
kind of looking up at my clock
periodically this next one is in
cinnamon and that is a pretty um sort of
pearly light almost got a little bit of
coral tone to it and the last one is
cranberry and this could be an excellent
contour shade there and those are very
pigmented you get a lot of color payoff
and that would just make it I think a
lot of the colors I'm talking about here
would make great everyday looks as well
I'm just thinking in terms of
Valentine's Day just the I think I think
of with this soft feminine romantic look
I think shades that have a little extra
warmth to them with those pinks and
purples and whatnot so next let's move
on and talk about and some cheek colors
I think you can't do valentines day
without doing a pretty cheek shade and
one that I really like that I think
gives you a radiant look like none other
is the Revlon cream blush in first blush
yes this does look pretty red here but
if you get it on your finger and then
you kind of blend it in it's just a
really natural flushed look you know
that it's that shade of you know you
just just went outside and the cold
weather came back in and your cheeks are
a little red it's just so fresh I love
that could be nice to wear underneath
something maybe with a little shimmer on
top since that's not really a shimmery
shade if you do like a light bit of
shimmer this is also a Sally girl
product available at sally beauty supply
it's the shimmer strips in LOL and these
have a nice rosy hue to them you could
also use the neech individually just by
reading your brush your applicator
across them as eyeshadow but a nice
shimmer there another gorgeous gorgeous
blush shade is from ELF and the color is
flushed and this is another thing you
use you'd want to use this sparingly
okay you wouldn't um excuse me you
wouldn't necessarily you know just put a
lot of this on but you'd use a little
bit a little goes a long long way with
this product
and I just think that that's a beautiful
berry blush shade another option I'm
just giving all kinds of options today
is Jane in blushing plum a little
breakage on this one but i still love
this shade in comparison to the elf it's
a little less deep a little more pinky
and less plum but gorgeous nonetheless
even though it is called blushing plum I
don't know it seemed it just seems like
a fresh pink shade to me not necessarily
plum new to come ok I'm going to try to
get through these lip products kind of
quick um what I have on right now is
something that I recently got in a
cherry culture hall and it is a light
pink actually not sure how it's coming
off but it's a pink shimmer that I love
it's from nicks or NYX and it is the
diamond Sparkle lip gloss and the color
on this is rose Sparkle and it is so
great it's it's like a just this pretty
light shade Hills good on your lips it's
look the packaging looks just like
Revlon super lustrous lip gloss but it's
maybe just a little less sticky and I
love it so this probably won't be the
last shade that I tried from that a
couple other NYX products for a pretty
light pink not over the top lip and it's
not i would say more of a rose it's got
a little little just a hair deeper than
than light pink it's the round lipstick
in doll and this may be coming off a
little bit reddish but if I swatch it
for you and sort of blend it out like I
think if you're doing this lip you want
to have that soft look so when applying
any lipstick and you want it to look
really soft and just almost like a
stained look use it you know maybe put
it on your finger and rub it on your
lips you know without just applying the
product directly from the tube but
that's the sort of look you're going to
get on your lips with doll and it's just
a pretty kind of a deep pink shade I
love that perfect for a soft look
and if you're into glossy again um elf
shoe super glossy lip shine and
watermelon just perfect pink shade and
for those of you that really kind of
like to stay away from pinks and you go
more towards nude this may be my new
favorite NYX round lipstick it's the
shade is Seto CET oh and it is like just
perfect to me just a hair a little bit
coppery mostly that golden a sheen to it
great nude color because it's new but
it's not it doesn't make your lips look
like they've been erased from your face
but it just gives just the right amount
of warmth and then of course my revlon
colorstay mineral lip glaze over the top
can be a great addition just to give you
that nice um nude shade that will really
last so I hope this gives you guys some
ideas for if you're going after that
soft feminine look for Valentine's Day
that romantic look that you guys said in
the question of the week that you really
like this will give you some ideas of
how to achieve that with some different
products so thank you guys so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
