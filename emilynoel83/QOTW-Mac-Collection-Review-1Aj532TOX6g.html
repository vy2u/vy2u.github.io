of the week this week's question was
talking about mac makeup because I was
just really curious to know you know
what portion of my audience uses mac
makeup though I realize not everybody
goes to my blog and answers the question
but a lot of you do and I really
appreciate that i actually had five
hundred and five votes on this one so
that was awesome and i'll go through um
kind of how what the breakdown was it
was hell the question was how much mac
makeup do you own and the largest
portion forty-one percent said none okay
so that was the biggest amount of
answers and then thirty-eight percent
said between one and ten items that
would be the category i fall into and
then it just kind of went down from
there actually nine percent said between
between ten and twenty three percent
said between 20 and 30 items only one
person said between 30 and 40 and then
five percent said more than 40 so we've
kind of it's kind of going like this
really high down and then a little bit
of it up at the end so I've got some
like people that really just have none
of it and or people that have very
little of it that's kind of pie and then
down from there so um I just thought
that would be interesting just for my
own knowledge you know to see how much
you guys care about that and just
because you don't have it doesn't mean
you don't care about it so I just
thought I would take this opportunity to
show you my extremely small Matt
collection which was pretty much covered
in one of my recent hulls but I would
use that I want to use this as a chance
to kind of review those things as well
and just tell you what I think about it
and how I like them and it won't take
very long because it's not a very big
collection for me and for me the fact
that it's not big is not because I don't
like the stuff or think i will like
certain things it's simply um I got
combination of things number one I don't
have access to a store where I can see
this stuff in person yes I can always
order online but I just don't
no haven't had that access in the in the
place that I live so that's number one
number two is that I do often times I
mean that more expensive makeup
purchases are the more infrequent makeup
purchases for me they're usually gifts
or you know just something i buy on
occasion uh I don't go buy them a lot so
anyway it up babbling about that i'll go
ahead and tell you about the makeup that
i do have in what I think about it so
the first thing is this mac studio fix
and it is the pressed powder and so this
opens up like so and you've got the
powder here um my shade there is NC 40
and you get the little you know spongy
pup thing there so I've used this um I
got this initially as a nice powder that
I thought I could use for work to
control shine and things like that um I
had used it quite a few times and
honestly I felt like it was a little
heavy especially considering the fact
that i wear a liquid foundation pretty
much daily for work so using that on top
of it was probably part of the reason
that it felt pretty heavy on my skin but
I brought it alone as well yeah that
wasn't totally thrilled with the way it
came off over time I thought initially I
like the way it looks and then I thought
I mean I was either getting a little oil
in some places or just things that I
weren't normal that wasn't normally
noticing about my skin we're coming out
and it didn't break me out or cause any
irritation but it just didn't we're
quite as well as some of my cheaper
products and I don't usually use the
puff or the little sponge here I usually
will swirl a fluffy brush in this and
use that so I think if you use it
lightly maybe you know you're going to
be okay but some things that are
comparable to this I think well it's a
loose powder but I feel like it gives a
similar finish only it doesn't do
anything weird throughout the
and that's the Mary Kay loose powder I
use it in beige one and it is great i
use that on a daily basis after my
foundation and it sets it and it keeps
it nice all day I feel like I mean
that's what i wore today over my
foundation so um that's something that's
good also i really like l'oreal true
match pressed powder night my color
there is sun beige and I use that
usually that's like my little touch-up
thing i do right before i go on for the
news and that has great coverage without
really making anything look cakey or
weird or you know changing textures on
your face throughout the day so those
are a couple of I guess less expensive
options to this I mean just for the
similar effect one if you're looking for
that pressed powder aspect and one if
you're if you maybe just stick a big
brush in this and enjoy the setting
effect of a powder and then the Mary Kay
might be a good one for you where that
is concerned and I'm not talking the
mineral mary kay stuff I haven't tried
that I'm talking these just the old Mary
Kay loose powder it's good stuff um
anyway moving on from the studio fix
I'll talk about my paint pot that I have
this is one of the star products for me
i have this is in rubenesque that's the
shade and since i've been using this for
a couple of weeks now i have really
fallen in love with this product because
it does extend the wear of my eyeshadows
so much i feel like it's a great base
the it makes the color of my shadow
stand out really well especially when
i'm going for like a warm um you know
kind of gold any look on the lids i
think it's really nice for that though
it can work with really pretty much any
color and just make it look really
pretty so a Paint Pot would be a good
investment I think because I feel like
this is going to last me a really long
time so kind of an added bonus there
with that product so been really really
happy with the paint pot just staying
power is terrific and just the color and
the way it helps the shadows stand out
is nice too um if you're thinking okay
what's comparable to this on a
lower end and I would have to say it's
there's there's something very unique
about this I guess it's kind of like the
texture if you put your finger on this
the texture is pretty firm okay it's
when you get it on your finger it's not
like a a super moist product it's kind
of actually a very very light and sheer
cream you don't just dip your finger
into it get a big glob and put it on
it's very like you sweep your finger
through it and you've got a light sheer
coating and there's very few things that
are similar to that texture I feel like
although the Revlon cream shadows if you
use them in a very thin layer I always
stress this with cream shadows but use
it thin those or the elf ones if you can
keep that thin on your lid this tends to
be thin naturally other things tend to
goop up just a little bit on your finger
so just you know apply that apply it
very sheer very light and it will help
out any powder shadows you put on top of
it so moving on from there I have two
mac eyeshadows one is in Naked Lunch and
it is this really pretty light highlight
shade it's got a it's a frost so it's
got a little bit of shimmer to it and
then i have the shade and sketch which
is a nice as you can see sort of
plumbing brown it's a velvet texture
which i really like that texture and
it's got a slight slight i don't want to
say sparkle but just a very very fine um
shimmer to that so I enjoy both of these
very much I think they work a nice side
by side go on doing The Naked Lunch on
the lid and then sketch in the crease
these really are great people say they
love mac shadows and some people have
very large collections I'm sure the
people who said they had more than 40
items probably had a ton of mac shadows
and they really are as good as people
say they are I definitely stand by that
I mean I love this this is just great
you know one sweep of your finger and
you've got plenty of product on there
you
no that's that's great this shade is
gorgeous so as far as the shades go I
can't say enough about them um however I
compare like this sketch shade this is
nice I really like using it and in the
crease but then I think back to my
Smashbox shadows which I actually have a
decent amount of Smashbox I shadows
which are fairly expensive and I mean
definitely that's a high end makeup
brand and I feel like those sometimes
have better color payoff I don't know I
guess I mean I just noticed that like
I'm getting ready before the show and
I'm putting some of this on and you know
yeah that looks great but then I dip
into the Smashbox if I use that on a
different day and it's like wow okay I
didn't have to hardly do anything with
my brush in that you know it just gave a
great amount of color so i don't know i
think smashbox if you haven't checked
out their shadows I think they're very
good granted i have only tried to so i
think i still think they're great I'm
just saying there's something comparable
out there but it's still high end
version so you know as far as low end
drugstore makeup that's close to Mac I
think Milani um I think I have quite a
few Milani singles that seemed to sort
of rival this kind of texture that is
very soft it doesn't take a lot of doing
to get it on your skin but these are
great so basically i love these I
products that I have and this is kind of
kind of on the fence about but I'll
still use it I'll find a way to use it i
just use it very very lightly but as far
as the studio fix those but that is my
little mac collection i can hold it in
two hands so um unlike it once again
it's not say don't like I should show
you haven't had a lot of access to it I
don't buy a ton of high-end stuff but I
hope maybe this informed you just a
little bit from a drugstore generally a
drugstore makeup person's point of view
just what I think about these things and
how they compare and feel free to share
your feedback and your thoughts and your
experiences with mac makeup i'd love to
hear about it so thanks so much guys for
watching have a
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
