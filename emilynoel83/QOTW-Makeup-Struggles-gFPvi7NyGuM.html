once again and this week's question
asked what beauty skill do you struggle
with the most and I gave about seven
different options in my question posted
on my blog and I allowed you to give
multiple answers for that because I feel
like easily you know one or two of those
things could be a problem for one
particular person so I thought why not
you know just let people choose multiple
answers and the ones that have the most
will still come out on top so in this
video I wanted to go through the top
four vote-getters they all got more than
120 votes apiece and they are concealing
dark circles applying liquid liner
applying false eyelashes and picking the
right foundation shade if you want some
quick tips on those four things keep on
what number one vote getter was
concealing dark circles that is the
number one skill that people who went to
my blog and voted thought the skill they
thought was the most challenging for
them so I want to go through a few quick
tips for you here the number one thing I
would say to do is use a cream product
and then set it with a powder it's very
important if you want that light that
concealer to last and if you also want
to hack give it and added a matte effect
you know what I mean if that is Matt and
less shiny there's less chance of light
bouncing off of you know us your dark
circle and it will be more of one solid
color as opposed to multidimensional you
don't really want the multi-dimensional
color around your eye you want that to
be Matt and basically go unnoticed you
know this is not the area you want
people looking at you want people
focusing on your eyes focusing on your
lips something like that but not not
really paying great attention to your
under-eye area so that's where concealer
comes in and I want to give you guys a
couple of options here first um you guys
have heard me rave probably numerous
times about Bobby Brown's creamy
concealer kit I'd like to say something
here as well real briefly on my channel
I if it's a good product that
I honestly believe is good i will
recommend that product to you and if
it's a bad drugstore product i'll point
that out if it's a bad high-end product
i've tried i'll point that out too but
um I don't stick to any one type of
makeup you guys may notice that I do a
lot with drug store that is for a couple
of reasons my drugstore size of my
drugstore collection definitely
outweighs the sight of my high end
makeup but also that is what many of my
viewers are looking for is affordable
options at the same time I have viewers
that you know our mac users and high end
users that watch these videos too I try
to keep the range as broad as possible
when I make a product recommendation to
you and just know that when I make that
recommendation I realized one product
that work for me might might not be
working wonderfully for you but if I
truly believe that it's good and it's my
hope that that will can also work well
for you I will promote that you know I
will get on here and recommend that to
you so that's its its honest
recommendations that's what I do high
end or low end I will tell you the truth
from my heart so I hope you guys are
cool with that because that's what's
happened all along through my one
hundred-plus videos on youtube and you
know it may be a high-end product i
recommend it may be a low it I'm not a
hundred percent one way or the other and
that I think is the beauty of this
channel so i will get off my soapbox now
and finally give you some concealer
recommendations and by far my favorite
is the bobby brown creamy concealer kit
that's because this follows the
philosophy that i just gave you of using
a cream which i would use a small
concealer brush to apply this i just use
one from essence of beauty at CVS then
but you apply the cream and then it
gives you a light yellow setting powder
to top it off and help it stay and help
sort of bright in the area further so
that's a great thing Bobby Brown also
makes something called corrector this I
have in bisque and it's more of a salmon
e color and that is great for some heavy
duty
ceiling that you might do in here and
around the outer corners so that's an
option that you could use before using
this low end alternative or a less
expensive alternative is the next
concealer in a jar I use this in light
it's the most comparable in texture that
I can find to the Bobby Brown product
and it works really well you got to make
sure you set this with some loose powder
that you own but very high quality I'm
really impressed with that i think i got
it for around five dollars on cherry
culture calm prices may vary there a
little bit but those are my concealer
recommendation another big struggle that
i think people have with makeup that
obviously you have because that's the
way you voted is applying liquid
eyeliner this was the second highest
vote-getter and there are a few tips i'm
going to give you in terms of
application first off when you're just
starting try to steady your elbow if you
can um if this means stepping away from
your desk where you have a mirror you
may have that mirror right in front of
you but it may be I don't know your
table might be down low or you might not
have a good way to sturdy your elbows so
get somewhere where you can take a
mirror that you can pull out and put it
here in front of you and like I'm
putting my elbow right here on my coffee
table and do that because that will help
you much ease more easily than when your
free standing later you'll probably be
able to do that just fine when you're
starting out it's very awkward it's
strange to do liquid line eyeliner so
find a way to steady your elbow my other
tip is when you're just starting try to
find one of those liners it's a pin
format you may have seen in my liquid
liner review way way back um I didn't
talk these up very much because I don't
feel like they last very long but when
they're new when you've got them unlike
the covergirl the little pin I guess
line exact or something like that these
are very very easy to manage they're
practically like a marker and I would
suggest that if you're just starting out
and then maybe as you get more
comfortable branch out to like the
Revlon Colorstay which is like a felt
tip applicator that you pull out of a
little like inkwell looking thing
also cream liners like for example this
one or gel liners like this one from
Jane this is the be pure gel liner those
can be easier to use sometimes as well
just because that product is not like
you're dipping in and dipping out it's
just all kind of you can get it on your
brush and do more multiple strokes you
don't have the pressure of necessarily
doing one stroke you can do multiple and
blend it out a little bit more easily
with a cream or a gel just an idea there
also make sure you're lining from inner
to outer corner that generally is the
easiest way to go with that just get one
fluid line and don't necessarily start
here go to the outer corner and then go
into the inner corner just try from the
start to get your technique right and go
inner to outer the next beauty struggle
that we're having is applying false
eyelashes so I'm going to give you a few
quick tips here try to use the half
strips of lashes if you can't find them
in the stores you can cut a full strip
and cut them in half so they are much
shorter and they cover the outer half of
your eye today I am wearing a half strip
of lashes I don't know if you can see
that if I tip them up a little bit but
these I mean I can apply them so quickly
early in the morning when I'm getting
ready and it's instead of having to
manage and get in there with both hands
maybe and make sure you've got it inner
to outer corner this is just a strip
that's about that wide and you just
place it right there and usually there's
no more messing that you have to do so
that might be a good way to practice
just like I said if you can't find those
half lashes available maybe try just
getting a normal set and snipping them
and then using those on your outer half
it really won't look that weird and if
you can taper the lashes so they're not
going like insta long lashes at the
corner you know just kind of taper them
so they sort of you know have that nice
variance in length that's a good idea
Sally Beauty Supply has a wonderful
selection of lashes so you should be
able to find the half strips there also
let your glue get tacky when you put it
on when you put your glue on the strip
of lashes don't immediately place it on
your eye it is not going to want to
adhere it's got to
get a little tacky before you do that so
give it around 45 seconds to a minute to
get that way and then you'll find that
once you stick it on it'll stay where
you put it and lastly use a light tone
glue to scart it's usually white and
then it dries to be clear if you're just
starting out chances are you might you
know accidentally you're trying to get
it on there on your lash line and you
hit your brow bone or you hit your
eyelid or something like that and if
you're using dark tone glue that's going
to show and sometimes you may not even
know that it's showing immediately but
you go out somewhere you look at Abbey
Road you're like what is that little
dark spot is that my eyelash glue and
that's happened to me so while you're
learning while you're still getting
comfortable with it use one of the light
tone blewett's they like I said it looks
like it's white it dries clear that
would be a good way to start a little
beauty struggle that I want to touch on
here is picking the right foundation
shade this is hard for I think almost
anyone no matter how experienced you are
with makeup there's always a brand that
maybe you're not familiar with or
something like that and it's very hard
to find exactly the right shade the
advice I would give is test it when you
can if you're in a department store and
you're going for a high-end foundation
definitely try that out and test it
however I've heard a lot of people that
have experiences saying i went to the
mat counter i meant to this counter that
one and the girl put something on me and
it was totally wrong but that's what she
sold me and so I mean things can still
go wrong but if you are able to test it
I think you're one step closer to
accuracy than you are from not testing
it at all and just picking up a bottle
however I realized that many of us
including myself stop in the drugstore
so what I honestly do is if I am going
in there to pick up a foundation I'm
going to find any mirrored surface maybe
I'm picking up a compact and you know
that is sold like that where you can
flip it open or something and just hold
the bottle up to my face and I see as
give my best educated guess as to
whether or not that matches that's just
what I do it may not be perfect
sometimes they have little sheets that
you can like get out
test and hold up to your wrist or
whatever but I just kind of tried to
hold it up to my skin and see generally
if that is correct another thing I do is
I evaluate what I have in my collection
already see what shades that you have
that have worked for you would have been
too light what are getting too dark and
get a sense of you know what where you
need to be going with that look you know
try to get a good visual of okay i'm
looking for something about here does
that make any sense so just just be
aware of what you own know what's too
light or too dark generally speaking for
you also get a sense of warm and cool
some people have a really Rosie
undertone to their skin others people
have a more yellowy undertone just kind
of know what's going on with your skin
so you are able to pick up a bottle of
foundation and say that's a little bit
Rosie or that's a little too yellow or
something like that so just kind of be
aware of what your skin's doing give it
a good long look look at examples maybe
from other people other pictures or
people who say hey I have this skin tone
and then you can kind of compounded
informative just a few quick ways to
solve some of those beauty struggles we
all have from time to time and I hope
you will visit my blog and answer next
