time I'm so excited because I kind of
set another little benchmark goal there
for the number of responses to the
question and I said let's hit a thousand
or more and you guys did it was a
thousand 26 for this question so that is
really really exciting I'm loving how
much feedback we're getting and its
really I think the more feedback you get
on something like this the more accurate
like your results become because they're
um you know accounting for so many more
people so this week's question asks what
is a mascaras biggest downfall like what
is the worst problem one of them can
cause and forty-nine percent so really
close to half of everybody that
responded said clumps the next vote was
smudges during where 23% next said not
volumizing enough that was ten percent
six percent said not lengthening enough
five percent said the formula isn't
buildable and three percent said the
wand is hard to use so I wanted to I
give a lot of recommendations I feel
like with my question the week depending
on what your response is were but for
this one I thought maybe I might just
give some tips instead some application
tips that can sort of help you get
around some of these common issues so
for clumps um recently I was with in the
past you know a couple of years brands
have come out with more of these rubber
brush mascaras and although some of them
I haven't been satisfied with the fact
like maybe they didn't give enough
length or thickness what they have done
is really kept from clumping so if that
is your biggest concern and you know
maybe there are certain formulas that
are buildable to where maybe you can get
more likely you can't get more volume
but you won't get the clumps so those um
some of those mascaras that allow you to
be pretty much clump free are the lash
blast I know there's some kind of strong
views on either side some people say oh
my gosh i love lash wise it's the only
thing i'd use and then others are kind
of like well you know it's not that
great for me so I'm kind of one of those
that's on the fence I mean I love the
fact that this just this this handles a
couple of the key
problem areas because it doesn't smudge
and it also doesn't clump so I mean
meanwhile some might say the wand is
hard to use because it is kind of big
and it's kind of bulky to get right in
there but at the same time and what I
mean by these rubber you see how how
it's like little bitty rubber you know
nubs coming off of the one there that's
what i mean by the rubber brush so
there's that another kind that works
pretty well that doesn't like smudge and
it doesn't clump is the L'Oreal
telescopic really small brush with like
little like four little sets of spikes
that come off of it really really easy
to use and aside from this one being so
fat this one's a little skinnier and
then the Rimmel sexy curves I really am
not happy with how I don't feel like
it's volume ii enough voluminous
volumizing enough at all but um it's not
that bad i mean it doesn't it really
doesn't clump on me at all so any way to
combat those clumps you know think about
those another good one that i find
doesn't clump a whole lot is the l'oreal
lash out and that's a traditional brush
but it's and it's been around for a long
time but that's actually a pretty darn
good mascara for length so this is the
curved brush but that's pretty good I
use it a lot to blend in my natural
lashes with like the false ones so um
but another thing with clumps in terms
of just the way you apply sometimes with
some of these traditional brush mascaras
like this one or my L'Oreal hit mascara
sometimes there's just way too much
product on the brush and you know you
can get away with taking a tissue and
just wiping your brush on or blotting
the brush sometimes because sometimes
the little stopper that's in these that
you know cleans off the wand is you take
it out does not clean off enough and
that's just a flaw in the way some of
these are made you know some of them
just they weren't designed right in my
opinion because you could you bring the
brush out and there's way too much there
so keep in mind and that goes for the
smudging that brings me right into the
smudging point because sometimes you're
putting too much product on your eye
shizz and you wonder why you have
smudges and I've said this before with
eyeliner it's because there's too much
there okay so that's the reason why you
smudge out your liner and you that's
another reason why you need to sometimes
wipe off the brush a little bit and by
doing that if you need I'll give you a
little demo here for that got a tissue
here's my brush and I'm just going to
kind of like go like that a little bit
or just blot it okay it's cleaned off a
little more and it's going to be more
buildable that way too because you're
not going to have one super thick coat
you're gonna have thinner coats and you
can build on top of that and the
lengthening will take more and the
volumizing the thickening will work
better for you too so keep that in mind
I'm a really good tip for not if it's
not volumizing enough how think about
how you're applying your mascara okay
are you putting an eye of false
eyelashes on today so that's gonna be my
overall tip not lengthening of not
volumizing enough try false eyelashes
watch the tutorial I made one but I'm
putting it on and wiggling it side to
side like this okay that's gonna get in
there and make by volume we mean the
look of more lashes so if you're going
in there and you're wiggling it back and
forth that formula is getting on more
lashes because you're wiggling it you're
really getting it in there and not just
hitting the surface you know few lashes
that you might hit when you lightly
lightly touch it you really want to get
in there almost like you're it's like
you're scrubbing it onto your eyelashes
so that is going to build thickness and
for volume do that same thing but make
sure you're getting it all the way to
the ends of the eyelashes okay all the
way to the very end like I sometimes
continue the movement even though I'm
out past it just to ensure that I've got
all the way to the end okay sometimes we
just hit it and then we come away from
it that's not the way to go you're not
going to build up anything that way
you're not going to get any length you
want to go all the way and beyond okay
because the way a lot of these mascaras
work are with micro fibers and those are
like itty-bitty fibers that are
attaching to your lashes and making them
longer well there's you're not really
doing yourself any favors by not going
full length of your eyelashes because
then those microfibers aren't building
on top of one another like they would
otherwise so keep that in mind go all
the way to the ends of your lashes
that's a good tip for lengthening trying
to think if I have any other tips those
are my main ones basically look at the
mascara you're using if you're finding a
lot of clumps try one of those rubber
brush mascaras and also in terms of
clumping and smudging wipe off the brush
from time to time especially when that
mascara is new I think it will help a
lot it'll make it more buildable too so
that's a tip to make if the formula
isn't buildable enough try that you can
do multiple coats and it will build much
upon itself much better um for volume
make sure you're wiggling it and for
length make sure you're going all the
way to the edge of your lashes they'll
turn out a lot longer than you think
they could otherwise so anyway guys I
hope this helped in terms of mascara
application um just watch sometime I
know I don't always include the
application step in all of my tutorials
but in a lot of them I do so just kind
of you know watch that and see firsthand
you know how I'm doing that but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
so much for voting on the question of
the week and don't forget to answer next
week's question I'll have a link on the
sidebar thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
