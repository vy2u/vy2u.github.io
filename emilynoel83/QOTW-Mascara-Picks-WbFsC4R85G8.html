means it's question of the week time and
I was really excited about this week's
question because we not only I mean
that's always I feel like I always get
some great participation on the question
it this is the first question of the
week video of money you're watching it's
available on my blog i'll have a link to
it over in the description box and it's
basically something i do there because
it totals up all the numbers for me and
it can just be more accurate and this
week's question was what's the number
one quality you look for in a mascara
and it was actually really close between
the top two or actually three but the
number one the number one choice i guess
was a false lash effect that was thirty
two percent of voters chose that
twenty-nine percent chose thickening
twenty-four percent shows lengthening
and thirteen percent chose the natural
and defined type of mascara so I thought
this would lend itself since I haven't
really done a mascara video in a
actually a pretty long time so I thought
this would be just a fun way to
recommend a few different mascaras
depending on what category you're in you
know what sort of thing you're looking
for there so I'll go ahead and start
with the false lash effect since that's
what the most people desire in their
mascara and by the way everything I'm
going to recommend is going to be drug
stores so that's awesome but for false
lash effect I have to go with the
L'Oreal hip high intensity pigments
mascara and that line um if you're not
familiar with it that's in your local
drugstore that's the line that sells all
the really kind of colorful I shadows
and things like that and the hip brand
does give you one mascara option and I
use it in ultimate black and it's just
this little tube like this it's actually
the exact same tube only a different
color as the L'Oreal lash architect
which I hate but anyways it's definitely
not the same formula is that the brush
is sort of it looks like kind of your
average brush but I believe its kind of
a little bit skinnier in the middle and
a little bit bigger on each of the ends
and it just does everything you could
want your mascara to do I mean it
lengthens it thickens it is the most
comparable to false eyelashes that i
have used and this is the type of
mascara that i go back and buy again and
again because i love it so much so i had
to choose that one as my pick for a
mascara that gives you the false lash
effect and by the way when i say these
are from drugstores that also translates
to these all being probably somewhere in
the ballpark of seven or eight dollars
maybe less depending on what kind of
special deal you get on one of them so
just so you know um next with thickening
and i actually this was kind of a close
one with um you know the idea of the
fall / effects but i've figured that
after using this quite a bit i'm kind of
realizing that it's maybe a little
better at thickening than lengthening so
that my choice for for thickening is the
aimer or almay one coat nourishing
mascara triple effect and actually
claims to thicken lengthen and curls so
but what I think it's four tapes sorry I
have like a little itch under my eye
well it's best at I think is the
thickening aspect and let me show you
the brush here um the brush has a to
kind of trying to get it so you can sort
of see it has two different sets of
bristles really in the same brush when
in the bristles are longer and then on
the bottom here you can see that they're
very much shorter and that shorter side
we're supposed to use this is actually
used the longer bristles first to
lengthen your lashes and then go over it
with the thickening side the short
bristles to digging them up and I just
find that it really is good at
thickening of the formula on this if you
don't like mascaras that have that sort
of watery feel to them almost like it's
just a little bit too liquidy or
whatever you might like this because the
formula I'm finding it's a little bit
drier a little more creamy maybe
and that might be why it just I feel
like that contributes to the fact that
it thickens so well it doesn't clump the
lashes together I mean it's just a
really good brush to use I liked that it
had kind of two purposes in one if
you're the type of person that does like
to you know do do you know use one
mascara for one purpose on your
eyelashes and then maybe use another one
for lengthening afterwards this is nice
because it can do it all in one tube so
that is the L may one coat nourishing
mascara triple effects and it does have
some good for you good for your lashes
ingredients there that can help kind of
condition your eyelashes and make them a
little bit healthier so that's an added
bonus there with that one the next
quality that you guys desire in a
mascara is lengthening and I'm going to
actually recommend one that I've tried
it's actually fairly recently that I
tried it but I do believe that it is one
of the best lengthening mascara and it's
been on the market for quite some time
and it is lore'l lash out mascara it
depending on whether you get curved
brush or waterproof or whatever the tube
may look a little different mine is has
this little like red band on it it's
kind of long it's really long actually
in gold and I like the curved brush in
this just because I don't know I feel
like it just I'm not sure why I like
here here honestly it just really seems
to get to every lash when I use it but
um oh it's like a unibrow but um
basically this is like a kind of your
traditional mascara brush nothing I've
showed you so far is a rubber brush
mascara and this one is not either it's
got kind of the brush sort of reminds me
of voluminous only it's a little more
like the the bristles are spiraled
around the brush rather than sort of
just poking out I don't know if that
makes any sense but I just I do like
this I like how dark and black it is and
I'll I
that it just really does lengthen well
it can handle more than one coat and not
get weird on you so I L'Oreal lasha I
think would be a good pick if you are
looking for strictly lengthening
volumizing I'm not going to say this is
like a multitasker here because I don't
think that this provides amazing volume
but it does do amazing length so that's
why I'm saying that then the last thing
the last kind is for natural and defined
lashes and for this one I honestly think
this is one that could kind of go both
ways i think it is pre volumizing but
yet it is also defining and you may
wonder you know it takes kind of a
pretty special mascara to not only
really define the lashes but also make
them a little bit thicker that's a very
hard combination to get you know
sometimes you can get lengthening and
thickening sometimes you got that false
lash effect that all around mascara but
it's kind of rare we get something
that's the natural and defined look that
does give you a little bit of thickening
as well so this is a pretty special
mascara and it is the cover girl volume
exact people ask me if I like lash blast
and I will tell them that I like this
better this is a rubber brush mascara so
if you're talking covergirl they've got
the covergirl lash exact that's in the
purple tube they've got the volume exact
here in this kind of deep red tube and
then they've got a lash blast in that
big orange tube and I find that this is
just easier to use the brush is smaller
than the lash lash lash of last brush is
um but it is just easier see how a
narrow it gets there towards the tip
that makes it I find it pretty easy to
get right in there to these tiny lashes
and really make each one of those little
lashes stand out like you can get right
in to the very corner of your eye and
work with those eyelashes with this
brush it makes you look like you've got
a lot more lashes and yet it slightly
thickened each one
and that it's just amazing I really like
this a lot better than last glass
because I felt like lash blast was a
very liquidy product that would kind of
um not necessarily like it was trying to
describe this exactly the way I'm
thinking about it in my mind um I felt
like it would sometimes pull my lashes
together in little bunches clumping this
separates and thickens and lengthens so
it's kind of like one of those
all-around mascaras but I had to
definitely put it in the category of
natural and defined because it does it
is able to separate them and that's
something that a lot of mascaras can't
do very well and still you come away
thinking okay my lashes look pretty you
know they look like I've done something
to them so volume exact is my pic there
i'm just going to run through them all
real quick for you just to recap what i
put in each category for the full flash
effect those really big lashes if that's
what you're after i recommend l'oreal
hit mascara if you're after thickening
really nice thick lashes i recommend
almay one coat nourishing mascara triple
effect if you want length i would
recommend l'oreal lash out mascara and
if you want defined and natural lashes
yet lashes that you still give you a
visible effect of improvement on your
eyes volume exact is really great just a
good one for everybody to have in their
make that back in my opinion so thanks
so much everyone for watching and be
sure to check in with my blog and answer
this week's question of the week bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
