this question of the week video I always
look forward to this time because I feel
like I'm learning so much about the
people who watch my videos or read my
blog because the question I just think
it's always very revealing as far as
what your interests are what sorts of
makeup products you're using what you're
watching this and that so I really am
always eager to share the results of
them and this week's question was what's
your favorite makeup resource close to
500 people responded here and by far the
number one response eighty-six percent
for YouTube the other options were blogs
beauty websites magazines books and
makeup artist / consultants so I have to
agree that I think YouTube is a
fantastic resource for beauty there are
so many people on here that know so much
and I just have a huge wealth of
knowledge built up and they're sharing
that with everyone and I just love that
I love that there are so many different
people to learn from you know different
techniques lots of people have their own
ways of doing things and that's the
beauty of makeup is that there's really
no one right way to go about it and
through the gurus and people who you
know share their techniques it's just
amazing to learn from them and and as
Tyler will tell you if i'm not making
videos usually i'm sitting around
watching other people's videos because
i'm learning so much and I just wanted
to go ahead and pick the top six people
that I feel like I really learned the
most from on YouTube and that's not to
say that there aren't tons more that I
love to watch but neither you nor I have
time for me to share all of those with
you so i just thought i would render it
run down um people that I watch a lot
that I learn a lot from and why so I'm
going to start out by talking about
encore um Corran is one of the people
that I have watched from even before I
was making videos and I love the way he
has so many like kind of little
do-it-yourself tricks you know like the
Sephora inspired brush holders how to
make your own brush cleanser how to
actually clean your brushes and deep
clean them had I not watch those videos
I probably
wouldn't know about those things so i
just i love the fact that he doesn't
only focus on the makeup application but
also anything a person interested in
makeup would need to know and even tyler
like if he's sitting beside me on the
couch you know and i'm watching an
encore video who kind of lean over and
see what he's doing because it's just
interesting and he is so engaging and so
fun to watch that i just hope he
continues to post more videos because
there I learned so much from them
another person that I learn a lot from
and did you know one of the early early
people that I started watching on
YouTube was purse buzz how much enter
Dacian energy she does she have I mean I
think she's just fantastic to watch I
also like how she has a nice variety in
terms of doing not only makeup but also
hair videos and I've learned so many
neat hair tricks and things like that
from her and she keeps it concise she's
a good communicator and she's definitely
introduced me to some new products that
I hadn't tried before so love watching
the next person i have to mention is
julieg 713 from a technical standpoint I
think her videos are so well done
they're so easy to follow you can tell
that she's definitely thought things out
how she's going to do them she covers
every little detail she would need to
and I also love how I mean I love that
about our tutorials but also with her
refuse when she does the experiments
that she'll kind of take you through her
day and actually show you how the
product product wore on her I mean the
time that must take you know you just
got to be so thankful that she's willing
to do that because I learned so much
from those and she has just the most
pleasant personality she's a fantastic
communicator I mean I just think she
will go so far in her life just what the
skills she that I can see on youtube
from her so I just love her also pinky
charm um when I watch her reviews I feel
like i love how she'll throw in like
some little tidbit about the product
that you might not typically hear about
in a review like I remember I was
watching her
a review on one of the Rimmel mascaras
and she popped out you know this mascara
that she gotten I think it was from
Japan or something and it had like a
similar one and I was like only only she
would bring up that little detail and I
just love that I love the fact that when
you're watching that you're watching
someone who is not only taking the time
to share their opinion on a product but
she'll look a little deeper she'll show
you the you know tell you about the
ingredients that she looked up on the
website and I just feel like in terms of
learning about makeup and learning about
products that's she's a great one to
watch another one is all that glitters
21 when I see her she brings a smile to
my face because she reminds me of so
many of the girls that were in my
sorority on my cheerleading squad that I
went to college with I mean when I watch
her I feel like I am taken back to that
time somehow and I've also learned a lot
in terms of mac makeup from her just I
mean she's given a lot of good
suggestions and in terms of good eye
shadows to get and color combinations
just watching her work with her makeup
is really fun to do she's got a great
bright personality and she's another one
of those people that I watch and I think
wow she has a real future in this kind
of thing so love watching her and lastly
um xteeener she is kind of like um my
drugstore sister I'm here because she
also enjoys a lot of similar products
that I do and it's so it's always super
interesting for me to see what she gets
in her haul videos I love watching her
halls because it's like okay I could run
out to my drugstore and get that too or
I wonder if she's going to like that
because I might think about getting it
or um she also gives me a lot of ideas
on how to take inexpensive project
products and really use them to the
maximum you know really use them so they
look like they could be something you
bought at a department store you know so
anyway I just wanted to take the time
since I mean youtube was by far the
favorite makeup resource by people who
answered my question of the week I just
wanted to share some of my favorite
makeup resources on youtube and
I'm sure there will be many more to come
if I ever do a video like this again I
will have to share like the you know
bunch more that I couldn't include in
this video but thank you guys so much
for taking the time to watch my videos
i'm glad i've been able to be a good
resource for some of you and I just hope
you continue to watch and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
