week a once-a-week feature i do to sort
of get your input on a variety of topics
and you can always answer the question
of the week on my blog i'll have a link
to that in the sidebar this past week's
question was what's your nail routine
and so I had five options there they
were either a salon manicures only
occasional mitten salon manicure
otherwise not done nails always done by
self nails occasionally done by self and
the last option was nails kept natural
and rarely done and I've got to say I
was so impressed this was the most votes
I've ever had for a question of the week
it was 942 so I wonder if next week we
can hit a thousand last time I gave a
little goal you guys reached it so
hopefully we can but as for the results
on the top answer with thirty-seven
percent of the vote was nails
occasionally done by self and close
behind that was nails always done by
self that's kind of the category i fall
into just so i don't bite them i try to
always keep them done and then the third
most popular answer was nails kept
natural and rarely done very very small
percentage only five percent and three
percent for the ones that pertain to the
salon manicure I didn't get a couple
messages like you know well my answer
really would have been a little bit of
this and that like kind of parts of both
so I tried to keep them as broad as I
could to get as many people you know I
can only have so many categories i guess
but i think this is a pretty true
representation that a lot of us do try
to do our nails ourselves especially if
you really take an interest in beauty
maybe it's a type of thing you try to
kind of master so anyway I just kind of
found that interesting and um because so
many of us do our own nails that may
prompt me to do more nail videos or at
least blogs with a picture may be
showing you how I did it so
since this was a nail topic i thought i
would throw in a quick review of the
china glaze nail polishes that i
recently tried from sally beauty supply
i hadn't tried this at all i've heard
lots of great reviews from a lot of you
about how high quality these are they
run probably around i'm going to say
around five dollars on average at peace
i got them on a buy two get one free
sale so i have three shades here i'll
start out with the one that I'm wearing
on my nails this is golden meringue and
that's what it looks like on my nails
this this is three coats and it's still
a little transparent just a little bit
so um I though I don't really mind that
it's a little bit transparent I'm just
not nuts about that color on my nails
something about the goal I don't know I
don't know it's just not my favorite
look for nails but it's not bad i mean
it is a really pretty sort of tone like
if you were wearing if you like to wear
a lot of gold jewelry i could see that
being nice or maybe a pretty gold color
dress that could be nice as well but
these go on really smooth and evenly
unlike some of those polishes that are
almost feel watery when you put them on
and they don't quite you can almost see
the brushstroke you've made in them this
isn't like that um drying time it takes
a decent amount to dry but I use my
Sally Hansen mega shine top coat over
the top and it really speeds it up even
though it's if it's like most of the way
dry but you wouldn't want to like maybe
go anywhere and do anything with your
hands you can go ahead and put that on
the top and it really locks it and gives
you a actual solid feel to it so anyway
this one is kind of like you know not my
favorite shade probably number my number
three pick out of the three that I got
but in terms of just how it applies and
how smooth the appearances I do like
that now right now I have this shade
avalanche on my toes and this may be my
favorite shade um it goes on it looks
just like it does in the bottle on my
toenails and it's just kind of has that
metallic feel this is kind of unique
sort of blueish deep charcoal grey
metallic shade
very creamy just goes on super even and
also I've had this on my toes for like a
week now and I touched it up a little
bit I touched it up a little bit after
one week and it really didn't need it
that bad we're just a couple little chip
places but other than that I was so
impressed because I wear a lot of
open-toed shoes now the weather's
getting warmer you're more likely to you
know scuffed your feet and get a little
chip here and there but I was very very
impressed at how well this held up most
don't hold up on my toes quite that well
um and then the third one that i have is
summer Rae now this looks pink it has
sort of a bluish undertone and like this
one it goes on a little bit more
transparent I had had this on my nails
probably probably during my last several
videos and it's a very very pretty color
I love the tone I only use two coats of
this cat I'd done three I think it would
have been a little more of like a solid
color but gorgeous gorgeous shade there
and its unique that's what I like about
these they're not necessarily the types
of shades you just find everywhere and
they had a color selection that went far
beyond you know the shades that I have
so I'm eager to try more of those again
they're available at sally beauty supply
and i'm sure many more places that you
guys know about that maybe I don't but
if you're looking for a really high
quality nail polish that'll really like
get you through and and hold up well and
just have a really bold nice smooth
finishes these are a good option for you
so anyway guys thank you so much for
tuning in for this question of the week
don't forget to answer next week's
question you can get there through my
blog and just follow the link thanks for
watching guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
