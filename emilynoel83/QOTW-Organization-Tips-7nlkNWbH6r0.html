question of the week video I am so
pumped to tell you that this past
question we had had the most responses
of anyone I've ever asked I had 618
people placed their votes for this past
weeks question so I think that is so
awesome never had that many so thank you
so much to everybody who stopped by my
blog and decided to give their two cents
it's so fast and easy so you just click
a button and your vote is counted so
it's really nice for me because doing it
through my blog helps it be really
accurate as well but anyway the question
was what beauty product do you have the
most of in your collection and by a
landslide I make up one with 67% of the
vote next was lip products with 21% that
would be the one I voted for her next
was foundation and powder tied with
blush and bronzer for only 4% and then 2
percent for brushes and tools I believe
I got all that right there so um anyway
that was just kind of the way it all
shaped up I just thought it would be
interesting for my perspective to know
what you guys are really working with
the most or what you decide to buy the
most of and because we're talking about
collection I thought it might be
interesting to show you some of the ways
that I organize my collection now my I
am sort of in the process of
reorganizing some of my makeup stuff and
I believe I will post a video when I get
done with that because I have been
getting some questions you know it's
been a while since you updated your
collection video so I do plan to post
another one but for now I thought I
would just highlight a few of the ways
that I organize that are particularly
helpful to me and I thought I would just
explain those to you and give you a few
ideas if you're running low on ideas as
far as how to organize your makeup and
these are all really really affordable
so let's take a look okay guys first I
wanted to show you a couple of ways that
I organize my brushes through these
so-called Sephora inspired brush holders
I know we all give credit to encore he
kind of got us all on to this way of
organizing our brushes but basically
what I have here is
glass um kind of squarish dish type
thing that you can get for Walmart in
the craft section for maybe a dollar or
two I filled it with some of this craft
rock stuff and I know I've shown this
before in a previous video but it was a
while back so I thought I'd kind of
refresh your memory but these little
pebbles fill there and then your brushes
just stick right down in there and I've
had a few people ask you know the fact
that you're using those little bitty
rocks I mean is that abrasive to any of
your brush handles but I've honestly
been doing it this way for a little more
than a year and it hasn't caused any
problem so far on my brushes and it's
just a really nice way to kind of keep
them separated there you can see none of
them are touching and just a really good
way to store your brush now I almost
forgot to show you my smaller size of
that brush holder this is a really cute
it's actually I think it's a votive
candle holder also sold at Walmart it's
got that little crack design on it and I
put some of my smaller brushes in here
that I sometimes like to use honestly I
could have thrown these into a drawer
but this is just so adorable sitting
there with my makeup stuff that I
decided yeah I'm gonna go ahead and do a
mini one because it just looks so cute
sitting there beside the big one yeah
very cute so I'm moving on I want to
show you I'm just another cheap thing
this isn't like rocket science here or
anything but it's just a little um this
is I believe just a little juice glass
really and we use some things like this
for my wedding for different stuff and
so I had some left over and it's just
served as a really nice lip liner holder
for me just pop all your lip liners in
there they just stand up nice and
straight and it's very small as you can
see you know I can almost fit my hand
around it so that's a really nice way to
just store anything skinny like that
that you want to stand up
you could also store brushes and
something like this as well next I
wanted to just show you this container
these are so common I believe I got this
at my dollar store and maybe a set of
several so not even a dollar for this
one but these are great for storing
pallets and you can kind of see that I
the way I have them in here I was able
to incorporate different sizes and just
kind of work it in like a puzzle I've
got some of my ELF pallets and you know
just a random stuff wet and mild and
I've just been able to fit those all in
there and and you know shift it around
it can change it can move with whatever
new things here's another dollar store
find and this is just a drawer organizer
it's just a little flat container here
and it these little compartments
actually will come out so you can you
can see there you can rearrange how this
is all compartmentalized and this would
be great to set down in your drawer I
don't even do that I sit it out on top
of a three drawer or five drawer pullout
drawer container but it's just so nice
in terms of keeping everything separate
that you have just really easy to find
everything that you've got there and
like I said if you switch these around I
mean this would be neat but you could
put eyeliners in there blushes over here
and especially if you have a small
collection I mean this could even do it
move over to my little five drawer
container I have a couple of these
couple of three drawer ones that I store
my makeup in and I absolutely love these
get you know one of these you may be set
if you have a smaller collection or a
medium size collection or whatever it's
all subjective than whatever you
consider that to be but these little
drawers are just wonderful for sorting
things like eyeshadow I thought I'd
feature my eye shadow one since in my
question of the week that's what you all
said you had the most of here I'm able
to separate it up for me like I put all
my Smashbox shadows in one drawer get go
one drawer down and I've got like my
L'Oreal hip and Too Faced and a couple
of Mac shadows and just miscellaneous
ones that I consider to be pretty high
quality go down one and I've got
different drugstore singles like my
Milani ones and down one more and it's
like different palettes and duo's that
are kind of small that fit in there
really well one more drawer down and
it's all of my loose shadows
it's just a great way to know what
you've got and that is such a big key to
make up is knowing what you have and
getting it well organized because then
you're gonna get use out of everything
that you have so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video like I said expect a updated
collection video to come in the near
future but hope this gives you some
ideas thanks for answering this week's
question and don't forget to go back and
answer next week's on my blog thanks
