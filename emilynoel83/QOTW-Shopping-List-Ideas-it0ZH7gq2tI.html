this video I first wanted to mention
kind of an announcement here that beauty
broadcast is on facebook like everything
else though I just wanted to let you
know that there is a fan page on there
so it's kind of a nice outlet for me to
update you when there is a new video or
a new blog so maybe if you're just
wondering you know what's going on or
what's new or if I own a little
announcements or things like that you
can check that page out you can become a
fan and I believe then that will update
you on your little home page on Facebook
for those of you who are familiar with
that so there are one or two ways you
can get there you can type in beauty
broadcast in the little search box and
it'll take you to it'll give you a
string of options and I believe mine is
the first one that comes up or you can
just visit my blog the same place where
you answer a question of the week and
there will be on the right hand side
there's a little link that says find us
on Facebook and you can click that and
go there too so I'm really excited about
it I just think it's just a really fun
way to keep in touch with you guys and
for you to kind of understand what I'm
doing and what's coming up and that sort
of thing so anyway back to this week's
question I'm so excited because of my
last video I said let's top nine hundred
responses and we did this time we had
907 so that's awesome and this question
was how often do you buy beauty products
both online and in the store and the
number one response was once every two
weeks that was thirty percent of the
vote there and then down from that was
once a month with twenty-five percent
twenty-two percent said once a week and
then thirteen percent said once every
couple of months and then the most
frequent twice a week was four percent
and more than two times a week three
percent that goes that translates to 30
responses by make up more than two times
a week so alright more power to ya but
for me I would probably fall into either
the once every two weeks or once a week
category I would think I mean it really
varies because it depends on when I find
good deal like fit were a high end
product that might be like oh you know
much less frequent but if it's like a
really cheap thing that I just find
while I'm out shopping then it may be
more frequent so anyway on that note I
thought it would give you a quick
shopping list ideas video just to give
you some ideas next time you are out in
the store and you're wondering what's
good and maybe what you're looking for
will fall into my category on this list
of some products that I really like and
some of them are new products some of
them are maybe a product I've had for a
while but I just have been using it a
lot more lately and what to update you
on it so let's start out the first one I
have here something I actually recently
bought it's the dream mousse bronzer
from Maybelline and the shade I have is
number 20 and sunglow and so if you've
tried the dream mousse blushes I mean
this is that same kind of really nice
whipped texture and I hadn't tried the
bronzers before because I figured you
know um you can kind of see a little bit
of a sheen there on my hand but don't
really judge it by that because it's not
kind of hard to make it show up in this
lighting I have here but i do have it on
today actually just kind of on the tops
of my cheeks a little bit and anyway
where was I going with this um I was
thinking with the blushes you know
they're pretty I have a couple of those
two and I like those a lot as well but
they're pretty easy to control you know
you're not going over a really broad
area with bronzers you know you might
want to really go all over your face
with something like this and so I wasn't
sure how well this would spread but it
really does spread super easily um since
it does have some shimmer to it I kind
of like to use it right in here sort of
on top of the cheekbone a little bit on
my forehead you know so not really is
like one of those all over like or
contouring Matt bronzers because this is
does have a little shimmer to it on but
at the same time it's got kind of a
warmth to it so it kind of can be like a
blush shade too so um I I'd use it as a
highlighter like a highlighting bronzer
or a blush would be nice for this but I
do like it the texture is just wonderful
so that is from Maybelline and that's
the dream mousse bronzer I believe they
have to
in that all right guys next product is a
cheap product as well and I featured
this on my blog with the picture and
kind of like a short little review on
there but I wanted to mention it again
because it is such a nice blush I have
it on right now and it is so pretty in
terms of packaging this is from be
luscious and it's the blush bouquet in
pretty in pink and you'll understand why
they save okay because it is just that
gorgeous gorgeous flower print and
that's not just like a it's it's
three-dimensional okay you can see that
it's like I've been molded in there and
its many different shades of blush
you've got almost a highlighter light
pink shade and then some deeper roses
and moms and it's just gorgeous when
those colors blend together it's in a
very nice compact with a mirror and
everything and when I think of this I
think what a nice gift I the idea this
could be maybe like a Mother's Day type
thing I mean it's just such one of those
like kind of high quality gifty type
pieces you know that that just stands
out a little more than everything else
so I really really like that in terms of
quality and of course the really really
adorable packaging there so that's a
product from be luscious and it is a
little more expensive so um you should
be aware of that however you know you
can't take advantage of some deals there
on the website if you know what to look
for so um if you also are looking for a
blush that is also great quality but a
little bit cheaper um I wanted to tell
you about the Jane blushing cheeks in
really a lot of the shades are great the
one I have right now is in blushing plum
I dropped it and it has that little you
know chunk out of it but it really is a
pretty pretty shade of pinky plum and I
really wanted to bring up Jane
specifically because Jane is going on
sale at a lot of places so if you're
wondering you know what's good from that
brand because things are down to like
maybe one or two dollars in some places
there blush is really really nice so you
might want to give that a look also and
eye shadow product here from physicians
formula and the
the formulation of these shadows of
these baked shadows has changed a bit
this is the baked collection in baked
sands what I have right here and these
are much much smoother and more
pigmented the color is a lot more rich
than it was in the past like a couple of
years ago so you can see how pretty
those colors come off there on those
three fingers um what it was before it
was I I just really did not like the
texture the texture of these little
beads and you can see this is cool
packaging too because they are kind of
like a three-dimensional shadow there
and um with what they had before it was
almost a little bit gritty it was not
nearly the smooth and the color payoff
was not as good so if maybe you if
you've tried these a while back like say
two years ago maybe I I mean I'm kind of
estimating it how long ago it was you
might want to give it a try again
because these have improved drastically
so that's the baked collection shadows
from physicians formula another
physicians formula thing that I'm liking
right now is their mineral eyeliner
pencil and this is a talc free product
it is a great black pencil which I
actually used in my what look was it my
Minka Kelly look on my waterline and I
found that it lasted quite a while so
you know maybe Revlon Colorstay for some
crazy reason or another didn't work for
you and you wanted to try something else
this does draw on a little bit more of a
smooth line but as you can see it's
still very dark and rich and one thing
about this that does differentiate
itself from the Revlon Colorstay is it
smudges more easily so it comes with
this little cap here which also has a
built-in sharpener thing so it's like a
little gizmo here with practically like
a little clip on the end so it's really
interesting but you can smudge out the
line a little more easily I don't know
how well you can see that but this it
has a really soft smudge tip here and
you can take you know whatever line you
did and really buff it out to make it a
smokey eye so I really like that they
getting a lot of questions about I
shadow primers and some folks saying I
don't want to spend the seventeen
dollars or you know fifteen dollars and
up for you know two faced shadow
insurance and all these different kinds
you know is there something cheap out
there so I have gone ahead and tried the
Loreal decrease and it's an eyeshadow
primer here it comes out with a little
monde applicator there and you blend it
in it's kind of like a skin tone shade
it's actually the exact shade you see
there and it's very smooth and I would
almost recommend this for people who
maybe have little more oily lids because
this dries to almost like eight I mean
it gives me the effective like a cream
to powder almost feeling which still
somehow still makes your eyeshadows
stand out nicely but it doesn't leave
sort of that tackiness that some other
primers do so this may work well for
some of you even if maybe you don't have
oily lids but we are heading into summer
and you know people are sweating and
whatever you know so this may sort of
lengthen the life span of your eyeshadow
if you put this on underneath and this
only runs somewhere in the ballpark of
six to seven dollars at your drug stores
so if maybe you haven't even tried an
eyeshadow primer yet you're not sure
what it will do for you but you don't
want to spend a whole lot of money to
find out this may be a good thing to try
so those are my shopping list ideas for
this week I also wanted to bring up
something that I just got that I'm
pretty excited about haven't tried it it
also don't take this as a recommendation
yet because I haven't even taken it out
of the box but it's another Physicians
Formula product called bronze booster
self tanning bronzing veil instant and
lasting bronze glow so what this is this
is one of those things if you can see it
has a little brush connected and you
twist it up and the product will come
out at the end of the brush and so this
is like a cream bronzer that also have
some has some built-in self tanners it
says stain-free streak free orange free
odor-free I will definitely tell you
what I think about this because this is
one of those kind of different
innovative products that I'm really
interested in and I got it in light to
medium if anybody has tried this prod
act and knows anything about it I mean
maybe share your thoughts here in
comments below or you know just shoot me
an email maybe and how do you exactly do
you recommend that you use this if you
have done this is this something you put
on all over your face like after your
moisturizer or do you wait and do it
after foundation I'm not totally sure so
since it is a sunless tanner I would
think you would want this to come in
contact with your skin first but I'm not
totally certain so anyway um yeah that's
my video for today guys so thank you so
much for tuning in and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
