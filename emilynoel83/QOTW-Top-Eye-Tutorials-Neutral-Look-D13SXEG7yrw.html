time the time where you go to my blog
and answer a question and over the
course of a week those responses get all
tallied up and then one week later I
share the responses with you and this
week's question asked what sort of i
tutorial do you like watching and this
was the sort of question that I was
really interested in not just you know
out of curiosity but really because I
wanted to know and I this the the
response to this question would really
help me structure my youtube channel the
way I wanted it to be I want to do the
looks that you guys are interested in
and the number one response was neutral
and natural looks if you're hearing me
say this and you're thinking oh that's
not what I think at all well then you
should vote next time the number to look
was a smoky eye with color that was what
I voted for I'm getting more and more
comfortable with that neutral probably
would have been my number one you know a
while back and now this doing like smoky
eyes i'm working in one or two shades
i'm really enjoying that lately number
three was bright and colorful number for
a dark smoky eye and number five a light
and subtle look so I there were more
than 800 responses here 834 to be exact
so I feel like these results really are
saying something here so and I know
those neutral looks are just very
wearable it's something everybody uses
at one point in time or another even if
you're a colorful eye makeup person
you're going to go back to that neutral
look from time to time so it is very
versatile and I understand why a lot of
people chose that it was pretty close
with the smoky eye with kind of a pop of
color in there so um you know this is
interesting to me it'll probably kind of
you know give me some cues if I'm
wondering what to do or I'll look
through what I have done because I have
done so many videos I got to look and I
was like wow how are we coming up here
on 200 videos at some point so um that's
pretty amazing but you know this just
kind of helped me you know realize what
do people really want to see so since
you guys said neutral and natural I
thought why not go ahead and give you a
look like that that you can see right
here on this question of the week video
so this is one that I did a while back
its kind of
warm coppery I so it still falls under
the category of neutral but it's still
something a little bit different if you
haven't tried this look yet I think
would be really gorgeous on people with
red hair or red you know kind of a
reddish strawberry blonde hair I think
it would be really really pretty on you
guys it works for anybody to so um but
anyway it was something I shot a while
back hadn't immediately uploaded it and
I thought now would be the perfect time
to go ahead and do that so I will hand
it over to that video now
this is going to be such a quick and
easy look if you are the type of person
that likes to do a neutral look but
you're looking for a little twist you
can put on it and it's something you can
do fast and inexpensively I hope you
watch this video because I think you're
going to learn some tricks to using some
really warm shades that can be very
complimentary to a lot of different eye
colors but i'm using all Milani shades
for this kind of gold and copper look
i'm using a shade to call a golden shade
called Sun Goddess a coppery color
called flare and a warm brown in spice
and so that's what I used to create this
look it didn't take hardly any time at
all so if you want to see how I did it
keep watching the first step was to
apply some Too Faced shadow insurance
all over the lid and then we're going to
take our Milani shadow in Sun Goddess a
pretty gold shade and I'm just going to
use my ELF eyeshadow brush and apply
that all over my lid
so it's just a pretty pretty gold shade
and you can also do some sort of golden
a base if you wanted to just verse speed
today I'm just going straight to the
shadow ok so now that you've got that
gold all over we're going to take our
second Milani shade and flare this is
one that I mentioned recently on my
shopping list ideas video really pretty
kind of orange e copper shade and I'm
going to take my essence of beauty
crease brush not the fine crease with
the step up from that and just dip it in
there and we're just going to make it
make this an all-over crease shade color
it's just so warm and pretty work this
up you know as high as you want to as
high as you feel comfortable with and
then we're going to take a shade called
spice and that is kind of a pretty it's
kind of a warm brown color and I'm going
to take my fine crease brush for this
and just dip it in there and we're going
to kind of just get a little more depth
just to the crease area here with that
all the shades just are there they're
shimmery their pigmented and they work
just really really nicely together after
that we're going to just go back to sun
goddess and use that as our highlight so
that was our gold and just grab a
fluffier I shadow brush and apply that
all the way up to your brow works really
nicely there alongside flare and there's
your shadow next for our liner i know
i've been using the shade a lot lately
but it just seems to have been working
well in a lot
my looks it's the femme Couture liquid
liner and brown and that's just going to
be the shade that I used to go from
inner to outer corner here not really
doing anything fancy just going right
there to the outer edge now for the
lower lash line you can see this kind of
a soft look over here i'm using my
smashbox waterproof shadow liner in
hollywood it's a pretty golden brown
shade and i'm using my smashbox number
21 brush it's really nice because it's a
liner brush and it has that nice bend in
it that makes it really easy to you know
work on certain areas so i'm just going
to come out here and sort of get that
blending with the liquid liner in the
corner and then just sort of blend it
right in with the lash line and all the
way to the corner next step we're going
to curl our eyelashes and the mascara
i'm going to be using is my beloved era
in carbon black it's the high definition
mascara and it has i've shown this
before but it has this really really
small brush and it makes it so easy to
just get to all your lashes and it
really highlights each and every one
well i hope you like this kind of
natural coppery really warm look on the
eyes i was just looking for something
kind of quick and easy to do today so i
just thought this might be a look that
my viewers would enjoy as well on my
lips I'm wearing my NYX goddess of the
night lip gloss and chestnut so that's
kind of a warm um you know coppery gold
shade and for my mascara as well I went
ahead and did like a couple of coats
there so I really like the definition
that that's giving me right now
and um if you guys have any questions or
any requests as always let me know and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
