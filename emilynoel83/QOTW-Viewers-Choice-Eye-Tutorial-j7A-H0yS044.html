on my question of the week which was
actually asking you guys what colorful
look you would like to see me do an eye
tutorial on and in case I hope you can
tell I'm really trying to play with the
lighting because this looks really cool
in person but I don't feel like the
pinkish showing up enough on the camera
but I will have some pictures on my blog
anyway but the winning look was the
pinks and purples request which I was
really happy about because I was hoping
to use my Coastal Scents palette to do
some more with that so basically i'm
getting my camera zoomed in here so you
can better see what i'm doing with this
look so i'm going to start out by
putting a cream shadow base I've already
put my Mary Kay eye primer on here and
I'm going to go ahead and use on one of
the colors on this Revlon cream shadow
sent in lava bloom and it's going to be
this sort of shimmery pink shade so I'm
just going to apply that all over my lid
just like so and kind of up to the
crease just do a little bit okay so now
you've got a nice creamy base there for
the color to stick to and I'm going to
start out i'm going to use a couple of
different palettes from Coastal Scents
I'm going to use the shimmer palette a
little bit and the mat one but keep in
mind that you can I mean it just similar
shades will work so you don't have to
have these particular palettes but in
the shimmer palette I'll just go ahead
and show you what colors i'm going to be
using i'm going to use this pretty pink
shade that's here just kind of a a true
shimmery pink and then i'm going to come
down here and use this purple shade and
then I'm going to come back over here
and this is just a light shimmery pink
that I'm going to go ahead and and
highlight with and then I'm going to
just for my the deeper parts of the look
for that I'm going to use my matte
palette so let's start out by using our
low porno three-eighths brush and I'm
just going to dip into that brighter
pink shade that I showed you and I'm
going to apply this it's wrong I'm then
going to apply this all over the lid and
you can see the color color is just
super vibrant just an amazing shower but
also along with it great color and I'm
just going to kind of padding that up
into the crease okay so there's kind of
our starting point here and then I'm
going to take my crease brush and I'm
going to dip into that purple shade i
told you about it's just like a true
purple shimmer and tapping off the exits
and i'm just going to take this over my
crease and i don't expect this to really
be my deep crease shade but it is just
working in the purple with the pink so
it all sort of has that undertone to it
and these colors look just so pretty
blend
together okay and while we're at it with
these nice light shimmery shades I'm
going to just go ahead and use that
light shimmery pink at the top and just
blend that right up to my eyebrow just
like so okay so we're done with the
shimmer palette so I'm going to step
away from that and get my matte palette
out here and for this and you can kind
of see this chunk oops something to
spell that you can see the chunk right
here of the purples and pinks we're
going to be using this vivid purple
shade right here on the bottom and also
i'm going to be giving in to that pink
shade right beside it as well and then
this charcoal kind of shade here is what
we're going to use to create a little
more depth to the look okay so let me
get set up here sorry going to make it
so the palette will stay open for me I'm
going to take my small little Cornell
brush here this is the quarter inch
dipping into that intense purple shade
that I showed you and we're just going
to put that on like the outer half of
the way just sort of push it up into the
crease area just a bit
okay and then just as I want a wider
wash of that color all over the crease
I'm going to dip into it with my crease
brush and wow I love that purple awesome
loving the way that it comes out and
then I'm going to take that bright
bright pink that was right next to it
and just over a lot this is probably one
of my favorite things about the Coastal
Scents palette it's how you can just
overlap the colors and blend so easily I
love that ok so you can see if you're
looking at this now the this I has just
that added intensity you could
definitely stop here if you wanted to
but I'm going to put just a little show
you how you can take a deep gray shade
and just um add to this look and so I
always go over to the other eye I just
put on like this is my quarter inch
brush and I'm going to go right over
that purple that I put on the outer half
of my lid okay just putting that there
and then I'm willing to take my fine
crease brush again into that gray and
use it right in here right in the crease
and you can go as heavy or slide on that
as you want just keep in mind a heavier
you go probably the less purples and
pinks are going to shine through and
just continue extending it outward a
little bit we want this look to kind of
as you can see kind of give us that
outer V
so there we go we're kind of achieving
that with the help of that gray shade so
I think we're done as far as the shadow
is concerned but we're going to use some
liner i'm using my cream liner from wet
and wild and i believe the shade is
eggplant it's just a nice deep purple
and i'm using my smashbox bent eyeliner
brush which i'm really liking these days
and just loading it up with some color
and i'm just going to go um not quite to
the inner corner i'm going to start
about three-quarters of the way in and
dragged out and just kind of barely
blend it towards my inner corner mainly
keep it on the outside
and just extend it outward and then this
is the very same thing we're going to be
using on the lower lash line so for that
again we're keeping it on the outer half
oops sorry and just carefully connect it
to what you had There and only go
halfway and because we want to work in
some more pink on the lower lash line
two okay so over the top of that we are
going to go back to our shadows a little
bit the matte shadows we were using um
just on the lower lash line I'm going to
overlap the outer part with that
brightest purple shade and then the
inner part and I'm just going to
continue in so the purple is going to
shine through a little bit more it's
going to still appear a little darker on
the outer half
she's in that bright matte purple shadow
using it on the inside and then it
overlaps the darker shade sorry if I'm
kind of getting used to this closer up I
and goes to forgive me okay so there is
a shadow look it's really easy to do
guys it's it's just a lot of different
shades and you don't need to use the
same shades that I used just you know
shimmery pinks and purples can do the
trick but hopefully you got an idea of
another thing I kind of wanted to
demonstrate with it with this video with
how you can use mats and shimmers for
different purposes you saw I used a lot
of the shimmers you know on the lid on
the highlight and then i use the matte
shades to really go in and give it more
depth so i'm going to go ahead and put
on my maybelline colossal mascara and i
don't find that this is colossal by any
means but i did want a more natural lash
look because I wanted this nice shadow
to really shine through and sort of be
the star of the show although you could
you know if you are going out or
something and wanted to really glam this
look up throw on some false eyelashes
and you'd really have a great a great
look okay
so just coating it on there and that's
the look guys and on my lips if you are
wondering i'm wearing just kind of a
light pink shade it's number 7 40 it's
maybelline superstay and it's just this
light pink shade has like the balm that
you put on top it's supposed to be long
wearing so i hope you guys like this
look um it was really fun for me to do
and like i said and the camera of course
does not always pick things up how i
want it to so check out my blog i will
post some pictures so you can really see
you know how this is coming off to me in
person so thanks guys a lot for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
