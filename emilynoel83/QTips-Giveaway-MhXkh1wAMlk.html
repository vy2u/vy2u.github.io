this video what I'm going to be talking
about is a very small but very useful
thing in the world of makeup and that is
the q-tip I mentioned this in a lot of
different videos especially like my
must-have tools video that i just
recently did these are so so inexpensive
but what a great way to enhance your
makeup whether it is cleaning off little
makeup smudges or actually applying
makeup q tips are great for that I love
them in the eye area especially I know
people have a lot of their own uses you
know for q-tips but I've mentioned it
before and then I was contacted by the
folks at q-tips and they said hey we
want to sponsor a contest so some of
your viewers can start to learn more
about it and I said I'm all for that
because this is an affordable great
product and I just wanted to if I can
pass it along to you guys my loyal
subscribers then that's what I want to
do so anyway what they have offered is
for the winner of my contest and I'll
break down what the contest is in a
second but the winner will get four
q-tips vanity packs the new vanity packs
and also a great little jewelry box
now here is what the vanity packs look
like they're about this big and they've
got kind of a different design on each
side and different color scheme this is
sort of the purple and pink color scheme
and you've got this cute little drawer
that kind of pulls out and it's got all
your q-tips just kind of pact right down
in there and you could leave that kind
of open on your on your vanity table or
you can just push it right in it just
slides in and out just like a nice
little drawer there so that's so cute
such a cute way to store these things
and so that's the purple one and then
you'll get a blue and grey one it's got
kind of a floral blue and grey motif on
it so this would be great for like any
room okay so you can sit him in any room
of the house nobody would have to even
know that there were cute it's in there
you know just cute little decorative
piece here this is the yellow one it has
kind of a like a butterfly kind of
pretty still floral print there with
leaves and stuff pretty for fall and I
really like this red one that's got kind
of a grayish brown color on it with the
red flowers so these are all definitely
cute and these are available at
walgreens you can also find them online

believe as well i'm sure they're at
other stores too but anyway these are
