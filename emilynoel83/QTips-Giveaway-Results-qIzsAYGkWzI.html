this video I really appreciated how many
people took the time to put in a little
response to my q-tips giveaway video and
I asked everybody who entered to just
leave a comment saying what your
favorite use for q-tips is and I just
picked a winner at random there were so
many responses and I read through a lot
of them and they were really some of
them very creative things I hadn't
thought about before but I randomly
picked a winner and that winner is
kaleidoscope 929 okay you are the winner
and in case you were wondering her tip
was involved using the q-tip to remove
excess makeup when you wake up in the
morning if there's still a little eye
makeup smudged there and she also uses
them to put the glue on her false lashes
like put it on the lash and then put it
on your eyes so kaleidoscope 929 will be
getting four of the different styles of
these cute little q-tips vanity packs
plus a really awesome jewelry box and
all that will be mailed to her directly
from the q-tips people that contacted me
so congratulations thank you so much to
everybody who took the time to submit a
comment I will be having some more kind
of contests around the holidays
featuring some of my favorite things
that I've reviewed over time so I please
keep a lookout for those and participate
in that some of them may be happening
through my blog or my facebook or maybe
just my youtube I haven't quite decided
exactly how I'm going to carry those out
but anyway guys that I'm so glad that we
kind of spread the love of q-tips on
this because they are a really really
inexpensive great little tool for makeup
and if you weren't kaleidoscope 929 you
do want to get your hands on some of
these I know that you can get them
online at like Walgreens calm and these
are in a lot of drug stores as well so
just a cute little way to spiff up your
makeup area or maybe your bathroom sink
or wherever so um thanks guys for for
tuning in to see the results and have a
great day I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
