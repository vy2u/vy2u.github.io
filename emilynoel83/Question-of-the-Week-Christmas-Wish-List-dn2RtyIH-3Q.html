of the week on 12 1008 what makeup items
are on your Christmas wish list what are
you asking maybe friends or family for
that is a makeup item that you hope you
find under your Christmas tree this year
and feel free to put in as many items in
your response as you want because I'm
not going to be totaling this up because
I expect lots and lots of varied
responses here so feel free to answer
that one and as for last week's results
the question was what is your favorite
lip gloss scent and or flavor and we had
record voting for this one more than 400
votes were cast 100 exactly for mint 72
for vanilla 68 for strawberry and the
list goes on from there watermelon
cherry coconut and mocha / chocolate I
kind of put that in there and put that
in its own category rounds out the list
of our top 7 there and now we had 19
other categories as you can imagine
folks brought up a lot of different
flavors that they liked those categories
receive less than 12 votes apiece 74
total votes were cast in those
miscellaneous categories just some
observations I noticed as I look through
the results three people voted for no
flavor they preferred no flavor many
mint lovers mentioned co bigelow the
brand available at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
most unique flavor mentioned violent
never heard of a violet lip balm so
thanks for bringing that up my favorite
I love vanilla I really like the kind
that makes you think of like a cake
batter or a cookie or some kind of baked
good like that but anyway thanks
everyone so much for watching and don't
forget to answer this week's question by
