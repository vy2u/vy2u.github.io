week time this week's question I'm
really glad this happened this way it
was prompted by a viewer question and I
was wondering what am I going to do for
this week's question and then like magic
I got a message from someone and it was
a message from mystic queen or mr. Queen
i'm not sure but she says is it possible
if the next question is what's your
favorite foundation and i think that's
really a great question and so that's
what it's going to be this week that is
the question what is your favorite
foundation and you know it may be
mineral or liquid or cream to powder or
whatever but I hope you'll leave your
answer by commenting below whatever it
is and the results will be tallied
according to brand so you can give me as
much specifics as you want to and you
know it may give some other people some
ideas as well but I will tally them up
just according to brand because I
predict there will be a lot of variation
in your responses so thanks so much for
your comments on last week's question it
was what is your on your Christmas
makeup wish list so many responses
thanks so much and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
