once again thank you for joining me this
week's question what is your least
favorite makeup brand and if you list
just one it would make it way easier for
me to total it all up so if you could
just list one that would be great I know
we focus on a lot of favorites so I
thought let's talk about a least
favorite not to be too negative or
anything but this time for results now
last week's question what's your
favorite form of lip gloss we gave you
this visual pot stick one squeeze tube
or the click up a sponge tip or brush
tip applicator and we had great response
this time this was awesome 236 votes 110
for wand won by a landslide but then we
had squeeze tube with a 27-16 for stick
16 for the cliq up sponge tip or a brush
tip one for pot or tub and 68 people
gave multiple answers you said you know
two or three of the different responses
so if you know take that with a grain of
salt because some of you picked some of
them and I really had no other way to
total that up but many think the pot or
tub form is not sanitary pop form was
included in some of your multiple answer
responses so it wasn't totally left out
and C and D or a very popular duo given
when you guys gave multiple answers so I
still think one would have won either
way but thank you so much for
participating and don't forget to answer
this week's question by commenting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
