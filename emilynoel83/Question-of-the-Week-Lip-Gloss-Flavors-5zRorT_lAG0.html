time thanks for joining me for this
video this week's question what is your
favorite lip gloss flavor now i'm not
exactly asking for you to give me a
specific brand here just a flavor for
example there are just so many different
kinds cherry root beer mint strawberry
grape i mean you name it there are just
so many different varieties out there
and I'm going to try my best to total up
from what you guys give me um but if you
can just give me one answer that would
be awesome so on you know it may be a
totally different flavor than what I
just listed there but again just be
creative and please share what you like
best that might be sent or taste you
know I'm not quite sure whichever you
just appeals to you more and now last
week's question what makeup product are
you most thankful for I got so many
replies on this and so many I mean
responses and it was just too many
different products and brands to really
break it down but I really do encourage
you to browse the list because people
gave some nice explanations and
descriptions of why they like certain
products you might find some of your
YouTube friends on there and see what
they like but thanks so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
