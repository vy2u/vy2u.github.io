of the week time this week's question
three parts i really hope you'll answer
each part in the comment section below
does all of the makeup you use come from
the same brand if it all had to be from
the same brand what brand would you pick
and why i'm just really wondering this
because i don't think a lot of people
use only one brand now the question of
the week results from last week guests
the eyeshadow brand this is one of the
pictures you all had to look at you had
to guess what brand is this i said they
didn't all come from the same palette
and these are some statistics now that
I've looked through it all after the
past week 199 replies 33 brands were
guests 27 of those were drugstore brands
six were high-end brands 15 viewers
guessed the correct brand and one viewer
against the correct shades the top
vote-getters NYX with 55 L'Oreal hip
2724 for claire's / the icing 15 for elf
and 84 Milani every other brand received
six votes or less once again this is
what you guys were looking at I did not
give really any clues whatsoever for
this but the winner is elf and
congratulations to these 15 people who
got that right very good judges of the
shades there and these are the different
palettes that I took them from star girl
hauser or user guess the correct shades
they came from the palates of drama
silver lining lux and I be there from
ELF now take a look at this though on
the right those shadows are the elf
shadows applied just as is just straight
from the package applied with a brush
the left is with a special added thing
that I use it's the mixing medium this
is a so cheap to make one part glycerin
to three parts purified water you can
add this I did a whole video on mixing
medium encore has a great video as well
but you just tap your brush into this
just moisten the brush I use a little
gold concealer brush and I just used it
I used all these different shades and I
thought I created
some really great shadows and what
prompted me to do this was a lot of
people say hey the elf shadows are no
good don't use them well look what you
can do there on the left side with the
mixing medium you can take some one
dollar shadows and create some great
great stuff with them I can't wait to
try this on my eyes because look at some
of those gorgeous shades that you get
I'm just astounded by it and thank you
guys so much for watching and please
don't forget to answer this week's
question of the week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
