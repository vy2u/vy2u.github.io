having a good day this is going to be
the start of a new weekly segment that
i'm doing called question of the week
and i just thought it would be fun to do
to kind of just generate feedback from
you guys and it might be the type of
thing that you check in with
periodically just to see you know how
people have answered the question you
know as time goes on you may go back
because you want to see what people's
opinions are on different things and so
she's kind of a discussion question I'm
posing to you and I hope that you guys
all comment and you just tell me what
your thoughts are I ask this because you
know it's either interesting to me and
it's hopefully something that you guys
have thoughts on and we can all find it
you know maybe learn a little bit more
about what's going on in the makeup
world and so i'll probably do this every
monday is what i think i'm going to try
to do and just you know being a question
of the week and I just hope for a lot of
participation this isn't something I've
really seen people doing on YouTube but
I think it'll just make it a little more
interactive and a little more about you
guys and what you have to say and and
I've definitely I just think your
comments in the past on other topics
have just always been really helpful to
me so I'm thinking this way we could all
be helpful to each other so this week's
question is what do you think about the
rubber brush mascaras as opposed to the
more traditional mascaras okay it's so
like when I'm talking about the rubber
brush I'm a couple of brands I know that
have this and there's probably many more
would be like the covergirl LashBlast
you know they have this big like to
applique tur that is a wand that is
those little rubber bristles another one
that's doing the same thing is the
define a lash volume or regular define a
lash to it's got this like really
flexible like rubber rubbery applicator
and then buy more by traditional
mascaras I'm talking things like
something like say
voluminous you know this is just your
typical kind of like thick bristle comb
or like say diorshow that's another one
you know it's just got that big kind of
comb that spirals around itself I would
also put the I guess another category or
maybe we'll just put it in the category
with just the traditional ones would be
those ones that are just like I don't
think I have it anymore like lash
stylists that are the little comb let's
just do throw that in with just the
regular old mascaras and call it the
rubber versus the traditional mascara
wand I mean what do you guys think about
this do you think that the rubber ones
are becoming more the trend now I mean
do you think that that is what people
are really going after do you think
they're becoming more popular than the
other kind I mean one thing I've noticed
is that many of these that are the
rubber wand cling to even if they claim
to be volumizing like definitely lash
blast does and define a lash does it
seems like they still have an emphasis
on um not clumping and really separating
and just not uh not weighing down the
lashes you know covergirl also has a
lash exact of volume exact I think are
the other kinds that they make I'm sure
other brands and even more high-end
brands are getting into this too but I
basically just want to know how you feel
about that I mean do you think it's a
worthwhile innovation or do you think
that they're really not doing that much
personally I've been more impressed with
some of the traditional mascaras like
voluminous say or other kinds i just
feel like they build it up more and more
so than these these new rubber brushes
do i mean i guess i've yet to find a
rubber brush even less less I mean I
just don't haven't found anything that
really is doing something that had never
seen happen before with my eyelashes so
anyway that's the question I want to
pose to you i hope you guys
want to discuss this and like I said
this could be something down the road
you know you want to if you see tips
here you see different things that
people are adding in is something you
can check back with and I thought it
would be fun to try so thank you for
watching my question of the week and i
hope you participate by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
