time once again this week's question
Thanksgiving is right around the corner
what makeup item are you most thankful
for and I feel free to name not only the
type of product but also the brand maybe
even why you like it so much I just
thought it'd be fun to do something kind
of an honor of the season there now for
last week's results favorite lip color
shade this I found to be pretty
interesting we had six different options
last place was red 18 votes classic red
a lot of people might think that's too
intense I guess fifth place peaches
corals 25 votes their fourth place
neutrals and browns 30 votes there was
very close with our third-place winner
which was berries and plums that's one
of my favorites although I like them all
like many of you do that was a
particular favorite of mine second place
a big jump here to pink with 73 votes
and then number one nude 133 votes all
of us like our nude shades i guess
thanks so much for watching though and
don't forget to answer this week's
question happy thanksgiving everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
