time I'm so excited about this question
I wish I would have asked it sooner what
kind of makeup videos do you most like
to watch on youtube so I'm not talking
about hair or fashion or other things
i'm talking about makeup do you like
tutorials Hull's refuse collection
videos or those like top 10 favorite
must-haves in a certain category just
let me know what you think I'm really
excited to hear and if you could explain
it that'd be even better now last week's
results what is your least favorite
makeup brand 242 votes crazy guys
covergirl had 41 votes NYC 18 wet and
wild eighteen seventeen for Maybelline
12 for rimmel lot of people didn't like
they said covergirl for a number of
different reasons least favorites
continued here elf 10 votes LA Colors
Mac yeah Mac even was on there almay
Avon physicians formula and then we had
about twenty six other brands that
received five votes or less a piece so I
couldn't really include them all there
were just so many so just so you know
there were other brands mentioned 12
voters said they couldn't come up with a
least favorite and your answers were so
nice and detailed I appreciate that so
much so check those out if you didn't
see him yet and don't forget to answer
this week's question I'll reveal the
results next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
