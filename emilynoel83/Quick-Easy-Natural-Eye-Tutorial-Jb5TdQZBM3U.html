a really easy basic everyday and I look
that you can do when you're in a hurry
and you're trying to head out of the
house really quickly and I thought
that's a great idea you know because a
lot of a lot of times these tutorials
can get kind of detailed and like sort
of complicated really and so I thought
what yeah that's a great idea let's do
something that's that's simple and you
can just feel confident with and if
you're a beginner and you're watching
this which I know a lot of people um you
know look to YouTube when they're
starting out it's like just to get some
ideas and some ideas on how to apply
makeup and so this is great if you're
watching this and you're not really
familiar with I makeup this is going to
be just a two color eyeshadow look that
you can definitely duplicate with color
similar to what i have you don't have
exactly the colors I'm using but it's
just going to give you a starting point
I guess and you can build on this look
and make it just as dramatic as you want
to if you add more colors so on this I
you can see what the finished look is
like it's so so simple this is the
eyeshadow i'm using it's the jane be
pure mineral shadow in red rocks which
is kind of a misleading name because i
find that there's nothing really read
about this the color is this lighter
shade is kind of like a dirty champagne
color i would say that's not the only
way I can describe it and then the
darker one it's actually kind of a
purpley taupe okay so that's about as
well as i can describe them they're very
neutral very easy to use if you're
looking at this I don't know I feel like
for some reason it's coming across a
little brown on there it's really not
it's kind of a cool color you can see it
on my I just um it's very natural like
the tones that
will naturally have in there and I don't
know if you guys just heard that yell
but I think Tyler is playing PlayStation
right now and he gets very intense when
he's doing there's a madden NC double-a
football whatever it is so your
parenting more screams out there that's
probably what's going on but anyways um
this is this these are kind of the
colors that are naturally in your eye as
it is so think of it as like your eyes
but better that's kind of look we're
going for so I've already applied a
primer here so I'm just gonna take my
eyeshadow brush this is my ELF eyeshadow
brush and I'm going to use the lighter
shade here and get decent amount on
there and just just pack it on the lid
you'll find you know like i said this
isn't going to be a far cry from what
your would normally looks like it's just
going to even out any discoloration
basically and be a nice all over shade
so just build it up to what you want
this is also a mineral shadow i know
that's really hot right now um so there
you go there's step one step two i'm
just going to take this other color the
darker shade the sort of plumbing taupe
but not its i mean these these colors do
have a slight bit of shimmer but not
much and um trying to just describe like
the the texture of it i mean they're
pretty pigmented there but they're easy
enough to use it's not like you're gonna
use a little bit and then it's just like
going to go everywhere and so that's why
part of why i chose this shadow goes
quick i thought it was very easy to work
with and so what i'm doing here is i'm
taking my fine crease brush and I'm just
going right about here starting
three-quarters of the way in my eye and
I am just applying that right here see
this what kind of windshield wiper move
movement you can find it and then just
kind of open your eye and it will
deposit that shadow right in there so
there you know we've gotten it getting
that color a little bit deeper just like
so and then I'm going to take my
fluffier contour brush dip it in that
shadow once more and just kind of blend
it out get a little more on concentrate
on the outside half of your crease and
just blend it out a little bit and
you're going to get kind of a warm kind
of a warm shade out of this it's it
really like people would look at you and
not think you really had eye shadow and
they would just think oh your eyes just
look good like that so like I said build
this to whatever you want whatever
intensity you want and um we're stopping
there there you go there's the bad whole
thing pretty much with the eye shadow
and just a tip if you don't have a
highlight shade cuz these I don't
consider either of these really to be
highlight shade and that lighter shade
just have a little too much gray in it
for me to want to put that on my brow
bone but just take some of your bronzer
and a fluffy eyeshadow brush and this
will warm up your entire face just by
putting a little bit of bronzer right up
here I mean obviously make sure it's not
too dark you know you want to keep it
light but just a little bit of warmth up
there some people go so white on their
highlight and I just can't quite
understand it I mean a little bit as
nice the accent you know any the highest
point of the arch but it's not
completely necessary and I just I feel
like sometimes it it just messes up the
line of your the lines of your face you
know you got your eyes your lips your
cheeks and then now the strange of
whiteness under the
just kind of unusual for me but um so
now there's the shadow you can see what
we've done here we just are really
really basic easy one color on the lid
another color in the crease now I'm
going to take a pencil liner this is
again very beginner friendly here it's
called pencil perfect from l'oreal and
it's an ebony so a very black shade here
and i chose this because as opposed to
my colorstay liner which I love but this
is more blendable because we're going to
do a little smudging with it so I'm
going to just line I kind of start in
the middle and go out and then come back
to my inner corner and meet my initial
mark that I made there okay so I'm not
being too careful with that that is
probably not a perfect line but I'm not
worried about right now because we're
going to smudge it and so then I'm going
to come around the bottom and I'm going
to draw my line halfway in on my I just
half white because we want to keep this
easy natural not too high maintenance
and then just make sure you got it
connected at the corner so just you know
that doesn't take much work there and
then take a smudge tip I have this
little like applicator thing and it's
just a it's just like us I don't know if
you can see it it's just kind of like a
sponge tip and I'm just going to go over
what I just did and basically just
smudge it out ever so slightly and this
performs of several functions you are
not only softening the line and making
it look more natural you are also
removing excess product you know if more
liner got on there then you need it you
can get rid of that through smudging so
that's that's a nice
added bonus there and also if you didn't
if you're also maybe just starting out
you didn't get quite as close to your
lash line as you wanted to when you
first line this can kind of smudge it
right in where it needs to be looks like
it's generating the wreck way from your
lash line so there is some a really easy
liner there and so I'm going to curl my
lashes now final step already did my
brows so just curl them take about 15
seconds usually does the trick but for
the sake of time we are speeding up i'm
using Neutrogena it's healthy Volume
Mascara check out the size of that wand
it's like the size of do your show and
just kind of work your way root to tip
with that just kind of wiggling it on
the way out one more little cup
and there you go there is a perfectly
natural I look that you can take to do
whatever you need to do if you want to
get out the door quickly and real quick
what I have on my lips is Revlon lip
glide in radiant rose and I'm also
wearing as my foundation and my makeup
is the Royale bear natural mineral
makeup so thank you guys so much for
watching I hope you found this
informative and easy and be something
you can easily duplicate like I said
real neutral colors don't have to be
what I used exactly but anything similar
to that will achieve this look so thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
