this video I'm in my bathroom right now
and that's because I'm going to be doing
a hair video and I've been getting a lot
more requests for videos showing quick
hairstyles that you can do that are
appropriate for every day and this one
happens to double is something you could
wear for every day or it's actually
something that I used for a wedding
recently that I went to if you've
checked my blog I have some pictures
there it shows the hairdo and like the
makeup I used for that so i just thought
i would show you how to recreate that
look since i've been getting a few
questions so first off you can start
with your hair straight or curly just
because my hair was basically straight
just a little turned under today but
it's been basically straight today so
that's just what I'm going to do but if
you want the updo part of it to be a
little more curly now is the time where
you may want to go ahead and just curl
your hair all over you know not in a
real precise way or anything but just
kind of get some curl going on then what
you need to have on hand is a some sort
of cliff like this that's what's going
to ultimately clip your style in place a
rat tail comb that you can do a little
teasing with some hairspray right now
i'm using my Tresemme freeze and control
ultra hold hairspray I was just kind of
running out what I had before I needed
to get something quick and this has
actually been working all right for me
and then you just need a little pony
tail holder to secure your look so I
will I gather those things up for myself
oh you also need a couple bobby pins too
so I'm going to get that together and
then I will show you how to do the look
alrighty everyone the first thing you're
going to do is if you have any sort of
side bangs that you want to leave out
and you can do that I sort of have my
hair cut in such a way that I do have
some shorter bangs there so you can
either leave that out or you can pull
them back and if you like this kind of a
look or your hair is just like this you
can include it in that in this style and
you know you'll be fine but for this
look I'm just going to actually leave
some L
is how I did it for the wedding and for
amount i'm going to leave about I don't
know maybe two and a half inches worth
of part showing there and behind that
I'm going to just pull back some hair
just kind of a section just like this
from about here to here just the middle
of the very top of my head and I'm going
to pull some of that hair up just kind
of a thin section of it okay so about
that much hair and just going to pull it
straight up spritz a little hairspray
right behind what you've pulled up just
literally like two squirts and then I'm
going to take my rat tail comb and I'm
just going to gently wrap this a little
bit just a few brief strokes there with
the brush and you can see how I've got a
little bit of height there now and so
this height is going to kind of add to
our to the dress eNOS of a look and not
look like our hair has just been pulled
straight back from our face so just kind
of a range that you'll find it when
you're working with such a small section
it's going to be fairly easy to like a
range you know on your head there but
just pull it like a little bit for once
you got that little bit of a poof there
and this is where you're going to take
two bobby pins and you're just going to
secure that by crisscrossing them so
there I've got one and it's under the
whole you know amount of hair that I've
pulled back and now I'm going to take a
second one and just crisscross it right
under and over the top so it's kind of
like forming a little sandwich over that
other one then once you've crossed it
there just give your hair a little bit
of spray and spray the bobby pins as
well so that is somewhat secure and then
comes the updo part of it so you're
going to make sure your hair is all nice
and smooth so take this opportunity to
brush through the rest of your hair and
make sure there is no tangles in it so
it'll be really easy to pull up now
you're going to do is just basically
pull your hair up into a ponytail and
you're going to secure that ponytail
right behind those bobby pins and yes
you can easily do this and make it a low
ponytail but for the purpose of this
being like an updo that could go you
know formal or
every day sorry my bangs are like I
haven't really done those yet so they're
kind of hanging around there but just
pull it up so it's right behind here
right behind your bobby pins and that's
when you take whatever you know an
elastic band that's either you know
black colored or a blond color whatever
you know best matches your hair it won't
show anyway so just get it all secured
there okay and I'm it is secured right
behind my bobby pins and you could leave
this here as a ponytail or we can go
forward with see there's so many options
with this look and that's why I like it
you're going to be able to see this and
do exactly what you want with it now
I've got this ponytail here and if this
work early you would get more of like a
curly updo there but it since it's
straight it's going to look almost more
like a bun I guess and so I'm just going
to get that kind of a range there and I
like it to look a little bit you know
not like the perfect bun but a little
bit messy maybe so I basically just kind
of twisted that into place and I'm
taking this clip and I'm just clipping
it right in the back okay and then you
know kind of move it around and wreak
lip as you feel like you need to to get
it looking how you want and there's my
little bun back there behind my by poof
in my hair and so now I'm going to do my
bangs and to get those in place I just
like to since I have sort of varying
lengths it's kind of layered here I just
tease them a little bit and then lightly
comb them down how I want them and just
put a light light mist of spray here mmm
it's pretty much just so they kind of
hang together seeing like however you
want them to really I mean they can be
nice and loose if you like that look but
otherwise just kind of give them a
little spritz there and if there's any
other areas you feel like you need to
spray that's fine if you want to adjust
your pouf one of these little hairpins
these are available at Sally's or
walmart or anywhere you go early and you
can just stick that right there in your
pouf and feel funny calling it that hood
just stick it in there and you can kind
of a jet
and then definitely spray the back spray
a little gun up there and that is your
look all right guys I almost forgot to
give you a look at what's going on in
the back of what it looks like from the
side and everything so basically yeah
it's just kind of like a little messy
bun and you could if you're you know
skilled and updos and you had a bunch of
curls there and you wanted to kind of
pin them in with bobby pins you could
totally do that as well but just having
that little bit of a poof there before
your ponytail gives you it gives a
little more interest to the look and can
make it look a little more formal at
times than just you know the straight
pulled back ponytail or bun so I hope
you guys like this a quick hair tutorial
and let me know if there's any other
hair style do you like me to show you I
have you know a little bit of knowledge
in terms of different kinds of hairdos
and stuff like that so just please let
me know and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
