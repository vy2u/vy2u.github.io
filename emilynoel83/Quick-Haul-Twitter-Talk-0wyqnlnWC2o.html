Twitter talk video because a lot of
people have said do more Twitter talks
so that's basically where I put the word
out at this when I start shooting so
like just now I put on there hey I'm
taking questions for Twitter talk you
can ask me anything and then at the end
of this video I will answer those
questions so um but first off I have a
quick little ulta hall it's nothing
really major but i just thought i'd
share so I got some of some more of
these I'll or natural lights eyelashes
and I just love this kind of lashes I
like them because they have a lot of
kinds that aren't just long but they're
really dense with line 107 s that are a
little more flared out at the ends and I
I do trim these just a little bit just a
little bit off of them so they're a
little easier to work with when I put
them on but I love how they give my
lashes a really thick look I'm actually
wearing Revlon ones right now but these
are really kind of like getting in there
is my new favorite I do still use my
Revlon precision lash glue which is like
a wand applicator that makes him so easy
to put I also picked up a couple things
from the Ulta brand because I rarely get
ulta brand makeup but they were having
like a buy one get one free deals so I
picked up one of their mineral eyeshadow
duos and the shade is called pink
chocolate so this is the packaging and
it looks like this and as you can see
I've kind of swatched them and the pink
is a really pretty like golden undertone
and then the brown is just brown but
they're really they're really soft I
mean they the color is not extremely
intense on these like I don't know I
don't know really what I was expecting I
just swatch them on my hand there but
we'll see i haven't actually used these
on my eyes yet but um we will see we'll
see how they work and then i also got
one of their tinted lip balms this shade
is in bloom and in just putting this on
i also is just kind of like and she's
kind of average it kind of is a slightly
metallic pink shade i guess it looks
about like that so that's kind of pretty
i'll have to use it a little
once again I'm just I was just kind of
you know how when you get out to the car
and then you get something you open it
up and you like do a quick swatch of it
and see if you like it that's about the
level of involvement I've had with these
products so and then I got one of the
NYX jumbo lip pencils because I love
jumbo lip pencils I think they're like
just a perfect way to combine lip liner
and lipstick because you have the
control of the lip liner but the
creaminess of the lipstick so this shade
is pecan or pecan I don't know how you
how you guys say it but this is just a
nice neutral it's about like it kind of
reminds me of my mahogany lip liner just
in a jumbo lip pencil form and that's
what that looks like so I thought that
it would just work well under you know
lighter shimmery glasses um you know
sort of like just a little bit deepened
up nude I also picked up something that
you probably have seen coming if you saw
my beauty test tube review and that's
the full size of the inner grace this is
actually the perfumed body spritz so I
was kind of I actually put a little bit
on when I first walked into the store I
went right back to the philosophy stuff
I was like I'm gonna try this inner
grace um body spray and so I sprayed a
little on I didn't pick it up to take it
yeah I just kind of was walking around
the store and I kept noticing the scent
on me and I was like oh my gosh I have
to just go ahead and get it and this was
like 25 bucks so I was sort of like uh
seems like kind of a lot for a body
spray but oh it smells so good it really
is just like the the shower gel only
it's a scent that can stay with you you
know the shower gel you wash it off you
don't really smell it anymore but this
is just such a great scent and you do
get a lot you get to 8 fluid ounces it I
right through the checkout they actually
gave me this little set as a free gift
and I don't know I didn't even know that
if there was some kind of promotion if
this was just related to how much I
spent or just buying a philosophy
product that day but either way I wasn't
going to ask any questions yes please
i'll take these and so these are three
minis of the state of grace collection
and these are all the shampoo bath
shower gel the three-in-one
and one of them is amazing grace Colonel
grace is one of them and then pure grace
which is like the soap and water clean
kind of sense so that's nice i thought
it was cute it comes in its own little
philosophy a little mini best looking
for a new little mirror to have here in
my makeup area I think you've probably
seen or I'm not sure my name is one-eye
I have a vanity girl Hollywood mirror in
here so it's a large mirror with lights
on each side and it's not exactly a
mirror you can reposition or put like
right under your face if you want to get
really close up so it's nice to have a
little extra mirror and I found this one
at Ulta the brand is called Karina I
believe ka rin a and this was on sale
for about 12 bucks I thought it was
really cute because it's pink and they
also had just clear ones as well but
there are a few reasons why I like this
first off size wise and this is not
lighted or anything like that but it
does have a regular side and then a
magnified side so I pretty much use the
regular side and part of what I like it
is because i oftentimes do want to pick
up a mirror and get a close look at
what's going on but also you can sit
this right on your table and if you're
trying to like put mascara on or
anything where you want really want to
look down you know in to run into the
mirror or you're doing your eye makeup
and you want to expose this whole area
flat you just turn it back like this it
can be sitting right there on your table
and you're suddenly looking down in and
it's perfect for putting mascara on and
stuff like that so I really recommend a
little mirror on a stand some people
probably have lighted mirrors like that
but if you have a big one or a big
bathroom mirror this can be a nice
little addition to your makeup area and
it looks good in my pink room so I'm
happy with it
alright so like I said Twitter talk it's
a Twitter talking video so I'm going to
look at some of the questions I've
gotten their only mayor says when did
you realize that Tyler was the one ooh
that's a good question that's that's
kind of a deep question here um I feel
like this is like blog TV only not you
know what I mean um well I think that
Tyler and I were actually really good
friends before we even started dating so
it was kind of like if any of you have
been in relationships like that where
you've been friends and then you
transitioned into a relationship and you
know I think you you know you really
like and care about that person but I
think it's kind of a gradual falling in
love with that person you know what I
mean so I just think you know over the
course of going through the rest of high
school and and pretty much all of
college it was toward the end of our
college in our senior year that he
proposed to me just during that time you
just realize oh my gosh can I imagine my
life without this person and you just
can't so it's just kind of like you come
to that realization after years of being
with them that that they are the one and
and it doesn't always happen like you
just wake up out of bed one morning and
think Tyler's the one you know it's just
you you just come to the realization
over time all right love lip gloss 323
says how tough would you consider a
communication program I'm going for
nursing but am considering changing
majors okay so like a communications
major well it depends it depends on what
the course requirements actually are at
the school that you're at but chances
are no matter where you go a lot of
speeches are going to be involved and
for some people public speaking or
speaking in front of a class is like the
scariest thing ever so I mean you may
consider that to be kind of difficult
but if your think you're interested in
communications it might actually be fun
for you I kind of found it fun but it's
I think a communications major or even a
minor alongside another major is hugely
useful because it will open doors for
you and allow you to become better I
think at whatever you turned out to just
become
good speaker overnight so you have to
put work into it and you know it's it's
if you if you do put the work in it can
be hard but it's not impossible for
anybody so I think a communications
major or minor would be great for anyone
out there oh and she follows us up with
a question how hard was it to get a job
as a news anchor and something that I
think people are somewhat misguided in
is the thought that you just get out of
college you say i want to be a news
anchor and bam you're in its really
really more what's more likely going to
happen is that you're going to get out
of college and you're going to get an
entry level job at a TV station for
example i love college thing yeah I want
to be a news anchor nope not how it
works you probably are going to get in
as a sort of an assistant producer or a
producer or maybe a reporter you know
you're going to get your foot in the
door with it with a job like that that
is more seen as entry-level still super
important jobs for the function of a TV
news station but the you're going to be
there before you become an anchor and
anchor is oftentimes seen as a bit of a
position of seniority in the newsroom
and it depends on the size of station
you want to get into if you're going for
a tiny tiny small market station it's
going to be easier to become an anchor
there than it is to become an anchor at
a big station so kind of got to keep
that in mind that it's going to vary
place to place but plan on getting out
of school and taking a job that's going
to be more on what a kind of a get your
foot in the door type of type of job
it's not necessarily that being cut
becoming a news anchor is that hard but
you've got to I think be willing to pay
your dues in a sense and work other
positions show your willingness to do a
lot of different things before you get
into something where you're almost
overseeing that newscast is somewhat and
really got a big picture mentality you
know how is this whole thing coming
together as I read over these stories
does it work does it line up is it makes
sense does it flow those are the types
of questions you can answer with more
experience doing news Xander James says
how do you keep your skin so amazing oh
my god not so amazing but how do you
keep your skin amazing without makeup
for on camera seeing as you're on camera
a lot between news and YouTube um it's
all about taking the makeup off at the
end of the day and taking it off
entirely I um I never skip taking my
makeup off I will never go to bed with
makeup on my face and I always use the
ol a daily facial cleansing cloths if
you've been sticking with my videos ever
since the beginning ever since I was in
college I started using those because I
didn't want to have to deal with washing
washcloths all the time and I swear it
they take off everything you see it come
off on the cloth you can take all your
eye makeup off and keeping your skin
clean at the end of the day getting all
that off there is really important also
you've just got to be in tune with your
skin and you've got a notice when
certain products might be having a
negative effect on your skin there have
been some things that I've used you know
different foundations over time that I
felt like have been the cause for a
breakout you know when you change
certain parts of your routine and then
you start to see a change for the better
or worse in your skin you've got to take
note of that and think this is something
I want to keep using or this is
something i need to stop using you can't
just kind of go around and barely pay
attention to what's happening with your
skin katie joy says do you know how to
knit or crochet no i don't girly girl Oh
147 says what is your favorite food um I
find most of the time almost any time I
could enjoy a big plate of nachos I mean
like if you asked me in the morning if I
wanted nachos or in the evening if I
want to nachos where after I just ate a
full meal do you want some nachos I
would probably say yes guacamole sour
cream cheese salsa so beef anything else
like I got it yep that would be good
well that's about all I have time for
today on the Twitter talk thank you for
sending me your tweets and I hope I
answered your questions well enough
sometimes I start rambling and I'm
really just seeing these for the first
time like I haven't rehearsed or looked
over them until I just like look down at
the screen so it's kind of fun but thank
you for watching have a great day and I
will talk to you again soon
