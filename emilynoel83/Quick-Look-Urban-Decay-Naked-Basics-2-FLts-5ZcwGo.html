tutorial with you from the Urban Decay
Naked basics the second edition of this
palette that's come out recently look at
the shades as you can see lots of matte
in this palette very basic types of
color this is something that I plan to
review but right now I'm just kind of
getting a little more acquainted with
the palette and I do like how these
shades come together to create a very
naturally contoured eyelid and this look
is all about just following your natural
bone structure creating some added
shadows there with the look but it's
very natural and could work for a lot of
different circumstances so here's a look
at how I did it I've already primed my
lids I'm going to go to the second shade
in the palette called stark and I'm
using the all-over shadow brush here
from my new it cosmetics little quad of
brushes and I'm just going to Pat that
shade here all over the lid it's a
really full-coverage matte shadow you
know not sheer it all really brightens
then with that same brush I want to go
to the lightest shade in this palette
called skimp and I'm just going to dab
that right around my inner corner I'm
also gonna take it up under the brow as
well just for a little brightness there
then same brush I'm going to the shade
called primal this is a nice cool brown
and I think it makes a very
natural-looking crease color and this
brush is kind of wedges
there in my crease and I'm just pulling
it on the side to side just really
following the natural bone structure
that's happening here then I'm gonna use
this shade called cover and I'm using
the full like blending side it says
crease actually of this brush I just
want to take this right up above my
crease I like how this color has like a
little bit of a pinky mauve tone in it
and I think it looks really nice as it
just blends right up into your natural
skin tone then I'm going to this matte
really deep gray shade with my smudger
brush actually kind of makes me think of
just a smallish crease brush
but I'm dabbing that shade right here in
my outer corner you can also kind of dab
it there on just the outer part of your
eyelid to make everything kind of work
in together and I'm gonna come back to
this shade again after I do my upper
liner but for now just taking some more
of that again with this kind of larger
size smudger brush and I'm pulling it
down so just really encircling the outer
part of the eye with some really soft
color and then I'll take primal which is
just a little bit lighter and go on
inward with that shade for liner I've
got my Rimmel scandaleyes in nude and
that's gonna go right here on my lower
inner rim and on my upper lash line I'm
using my favorite black gel eyeliner
it's from essence and it's called
midnight in terrace I'm using it with my
Real Techniques fine liner brush which I
also love I always get such a great rich
black line with this so I'm just gonna
take that all across my upper lash line
once I get to the outer corner I am
gonna do just a bit of a wing here then
something I've been loving to do lately
I think it gives the illusion of really
large eyes is when I do a wing coming
down with some powder shadow and kind of
filling in this whole area right here
see how it's kind of like a wide thick
line there leading back down to the
lower lash line and something about it I
don't know it just makes the eyes seem
even more kind of rounded out I'm using
an angled brush going into undone and I
also like how this shade is not like
super black it's just a little more grey
and it just works really nicely for this
kind of thing so I'm just going under my
wing and pulling that down for kind of a
thick line right here if you want to
just blend over that with the smudger
brush you can do that too to finish off
the look I just applied mascara on my
top lashes my bottom lashes and then I
used my ELF dramatic lash kit I don't
love these lashes as is but if I trim
them up enough and shorten the lash band
up in
I can get a decent look with them
finished I look very naturally contoured
and I think what adds the glam is
definitely the winged liner the lashes
ultimately this is a look that can be
done quickly and I think it can fit in
with a lot of different makeup scenarios
different lip colors different cheek
colors
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
