joining me for this video I hope you're
having a great day I just wanted to
share with you a quick trick that I've
been using for about the past couple of
weeks or so with some different pairs of
false lashes sometimes you get them and
you know they look like what you want in
the package but then you put them on
your eyes and you're like that's way too
much you know they're too thick or
they're too long I mean you're you're
often advised to go ahead and trim them
if they're too long but sometimes it
just seems like too much on your eye and
sometimes you can get a more natural
look when the lashes are concentrated a
little bit more on the outside so you're
not seeing because naturally I mean a
lot of us probably don't have a like the
thickest lashes like from here to here
and sometimes false eyelashes will give
that appearance and while it's kind of
pretty and interesting sometimes it's
not always what you want sometimes you
want a little more natural look and
there is a way that you can take lashes
that just maybe are not quite suited to
your eye and still make them work you
know you don't to throw them out just
because they didn't work as is and so
lately what I've done with at least a
couple of pairs in my lashes and I'm
going to do it for you here as well it's
just trim them up and you've got instant
uh you know half lashes sometimes you
can buy those little half lashes like I
think I have a set over here like these
Sonia Kashuk ones that are like I need
to clean them off but they're like half
a shiz you know and this is I'm sure has
occurred to people before but I just
wanted to give you a heads-up in case
you didn't think about it or maybe you
don't have those have flashes in your
store so basically I these are the 130
ones from our dell and they're a little
long to begin with but I'm just going to
make him a more wearable for everyday
type look for me so basically I've got
this set of lashes here and this would
be see if I can hold them somewhere you
can this would be the longer end that
would go more towards the outside of
your eye and this is the shorter end I'm
going to leave the longer end and cut
about a third of these lashes off okay
so I'm just going to take like a little
pair I mean any scissors so obviously
we'll cut but these are just a little
pair of like manicure scissors like
they came with a little nail kit and I'm
going to cut off just a little bit here
of those like i like i said a third or
so okay so once you've cut that off
you've got flashes that are about like
this okay so you can kind of lay those
down and see about where they're going
to come to and you can see okay they're
still kind of thick and there's like a
jump-off point well you can obviously
change that to just by trimming and sort
of tapering tapering that edge just a
little bit so I'm just going to shorten
those so I got to hold it over my desk
here a little bit you know you can
shorten and just kind of clip and trim
in and make them a little more natural
it's like you're practically just giving
them a haircut you know and so I've got
it a little more tapered now get that
off there okay so now you've got them a
little more tapered like that if you
were to put them on and I don't have
glue on them right now but I can kind of
sit them down for you and let you see
about how like they would look and it's
as you can see it's more like
concentrated towards the outer edge and
it just makes him seem a little more
natural but you still got that flirty
like long lash look so anyway that's a
way to just kind of take your false
lashes just trim them up a little bit
and make them a lot more wearable and
like I said it's not that like loan
full--like full strip of lashes aren't
wearable I do that all the time but this
just may make you know a pair that
you've been struggling with a little
bitter just haven't been getting use out
of may make it a little bit easier for
you to use them so again it just takes a
pair of scissors para flow slashes and
just kind of trim them up for shorten
them and I would say you know about this
long you want them to be like the outer
half or you know to two-thirds of your
lid basically and then just make sure
that you kind of taper them down so we
don't have like a jump-off point tour
it's like you can clearly see long
Liza's short lashes you know you want to
kind of ease in
so basically you know if you've seen
them in stores sold on that hath flash
version you know you just kind of cut
them like that and you can kind of cut
into them a little bit as well to make
them not look quite so perfect you know
and that makes them look a little more
natural too so anyway guys I hope this
tip helped you and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
