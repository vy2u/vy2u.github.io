going to show you how to apply concealer
to several different problem areas so
here in this picture it's a little far
away a little out of focus doesn't look
too bad but sure enough there's a sit
there's some under-eye circles some
broken capillaries overall this person
is none too pleased I've got on my
tinted moisturizer here at some eye
makeup but I would typically do the eye
makeup after all my face makeup here is
the cleaning clear person gel I think
this is a good product to treat your
bowl underneath your makeup other
products you might find useful are the
Max Factor pan stick Maybelline cover
stick and elf all over cover Sookie's
creamy concealers are good for blemishes
and also broken capillaries but I think
you'll also want to have on hand out
more liquid concealer like favorite
maybelline mineral power Physicians
Formula circle RX and Maybelline age
rewind these small work very well for
your under-eye circles and and the other
step to concealing is setting it with
some sort of powder I like NYC smooth
skin powder loose powder and where
Revlon Colorstay pressed powder also
have a concealer brush that you reserved
just for powder and when I'm setting my
concealer under my eyes I like to use a
powder slightly lighter than my natural
skin tone so I use family mineral power
finishing fail and light this just
generally illuminates that area
that wants to be a little bit darker and
for the finishing touch of this look
you'll just want to have your regular
makeup on hand that you would normally
use your all-over face powder your
bronzer blush whatever you feel like you
need to use to pull your look together
after foundation and concealer and that
kind of thing so first off step one
concealing a blemish there it is clearly
pointed out for you where that blemishes
that I'm going to be dealing with on my
forehead and so first step I'm going to
use my purse a gel to treat the blemish
before I put any kind of makeup over it
next I'm going to use a creamy concealer
I'm going to use the elf all over cover
stick and I'm just going to use my
finger to dot it on there you could also
use a concealer brush that's fine but
this kind of melts it into the skin then
I am going to use my dry concealer brush
to set it with my Revlon Colorstay
pressed powder so let's get a before
look here yep there it is you can't miss
it with the bullseye around it on my
forehead but after you might not even be
able to tell where that blemish was on
my face obviously this hasn't been
retouched that's just makeup organ for
us here next step concealing under-eye
circles such a common problem here I
deal with it on almost daily basis and
here I'm going to dot on some liquid
concealer the year i use maybelline
mineral power straight from the tube
that little sponge tip applicator i just
dotted it all around the eye area and on
the inside of the nose and i'm just
going to blend that and again with my
finger you could use a brush then i'm
going to set that with the maybelline
mineral power finishing veil little
lighter than my skin tone illuminates
the whole area so once again before you
can definitely tell the dark but
darkness around the nose and under eye
but after it really brightens up the
entire eye area makes you look so much
more awake and alive
so next off sadface we're dealing with
concealing broken capillaries there the
little veins that can sometimes break
along the crease of your nose there so
I'm going to dawn on a creamy concealer
here I'm using the elf all over cover
stick it's great coverage for an area
like this and then I'm going to set it
with the Revlon Colorstay pressed powder
really easy two step process so once
again the before look it's kind of hard
to pick up on here in the picture but
you can see some redness there on the
inside of the nose afterwards it's
bright its Sun not shiny it's not red
it's just how you want it to be so
finally to finish the look good just use
your hope your regular makeup routine
now I go with some powder all over my
face to kind of pull together all those
concealed areas also add some bronzer
for that healthy glow and then you
definitely want to use some blush on the
apples of your cheeks or also as a
contour if you prefer and so let's get
one more before look yep there are a few
problems there there's a few things that
need to be fixed but afterward let your
hair down put on some bright lipstick
finish up the eye makeup and you have
got a look that's ready to go for the
day and one other tip yes I'm soft
lighting will always help any flaws
you're dealing with if you can manage to
stay in soft lighting all day that would
be agreed
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
