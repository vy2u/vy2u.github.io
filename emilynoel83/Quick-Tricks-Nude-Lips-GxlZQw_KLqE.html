show you how to do a nude lips so we're
going to start with fresh clean lips to
get going and the first step is to use a
lip primer I'm using timewise
age fighting lip primer from Mary Kay
and you're just going to smooth that on
your lips just like you would apply a
lip balm just apply it all over you're
gonna wind up with just a nice smooth
finish no sign really but so ever then
we're going to line but we're going to
use a clear liner from Revlon Colorstay
this is just gonna reinforce you know
the line around our lips but since we're
doing nude we don't want really much
color so this isn't going to give you
any and we're gonna go around and inside
the lip as you can see here we're just
putting that all over and once again
just you still have that matte
appearance to the lips now lipstick
covergirl incredible lipstick and grande
is what we're going to use it's a nice
sort of a light golden e bronze nude and
just apply that all over and now we're
starting to see some color and shine
with this look but we've got to use some
gloss and this is Smashbox lip gloss in
a loom it's a nice very very light
peachy nude with a little a little
shimmer and sparkle and we can see the
lips now really starting to look full
and almost talked when when this gloss
is on there but one last step to really
make it work is the savvy diamonds lip
gloss in buff diamond to get it from
Sally Beauty Supply and what we're gonna
just do since this is a very little bit
thicker gloss we're gonna apply it just
in the middle of the bottom lip and
you're gonna see the end result here is
just a really pretty full nude lip and
that color is gonna stay on stay within
your lip since we lined and used a
primer and that is it that's all it
takes to get a beautiful nude lip
