this video I am shooting this at the end
of the day as opposed to the beginning
of the day so the lighting in here is
kind of all different I feel like I'm
looking a little rough because I just
went through a whole day with two kids
under the age of three but something
that I thought I shot on here well I did
shoot it on here but it didn't record
new camera problems so I'm here to tell
you about the things that I got from the
Nordstrom's sale about some
tried-and-true things that I know are
good and got some things that are new
that I kind of wanted to experiment with
with the discounts that you're getting
because I have the Nordstrom card I was
able to take advantage of that early
access but now we're into the sale
opening up for everyone so I will have
the dates and any specifics you might
need down below in the info box and I'll
also link to everything that I've
mentioned here in this video and I'm
going to start off with the makeup items
the first thing thing I was really
intrigued about and I just thought I've
got to try it it was like 98 bucks and
it's this Bobbi Brown Bobbi on trend
eyes and cheeks palette based products
got two blushes a bronzer and a
highlight then on the other side you
have your mirror and here is your eye
shadow palette and you've got a mix of
maps they're shimmer wash formula the
sparkle eye shadows a metallic eye
shadow most of the masks are shades that
exist in her line with the exception of
just a couple I looked on the Bobbi
Brown's website to try to figure out
like which of these shades because
they're all named here right here on the
back to see which ones belong to the
regular line and which didn't so for
whatever reason most of the matte shades
seem to be part of that line and the
rest were new as far as I can tell while
you're getting a variety of finishes in
here the overall color scheme is pretty
cool toned I mean I feel like there's
maybe a couple more warm ish Browns and
stuff but overall there's nothing super
orangie about this so you're going to
definitely easily be able to execute
that smokey eye that's a little bit more
on the cool side
or a brownish one as well you've got a
few splashes of sparkle in here with
this color and this one and this one and
those are kind of this sheer wash of
sparkle and it's something that's really
only going to build up a whole lot on
the eyes if you're topping off more of a
khaki base then over here like I said
got a couple of blushes nectar is part
of her regular
line and this bronzer in medium that's
like the same bronzer I got in a sample
a few videos back that I was talking
about really liked those products so
that's nectar that's the bronzing powder
then you got this French pink blush
which is cooler and brighter and also
this illuminating bronzing powder which
is really going to act kind of as a
highlight today I've got on a little bit
of this nectar blush which i think is
really pretty and those are very
pigmented blushes and they're matte
which I like a good matte blush because
then you can build up the shimmer to
your liking this is a pretty enough
highlight but it really isn't like
knocking my socks off you know I tried
that Amazon palette that was like well
this is a fantastic eye light and so now
I tried this and I just thought it
seemed a little bit dry and it's just
like when you swatch it on your finger
it just kind of fades away and I just
didn't find it building up on my skin
that gray so I know with this palette
being $98 they're still giving you a
deal because you're getting quite a bit
of product in here but do I even think
it's really worth that I don't know just
being able to see these shades in person
and give them a close look they're nice
but they're nothing that I don't already
have right and I kind of feel the same
way about the cheek products you know I
did happen to have this in a small size
really really like that
bronzer product but the pleasures are
anything SuperDuper different and I
didn't really love the highlight how
some people maybe you don't have a lot
of shadows in your collection and this
very neutral color scheme really appeals
to you and maybe you're just a big Bobbi
Brown fan and you know you enjoy this
quality I'm wearing a few of these
shapes today I've got this kind of
shimmery brown in my outer corner I
popped a little bit of this light kind
of vanilla type color on the lid just
did a very quick and easy look just with
a little mascara and it could definitely
go from natural to nighttime dramatic
easily again not really criticizing this
palette too much on the quality except
for the highlight maybe but it's just
knowing where I know now about it I
don't think I would have gotten it
another makeup product that I got is
this lipgloss set from Anastacio and I
absolutely love this on Stassi of lip
gloss formula I don't know how long ago
it was but I will link to it below and I
did a blog post basically declaring this
my favorite lip gloss formula of life
and its really really good as shiny it's
opaque it's not sticky
these are
nice vanilla scent it's a great shade
range overall in the line and it's
probably one of the biggest Emily Awards
oversights I've had to not include these
in my top 10 for lips I don't know how
that happened they totally should have
been in there so now that I told that
rambling story this set I saw it online
and I just I didn't even really
scrutinize what colors were in here I
just thought yes I'm going to pick that
up I'm all about it and now getting it
home and watching all these out it's a
very deep really rich color scheme kind
of a browns and berries and just really
deep tones in here even the nude shade
you know it's kind of one of those
caramel you rich news very very pretty
they've got all the qualities that I
said earlier that I like about these lip
glosses however when you choose a
statement color and have it as a gloss
you're definitely going to have to be
careful about where that gloss is going
on your face because when though these
are great there's still a gloss and
they're not completely foolproof they're
not setting to some budge proof state
you know their glossy I think the shades
are brilliant I really enjoy them but I
guess I feel like I'm saying you kind of
have to wear them with caution you know
and I actually while this may seem to
completely defeat the purpose of a gloss
and then tell you anyway I will blot
these once and because they're so
pigmented like you take away a little
bit of the shine but you've got loads of
color left and it looks exactly like the
finish of a cream lipstick when you blot
one of these on estancia glosses so
that's kind of what I did actually with
what I've got on right now and it's
honestly been about an hour too since i
blotted it so the color has worn down
somewhat but I'm wearing this deep it's
very cold very it's just a shimmer free
deep berry gloss but if you give it that
little bit of a blot I think you'll find
it makes them really easy to wear or
maybe you're thinking no problem I'm not
scared of a deep color and a gloss
format and I'll wear them full-on you do
your thing the first two shades in this
kit I'm really not concerned about it
all is just as you get a little deeper
you just might want to wear them a
little more carefully and then the berry
like I said that I'm wearing now the
only shade with any shimmer is this next
one what's that called maple is the one
that has a little bit of Sheen and
shimmer in there and that's a very
pretty shade that's kind of deep and
then this deep rosy red and also this
deep brown so if you haven't tried this
yet I think you're going to love the
quality of the glosses it's just
I don't know I was maybe wishing for a
few lighter shades in this mix but you
get what you get and it's a good deal on
this set next thing that I got in the
sale is some really good sunscreen this
is the super goop play and it's an SPF
50 water-resistant for 80 minutes
sunscreen it says antioxidant infused
sunscreen minutes with vitamin C and
this stuff is really good I really like
the way it sprays out it's a nice fine
mist that isn't going to build up a lot
on your skin you know you put it on
there and then you just like to rub it
in a bit it makes my skin actually feel
silky smooth and I don't normally expect
anything much out of my sunscreen where
that's concerned I don't know if there
are little light reflecting particles in
this that I can't even see that aren't
even you know visible to the naked eye
but my skin looks so like glowy and
radiant without feeling sticky it's
ultra smooth and just so softening like
if you're just going to put this on and
wear it all day long you would feel
totally comfortable with this so I
thought this was a good deal because it
was buy two get one free so I ended up
paying 38 bucks for all three of these
we really go through a lot of sunscreen
between the pool and you know Tyler
going golfing he can take one of these
in his golf bag I can keep one for pool
use we still got a backup so I think
that's a great thing
now couple of tried-and-true Nordstrom
sale favorites here these are for bub he
told me he wanted me to get some more of
this stuff if it was part of the sale
and I did find it it's the Kiehl's body
fuel all-in-one energizing wash this is
a hair and body cleanser since is 33.8
fluid ounces this is a leader of project
here and I mean he will be running out
at the same time soon bub is a guy who
liberally uses product in the shower he
doesn't really hold back so got plenty
here of that and then I also got into
facial fuel which is the energizing face
wash gel cleanser for men and he's used
this before in a much smaller size so I
thought now he is stocked up he's got
not only his hair and body but also the
face stuff and this from what I remember
him saying this is kind of like a
cooling feel it has a little bit of a
menthol scent to it and then what's the
scent on the body wash here I should
have gotten him up here for this video
and it smells like clean man Penev
outdoorsy but
also a little bit like clean sheets but
this is great stuff if he could only
choose like one product of this kind
this is the brand he would go for so
it's great to find such a good quantity
of product that I'm not going to have to
worry about run into the store and be
like oh he needs another face squash or
he needs another shampoo like it's all
here and he'll have that for a long time
and again as with all this stuff you're
getting a good discount on it when you
get it in this sale now you guys I got a
couple of other cute things look at this
well-rounded diet I had to get this for
even when I thought I thought yes that's
so cute she's in that wonderful like
little six month pudgy got rolls upon
rolls all over her body so I just
thought this would be perfect for her
and she'll look back on that and last
Sunday when she's an adult and then I
really think this could be for you know
Eve now that she's starting to get into
solids more but also bill because she
can sometimes make a bit of a mess but
this super cute did this says make my
day I guess that's the brand baby bib
with pearls it's a food grade silicone
dishwasher safe satellite free PVC free
BPA free it's just got that nice little
pocket down here that will catch the
food that falls down so I know this is
not beauty related but it was definitely
something I saw on the sale but really
appealed to me so some body steps and
makeup steps and kids stuff definitely a
lot of variety in this Nordstrom sale I
didn't really get into the clothes too
much because I actually did a bit of a
clothes Hull on HMS website I had never
shopped on there before and I found some
super cute tops and cardigans there but
that's a whole other story maybe for
another video but this Nordstrom sale
again good stuff definitely a lot of
makeup options beyond what I got I just
gravitated toward one thing that I
really knew about quality wives that I
knew I'd like with the onstott via
glosses and then one thing that was kind
of my wild card which 98 bucks is kind
of a lot to spend on a wild card I will
use it I think it will be good but it's
just I'm just not really jumping up and
down over it so just giving you the
straight facts here thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
