tuning in today we have quite the haul
here from Ulta I'm calling this like a
retail therapy
maybe some bad decision the sort of made
that befall and here's the deal I was
only one grape Arita in when this
happened it was the Thursday night after
Tyler had been away in Vegas for three
days and he was getting back he was at
that legal conference I was on the couch
I worked on this video there was a
massive bug in the house the cupcake
killed if you want full coverage of this
whole situation you can watch the vlog
where this happened and in the midst of
all that activity I may have gotten on
ulties website and I got some things
that I really wanted to try but I also
ended up with some things that they're
questionable they're really questionable
I'm gonna start out with something
sensible that was more village it need I
got some of this duo brush on strip lash
adhesive I haven't been like insanely
proud of my kiss strip lash adhesive the
one that says with a low on the tube
it's okay it gets the job done but I'm
just kind of wondering is there
something better or stronger out there
so I believe I have used this duo at
some point before but now I'm really
ready to you know make that comparison I
got some poor strips the practical
justification here is that I feel like
I've had a lot of breakouts around like
the crease of my nose like you know my
little nostril bump here what do we call
those just I guess they're just nostrils
back in there I feel like I've gotten
some breakouts and I just like without
makeup on looking up really close at my
face I'm like I'm seeing a lot of a lot
of things on the nasal region and I
thought what targets that area better
than a poor strip you know a poor strip
is a very like potentially satisfying
experience you know when the poor strip
comes off you feel like men work has
been done here and so I got some
freaking poor strips but the fun side of
this would be that I got zebra print
ones there's eight of them they're
limited edition and it says tame your
wildest pours okay these look tat so
cute I think there were only maybe a
dollar or two apiece and I got these for
my girls so I guess this might actually
come under the category of a selfless
purchase
they're so cute they say sweet and
shimmer bath sponge I really don't know
how I even stumbled across these usually
I'm looking at like the new makeup
section or the new skincare section
Volta and these caught my eye somehow
someway but they always like take baths
together you know when you got two
little kids you can just lump bath time
all into one lovely experience so I
thought they could each have their own
strawberry sponge they don't smell like
strawberries I'm glad I got those really
there's one thing that's really kind of
silly out of this whole whole and I
think I'm gonna save that for last I'm
gonna make that be the cherry on top of
this whole here's something I got that
I'd really wanted to try and it's the
Milani make it dewy setting spray I am
wearing that today a little bit I think
I'll put on a little more I noticed
instant instant results from this like
with just a few sprays somebody told me
not to try this when I I think it was
around the time that I was really
testing make it last which that one I've
had really good results with I think it
does work well but I noticed a lot of
people weren't really raving about the
make it dewy but if you want to look
dewy like maybe if you've got a dry skin
issue and you really want to finish your
look up with a super dewy look I think
it works so I'm wondering if my skin
type is like changing and here's the
deal if you start drinking a heck of a
lot more water like I'm drinking a lot
of water every day
and I think that's great for me but I'm
wondering if my skin is becoming more
oily as a result I mean maybe we want to
call it hydrated but like I swear my
t-zone is oilier than it had been before
my whole water drinking initiative has
anybody notice their skin type changing
as a result of a lot more hydration
maybe my point here is that I'm not so
sure I need this make it dewy but I'm
glad I finally tried it because I do
think it's kind of an instant dewy
result I don't think I would need to
overuse this or I wouldn't want to
overuse it because you can really see
your skin taking on that dewy appearance
immediately but another setting spray
several setting sprays that I love are
those smashbox once in the fun new
scents like the citrus and the greens
and the coconut those are good speaking
of coconuts I got a little coppery
coconut Milt I had been meaning to get
this I wanted to get it during like
twenty-one days of beauty event and I
forgot this is just a little size and I
thought it might be good also to take on
vacation because we're gonna be
vacationing very soon I thought it might
just work nicely as a body moisturizer I
could use it on the kids as well organic
coconut oil hydration from head to toe
it says so let me know if you've tried
this if you liked it or if you should
just stick to big old jar coconut oil
let's talk about this the weekend
festival palette I was obviously in kind
of a fun mood when I did this haul and
so I went for a fun eyeshadow palette I
looked at this and my initial reaction
was a no not a glance just kind of
scrolling past a website I thought it
it's not necessary and now that I have
it I think this is really fun and
actually very top quality so I did a
look with it today let me show you
I used this shade called ultimate that's
kind of like my little pop right here
I've got a lot of this warm brown in my
crease and some of this shade and this
shade too so they've got like some
really good mattes bright mattes mixed
in with the bright shimmers so sometimes
in palettes like I think brands feel
like their statement shades have to have
some kind of a shimmer or metallic
finish and I love that they realized
that some statement shades here could be
matte I'm going to end up offering a ton
of variety to this palette in that
finish but they gave a nice dark brown
here and this really reinforces my point
the way I did my look today for why I
like having a deep matte in a palette at
least one it's not so I can make like
some really dark fall and winter look
out of something it's simply to allow
those shimmers - absolutely sing I mean
look at that blue look at that bluish
aqua shade happening right there
and because I took that Brown and I kind
of like worked it in and overlapped it I
feel like that blue is really able to
shine and I took some brown on the lower
lash line also I mean it's just part of
the frustration is you know these
pallets this is a 5 10 15 20 color eye
palette and you know they should have
included something dark and matte but
there are a lot of palettes that are
this size and it's like can't you make
room for just something that would give
it but most versatility just a thought
but I'm enjoying this I'm loving
this matte purpley shade over here the
other day I used some of solstice which
looks like it might even be chunky shiny
you know but that's a really pretty rose
so far all I can say is nothing but
success with this guy here and it's fun
and it gives you options and if you
don't want to spend like a ton of money
on a bright eye palette this is good
this is really good then I got very
earthy eyeshadow palette that I've been
wanting so I guess you might call this
practical purchase because I'd had my
eye on this for a long time but I just
it wasn't in stock and it's one of these
makeup revolution palettes that's
packaged this way the other one that I
had used in a video is the one that kind
of looks modern renaissance II with the
color scheme and this one sort of looks
like aa Nastasia subculture to me and
I'm sure in some videos this has been
pointed out as such but I really like
that color scheme I wanted to try it for
myself that kind of grungy olives some
warmth in there as well and these
pallets are only seven dollars I
challenge you to find me a better deal
for that quality and that amount of eye
shadow another couple of eyeshadow quads
that I really didn't need like these
shades are no doubt in this palette like
yes there's some purples yes there are
some teals but I went for these la girl
quads because I have a couple and I
think they're really nice and so I got
the purple one called glamour eyes and
this one called tranquil ice tranquil
eyes I think they meant to play off the
thought of these being like tranquil
tones but actually tranquilizing
something is a whole other situation but
this is what those look like all popped
open for you to enjoy a little Sheen and
darn near everything in this one but
this seems to have like three mats and
one shimmer the shimmer isn't like
intense in all of these but it's there
but really smooth and pretty I'm excited
to do some kind of lilac e lavender like
lighter toned purpley looks that aren't
so deep and plumy I think those are
gonna be fun bring him back the quads I
got this Frank body lip tint and it says
send nudes and there is no joke a little
but are you seeing the but there
honestly nothing says frivolous retail
therapy haul like lip balm spot by a
girl who needs zero lip balm so shade
says send nudes go topless babe
tested on babes okay babe I'm getting a
little turned off by this product just
from the description but the box says
coffee based skincare and it says take a
tint this one's the perfect better than
regular lips color dab on lips for a
soft Sheen I am wearing this and it's
honestly very very sheer and it's also
really thick like I have to squeeze
really hard to get it out of the tube
but sharing it out here on my hand see
how there is just this kind of a peachy
nude sheen the texture is nice it's not
like unbearably thick once it kind of
melts down and works into your lips it
actually feels really good but I did
feel the need to step up the color being
offered just with a little bit of a nude
lip liner this is the l'oreal colour
riche matte in mastermind like the color
just needed a little more strength you
know for me maybe not on a daily basis
like if I'm just going for natural
barely-there makeup I just leave it at
this but with this kind of eye look I
just needed a bit more balance you know
I needed more of a structured list scent
on it is nice it's kind of lightly
fruity but nothing too over-the-top but
I remembered seeing it online thinking
there's a little butt on there like I
don't know I wanted to experiment with
the brand here's another situation where
I got something and this one has a goat
on it this is the Diana Sordi honest
goat milk skincare and it says coconut
cream and let's be honest I got this
partially for the fact that it said
coconut cream partially for the fact
that it had a goat on it paraben free
cruelty free dermatologist tested made
in the USA it smells fantastic they
nailed a soft coconut scent there so
well oh it's good it really doesn't make
me think like fake suntan oil kind of
scent it makes me think of actual
coconut and I was wearing this yesterday
and it was so smooth like it just felt
like a good classic lip balm like the
proper amount of slip the proper amount
of moisture this brand has been around
apparently since 1982 but now they're in
Ulta they're putting out their little
goat lip balms and I am here for it here
is another lip product I got this is
from julep and as you guys know I have
had some great great results with
certain lip products from julep I'm
thinking about their matte liquid lip
colors that go on so well they have like
the perfect applicator and
they have something new called whey
butter hydrating lip shear so it says
luxurious texture with a hint of color
so it's gonna be a more lightweight
sheer lip product but I got it in more
of an out-there kind of shade I got it
in the color Dahlia so let's focus on
the packaging for a moment really pretty
kind of deep sort of the gunmetal color
which a lot of their products have and I
love that but the top it's magnetic
closure and look what happens oh no oh
no I don't want to close that way bam
bam bam it's satisfying I know you think
it's satisfying too okay so we've got a
stick here and it was really really soft
when I first opened it up like somehow
the stick had come off a bit and sort of
stuck to the top so it looks a bit
compromised right there at that end but
it's a really pretty color and now
picture that shear on the lips I'll do a
swatch here for you it's like a sort of
a pink orchid mix it's a nice soft color
like that and it does feel awesome like
it's thicker it's thicker definitely
than like this lip balm for example so
my lips feels really nicely moisturized
when I've got that on I mean staying
power is not amazing but in terms of the
spectrum of lip balms for the thickness
that this has I would say it's better
than most in terms of hanging on a
decently long time on the lips
everybody's different it depends on your
activity level how much are you eating
in drinking stuff like that everybody's
wear down situation it's gonna be
different but it's compared to a
standard lip balm this lasts longer now
two more lip things that I got here are
from la girl and they are called the lip
of thigh stylo one swipe intense creamy
color so I got the shades honeymoon and
brave so one is kind of your Mavi sort
of you know just classic pinky mauve the
other is kind of that watermelon II
poppy color and here's the deal with
these I love that they're a slim
stick lipstick I just really really like
that format I think it's easy to apply I
just love the control that you have and
here's a swatch of each shade they have
like a little bit of shine coming off of
them I feel like they look kind of matte
they're on my hand but they're kind of
like a cream lipstick is the best
comparison but here's the deal and they
put a note about this on the back non
retractable tip
would they make it that way like why
wouldn't they let you kind of you know
go beyond and then twist it back down
kind of like a normal lipstick like
what's the advantage to that maybe some
of you know I'm legitimately asking
there's one more makeup ething here that
I got and it's from Becca and it's the
Hydra mist set and refresh powder so
this is that powder that's supposed to
feel kind of like almost like water
going on very cooling sensation so you
take off the cap and it says keep me
close to keep me cool so we've got a sub
Kat here and I put this on today I
didn't bake with it or anything I mean I
don't think it's really that kind of a
situation here there's a little mesh
like net very stretchy and some products
gonna come out through there just a
little sifter but when this comes in
contact with the skin it does feel
cooling on contact now a product that I
tried like this these lip colors from
Ally does anybody remember when I was
talking about those lip pouting
you put them on your lips and they go
from like a powder to a cream almost yes
I don't sense that it's actually
changing texture that much but somehow
it is feeling cooling and it's becoming
somehow less powdery although I don't
think it's 100% turning into a cream or
anything like that like it can be swept
across the skin with a powder brush I
didn't notice any real transformation in
my look I guess I felt like it was an
experience that felt cool to brush it on
but just to look at my skin after I'd
put it on it didn't look like I had
really perfected my skin a whole lot
more amped up my coverage or anything
like that I'm really curious to hear
your feedback on this product if you've
tried it but I did bake my under-eye
area with my Maybelline fit me today and
then I use this stuff everywhere else
I'm not really sure what to say about
this I think I'm gonna just need to use
it more and just kind of hone in on what
its best purpose is for me but it was an
interesting experience to put it on I
just don't know that it actually
improved my look any and then guys the
last thing I got this I thought this was
really cute okay and I do plan to start
taking more baths this is the peach
sangria Bath ficers in here these little
cubes and it's in a fun little cup that
says cheers to the weekend I can tell
even without unwrapping this that they
smell awesome
but why did that grab me that just I saw
it and I just thought yes I'm not
normally buying a lot of like Bath &amp;amp;
Body stuff these days but it just
instantly spoke to me I'll try it and
I'll let you guys know if these baths
fizzers are really good and if the cup
is really awesome too and maybe you want
to pick this up as a Mother's Day gift
or something but yeah guys that is my
that's my retail therapy hall filled
with some practical purchases and some
questionable decisions what am I most
excited about here I really am digging
this BH festival palette I can't wait to
put on a zebra print poor strip at julep
with the magnetic closure oh dear Lord I
hope next time I'm in a waiting room
I've got this in my hand guys thank you
so much for tuning in today I hope
you're having a great day and I will see
you again in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
