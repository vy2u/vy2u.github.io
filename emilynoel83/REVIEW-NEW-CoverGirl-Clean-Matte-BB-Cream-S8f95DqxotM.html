quick review on the new covergirl clean
matte BB cream I got mine from Ulta
actually ordered it from ulties website
I have it in the shade light/medium and
it does come in a range of 6 shade that
goes from fair to deep which is a little
bit more diverse I would say than some
BB creams from the drugstore and I got
mine for between eight and nine dollars
and size-wise you are getting one fluid
ounce it's pretty much CoverGirl's
standard squeezy tube that they've done
with other products as well this BB does
not contain any SPF but it says it is
oil-free won't clog pores suitable for
sensitive skin and less all-day those
are just the claims here on the bottle
so in this video I'm going to definitely
address application coverage staying
power and compare it to a couple of
other both high-end and drugstore BB
creams that I see some similarities with
and just kind of let you know what comes
out on top but overall just in terms of
application with this product I was
pretty impressed from the first time
that I put it on because I thought okay
this is about a medium coverage and
that's not just medium coverage on some
BB cream or tinted moisturizer scale
that's pretty much you know considering
the way foundations go on this is kind
of like a medium coverage foundation but
it still has the feel and kind of the
slip and the consistency of a
moisturizer I have applied at various
ways I've used Beauty Blender type
sponges I've used my fingers and also a
more dense brush like this and I think
any of those methods really can work but
if you're interested in really
maximizing the medium and buildable
coverage that this product has I do
think a dense brush works really nicely
so in this video I used my Sigma f80 and
about like a large pearl sized amount of
this product and I just dotted it all
over my skin and then blended it in kind
of buffed it in with this brush and it's
very easy to blend you don't have to
work too quickly because like I said
there is that kind of moisturizer
element to this product that doesn't
allow it to set too quickly on your skin
so you do have time and then if you want
to you can add a little more product and
actually build coverage in
certain areas and it doesn't look too
apparent you know it doesn't look too
heavy on the skin but you can see the
matte effect I think immediately after
the product is applied one of my biggest
issues though with this product is that
it's got that BB cream name and it also
does not contain SPF many BB creams on
the market I feel like have been capable
of you know combining some SPF you've
got that moisturizer element you've got
that foundation like coverage and you
know you've come to expect that you
won't need all those different layers on
your skin separately so with this you
know well I do feel like it can have
adequate moisture for my combo type skin
as is I still need the sun protection so
I always put something under this lately
it's been my Kiehl's ultra facial
moisturizer with the SPF 30 I just want
you to know I'm not applying that out of
necessity for extra moisturizer extra
hydration in my skin it's just kind of
what needs to be done if I want some sun
protection after I get this on then I go
in with an under eye corrector like
benefit erase paste dab that on my
darkest areas and maybe use more of a
standard concealer on other areas if I
need it in this video you're seeing the
Maybelline age rewind and newtralizer
just blended that out with my Sigma P 80
brush I didn't have a dampened Beauty
Blender handy at the moment otherwise I
typically would use that and then in
terms of setting powder as I've been
testing this product out I've tried to
keep the setting powder very very
minimal so I will set my under eye area
and I will apply it like just you know
around the nose area and that's pretty
much it for the powder and that kind of
takes me right into the staying power
discussion with this product it does a
really good job and I don't have the
oily skin ever but my nose can be a
problem area you know for combo type
skin you guys know that's generally
where something will start to break down
and I haven't seen that any time I worn
this product and just the other day I
was wearing it more outdoors I was
sweating a little bit definitely around
my hairline but I didn't see this
product get too terribly affected by it
I think it's a matter of really
understanding where are your problem
areas where are your oil prone areas
and you know cover those with some sort
of powder it doesn't have to be any
certain powder even I've had all day
successful where with this product
whether I've put Milani multitasker on
top my Chanel double perfection Lumiere
or L'Oreal True Match and like I said
I'm not doing an all-over face powder
mask but I'm just doing it pretty much
on my nose maybe a little on the
forehead if you have really dry skin I
don't know that this product is really
geared toward you to begin with and
you're probably going to want to go
toward one of those BB creams it has a
little bit more radiance infused but I
think the oily to combo people are the
ones who are probably going to see the
best look overall on their skin which
the finish is not too heavy it doesn't
look too makeup II keep in mind this
still kind of has a consistency of a
tinted moisturizer type product but it
definitely does do some mattifying and
can get me through a day now a couple of
other BB creams that I have to kind of
pull into the conversation because I
know I've talked about them quite a bit
one that's very comparable is this
Rimmel BB cream the 9 and 1/2 skin
perfecting super makeup I have this in
the shade light and this has always been
one that I've praised for the coverage
and just the overall look on the skin
and this also manages to have
broad-spectrum SPF 25 so automatically
you know this one if we're talking
drugstore BB creams this one definitely
hits the mark for me I know they have a
matte version that I haven't really
played with too much I did not like the
radiance version of this BB cream the
one with the blue cap has just always
been a go-to for me
so if I'm in the drugstore you know I
think this is good you know it's
definitely got its redeeming qualities
with the staying power and the nice
coverage but if you can pack in a little
SPF it definitely kind of takes it up a
notch and then just to compare coverage
wise to the it cosmetics CC Plus this
has an SPF 50 and this has amazing
coverage whereas the Rimmel and the
covergirl are more like a straight-up
medium coverage this goes more toward
full coverage so I really like that
about this product it's got the perfect
amount of moisturizer in it I definitely
don't need to even consider really
adding that extra step or extra layer
onto the skin and the staying power is
really good for me they now have the
illumination option they also have a
bronze type option but if you are pretty
adamant about sticking with the
drugstore price range I would
with the rimmel BB cream and then this
one you know it's got a lot of good
things going for it if it can get that
SPF in there it would be much more on
par with some other BB creams that I've
used thank you all for watching and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
