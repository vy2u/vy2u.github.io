bringing you another drugstore review
today because I've got a product I
mentioned it in the hall and I just
wanted to follow up with you and let you
know how it ended up working out because
I had a really good hunch about this
judging by the swatches and turns out it
is really good it's this L'Oreal pocket
palette they're calling these the pocket
ballots I mean they're quads right but
they seem to be a different formula from
some of the other L'Oreal eyeshadow
products that are out there I have some
of these color riche quads many of them
I do like but I would say the overall
shadow quality in these is a little more
hit and miss these the formulas seems to
be very soft kind of velvety doesn't
kick up too much fallout when you stick
a brush into it but it really like hangs
together and these can potentially build
up a very full color look on the eyes
and most of the quads seem to have a
variety of finishes in them as well but
this is also a different formula from
their larger skinny palettes I think
they're called look palette nude I did a
video on those when it's more neutral
brownish one it's a little more plumbing
those aren't terrible palettes by any
means but if they were filled with this
kind of formula I think people would
have been a lot more impressed by those
so in my haul video I showed you this
quad in French biscuit and it really you
know just by the swatches I thought okay
these feel really really nice we'll see
how they perform on the eyes I did a
look with them and I thought yes they
are the real deal you know they transfer
onto the eyes nicely he's top two shades
go on with kind of a matte finish the
shimmers are equally nice and you will
be seeing a demo by the way with this
palette I mentioned I was probably going
to do a tutorial with it and I didn't
want to leave you hanging on that so
that is the quad that I'm wearing today
but I was thinking like if I do a video
just on this quad what if people go and
check out the others and they turn out
to suck you know what if I randomly
found the best one of the lineup you
know that was kind of in the back of my
mind and I think lip gloss Leslie had
commented on that haul video saying she
got one of the blue quads and it wasn't
so good so I went to Walmart and I
didn't get any other boys I couldn't
remember specifically which blue she had
and they
severals so I stay away from blues and I
got three more and tried amounts watched
them and yes they are every bit like
what I experienced with this quad and I
mean I got a little D or five color
palette recently this texture in these
quads is better than this and I don't
know considering the price difference
that's really saying something but like
I said they managed to have a soft feel
without being completely unmanageable
and going everywhere when you put a
brush into them you know I will be the
first to say I love wet and wild eyes
shadows but you know when you get into
some of their darker shades they can be
tricky to use because they're just so
intense and with these I just find a bit
more ease of use there's no struggle
getting them to translate onto the eyes
and getting them to show up true to
color the texture is such that I feel
like when I put a brush into it I get
just the right amount on not too much
and it just turns out to be a really
easy pretty effortless look on my eyes
now having said all that these are a
little more pricey you know than a wet
and wild palette they were eight dollars
and change from Walmart which that price
isn't vastly more than you know what
you're gonna pay for other little
drugstore eyeshadow palettes but I
really do feel like they're worth it I
think the textures are enjoyable easy to
work with but without talking too much
more I want to show you close-ups and
swatches of all of these palettes so I'm
going to start off with the French
biscuit the first one my introduction to
this line and you are getting a couple
of shades that are matte there's a matte
peach a matte like a true caramel a
color and then you've got a metallic
shade that after application I realized
this is a little bit cooler on the eyes
and then a gorgeous shimmery charcoal
and that sparkle really will translate
onto the eyes it's beautiful shade then
I chose to get this quad called boudoir
charm and this one does seem to have all
shimmery or at least satin finish type
shades in it and I kind of wish there
wasn't that but seeing them all swatched
out I can tell that some of these will
be perfect one shadow looks the light
kind of peachy champagne doesn't have a
lot of shimmer to it but then you've got
kind of a
steeped brownish-red a deep bronze and
also a nice neutral deep brown next up
if you're a lover of Urban Decay Naked 3
any kind of rosy pink type shades you
might like this avenue de Rosas palette
this one does have two matte shades one
of them is a creamy very light pink the
other is your deepest shade which is
like a very rich burgundy and in between
you've got a soft kind of dusty satin
finish pink and then more of a true
shimmery pink and because I wanted to
see how well their brights performed I
got the purple quad and violet amore
this one seems to contain one fully
matte shade and that's the deep dark
plum the lightest shimmery purple does
remind me a little bit in tone of the
infallible single and burst into bloom
which I love but it's not quite as
pigmented as that I think this will be a
pretty shade like packed on top of a
primer or you know some sort of base in
a gorgeous true purple then yet another
tone of purple that reminds me more of a
lavender but kind of like a deepened up
let happen and just to show you one of
these in action I will demo the French
biscuit shade first off I put Milani
eyeshadow primer all over the lid that I
always do and then I took the matte kind
of caramel a color with my Sigma e25
brush just got that going in the crease
it's a beautiful perfect crease color
and then I took the matte peach and I
first off just sheared that out under
the brow for a little color there and
then I took the sponge tip yes you can
use the sponge tips I hate to see people
beaten up on sponge tips but you can
just dab that right on the center of the
eye and look out full coverage this
shade is and then I wanted to do
something a little bit different get out
of my normal pattern of shadow
application so I took my little Sigma
firm shader went into the bronze II
shade that does have some shimmer this
is a little bit cooler a little bit
different tone than the other Brown in
this kit on the eyes and I patted it
both on my outer corner and inner corner
of my eyes to kind of give the lightest
pop in the center of the lids and I
applied a black liquid liner across the
upper lash line black pencil in the
lower inner rim and also smudge that on
the outside and then I took this great
sparkly charcoal and just kind of dead
that on the lower lashline smudged it
out a little bit it's beautiful it can
create a great smoky eye you wanted to
take that kind of shade and just really
press it onto the lid I think you'd see
a lot of that sparkle and then I just
finished the look with mascara top and
bottom I put on my huda beauty Samantha
lashes which I now have trimmed it to
the right spot so they really hit my eye
in the right way oh yeah very very
pleased with that look I'm excited to
get some use out of these other quads
and the boudoir charm like I said you
know it seems to be all shimmer but not
everything is super metallic in that
shade so I still think it's gonna be a
nice little versatile quad and it has a
lot of versatility and that I think
three of these shades could be nice one
shadow looks in other words just enough
shimmer to be worn both all over the lid
and into the crease and look like a bit
more complex look than just one shade
but you know you only use one trait the
avenue de Rosas I love these kinds of
tones and I do think that that dark deep
dark burgundy is probably gonna shear
out to be something very beautiful and I
think I'm gonna have a blast with this
purple quad - so who knows maybe I'll be
back for more tutorial let's just wanted
to give you a little update that there's
some great quality shadow quads out
there in the drugstore thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
