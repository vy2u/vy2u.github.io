today let me tell you this I have been
using a lot of highlighters lately I've
had this idea here and there to review a
certain category of products that are
bestsellers from certain retailers I
started looking around ulties website
and when I got to the highlighters I
thought wow I have only tried one of
these five best-selling highlighters so
I bought a mall I've been trying them
comparing them against one another and I
think it's very interesting to talk
about the bestsellers because I think by
default usually on websites like Ulta
and Sephora if you just go to a certain
category of makeup you're automatically
going to see what they want to display
is the best sellers so these products
are getting like the most visibility on
the website but are they really like
top-notch or who are they for and what
I've tried here I've got two that I
really like I've got one that I'm kind
of in the middle on and I've got two
that I didn't go for so much and my
descriptions on these and my explanation
of the experience I had may lead you to
any number of these highlighters if you
have different preferences or just
different expectations for a highlighter
you know then I also want to say that I
bought these probably three weeks ago
was when I would have placed the order
on the website and when I was just
looking at the best-selling highlighters
Ahnold his website yesterday these were
all in the mix very much so I got this
Urban Decay afterglow palette and this
is a palette of four different
highlighters and before I even got my
hands in it you know how it's always
tempting as soon as you get something
what does this shade look like what does
this shade look like with highlighters I
think swatches can be very deceiving
definitely more so than they are with
eyeshadows because with an eyeshadow
there's always the chance that you're
going to pack that shade on to the level
that you might see in a swatch but with
highlighters
I'm usually you know sheer in that stuff
out wearing it way lighter so as I was
initially playing with these I really
wanted to just see how does it apply on
the skin and then will swatch him later
and we'll see how that goes but I really
was not impressed with the way these
went on the skin I thought this NSFW
shade here like on my finger yeah it
looks like kind of a pretty rose gold
but on the skin I could hardly make that
show peroxide
here's this pink color and something
about that tone and I will have another
pink highlighter that I'll be mentioning
in this video but this just kind of
looks powdery it looks like product
sitting on the skin know how some
powders can practically even appear to
melt into your skin even being a powder
they've got enough like pigmentation and
real glow enos about them they just kind
of work into the skin and that one
seemed to be kind of sitting on top this
shade called side piece here now this
might be very flattering on a deeper
skin tone on my skin I can't make like a
true gold highlight work if it's a real
light gold if it's verging on like a
golden champagne color yeah that can be
fine this again it stands out on the
skin for the wrong reasons on me and so
I wasn't a fan of that in contrast this
color called bliss this can work for me
this I thought was bright enough it was
shiny enough I thought it had a nice
wearable finish on the skin and I was
impressed that none of these
highlighters seemed to be packed with a
bunch of glitter because did anybody
remember was it like two Christmases ago
Urban Decay had like a highlighting trio
and it was just a big glitter bomb I
don't know that I saw a single positive
review for that on YouTube this is not
that kind of thing you've got a series
of soft shimmers here but if I'm only
really gonna be impressed by one out of
four I don't think that's a good deal
just my opinion also I'm comparing this
to other things that I'm gonna be
getting to here that I think just
absolutely not my socks off here's the
other thing I didn't really go for but
maybe some of you would if you really
like this tone it's this Too Faced
highlighter that's in like jewelry box
kind of look here and it kind of looks
like a diamond now you might be able to
tell with the light bouncing off of that
that this has a very cool tone to it it
actually has this sort of blueish Sheen
on my skin I like that this is actually
somewhat soft it's not a bunch of
glitter it honestly doesn't come off too
metallic on my skin to work but it's
just a tone that I don't really find
super flattering on me the upside to
this one might be the fact that if you
do like that tone that gets very very
cool not so much in a purpley sense but
actually downright just tipping on blue
a little bit if you're looking for
something like that that doesn't have
ridiculous Sparkle and chunkiness and
stuff like that which I have seen
and other highlighters that seemed to go
this direction they think like okay if
you want this shade you want it to be
just wacky and filled with all these
flecks of everything I mean this is not
that it seems to actually be a decent
formula just in a tone that's not super
flattering on me and then in addition to
that the packaging is very bulky now I
want to tell you about the thing that I
believe was the top seller it was the
first one listed on the website and for
me it's kind of in the middle in terms
of these highlighters and it's the
amrezy highlighter from anastasia
beverly hills look at that I mean it's a
beautiful presentation here in the
packaging is it not the way they've
created that sort of ripple is I think
absolutely perfect for showing off the
sheen of a highlighter the tone on this
like I immediately think of like bright
gold it's not a brassy really yellowish
gold like that one shade I was pointing
out in the Urban Decay quad this is a
really like light bright champagne e
gold and just as far as tone goes I
think that's awesome I will say compared
to other Anastacio highlighters like the
ones that are sold in the for pan
palettes this does have a little bit
drier feel to it and a more like
straight-up
metallic look like to swatch this it
really looks like a metallic eyeshadow
it's that opaque it's a very serious
highlighter like you want to highlight
to the gods and this gets the job done
for you for sure I'm kind of in the
middle on it because I do think I have
to be careful with this this metallic of
a highlighter like doesn't always look
the best like right up in this area here
on me or maybe right up above my
eyebrows where I got like little fine
lines coming through it can show off
some of those issues so you have to use
it very lightly and I'm talking real
life here okay because this can look
phenomenal in a picture it can like
bounce off the skin and be so beautiful
like if you want to look highlighted it
can absolutely achieve it in the real
life face to face looking up close at
yourself in a mirror sense I don't think
it's the most flattering
now here's another highlighter that was
among the top 5 best sellers it's the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector and
there wasn't any one particular shade
pointed out in this but if you're not
familiar there's a whole range of these
you got champagne pop you've got opal
moonstone all different kinds something
that I wanted to get individually that I
didn't have
Sonia is the shade called pearl and I
see comments from a lot of people when
I'm on the topic of highlighter saying
like I am the fairest of the fair skin
even something that looks champagne e
gold is not gonna be light enough to
have a profound highlighting effect on
my skin and so in trying these products
I thought I'm gonna get pearl and see
how that goes and this absolutely I
would think if anything works on fair
skin it would have to be this shade like
you see how potentially bright that can
be and the finish of these oh it's so
smooth it's got a little less of a
metallic look than the amrezy one it's
slightly softer than that it kind of is
more capable of being buffed into the
skin and that technique can really
benefit a product like this this is like
super intense this tone and this formula
can look very very pronounced on the
skin if you still are wanting that level
of brightness but something that's gonna
be an even softer take on the skin a
little more friendly maybe two fine
lines and texture on the skin you might
look into the liquid shimmering skin
perfecter option because that is like
undetectable sneaky sneaky but really
effective glow and it always manages to
look a little softer than the powder
versions of these highlighters but I
can't argue with the quality and if
you're someone who just struggles to get
a highlighter to look right on your fair
skin I think pearl would absolutely be
the way to go now my number one thing
here that I tried in terms of best
selling highlights on altas website is
this sugar glow kit from Anastacio these
glow kids are huge by the way I've owned
one other one of these I think I'm the
Sun dipped one but this is definitely my
favorite thing that I've tried in terms
of anastacio highlights and it's my top
one out of all this stuff now you've got
four big pans of product here they are
point to six ounces each 7.4 grams
compare that to one Becca highlight
which is just 7 grams and point to 5
ounces so they've beat them out even a
little size wise but you're getting four
and this whole thing is going to be $40
whereas one Becca shimmering skin
perfecter is gonna cost you 38 so from a
value perspective this honest hacia
palette has everything like completely
beat and I also love everything since
but real quickly I do want to mention
the cost of the others the amrezy one is
28 this two-faced one is 34 I feel like
that's really overpriced and the Urban
Decay one originally 34 currently marked
down on sale on altas website 217 and I
still wouldn't pay that for it but back
to this Anastacio sugar set everything
in here is 100% wearable to me this
product is kind of a lesson to me in you
can't judge a highlight necessarily by
what you see in the pan because like
this color called gumdrop if you're
looking up close at that that has a lot
of sparkle I can see bits of shimmer it
comes off like a really pinky but
instead of looking like a thick pink it
looks like this beautiful pinky sheen
that I put right over where I have my
blush right here on the apple of my
cheek I've got gumdrop I can't see a
Fleck of glitter it just looks like it
gave my blush the most beautiful sheen
right there and I am wearing the Mac
Patrick Starr this shade right here
underneath that highlighter just gave
the cheeks the most juicy look also
let's talk about starburst starburst
right here gives an absolute like dewy
Sheen to the skin it looks peachy in the
pan but it's not a super far cry from
the brightness of the Becca pearl you
know and so I've got that starburst
shade on the tops of my cheeks here and
I mean I put it on lightly so it has
potential it has a range and something I
love about all of these Anastacio
highlights I feel like unlike the amrezy
these are softer I feel like I'm capable
of achieving a more natural look on my
skin with these and the brush that I
like to use it's the Mota highlight and
glow brush I got mine from Walmart and
see how it's just a really good size to
pinpoint an area but then you kind of
buff over it works really well on this
side of the palette what we have is a
more golden take on things butterscotch
worn sheer more lightly on the skin I
feel like achieves a very similar look
to what the amrezy does there's a little
more depth in this shade but it can
still highlight my skin tone for sure
and it's like by the time the a more
easy one and by the time that one gets
sheared out they look really really
similar only in some strange way that I
can't fully describe to you this ends up
looking more natural on the skin
I think there's somehow a little more
creaminess in these powders something
about the texture of the product I think
is what it is and then marshmallow looks
really really light from a distance but
unlike pearl this goes to a very golden
II place so a soft gold very soft gold
but it's not like how pearl was just a
straight-up like a white pearl this
definitely had some golden tone to it
and I do think marshmallow and
starbursts can be equally bright and
kind of bouncing off the skin but yet
the textures are so good and so capable
of being worn and to look kind of
natural and I'm sure I'm preaching to
the choir on this because I don't think
this is brand spankin new I think this
one is a best-seller for good reason for
40 dollars you're getting four fantastic
highlighter products in big sizes to me
this is my clear favorite I do love the
Becca shimmering skin perfectors but
from a value perspective unless you're
like needing a really specific shade of
this I don't think it can compete with
the Anastasio you're getting like four
and one there now this a BH highlight
the amazing collaboration profound
profound highlight is beautiful it's
hard to not make it look really metallic
on your skin I would skip the Urban
Decay afterglow and unless you're really
looking for that specific tone that's
the Too Faced is giving you I'm not a
huge fan of that one so that's my little
review roundup yeah it's on the top 5
best selling highlighters from Ulta I'd
love to hear what you think if you've
tried any of these and thank you so much
