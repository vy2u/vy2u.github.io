sets but this time they are from Mac and
I was not sent like some huge package of
Mac holiday stuff from the company but
when I saw that this nutcracker suite'
collection released online I just
decided to order the ones that seemed to
appeal to me the most the ones that I
really thought I would have the best
luck with and then I thought I'll try
them out and I will give my full
feedback here on my channel so one of
the things I got was an eyeshadow
palette I also got one of the 3-piece
mineralized sets and also a lipgloss and
all of these things came in like a
little coordinating box so this is what
the eyeshadow palette looks like and
then the outer box had polka dot CI
palette that I got is called the
nutcracker suite' smokey eye compact
eyeshadow x 9 and how much was this
puppy this was 39 50 on Mac's website
comes with nine shadows and then the
double-ended brush and I just you know
at a glance thought hey this could be a
really workable really universally
acceptable eyeshadow palette sadly I
don't think the quality is there and I
have tried other Mac palettes that I
really enjoy one that comes to mind is
their warm neutral palette that's one of
the pre put together
Big Mac palettes that gives you
full-size shadows and I've really liked
that I've been using it a little bit
more recently and enjoy it totally here
I feel like the quality is kind of all
over the place before I get to the
shadows you are getting a double-ended
brush one end is labeled 213 se and this
one is kind of like a brush you could
use in your crease a little bit but it
has such a taper down the side it also
can work for packing shadow on the lid
but it's a very petite brush and I do
kind of like to have that and then the
other is the 214 SE and this looks like
more of a classic smudge brush on the
other end so happy with the brush
actually and that's something I may
continue to get use out of even outside
of this palette as far as this palette
goes and the matte and shimmer balance
here and a third of it is shimmery your
first two shades right here have shimmer
and then this kind of peachy color very
shimmery as well everything else these
- and then these four at the end are
Matt of my favorite shades in this
palette really like these couple of
colors right here that are kind of like
a soft warm brown and then a little bit
richer warm brown I enjoy both of those
I thought they were soft and nicely
pigmented I also like this shade right
at the end called toodaloo I love that
phrase as well and that color I thought
was really pretty highlight these two
mats right here are okay they're nice
ish for a soft crease color but they
don't have a lot of impact on me and
this shade way at the end of the palette
this is called licorice Lane it's a
matte and I thought this had a nice
softness to it but there were several
shades that really disappointed me as
well I thought these two shimmers right
here and this second one is called
deception and I thought you know where's
the intensity with this I had to build
this up quite a bit on the eyes and I
just thought it wasn't delivering and
then this color here is called dew drop
and I thought this was so very flaky
should have had a lot more like hang
together NISS when you pick it up on
your brush and pack it on the eye I
thought it should have been capable of
so much more also really disappointing
shade here called dance in the dark it's
the second one to the end here looks
like the darkest one in the palette it's
like a near black just to look at it in
the pan and I have that shade in the
warm neutral palette and i swatched that
side-by-side with this it's like they're
totally different things so one of the
warm neutral palette is kind of creamy
rich nice to work with this one is dry
hard to build up hard to blend I ended
up using that for my smoky eye look that
I've got on today and I thought how you
know how long is it going to take for me
to build up this shade think you're
getting the picture that I don't think
this palette is worth the 3950 price tag
I think if you want a really nice
quality Mac eye palette I know it's more
expensive but I did really enjoy their
warm neutral color selection I've done
some gorgeous looks with this palette
and great consistency and quality and
that one too this one I just thought was
today I thought I would go classic
smokey eye for you it is called the
smoky eye palette so first off I did use
an eye primer but it didn't do me much
good when I started to pack on deception
and
said I just didn't feel like I got
enough color payoff with this shade put
it all over the lid into the crease to
get some kind of base color happening
and then I packed on dance in the dark
over most of the lid outer corner up
into the crease a little bit and I just
felt like I was working with this shade
forever it really took a lot to build up
to what I got and while the end result
of that shade was okay there are many
colors that I could get from other
palettes that wouldn't have taken that
much work then I took one of my favorite
shades in that palette which is Swiss
chocolate and I blended that up over the
edge of my dark color and I thought that
gave a nice little bit of warmth and I
used the lightest shimmery shade as my
highlight under the brow and also around
my innermost corner I applied some black
liquid liner and I lined my lower inner
rim with black and kind of smudge that
on the lower lash line and then I
smudged some more of dance in the dark
down there I also used a little bit of
Swiss chocolate again kind of smudging
over the entire lower lash line finish
the look with mascara top and bottom and
some demi whispies false lashes and I do
feel like I have a totally workable
acceptable smoky eye at as far as the
finished result goes I just thought the
application was a lot more tedious than
it needed to be for as basic as the
shades are as common as these kinds of
colors are in palettes these days
evidently my least favorite part and
probably biggest regret as far as what I
purchased on the brighter side the next
couple of things I did enjoy one I think
even a little bit more than the other so
we're going to go to my like
second-place item here and this would be
the lip gloss kit for $35 and I think
the packaging here is really cute it is
kind of a solid plasticky box you've got
this little like knotted knob and you
can pull out the product there and there
is a tray there's like a plastic insert
tray that can come out so you can
continue to use this box for other
little things like I'm picturing it it's
a little jewelry box or something I do
think the design is cute by the way I
haven't really talked about the overall
look of the collection but shades of
Plum hot pink gold black the overall
look of things does appeal to me and the
look of the lip glosses the way that
packaging turns out too low
on the tube and everything I think it's
really cute but the lipgloss set that I
chose is the red lipgloss kit so as you
can see you're getting four shades here
and two of them have shimmer one is
actually a dazzle glass and then the
other three are labeled as creme Sheen
glass and I'm not like the biggest most
knowledgeable mac cosmetics person I
mean I feel like I've tried my fair
share of things here and there as far as
the little bitty nuances of all these
different formulas I still feel like I'm
kind of learning but what I have noticed
in my experience with matte lip glosses
is that I really do like the cream Sheen
glass formula a little bit better than
just the standard lip glass the lip
glasses I find to be rather sticky just
bordering on like you know I can
tolerate them and especially if it's a
shade I really like I'll wear it sure
fine they Virge I'm feeling a little bit
heavy and annoying for me I feel like
the dazzle glass in this kit which is
this shade and has more of the lip glass
feel but my other three are all cream
sheen glasses and they all have this
kind of comfortable just enough
thickness to them to stay on the lips
and not really concerned about them
drifting outside my lips I've worn these
brighter shades and haven't had a
problem with that I just find that
formula a lot more comfortable and let's
face it less annoying to wear on my lips
but back to the dad so blessed this is
the first one I tried on for you it's in
the shade called well it's spelled pho
FF I guess it's what I'll say oh it has
an exclamation point
and I put that on all over my lips and
it's just you know this really extra
shiny looking gloss because there is
some sparkle and shimmer in the shade
but it's still overall like just kind of
a clear color then we have two shades
that are very creamy one of them is this
pink called galaxy rose and I thought
this was a very pretty shade I felt like
the color was somewhat buildable I mean
we're not talking about liquid lipsticks
here these are lip glosses so you're
going to find that if you apply a little
bit more you can get a little more
opaque look on the lips but either way
when I've worn these shades more sheer
if they've just kind of like died down
and started to fade a little bit from my
lips I never thought they really look
streaky then you got this creamy cherry
red called gumdrop really pretty shade
brings a lot of life to the face that
being said I do feel the need to be a
bit more careful
about wearing brighter and darker colors
on my lips in a glossy finish you just
got to watch him a little bit more and
then the final shade is called courting
chic and this is a deep red with golden
shimmer not like deep darkest dark red
but it is definitely the deepest of the
collection and then it's got that added
bit of glimmer II bits and it looks
gorgeous when freshly applied as that
shade wears down it's not so pretty to
me because I feel like in situations
where glosses have this sparkle as color
leaves your lips but that sparkle stays
on I just don't like that look so much
so I think what I come away with here
are pretty shades that I will wear and
get use of from time to time you know I
think the dazzle glass is probably my
least favorite feel on the lips the
other three the cream Sheen glasses feel
quite nice as you've heard while the set
itself
I feel mostly good about there are a few
cons here as well and I think to other
lip kits that I've tried you know bite
has had a couple about standing ones
this season also really like the sephora
favorites give me some bold lip kit
things like that as far as lip kits go
this one isn't maybe at the top of my
list now the thing i really like the
most that i tried was the mineralized
kit and i have this in the pink color
selection i think there was a more
golden e warm kit as well but this is
kind of cool because it's an actual zip
around makeup bag like I could see my
I've got a random piece of plastic on my
finger no big deal
I could see myself getting a lot of use
out of this as time goes along for
travel I feel like that's a very good
size and there's some structure to it
it's not a real floppy bag I took out
the tissue paper like insert that was in
there and you've got three products here
this is called lightscapade mineralized
skinfinish and I think as far as those
go this is a smaller size like it's the
same size as my Mac mineralize full-size
blush but if I compare it to soft and
gentle mineralized skinfinish this is
smaller and get an up-close look at this
it's so pretty it is like these swirls
of pastel blue and light yellow little
bit of peach a hint of pink in there
throughout it's so pretty and I think
it's gorgeous on the cheeks like
this highlight just really makes me
happy it's next level brightening I
think it must be something about that
blue that's coming in there that takes
anything golden e about this and it like
kicks it up a notch
and I just think it's so so pretty on
the cheeks and it's not too much I don't
see any flecks of sparkle in here that I
can detect it's just the prettiest
pearly Sheen you see what I mean it's
just mmm it's so yummy it's really good
and I still think you know the size is
pretty generous I think about the size
of my warm soul blush and I feel like
I'm gonna have that thing for a long
long time and so this works really well
and I was very pleased with that the
other products you get are clearly
full-sized lipstick and lip gloss one is
a mineralized rich lipstick and a
mineralized glass lip gloss and this is
my first time trying either of these
kinds of formulas gotta say very
impressed this formula the gloss reminds
me a lot of the cream Sheen glass if not
maybe even a little bit softer I don't
know that's a weird way to describe a
gloss maybe a little more moisturizing
on the lips and then this lipstick
really love the feel of this as well
very luxurious feeling the shade you're
getting here as you can see it's a light
cool pink it's a kind of verging in that
cotton candy pink land that I don't go
to super often but I do love the formula
and the look really is something I enjoy
I will show you just the lipstick first
and this is in the shade B fabulous
so it's creamy no shimmer soft cool pink
doesn't really give me that full winter
vibe but yet it seems to totally fit for
me alongside this dark smoky eye so I
could get used to that shape for sure
and I would definitely try more
lipsticks in that formula and then the
gloss I'll show you that on its own this
is in the shade eloquently elegant and
this is creamy I don't see any shimmer
in this and it reminds me a lot of that
NARS lip gloss and Turkish Delight
that's so popular sort of this milky
light pink creaminess and it is a little
bit on the sheer side I feel like I can
still see some of my natural lip color
through it but now here's a look at them
layered together and that's the way I've
been wearing them throughout the video I
think they play very nicely together I
feel like the gloss on top of the
lipstick almost softens up that pink
shade just slightly and it's very pretty
and if you're into a less cool pinky
look you might check out the other set
that's available although I don't think
the highlight would be the same one as
this and this is like my number one top
favorite thing in this trio and then the
lipstick and lip gloss are like equals
and for as creamy as Max cream machine
lipstick formula is and I love that
formula this goes like even a step
further I think in terms of feeling
really nourishing and nice on my lips so
I feel like I kind of had a little
product discovery like light bulb moment
with this set but there's a lot in this
Mac nutcracker suite' Holiday Collection
that I have not tried so I would love to
hear your feedback I'm sure it would be
helpful to others if you shared in the
comments section what things do have you
picked up what interests you the most I
know they've got little lipstick sets
they've got different eyeshadow palettes
than what I picked up yeah that
eyeshadow palette not a hit for me the
lipgloss set pretty good and then my
favorite definitely the mineral I said
that I tried but yeah let me know what
you think in the comment section below
and I will talk to you guys very soon
