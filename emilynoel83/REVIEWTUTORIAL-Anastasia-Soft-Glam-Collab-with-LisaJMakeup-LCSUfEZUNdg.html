tuning in this is a very special video
on my channel this is a video in
collaboration with my buddy Lisa J
makeup here on YouTube she is absolutely
wonderful you've heard me mention her
before on my channel probably if you
haven't found her yet she's a real gem
here on YouTube I feel like her videos
are so educational very sincere very
genuine she's worked with Mac in the
past as a trainer and I feel like when
you watch her videos you'll see she's
got a real all encompassing knowledge of
makeup that I think really benefits
people of all ages she's super pretty
she's from Texas she's got two girls but
above all else honestly she's kind she's
a truly kind person and that means more
to me than anything and she's been so
supportive of my channel I hope if you
haven't checked her out yet you'll go
find her click subscribe say hello I'm
sure she has a great tutorial in store
for you the way we kind of decided to
approach the soft glam palette from
honest hacia here it's to kind of each
take on two different color schemes
because as you glance at this there
might be a couple different things that
stand out to you maybe it's the rosy
tones in it or maybe it's the golden
shades and so she's gonna do more of a
rosy look and I went with something very
golden and it turned out very dramatic
as well but I hope you guys like it and
we just thought this would be a nice way
for people to get sort of the full
picture of the palette within our two
separate videos so thank you so much
Lisa for doing this with me thank you
for being just positive wonderful just
genuine makeup loving presence here on
YouTube I really appreciate that and
just so excited to kind of do this video
with her from afar so hi Lisa anyway
let's talk about the palette a little
bit more it's soft glam the palette is
actually soft and that velvety feel to
the outside same size and shape as you
may have seen in a lot of different
honest hacia palettes it's got the
mirror there it's also got the nice
little double ended brush looking at the
shades I mean this just screams wearable
to me you know you've got so many mattes
you've got a variety of tones here
although I feel like it goes pretty
heavy on warm especially as you look at
these mats here in the center there are
some really gold any pops this shade is
very golden the bronze up here dusty
rose is
cool option here and then you have these
other rosy shades like rose pink and
sultry mulberry is fantastic that's one
of those dark kind of red wine shades
that's really right up my alley
super excited to see what Lisa does for
a rosy look from this palette but it's
certainly neutral with variety i think
the quality here is very consistent
whether you're dealing with a shimmery
shade or a matte shade or a shade like
tempera which is just a barely there
shimmery you know it works so
effectively on the eyes and i've heard
it mentioned i can't remember where
maybe it was from an honest Asti of
beverly hills account somewhere
instagram twitter i don't know that this
is the same formula from modern
Renaissance
so if you loved the way those shadows
felt and applied you'll probably enjoy
this as well there are some shades like
I use quite a bit of burnt orange in my
look today and I felt like you know you
tap into it you will see some kind of
powdery fallout that doesn't scare me
never has just build up your shadow
little by little tap off the excess if
you see a little excess there you can go
back and use it and work it into your
look you know a little powder enos and a
shadow is really not a deal-breaker for
me in fact I want it to be soft enough
to transfer onto my lids in a pigmented
way instead of having to build it up or
scrub into a shadow another thing I'd
like to point out is with sultry and
bronzed I've used both of those shades
on different occasions bronze especially
in the look that I did today and I felt
like it was very easy to control and it
didn't take any real special instruction
to use you know you just pick up a
little bit on your brush just kind of
Pat it on build it up to as much
intensity as you want and I think it
looks absolutely beautiful and it wasn't
hard and it was just an all-around
really nice quality shimmery shadow I've
mentioned from some brands I feel like
we're almost regressing a little bit in
the quality of shimmers like brands are
making them very creamy in some cases
like they'll swatch beautifully but
they'll be tricky to apply I don't feel
like there was any trick to anything
really in this palette now when palettes
come out I mean am uniqueness is a big
factor we look at me say well where have
I seen this before and these are gonna
be a lot of shades that you've probably
seen before if bits and pieces here and
there in different palettes you know
we've seen Gold's we've seen a lot of
rosy things we've seen a lot of warmth
lately if you own a lot of different
eyeshadows and palettes and you may be
able to recreate a lot of looks that you
see various youtubers create with this
just from other things in your stash
because the shades aren't insanely
uncommon but having this grouping is
nice I do think these colors complement
each other really really well at least
is going to be doing a distinctly rosy
look I'm doing something more golden but
then you start blending those tones like
put bronze and mulberry together or fade
some of rose pink into faerie you could
do all sorts of cool combinations but a
speaking of the look I did today I want
to show you how I did it we're gonna
take you step by step so let's do it
okay guys it is eye tutorial time and
I've already got my foundation powder
concealer and some bronzer on and then
I'll be kind of dressing up the look
adding in some accessory type products
like blush and highlight and lips a
little later and they used this burnt
orange shade right right down here right
down here and it is a nice little on I
want to call it like a soft warm Brown
so even if you don't have this palette
you might find some of these shades you
could turn up in your collection
different places I think sometimes with
palettes it comes down to convenience
factor and liking certain shades and
just having them handy all in one
palette a lot of times that's what
drives me to pick up and use a certain
thing it's just because okay I know it's
all there I know all of those colors
work together as I dip my brush into
this I'm getting some powdery sort of
some fallout there there's some definite
softness to these shades I wouldn't say
it goes too far beyond what I
experienced with like a lorac shadow but
in these cases as I've said before you
know you tap off the excess always you
build up slowly now I'm just blending
over that with a bear brush here this is
my me 40 brush and I'm going to use a
little bit of tempura right up under the
brow I kind of like this shade it looks
mad at a glance but it actually has just
the slightest bit of sheen to it
next up I'm going to take some rustic so
that's that pretty brown right here pick
some of that up with a flat brush and
I'm gonna start putting this right here
on the center of my lid
know what song I
not get out of my head right now and I
don't even mind it like I love this song
I'm kind of late to the party on this
song but lights down low max I mean this
dude's voice is amazing I love it so
much that song just like it haunts me I
heard it in the car like several times
we were travelling like this is so good
I think before I just caught it on the
radio different times like bits and
pieces of it like it's kind of a good
song but now I've like got it on my
phone I love it so much I watched the
music video and it's one of those things
that looks like maybe it was done super
low budget style but it's so good and I
didn't expect to be like crying at the
end of it but I was so you might be
wondering where the heck is this look
going Emily well I think I know I'm
gonna leave a gap here that's about this
big on the inner part and we're there's
gonna be some overlap happen but for now
we're gonna transition kind of to the
outer part of our eye with deeper and
deeper shadows so we started with rustic
and now I'm gonna use a little Cypress
umber and we're gonna put that and
that's the way you need to say that
shade by the way and I'm gonna Pat this
kind of overlapping the last shade and
all over the outer part of my lid
his family just friendless cans trying
to find an island in the fall two
monsters don't know
you guys are like girlfriends using
every Brown in the palette well it's
gonna get boring before it's gonna get
exciting here that's what I'm gonna tell
you just laying some groundwork here
y'all okay also the brush that comes in
here I have always said this but I think
honest hacia gives great little brushes
on this side has a little like kind of
it's sort of fluffy but it's more toward
a flat brush and then this side it's a
nice little blended out type brush as
well
I like that they've never stopped giving
these brushes in the palettes because
they're always they're always good
brushes now you want to go ahead and
clean off some of that darkness and
madness from your brush because we're
gonna play with bronze and bronze can be
very intense here very golden e and so
I'm going to pick some of that up on my
brush what I like about this is that
this isn't easy to work with high impact
shades sometimes the more impact a shade
gives off the more like tricks you got
to know about it more careful I'm
tapping off a little bit of excess there
and then I'm going to Pat this right
here on the inner corner we're going to
go for major major impact right here and
this one seems to work well just by
patting patting patting repeated patting
and I just kind of want to look like
there's this sort of starburst happening
right out of my tear duct and kind of
fading on to the rest of my lid when I'm
doing eyeshadow like I try to stick with
certain methods that I do think are most
flattering on my eyes there's different
ways to vary it up some but from I like
eye shape and placement I just always
like keeping it bright on the inner part
not that you always have to but I tend
to like the look I see I feel like this
shade is easy to control I'm able to
really like press it on there I'm not
seeing fallout going everywhere it's
just a very high quality shimmer and
there's a couple in here like that
sultry is like that from a more like
rosy standpoint and then you got bronze
next I want to take no more because I
want to show you guys like how the black
performs in here a lot of people swatch
a black and they're like yeah it's a
good black or no it's a bad black but
let's just put it on and show cuz this
is a very nice black the other day I was
wearing it actually just very softly as
a crease color you know which sometimes
you just think of reaching for the brown
or the more mid-tone or slightly darkest
shades but this black I find to be very
blendable so what I just wanted to do
was build up some really concentrated
darkness right here on the outer part of
the lid outer corner and you can see how
our warmer Brown that was already in the
crease is kind of playing nicely with
that I feel it's kind of helping it all
work in
and to kind of round things out here I'm
tapping back into rustic this is what
the brush that was provided and I'm
going to just be sort of developing that
outer part here a bit more I'm not doing
a super stark like outer V but see I'm
bringing that shadow almost in little
circular motions out from the eye
slightly like we already had some shadow
there but it just kind of helps to
finish things off and kind of smooth it
over once you've added another dark
shade so again that's rustic
and then just a slight bit of the burnt
orange kind of here on the inner part of
that crease
now for eyeliner I'm first gonna use my
Jordana color Envy and black envy across
the upper lash line I just think this is
such a high contrast look it really
calls for sand black I'm going for kind
of a medium thickness to this line
because I don't want it to be so thick
oh and there I just kind of dabbed it in
an area wasn't supposed to but I don't
want to go too thick because I don't
want to cover up a lot of our nice
effect on the lid but it needs to be
thick enough for some lashes to lay down
going for just a slight wing there a
light wing
in my lower inner rim I'm using this
julep one pencil met gel which is a nice
soft and decently long wearing liner in
your waterline and this is in rich Brown
and whenever I do that I'd like to also
get a little bit on my actual like in
between the lashes lower lash line area
then we're going to go back to Cyprus
Unger and I'm using a ankle brush a
smallish angled brush II 65 from Sigma
and taking it under my wing and also
down to about the outer part of my lower
lash line and this will all start to
look a little more blended here in a
second the little disclaimer every
youtuber gives so people don't get too
scared about things I'm not sure about
the direction this is going well I'm not
either
oke 21 coming in nothing on it right now
just kind of smudging over what's been
put there
like taking any shadow that might be
there on the lower lashline and kind of
just pulling that inward I'm letting it
come down a little low or two actually
then I'm going to take a little bit
softer lighter gold in this palette
called fairy and I'm just using this
small angle brush it's like a little
synthetic brush from Sigma but any you
know angled brush smudger brush just
generally small brush that you have see
what I'm doing with this I'm going
around that inner corner and I'm kind of
pulling it down along the lower lash
line so it's in like the same family as
that really intense rich gold on the lid
but just a little softer
so now I'm gonna top this off with a
little mascara and lashes and I'll join
you with the finished look okay guys
finished look here very dramatic I know
it's the Koko lashes in Misha are the
ones that I have on and so they're very
like fan straight out if you want that
similar effect just look for any lash
that has a lot of length kind of coming
up right from the center it's very eye
opening and I kind of like that look
when everything is very dark and
dramatic as well also one little quick
tip that I wanted to point out as I was
doing my lashes I remembered this little
brush called the insta pop crease brush
from Real Techniques it looks kind of
full at that angle and then you turn it
to the side you can see it's very like
steeply tapered up one side and I love
using this end the end where there's the
most length and really smoking out eyes
shadow it does a really good job of
softening out like your lower lash line
so I did go back in with a little bit of
this rustic shade just tap straight into
it with that brush and then very softly
went across here like under the wing and
on this outer part of the lower lash
line and I thought that was a really
cool effect with the shadow but as far
as what else I'm wearing I'm trying one
of the bare minerals Jen nude blushes
this is pink me up I just got like a
mini one in a little set that I found on
Ulta and it's a super soft blush to the
touch and it's also a very natural shade
on the cheeks and then for a highlight
I'm wearing my Physicians Formula
shimmer strips in Vegas strip so this
has kind of a soft golden a sheen to it
that I thought might play off of the
eyes well I don't know and then on my
lips I'm wearing my Lancome gloss number
202 it's just a nice casual nude shade
you know it was all real low maintenance
low fuss with this look but I did really
enjoy this palette while I am by nature
very very drawn to those rosy shades and
that was definitely the first kind of
look I ever did what this palette was
with the Roses I think this shows that
you can forgo those and still get a very
fun look you know kind of a dramatic
take on it I hope you guys will check
out Lisa's channel and see what she did
I have no doubt it will be beautiful
thank you guys so much for watching my
video to me aiseesoft glam as a super
wearable palette the kind of thing that
most anyone could pick up and find their
everyday work look find you know a way
to make this dramatic and
a fun night out type palette as well
it's very versatile it's very
approachable is it an absolute must-have
for everyone well we all know there are
a load of eyeshadow palettes on the
market and these really aren't the most
unique shades ever are they wonderful
quality yes are you gonna be
disappointed if you get your hands on I
don't think so I guess what I'm getting
at is if you're really trying to hold
back on makeup purchases I think you
could achieve the look I got today and
by combining maybe some similar shades
from other palettes for sure again I
think a lot of what it comes back to
with palettes is convenience factor and
having all of those certain shades
all-in-one this is the kind of palette
that I think is going to appeal to a lot
of people and it was very well done from
a quality perspective in my opinion so
thank you guys so much for watching
don't forget to head over to Lisa's
channel and I will see you again next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
