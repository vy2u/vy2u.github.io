today's video I'm going to be talking
about these new pallets from Revlon they
say eyes cheeks and lips palette and the
idea is that these are full of
universally flattering shades so there
are three different varieties you've got
the romantic nudes
there's the berry in love palette and
then the seductive Smokies palette and
any time I think of that name I think of
little Smokies maybe I'm just hungry for
breakfast food I've been trying these
out and long story short I'm not really
impressed with these now the price tag
is $17.99 so when we're starting to
close in on $20 for a drugstore product
I really begin to look super critically
at them and think you know is it really
worth that and bottom line here I think
we've got average eyeshadows as far as
drugstore palettes go the worst thing in
these palettes are the blushes they're
like kind of non-existent even on my
skin tone so if you're even a little
deeper than me I think you're going to
be even more frustrated with these but I
just can't get them to show up on me and
then you've got lip products in here the
lip colors are decent you're getting two
that are actually lipsticks and two that
are identified as glosses so these are
going to be more sheer and shiny these
are going to be more opaque and those
seem to you know kind of do what you
would expect them to do they're not bad
colors they seem to be nicely pigmented
and creamy but that was really the part
of the palette that I wasn't even super
interested in to begin with I see
they're trying to really make it like a
convenient multi palette type deal but I
really wish when brands put creamy
products in with other powder products
they got to do something to kind of
separate those creams or like the balm
always seems to come up with a way to
give it like a separate little flap so
that powder doesn't get in with these
because here you've got powder down here
you got all these powder shadows and
I've already experienced a lot of powder
shadow falling out into those things and
then kind of having to blend it away or
scrape it off it's kind of annoying
they're quality wise just the palettes
themselves they feel nice you know
there's a nice sturdiness to them
there's
actual plastic window there I would have
rather had a bigger mirror but you do
get at least a tiny mirror which i think
is better than no mirror but you know
that's really small and for applicators
you're getting a tiny blush brush a
little double-ended sponge tip and a
little lip brush as well I wouldn't
really use the tiny blush brush but the
other parts you know I'll use a sponge
tip applicator from time to time and the
lip brush is fine as well
I enjoy multitasking I thought you know
if I get this and I love the quality
this could be a really nice thing and
maybe if I'm just loving the quality so
much I could overlook the fact that
there are creams situated right next to
a powder but it's just not the way it
went for me and looking at the price tag
and then seeing what you get I just it's
nothing I would sit here and say oh my
gosh everybody needs to run out and try
these really what the quality of the eye
shadows reminds me of if you've tried it
would have been several years back that
they were still in stores but the Revlon
eyeshadows that were kind of you know a
rectangular shape it's that kind of
quality which always tended to be a
little bit hit and miss for me across
the board with these palettes the deeper
shades are better the lighter shades are
more sheer and flaky you can definitely
make them work with a primer so looking
on the bright side you know you could
get a decent look with these eye shadows
and the lip colors are certainly usable
but looking more critically at it it's
like I wish there was more consistent
quality with the eyeshadows and the
blushes you know what the heck let's put
something in there with a little more
pigment so I want to show you swatches
of all of these so you can really see
what I'm talking about so I think the
softest most natural option is the
romantic nudes palette all of the
eyeshadow shades contain shimmer except
for a matte Brown that's in here and as
you can see the deeper shades a lot more
color payoff you don't have to use as
much product to get an impact on your
eyes I would recommend using a primer
with these regardless but the blush is
really really weak and then you've got
lip products where again to our
lipsticks to are identified as lip
glosses so I'm glad they gave you at
least a couple of lip colors in there
that do have you know a definite look on
the lips they really show up next up
you've got the berry in love palette and
I don't know if you guys have noticed
but it almost si
like they're setting you up to have two
separate eye looks in here you could
certainly mix them up and use different
things but here it's got like this soft
kind of pastel with a hint of purple and
then a little bit more of a deep smoky
eye option over here just something I
noticed but you look at these shades and
very consistent with what I've noticed
before darker shades perform a little
bit better they just feel more rich
these light shimmery shades just kind of
chalky just even to swatch them but also
to apply them there is a baby pink blush
in here and these blushes feel kind of
nice to the touch but there's just
there's no color payoff coming from that
and then to berry type lip colors and to
glosses that basically show up pretty
sheer you're going to see a lot of your
natural lip color through any of these
glosses just so you know and then if I
were to pick a palette that I find to be
the most impressive or just had the best
color payoff for me it would be the
seductive Smokies palette because I do
really like the lip colors I think the
lip colors offer the most variety it's
kind of nice to have this one that's a
little bit sheer and shimmery it gets a
nice little spotlight on the lower lip
center of the lower lip you've got a
berry type gloss that actually does show
up with some color too pretty colorful
lipsticks here they give you that red
the blush again it's kind of a toss it
out type item I tried to put that on
today but I could not see anything on my
cheeks so I popped on a different blush
and then I'm also wearing mainly these
shades for my eye look today and a
little bit of that plummy color there as
well but these eye shadows because there
is so much darkness and depth here they
really have the most impact out of all
the others whereas the swatches of the
others as a whole just seem kind of
pastel and light these definitely have
some intensity that black is really nice
you can see a little bit of shimmer in
it but it really performs like a matte
color and it made a decent smokey eye
for me and then on the lips I'm wearing
mostly this shade and a little bit of
both of these glosses kind of mixed
together on top but in the scope of
everything like the lip products are
just not something I'm really that
interested in in this palette anyway if
they're great quality you know added
bonus but I'm probably going to tend to
use lip products that I have
individually in my collection so I can
pop them out take them with me in my
purse if I'm going somewhere that's just
a more practical way to touch-up and
reapply for me I think this palette
might have had more potential if they
had some good quality face products in
here like a blush that really showed up
and then maybe also a bronzer and a
highlight kind of like the way this
charlotte tilbury instant look in a
palette is you know this is all powder
and everything in here is like really
top-notch quality granted it's way more
pricey than this other stuff and I will
be doing a full video and reviewing and
showing you how I use this I having had
this palette it got me interested in
this whole multitasking palette idea I
saw Revlon came out with these I wanted
to try them all but for nearly twenty
dollars a pop I don't think they're
performing up to par if I was going to
pick one that gave the most bang for the
buck I would say it's the smoky palette
but realistically I'm probably not going
to use a lot of this bottom part so you
know I would be happy to hear what you
guys think of these palettes if you've
tried them I'm all for multitasking I'm
all for you know ease of use and pop it
in your purse type stuff but I don't
know that this was my favorite execution
of that kind of idea so thank you guys
for watching I hope this was helpful if
you were curious about these stay tuned
for more info on the Tilbury palette I
know some of you have noticed I've been
wearing that in some previous videos and
Avast how's the quality is it worth it
so I'm really going to address those
things in its own video at first I
thought I might lump it all together but
I thought no too much too much content
so thanks again guys I appreciate your
time and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
