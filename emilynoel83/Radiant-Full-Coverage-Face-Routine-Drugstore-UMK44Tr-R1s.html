about this video because I feel like the
concept in my mind has been in the works
for a long time I love a good full
coverage long wearing makeup look but a
lot of the products that I've been using
were high-end and those were a lot of
products I've been recommending too and
so I've had some great requests from
people saying you know how can I get a
really long wearing look really great
coverage look with drugstore products so
I challenged myself to put together a
look that I thought was just as good as
anything I've been using high-end wise
but more affordable products and not
only did I want it to be full coverage
but I wanted it to be really long
wearing I'm all about that and also
something that I felt like look kind of
radiant you know the skin didn't look
super flat to look at it and totally
matte but it had a little glow in the
right places you know what I'm saying so
I got a full tutorial on how to get this
will take you from primer to my
finishing step for the face makeup so
here we go so I've already moisturized
and then I'm gonna put on my primer I'm
using the boots number seven photo fix
wrinkle filler and prime this primer
seems to do really well alongside the
foundation that I'm going to be using I
find that something about this pairing
my foundation and the whole look just
lasts a really long time using my
covergirl outlast stay fabulous
foundation love that this foundation has
a pump and I just do like pretty much
almost one full pipe just kind of dotted
around first just getting it roughly
where I want it and then I bring in my
Sigma f80 brush and I use that to really
get an even blend all over and a big
part of a foundation staying power is
making sure you've got it applied really
evenly on your face so that way you
don't start looking patchy it's a really
good coverage there but if you look
closely in my eye area I've got what a
lot of people have and that is some
darkness right in here really kind of
dark on that inner part of the eye best
to counteract that kind of a look as a
peachy tone concealer the best one that
I found from the drugstore and I know
this is technically on the verge it's
from Target and it's from the pixie line
and this is like a $15 product but it
really really is worth it I think it's
got great coverage it's called the
correction concentrate and brightening
peach and it's a great alternative to
like benefits erase paste if you've
tried that it's a little bit thicker
it's not quite as gooey and moist as
erase paste it I just dab it right
around those dark spots and you can see
an instant correction in those areas and
I'm not using much I'm basically just
dabbing my finger in the product I get
about that much on there and then if I
see any other discolored areas you know
you just Pat around it
the warmth of your finger works really
nicely with this product in getting a
little bit on here's a dark area and
just kind of then start dabbing it in if
we do a lot of rubbing side-to-side
we're gonna start picking up the product
and actually removing it from the skin
so we want to just press it right in so
this is just a really good corrector on
both dark circles and dark spots I found
it effective in both ways so definitely
worth the $15 I mean I've had this for
quite some time I still feel like I've
got a lot of product left in there you
could really stop there concealer wise
if you wanted to but I do want to add an
additional step to brighten and this is
a full coverage look so it's it's using
a little bit of product here but I'm
using the Maybelline Dream Lumi this is
an ivory so a shade that is without a
doubt lighter than my own skin tone and
I'm gonna use this in a few key areas to
just brighten and bring forward the
places that I want to come out like my
cheekbones so I'm kind of drawing down
I'm going with that whole triangle
method here you know under the eye but
also out I'm gonna bring this down my
nose and I'm gonna hit my chin as well
and also just above the lip then I'm
taking my p80 which is the baby version
of the f80
and I'm gonna just blend all that in and
I really like to take this light
color and get it right up to the lower
lashline you can practically stipple a
little bit with this brush so you don't
remove you know too much of the product
or mess with the under layers of your
makeup too much next up I want to set my
under eye area I want to make it look
mattified and perfect but yet I don't
want to make it too heavy with products
so I'm gonna take a really lightweight
product that I've been using kind of as
a little like drugstore substitution for
bare minerals bisque products it's
definitely not a dupe it is not as full
coverages though it really does give a
nice smooth appearance to that area and
if the elf mineral booster in sheer so
this is kind of like a finishing powder
type product and it looks like this it
maybe has a slightly pinky tone to it
so I just tap a little bit of that in my
cap I'm using this tapered highlight
brush from Sigma and I'm just gonna take
this right on my under eye area I feel
like when it comes to the contours of my
under eye area it almost makes it all
seem a little more flattened out you
know what I mean set the rest of my face
and I'm going to stay away from the
under eye area since that's got enough
product on it as it is I'm using my NYX
stay matte but not flat powder
foundation medium beige is my shade I'm
just gonna get a medium sized brush in
there I'm just gonna buff this in all
over the rest of my face you might say
well if you've got a great coverage
foundation already why put a powder
foundation on top but I want you to know
I'm really using this very lightly and
I'm using it because I love the finish
it's not a finish that I think is too
matte but yet it doesn't get me shiny
you guys so there's basically your full
coverage face makeup I'm gonna continue
on with the other face makeup steps just
so you can get the full effect of what's
happening here I'm taking my Revlon
Photoready bronzer this is a matte
bronzer it has for sure it's in it's got
a good sized chunk out of it too I'm
gonna concentrate on the bottom most
part if you want a lighter bronze go for
the like the top two shades but I'm
gonna use this as a little bit of a
contour here starting right back by my
ear swirling forward circular motions
and you can start to see that area just
popping a little bit more same thing on
the other side this is such a good
bronzer I mean it's really got to be my
favorite Matt drugstore bronzer I'm also
gonna make sure I get under my chin and
jaw area and I'm gonna go around my
forehead too with this not going for a
super like all over bronzy look I'm just
using this in the areas where I want to
contour then for blush I think it's
really whatever you want to do staying
in line with the radiant theme of this
video I'm going with something that's a
little bit brighter I think it gives
just a really nice youthful flush to the
skin so I'm using peach blossom from
Jordana looks like this it is a matte
blush but you could use a blush with a
little bit of shimmer in it to just get
a little bit on my brush here it does
not take much and I'm gonna swirl this
on the outer part of the apple of my
cheek and also bring it upward as well
this is such a pretty shade and it's
something I think really works well with
whatever the rest of your makeup look is
you know it doesn't really interfere
using my so baked bronzer intiki
from hard candy this is not like a matte
highlight but this is not the most
shimmery highlight either it's kind of
in the middle I'm using that tapered
highlight brush from Sigma and I'm just
gonna do one simple step with this I'm
gonna smile and then I'm gonna tap it
right here on the top of my cheek just
like this and it's gonna instantly give
just a little extra glow to this whole
look I love it and finally a product I
did not think I would love but I am
totally all about this it's the NYX dewy
finish setting spray oh my gosh I've
tried the matte finish matte finish
works what about this and the
combination of these products that I've
been using that covergirl outlast you
knows a real nice matte foundation and
then you add a little bit of this on top
I feel like the staying power is amazing
and you get a look that really seems
like skin when you're all done and I
also like the way this sprays out of
really nice fine mist so I just do like
one spray of this I go up into the air a
bit let it kind of fall down on my face
it feels nice and refreshing you don't
come away from this look seeming you
know SuperDuper dewy but something about
the overall look this gives the skin I
think is so radiant and I really like
the finished look so that wraps up the
face makeup you will notice I have my
eyes and everything else done I actually
did a separate tutorial on my eye look
it's using the lorac unzipped palette so
definitely check that out that video
will be coming soon yeah I've been
experimenting with this look this kind
of combo of products for quite some time
and I've been really pleased not only
with the finish on the skin but with the
staying power throughout the whole day
for example I was wearing this look the
other day and toward the end of my day I
took some pictures for my blog and I
felt like the skin was looking like
literally just as good as it did when I
first applied it and that is just an
amazing feat for makeup as we all know
so thanks for watching guys and I'll see
you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
