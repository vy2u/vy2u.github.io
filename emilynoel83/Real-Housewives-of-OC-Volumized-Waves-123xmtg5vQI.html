this video this is going to be the hair
tutorial for the Real Housewives of
Orange County if you've seen that show
on Bravo you know that these ladies are
kind of flamboyant and I think it's kind
of fun because they've got great hair
great makeup but it definitely is not
low maintenance stuff okay so you got
the volume eyes tear which I have gotten
the volume in there with some rollers
and I've used different sizes to
actually wind up with more curl at the
bottom and more volume at the top so a
very very deep side part this is
inspired by Gretchen she was in the
sophisticate hair style guide which
Carrie Underwood is on the cover of
probably something from Carrie Underwood
coming from me soon as well but yeah
basically i recreated the hair look and
as you know did the makeup look as well
so if you want to see how this all comes
together keep on watching and hopefully
I don't ramble too much and it's clear
and easy to understand alright guys i
have just blow dried my hair and i also
used a little bit of a volumizer in it i
use the generic value products
volumizing root lifter it's the generic
version of the matrix amplify volumizing
root lifter so that just will give me
hopefully a little more oomph in my hair
as i style it and one of the
characteristics of this style if you
look at this picture here you can see
that they have a very very deep side
part and so a lot of kind of side bangs
coming over a lot of lift at the roots
and of course um lots of curl kind of a
soft wavy curly a a super defined tight
curl so that's sort of what we're going
to be working with here so the first
thing you want to do before you work
with the rollers is to sort of part your
hair so what I'm going to do is go over
here pretty far and it looks like it's
not even you know super precise the way
it is there on Gretchen's hair
just kind of like really pulled over far
from this side so just kind of decide
what you want to work with in terms of
your bangs for me I think I'm going to
go like that so I pull all the way over
here almost a diagonal that way and now
have some bangs going over here and we
will style those but we are going to
leave them out of the roller process
specifically and she's mentions Gretchen
says that she uses hot rollers which is
definitely an option here if you enjoy
those for me I think sometimes it's kind
of hard to keep from getting a dent in
your hair with hot rollers so I like
using velcro rollers and my strategy to
get a wave that will actually stay in
your hair is using a smaller curling
iron i'm using this one from revlon
which is gosh i don't even know the
exact sizes but i believe it might be a
three-quarter inch curling iron they're
so very small curling iron and then
using some of these goody velcro rollers
which are available at Walmart and they
come in a variety of sizes we're going
to be using larger at the top and
smaller towards the bottom to hold the
curls so just to get you started on that
basically decide kind of where your
bangs are and pull a section up right
behind that in kind of the middle of the
top of your head so this would be your
crown area i suppose and just pull up a
small section of hair there and we're
going to put one of the bigger rollers
this sighs this is the biggest I have
under that so just go ahead and take
your curling iron roll that up and let
it sit there and it will sit for a good
you know 15 to 20 minutes I have some
different layers in my hair here so I'm
kind of like taking the longest layer
got that in there then I go back and
kind of pick up the shorter layers is
kind of a pain when you do have layered
hair but the effect in the end will be
nice so just kind of get it all rolled
up there get a curl init and the heat is
what you really want to play off of so
while that's hot get it going around
that ruler and just roll it
down a lot of times your hair will stay
in these rollers but i like to use these
clips i believe my mom who is in who
used to be a cosmetologist calls these
yets and so I'm just kind of turn to the
side so you can see what I'm doing here
I'm just clipping it in going to see the
mirror here clipping it in on the bottom
and securing that and then I will spray
it with hairspray while it sits here it
also help hold the hair in there but
that's kind of our top curl and so now
what I'm going to go ahead and do is put
a few back behind i'm going to go
probably this size right behind it one
size smaller one size smaller and then
to the smallest down the back of the
middle of my head and I will join you
when I get that done alright guys I have
put my rollers now on down the side of
my head hopefully you can see here I've
got my largest at the top because that's
where we kind of want the big volume so
and we've pulled it up right from the
room so it's going straight up from our
roots that's what gives you lift there
and also spraying it after you do that
helps lock that in if the roller was
hanging down like this and it's just
hanging and there's all that you would
not get any lift from the roots that's
the benefit of rollers so make sure
you're getting that you're not you know
selling yourself short on that fact but
we've got large at the top going down to
smaller here towards the bottom and
basically we get the tighter curl
towards the bottom on that so we're
getting the length of our hair is
getting curled more in the top is
getting more lift it might puzzle you a
little bit the fact that i'm using such
a small curling iron and putting it on
larger rollers but i did a whole video
about this how it actually creates it
helps your curl last longer and be
stronger even though i'm going to take
this out it's going to be a bigger girl
it's going to give you more concentrated
heat it's going to be wrapping around
this tight curling iron and it's going
to just real
have a better impact so that's my little
tip on getting a longer lasting stronger
holding curl now for the sides of our
hair as you can see we've got two
different sides here because we got that
all these bangs and we've got this side
this fairly normal this sign is going to
be fairly easy i'm going to go through
that first basically what i'm going to
do is kind of go back basically most of
the length of that part pull out some
hair here and this isn't going to
necessarily be your typical roller that
i'm going to put in here i'm going to be
putting it in vertically and that's
what's going to give us that nice look
where the curl is kind of swept back
from our face a little bit it's
definitely a current look it's the
current you know way to do rollers i
would say kind of Miss that there but
I'm curling it away from my face that's
another thing on the opposite side we're
going to be curling it back that way
here we were just curling it you know
ads we usually would back so hold it
there for a little bit and then i think
i'm going to use i'm going to go with
the medium sized roller with this that
would be my the yellow in my set so that
size roller like that so take this out
and this is what i mean by putting it in
vertically like this and this is going
to come out more like like you know how
you would wrap your curl all the way
around the length of the curling iron
and you would pull it down that way and
you've got this curl that's going like
spirally that's sort of what we're
working with their it's going to be
spiraling when you back from our face so
go ahead and now that you've done that
spritz and then the ones following that
I don't want any sort of bump on this
but the the ones behind it it won't
matter so much so i will probably use
these clips on that i'm going to go
probably one more behind it another one
and then i will do the same thing
underneath with smaller so i'm going to
go yellow and yellow up top and then
probably a couple of red ones which are
this size and comparison no not that
matter
but i'm going to put those on the bottom
and then i will show you this side
alright guys this side is done as i
mentioned i was i went with yellow
yellow and yellow the medium sized
roller right here across the top keeping
them vertical and then I have another
vertical red one slightly smaller down
here and two more back behind it which I
don't really know how those turned out I
got one that I think that's straight up
and down and then the other one is just
kind of in there it really does not have
to be perfect and I want to make sure
you know that you don't necessarily have
to do this every time to get a similar
look to what we're doing I just wanted
to show you for this for the purpose of
this tutorial how to do it all out and
then sometimes like if I'm going to
hurry for work or something and I'll do
this style I'll get one up here one
behind it and then just kind of maybe
get one on the side take the rest and
either curl it quickly without putting
it in a roller or just curling it in
bigger chunks and putting like one or
two extra rollers down here not all of
these so you there's a lot of variations
on this don't feel like you have to you
know take a lot of time and you'll
actually find if you do this a lot you
get kind of fast with it show anyway
moving on to this side we've got this
big swath of bangs here like this I'm
going to leave those out and I'm
actually going to curl those with the
curling iron without a roller at the end
so wait for that I'm going to take
what's behind it however and do the
exact same thing I did on this side it's
going to be large yellow rollers at the
top actually they're not my largest
there the medium size and then along the
bottom will be a few more red ones so
like I said just going to hold it there
for a second popping a yellow one and
I'll do I know what I'm done alright
everyone my whole head is wrapped in
rollers now I just finished my left side
and that is one two three up top a
couple reg ones on the bottom and like I
said
is all you know your hair you may
require more or less rollers whatever
you choose now we've got this big chunk
of for me straight hair right here bangs
that are kind of layered and pulled over
and so I'm going to do is just sort of
lightly run my curling iron through that
we just wanted to kind of gently curved
back I don't want these to be come out
in a tight curl from a roller and even
though I have big rollers I just kind of
like to curl these keep them kind of
loose and straight so that I can then
manipulate them you know once i get
ready to style this so we're going to
let these sit for I don't know 10 to 15
minutes I'd say would be fine and then I
will join you with how to take them out
and get it all styled alright guys the
hair has just freshly been taken out of
the rollers haven't done a thing to it
since taking them out I didn't figure
you needed a tutorial on how to take the
rollers out that's kind of the fun and
easy part but anyway I wanted to show
you something though see how this
section of hair is lifted like that
right from the roots that's exactly what
should be happening here that was a big
roller that we had we put the spray on
it we put it on there hot and it's got a
nice little natural wave to it because
it was a big roller but it is giving us
that volume at the root so we're getting
that all over except I should have worn
a different colored shirt to really show
you what's going on here but the the
hair that is here at the bottom is it a
little bit more of a tighter curl though
so anyway what I would do now after
taking them out is to really just brush
through everything lightly just to kind
of blend the curls a little bit and get
things looking a little more natural
sometimes when there's hairspray out
there you run into little chunks of that
that you weren't expecting just kind of
feel around and make sure everything is
brushed out then what you may want to do
is tip your head over and actually spray
some hairspray what I've been using the
entire time is Trent the Tresemme tray 2
or trust to
hairspray that they can available like
everywhere so I'm going to tip my head
over and just spray some hairspray on
the basically the bulk of the length of
my hair I'll spray the underside so when
you flip it up I sprayed right back here
so now I've got a lot of volume and I
met spritz it all over once again tehsil
it around kind of get the volume the
life back in there it's out of the
rollers and now it is free so now in
terms of styling like I said there's a
very deep part going on on this look and
really a lot of the ladies looks have
sort of that side parted swooped over
bangs look here so what we're going to
do is try to keep with that so I'm going
to try to keep that here going over I do
want lift here in the crown and I can
see that she has that as well there's
not a ton but it is there so I'm going
to lift up basically this hair that we
put over that top roller and I'm going
to spray it right behind it spray the
back I've had and I'm going to take a
rat tail comb or this kind of fine-tooth
comb and I'm going to just tease it
right near the roots I'm not going to go
more than maybe five inches up on this
and just choose it and then when you
bring it down the fact that you've
sprayed it as helping it kind of lay
like that I'm gonna spritz that and then
I'm going to tease right over here so
the other side here's our part it's
using this side so pull some of that up
sprayed the back and grab your comb and
just kind of tease that a bit just like
so and then we're going to get this
going up a little bit to this is our
part this is mostly our bangs but some
of this was in our little r2 and tease
that up a little
okay so everything has been volumize
just a little bit one final spritz over
to all that and then I'm going to take
one of these combs your combs who pins
so like hair pin these are available at
Sally's you can get like a ton of them
in a package and these are the best way
I think to tame down any teasing that
you've done so basically we're going to
tone it down and I'm just kind of
smoothing it out bringing it back to
earth a little bit I know you guys might
have gotten a little scared there for a
second thinking I was going to leave it
but I wasn't kind of pull what was on
that part and I kind of pull that over
here the way as far as the curl when
you've teased it and you got that curl
you do want to make sure you really go
over just kind of in this method the
ends of your layers just to make sure
that those curls still look like curls
and don't look like her a rat's nest
after that teasing we did now this is
where you can kind of do it you want
shape it how you want it I've got to
kind of got this coming down here i'm
sort of referring back to the picture
you can see also what's happening with
the fact that we rolled the rollers back
we've got those waves coming back from
our face and I've kind of got this
sweeping back right there so you can
spray over this in fact i would
recommend that and also kind of look at
the back of your hair in a mirror see
what's going on there and be always to
be aware of what happened in the back
while you're dealing with all is styling
in the front so i'm going to do is
sprint some spray right there you kind
of shape that after you spray spray all
over there and spray your ends rope just
for a light touch and this is basically
their look you know you've got that real
deep part you've got the curls going on
in the back as a result of rollers and
it's a pretty fun look so thank you guys
so much for tuning in for this video to
see how to get that big volume eyes hair
that you see the girls have
and the girls I say girls they're women
on the Real Housewives of Orange County
