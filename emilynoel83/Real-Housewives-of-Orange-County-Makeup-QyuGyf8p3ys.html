video this is sort of a celebrity
inspired look or a reality star inspired
look because this is based on the women
of the Real Housewives of Orange County
the show on Bravo
I actually got my sophisticates hair
style guide from the store today and I
noticed there was a whole spread on
Gretchen from the show she is one of the
ladies on there you can see her hair her
makeup and stuff anyway I was kind of
inspired once I saw that I thought yeah
I watch this show and I noticed how
these ladies have this always kind of
high-maintenance hair done makeup to the
max kind of look and I thought how much
fun that would be for a tutorial so I
wanted to show you kind of how they did
the eyes especially so in this tutorial
I'll walk you through kind of how I did
the liner and the makeup what I feel is
very characteristic of the bunch is
having always day or night kind of a
dark sort of semi smoky eye it's very
very darkened in the corners liner is
key lashes are key there so I kind of
thought it was thinking about Gretchen's
look as I created this and just but
basically this is kind of characteristic
of what they all look like so if you
want to see how this all came together
keep on watching and I hope you enjoy
something we're gonna do is really
neutralize our eyelid area and I'm for
that I'm gonna use one of the best
primers for that purpose and it's the
Smashbox photo-finish
lid primer so it just has a little wand
applicator here I like to get a little
bit on my finger and then you can just
see how this is a little more you know
like it's not just completely invisible
it's kind of a skin tone to the primer
so you can just put it on there and any
you know discoloration in your eyelid
area is pretty much gone after that so
that's really cool next I'm gonna be
using this little trio here from
Palladio and it is the baked collection
in plums so while I while I tried those
lip balms I'm also testing out some
other products I thought this was pretty
I'm going to be using this plum shade
right here on the end
and for that I'm just gonna grab one of
my Sigma brushes here let's use the SS
239 for this this is kind of just like
your standard eyeshadow brush so just
pack some of that plum shade on and this
isn't like you know all-out purple
purple plum this is more of like you're
borderline just neutral colored plums so
just go ahead and get some of that all
over your lid it's not gonna turn out to
be like a really dark shade it's gonna
be just kind of like a medium color for
your eyelid also kind of flip the brush
and take some of that plum up to the
crease as well use my SS 224 to take the
light pearly shade right here and just
kind of get some of that on your brush
and use that to highlight right under
the brow that whole area okay and then
there's a pretty like cranberry shade
which we are going to be coming back to
we're gonna be really revisiting these
shades a little more as we develop the
look further but um I am gonna for now
get a little bit of that red on there
it's very very subtle it's more of just
like a little bit of a burgundy tone and
just get some of that right there now
what's really characteristic of the
looks of the OC ladies is the fact that
they have it seems like in many cases
any time of day they've got a really
made up eye and it really focuses on
dark liner even though a lot of these
women are you know blonde hair blue eyed
they don't hesitate to use dark liner
dark shadows especially kind of really
defining the outer part of their eye so
and you can see how it makes one eye
from the other like it really does make
your eye look bigger and kind of pop
it's a nice nighttime look but like I
said they use it any time of the day or
night so anyway I like the look so I
wanted to do it and I'm gonna be using
my Mac carbon as a little companion to
this today to really deepen up the outer
part of the crease there so what I'm
first gonna do is take my essence of
beauty fine crease brush the smaller in
that duo pack you can get
get some of that on there and really
just start to lay that color down in
your crease and sort of in circular
motions kind of buff it out especially
out around this outer area okay we are
going to get some depth going on right
in here but we're probably going to come
back to the plum to kind of intensify
that inner area as you can see in here
it's more the warmer shades and out here
is the darker so we'll get down just a
little bit there but what really I find
is easiest is to just kind of you know
know where you're going with it but go
back into your liner and then you can
actually see exactly where you want to
play off of for that so we're gonna
leave that B for a second and I'm gonna
use my NYC liquid eyeliner in black
again don't hesitate to use black if you
want to duplicate this look that's
really you know don't go easy on it so
I'm going to be going from the inner
corner to the outer here I'm going to
make sure I get right in the inner
corner almost drawing it down just a bit
see how I kind of went right down in
front of my tear duct there okay
continue it all the way down to the
corner just like that go back for a
little morphine unit okay we do want to
wing this out if you look closely at
what I've done here I haven't winged it
out dramatically but just a little bit
to kind of frame our our shadow so for
that I'm going to just um kind of draw
up draw it up toward the the brow and
connect and fill and today you've got a
little wing there don't stray away from
the black on the lower liner either I'm
gonna be using my Almay eyeliner crayon
in black so just your standard black
liner this one lasts pretty long and
it's pretty smooth and rich so this is
again we're going to kind of go right up
here in the corner and make sure you've
just kind of connected with your liquid
liner there so it's kind of somewhat
seamless from there and then we're just
gonna go all the way under sometimes I
like to meet in the middle
we're connecting to that extreme inner
corner and then just connect whenever
you're using some kind of creamy liner
on the bottom it's always kind of your
safe way to be safe with it is to go
over it with a shadow and a coordinating
color because it just ensures that the
oils and that creamy pencil or or
straight-up cream liner or whatever
using aren't going to kind of steep down
on your face so I'm gonna be using the
matte carbon again with my SS 266 brush
a nice firm angled liner brush and just
go over that this will also intensify
the the black there now we remember what
I said about kind of using our liner as
our guide to build out our outer feel a
little bit so we can see where our liner
is ended here we're gonna go back to the
matte carbon that matte black shade and
just going to go off of the outer corner
here using our essence of beauty fine
crease
brush I've yet to really find a brush
that can do this particular task quite
as well as this brush which is nice
because it's a good affordable brush too
but really a trademark of this look is
getting it nice and dark in your outer
corner here so really concentrate on
that if you want to duplicate this and
we're going out just a little bit like
we all have different distances between
our eye and our eyebrows so for some
people you may want to build this up a
little more for me I have quite a big
distance between so I'm going to build
mine up a little more but if you have a
smaller distance there between you may
want to kind of customize this to your
own needs I guess but I'm going in a
little bit but mainly keeping carbon
right out here then to really keep it
blended I'm going to take my larger SS
224 brush and some of the plum shades
some of the red shade you could even
blend the two together the way they're
side-by-side in here I think I'm going
to do that and just take that over the
top take it in right here
we want it well it is dark and you know
black is not the most natural shade to
be using on your on your eye area we are
going to keep it a nice blended look so
go over the whole thing we also want to
highlight some areas a little bit and
this little light shade in our trio
works pretty well for that if I can find
the right brush here I'm going to use my
AG Coastal Scents mini contour brush a
q-tip could also do this job I'm just
going to go right in here to our inner
corner and just work that around there
just to bring almost a dewy look to this
area brightening it up a little bit and
the final step for our liner because
I've noticed this specifically on
Gretchen's eyes because that's kind of
who I've really been thinking of what
this look it really does apply to all of
them but
no specifically for Gretchen she does
line her waterline in here so what I did
was lined in about halfway with the
black and because I feel like my eyes
sometimes look too closed in with lining
it all the way across I'm actually gonna
use a white and go on the inner part
it's not it's a very subtle thing but I
personally on myself I can tell the
difference if I don't do this so yeah
just going in on the inner part of the
waterline with the light and keeping the
dark on the outside it's very subtle no
but it would really be able to pick up
on it but I can so next what I'm going
to do is curl my lashes I'm going to
apply a coat of the covergirl exact eye
lights in black pearl I find that it
blends pretty well with false lashes so
I'm I'm gonna do a coat of that up there
I'm gonna do the Maybelline lash
discovery on the bottom to make those
little lashes stand out and then I'm
applying these what were they the Andrea
Maud lash number 52 just like that gonna
be applying those and then I will join
you with the finished look
alright guys here is the finished look
I've got the lashes on there I've got my
final coat of mascara something else I
did with my little pencil brush from
Sigma let me pull that out here so you
can see what one it is it's this one I
went in kind of under the lash line as
well with a little bit of carbon on
there just to smoke it out slightly more
but basically that is the look it's
really an intense eye and for them it's
an intense and intense eye that's used
probably day or night as far as the rest
of the skin as you can see in the
picture I mean Gretchen's just got
flawless skin they're not the hen not to
say that this is you know has not been
retouched or anything but I mean really
she does appear to have great skin even
on the show too so I mean this was a
matter of using a liquid foundation I
used my Revlon Colorstay all over
I used a matte bronzer all over as well
the NYC sunny and then another key
product to kind of give me a little more
glow is a new bronzer that I'm liking so
far probably will review eventually it's
the hard candy baked bronzer and heat
wave look at that gorgeous shade there
it's got kind of a sheen to it so it's
not entirely matte
I definitely contoured the cheeks I use
my covergirl cheekers blush in golden
pink which is one of my favorite colors
to contour with a little bit of peach on
the cheeks but didn't go overboard with
face color on the lips
overall they go with a lot of nude lips
so what I did was what did I do
I line my lips with the wet-and-wild
liner number 666 just to give it some
definition all around and then I went
over that with oh my gosh this is
getting complicated because I just
started messing with stuff you do not
have to do this many steps but I use my
revlon matte lipstick in nude attitude
which was kind of like a lip eraser I
actually did this first then I went over
it with the wet and wild number 666
which is a little bit deeper
let me grab that for you deeper tone
pencil just a little bit of a I don't
know berry tone mixed with the lips
take it kind of gave just a little
deeper nude look and then I went over
the top of that with my NARS lip gloss
and Turkish Delight just a light sheer
pink and that's what you get you can
make follow those things together so
anyway you could just do a simple nude
lipstick or nude gloss and you would be
perfect for this look I just kind of sit
down and start playing and I don't stop
sometimes so anyway guys thank you so
much for tuning in for this look I hope
you enjoyed it and hopefully there will
be more kind of celebrity inspired looks
to come because I know you guys love
those and they're really fun for me to
do as well so thanks for watching have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
