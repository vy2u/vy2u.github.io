Facebook page for some updated video
requests I have a big running list going
but I wanted to sort of get a new idea
of what things people still wanted to
see or new ideas and one of the things
that came up a lot that a lot of people
thumbs DUP was to do a video on makeup
fails just a compilation of some
products that haven't worked for me and
that's exactly what I'm gonna do you
think I've got some kind of rash here on
my hand actually I was doing a ton of
lip product swatches on my hand for an
upcoming lip dupes video that I want to
do and let's just say a lot of them
staying but these are all just products
that did not work for me
and that's the most important thing to
know I think if these things can work
for somebody that's awesome but I just
want you to be aware that it's just my
personal experience that I'm talking
about here so the first thing I want to
mention and this is again one of those
things that may work for other people
but really didn't work for me is the
covergirl clean foundation I think I
used this years and years ago and
decided to give it another shot I think
it had been repackaged somewhat recently
and I could not believe what happened to
my skin after I use this I broke out a
lot and I don't think there's any other
foundation that I've ever used that has
caused that kind of a reaction so
quickly maybe a great product for some
people but I don't have a specially
sensitive skin so I was just really
shocked to see that it broke me out so
badly another fail for me and I really
wanted this to work the packaging is
adorable but it's from Too Faced and
it's called the air buffed BB cream
complete coverage makeup it has an SPF
20 in it and I have it in the shade
cream glow and as you can see it's got
this neat little top here and this is
actually the brush so it's got an
itty-bitty brush I really wish the brush
was bigger if it's something you know
you're gonna buff all over your skin you
see the size of that compared to my
cheek I mean I got big cheeks but and
the texture of the product it feels
really nice and creamy but it is just in
no way a complete coverage
product you know it's just that was the
claim and that's not at all what it was
I found this to be super sheer the
staying power was not there for me at
all they'd be that at the time I was
really actively using it maybe my
combination skin or oily t-zone was
really like eating this stuff up but it
just seems like kind of a non-existent
type product to me and I think I was
expecting a lot more I mean when
something's labeled that's gonna have
complete coverage you know I don't think
that it's gonna be here's a great
products that I like from Too Faced but
could not get into this one other face
product here is something I tried more
recently and this is from Ulta Ulta
brand and it's the double duty concealer
and dark circle treatment and basically
this is like a creamy concealer but it's
expected to squeeze out through this
roller ball and just from a packaging
standpoint you can see there are all
sorts of reasons why something might not
work for me or for anyone I think the
biggest flaw with this product is you're
taking like the typical creamy concealer
consistency and you're expecting that to
be easily like rolled onto the skin out
that roller ball and I don't think it
does a very good job of it I also found
the consistency of this to be kind of
drying and for this to be something
that's like actually marketed for the
under eye area it's just not a workable
thing for and it wasn't even a matter of
like oh as the day wears on I'm starting
to look a little dry on my under eye
area but like almost immediately upon
application I felt like I was just
highlighting lines and stuff like so
clearly not something I would repurchase
there another fail for me was a product
that I really had high hopes for this
product as a complete testament to why I
don't do first impression reviews but I
try something for a while before I
review it because the first time was a
charm and after that I felt like the
product really changed and this is the
Too Faced better than false lashes
system up in the middle is like added
fibers that go on your lashes so you're
gonna put on you know this black mascara
and just apply that and then these loose
furry microfibers will like attach to
that and then you'll finish it off with
another coat of the masks care
first time I went through that process I
thought oMG the length is crazy but then
as I continue to use it in the coming
days I'm wondering why am I not
continuing to get that great look that I
got the first time and I think the whole
issue is that this mascara once it's
coating those loose fibers and then
you're putting it back in to the tube
and then you keep using it you're
changing the whole makeup of this
product and that's why I think I was
getting more and more clumps the more I
use this product instead of looking like
feathery really long really
voluptuous voluminous lashes I was
getting something that looked really
unnatural and kind of spidery with those
five because again when this mascara is
the finishing step it's not like it's
the only thing it's doing is coating
those loose fibers it's also this is you
know a wet creamy product it's picking
up some of those as well you're putting
them back in the - you're adding more
fibers and you really want with every
subsequent use so hopefully that made
sense but overall not better than false
lashes sorry another thing I was really
disappointed with were the shadows
softies from al may I do have a full
review on my Express channel on these
the couple that I'm holding up here are
creme brulee and this pink is called
petal I have a couple deeper shades as
well powder with maybe a hint of cream
going on in there too but the
pigmentation is so not there for me not
really like creamy enough to act as a
base type product that you're gonna
layer stuff on top of and it's gonna
intensify that I was just really
flabbergasted by how sheer these all
turned out to be and I mean they're
singles right so you're gonna pay you
know between 4 and 6 bucks at the
drugstore for just one of these and I
just don't think it's worth it another
shadow thing that I really could not get
into were these Revlon singles that hook
together this is another thing I've got
a forward view on if you want some more
details you want to see him in action
but I was really disappointed with the
quality of things they were way too
sheer again you're paying for singles
you're not gonna just buy a quads worth
of these but you're gonna just buy one
for a few bucks what
the thought that you're going to
ultimately purchase several and make
your own little pallet type thing out of
it like it just expected so much more I
mean there's so many great drugstore
shadows out there that you could pay
lots less for and get a really great
look and I just thought where's the
pigmentation they seem dry they seem
kind of chalky if you love the idea of
hooking things together go to Sally
Beauty Supply by the Sally girl singles
and hook up a bunch of them they're like
99 cents the quality way surpasses this
and I have a blog post that I'll link to
below where I show this shades I have
and swatches and it's like crazy how
good those are and how disappointing
these turned out to be last but not
least the worst lipstick I've ever tried
this is from Jordana I got this on a
whim when I was randomly in a Kmart I
don't even have Kmart's around here but
I was off somewhere else I went to a
Kmart looking at the makeup and saw Oh
Joerg anna has lipstick cool all by the
shape gold hollywood red open it up like
the smell of this lipstick like I'm
gonna hold it at a distance because I
don't want to catch a whiff of that
anymore this lipstick is like a
phenomenon to me it is so dry but so
sticky I remember busting it out of the
packaging we were on the way home and I
like put some on nose like it's it's
like skipping across my lips it's so dry
and then as when I press my lips
together it's so sticky how does that
happen
maybe this lipstick is really like 20
years old and they just still had it in
stock in the store I don't know but it's
a problem and I do not like it and I
have kept it around all this time for a
special appearance in a fails video like
this these are my recent makeup fails
please do not be offended if you had
success with any of these products I
hope some of this stuff turned out to
work for somebody but it just did not
work for me so that's what I'm sharing
just my personal experiences and if you
want daily reviews 5 times a week
quick reviews nothing over 5 minutes

Express - whether something's good or
bad I share something new Monday through
