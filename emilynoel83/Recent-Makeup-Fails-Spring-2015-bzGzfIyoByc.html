me this is going to be a product fails
video actually it's all about makeup
pretty much in this one I'd like to do
these videos every so often because I
think it's just as important as the
favorites to talk about the things that
don't work there are many products that
I feel kind of take-it-or-leave-it about
but then there are some things that I
really dislike and so those will be the
things I'm talking about in this video
they'll could work for other people just
not my bag of tricks the first thing
that I want to mention and I may
actually do a blog post I had swatched a
bunch of these recently and I think they
swatch beautifully but they just don't
perform on the eyes since the Milani
fierce foil eyes shines I mean they
really have a gorgeous appearance you
can see from these couple that I have on
my hand right here you know they look
beautifully metallic and they look great
in the pan as well but they're called
eyes shine and it actually says you
should only expect them to wear two to
six hours and reapply as needed and
rarely am i and I'm a cup touch-up kind
of person you know I'll maybe you know
put a little bit of a mattifier on my
skin I'll touch up my lip color but I
don't like to have to go back and really
tweak the eye look I have a high
expectation for staying power with eye
makeup and this stuff while it's creamy
it doesn't totally set once you get it
on there so it creased on me it did not
look pretty at all I mean I kind of knew
that that was gonna happen from the
swatches I had taken but after trying
this and wearing it you know it just
confirmed my suspicions that this is not
a product that wears well so typically
you might say well I've got a cream
shadow it doesn't last very well so I'll
set it with something but the one
strengths of this product is the
beautiful finish so I wouldn't want to
really cover that up with a powder and
it comes with this like silicone rubbery
little mini spatula type product for
application and that did not work for me
at all and Milani really they're
probably one of my favorite drugstore
brands because they come up with a lot
of great things but this is just
unfortunately not one of them this is
one of those where I like what were you
thinking you know they do look beautiful
and maybe for like just very temporary
use like if you wanted to put this like
kind of shiny spotlight on part of your
eyelid for photos or just a very
temporary situation
it might be good another thing that was
a Milani beautiful product at a glance
but a staying power fail for me was this
constellation gel eyeliner did anybody
else try this I have it here an
enchanted black opal this product is
combined a couple of my pet peeves
because they've got this kind of
glittery overspray on the gel liner and
it seems like it should be really nice
and creamy and I'll do a little like
swatches watch from the brush here on my
hand and it looks pretty at a glance but
this stuff did not wear well for me at
all it may have actually faded a little
bit sooner than these guys and I wasn't
rubbing my eyes my eyes were not watery
but it really like faded along the lash
line and I winged it out as well and
forget about it I mean that stuff did
not last
well we're on I products I guess I'll
just continue with that and talk about
these elf baked eyeshadow trios now the
elf baked eyeshadows just the singles
which have been out for quite some time
they've got a great shade called toasted
and a really pretty plum II shade there
are several of those that I think are
just gorgeous they're really great eye
shadows that go on nicely they have a
nice texture to them and some baked
things are really really dry these sadly
are some of those dry baked products
that do not work well these trios
specifically recall wearing this plummy
trio and thinking that that shade looks
so pretty here in the packaging and then
it's like it's a barely-there type color
these would be products where you could
lay down a base of some sort and you
might notice a little more color coming
off of them but part of why they're a
fail for me is just because I know elf
does a Goods baked single shadow so why
can't these be that kind of quality you
know I know there are a lot of people
out there who like this but the L'Oreal
Paris carbon black liner in tints I had
picked this up when I was running low on
black liquid liner and I had not yet
reordered my Jordana color Envy liquid
liner that I use all the time and I
think I remember trying this in the past
and feeling like you know maybe it was
not quite as jet-black as some other
liners or it went on just with a little
bit of this streakiness like I had to go
over the line
for whatever reason I thought I would
retry it's got that nice kind of
flexible tipping for liquid liners from
Milani and Jordana are just quite a bit
better than this in terms of being kind
of a one-and-done application this is
just one of those situations where it's
not like the worst liquid liner on the
market by any means but I have just
tried quite a few others that I like
better I wanted to mention this come
correct celebrity concealer from the
Fergie wet-and-wild line I have it in
medium golden it's a pretty good skin
tone match and actually pretty decent
coverage it reminds me a lot of a
concealer from Tarte that I had I think
it was like the Amazonian clay it was a
tube concealer and it was a very like
dewy finished on the skin definitely a
concealer I needed to set but it has
pretty good coverage but this one the
first time I used it I squeezed it out
and there was a major like separation
that had happened in the product you
know where you squeezed it out and a
bunch of wateriness sort of oozes from
the tube first and then you get to the
product itself I thought okay I'll
excuse that the first time maybe it was
just the way it was sitting or maybe
it's been on the shelves for a while but
that kind of thing continued to happen
with this product for me it kept being
this watery nusiness no matter how I
would store it you know I stopped
storing it tipped down and laid it flat
and I continued having to squeeze to
help so much of the product first to
actually get to the part of the
concealer that I felt was usable I
wanted to like this because I actually
thought it had good coverage here's a
brush fail on this I got from Walmart it
seems like a just a brand exclusively
carried by Walmart these brushes that
have the sort of fluorescent or pastel
colored handles and this one says smooth
coverage and I got it as like a
foundation buffer type brush and then I
don't know if you can see it to look at
it up closely here but there's actually
like a chunk of brush sort of missing
here in the way it was cut like it was
not cut super evenly all the way around
there's quite a dent right in the one
side and it's like this brush got a bad
haircut definitely does not perform as
well as the up-and-up brush that I love
that I raved about my affordable brush
rave video you might say well it's a
cheap brush what do you expect well I've
tried plenty of cheap brushes
that have an even cut to them and are
also soft and this is a soft brush so I
don't know I might need just saving you
a couple bucks by telling you this
information but I think it's still good
to know this Maybelline lash sensational
mascara really not enjoying this and
some mascaras
I don't like it first but I hold off
because I think okay give it a few weeks
and maybe I'll end up liking it better
after it just dries out slightly but I
just can't get on board with this one
now I don't have great lashes naturally
they don't hold a curl very easily and
this does not help them any as you can
see it's kind of a curved brush with
some shorter bristles in the curve and
then longer bristles on the underside
it's kind of a thick rather wet formula
here and I just felt like it was kind of
clumping the lashes together quite a bit
and it was really hard to remove so if
you just got those naturally amazing
lashes this might be something to use
I'm going to continue getting use out of
it until it dries up probably just as
like a precursor to false lashes when I
want to wear them yes anybody else had a
weird experience with the Tarte blush in
blushing bride I have a lot of these
Tarte blushes I got like a big set of a
bunch of the Tarte blushes and so many
of them are that buttery smoothness
they're pigmented they're long wearing
just to look at the pan in there and the
product it seems like it should be you
know a blush that would have some
intensity to it and compared to so many
of the others even some shades in their
line that are lighter than this have a
lot more buttery smoothness and this one
it feels kind of dried to the touch and
I wasn't seeing it much on my cheeks
like I really felt like I was building
it up maybe I have a flawed one with
this particular product I'd love to know
if anybody else has this and finds it to
be super pigmented because I think so
many of tarts other blushes are really
really good and this one just was not
hitting the mark
I revisited my local Sally Beauty Supply
for the first time in a long time and I
found several really awesome things but
this was not one of them it is the get a
glow finishing powder and I couldn't
quite tell by looking at it what kind of
look this was going to have at a glance
I thought it would be maybe a lower
cost alternative to my board Gellar
baked french vanilla highlight because
it just seemed to have that similar tone
but once I was able to open it up and
get it out of the packaging I could see
well okay there is a little bit of
glitter in this product so that's a
slight mark against it in my book anyway
but also it just has kind of a chalky
look like a very dry kind of white
chalkiness with a little bit of glitter
mixed in so just worn all over the skin
as the finishing powder this claims to
be I didn't think it gave me really any
added radiance and then even just to
spotlight areas like you would as a
highlight it just did not give me the
look I was after so I can't really
recommend that
another thing that seemed really cool to
me in theory but I just didn't really
like the consistency of it for me anyway
is the NYX conceal correct contour
palette and I have it here in light so
what you're seeing here are several
different tones of cream product that as
you could see could be used as a cream
contour maybe more corrective shades
some skin tone matching type shades even
a brightening yellow and I have used all
of them but I think they have a really
thick texture that makes them kind of
hard to blend on the face and a
thickness on the skin that I don't
really like it particularly if I'm gonna
be using these around my eye area
talk about spotlighting fine lines and
wrinkles they have some coverage you
know there's some pigment in these
products I just don't love what these do
for the look of my skin like I said
they're kind of tricky to blend they
might be better over like in a spot
concealer type way like if you just
wanted to go over a blemish or something
just here or there small areas of your
skin maybe that could work now they've
got several skin tones available in this
conceal correct contour palette but then
they also have this color correcting
concealer and I just wanted to point out
real quickly that the consistencies on
these are much thinner I think they're
smoother they're more lightweight
they're easier to blend out I'm not
always one who goes for the lavender or
the mint green you know on my skin to do
color correcting but the peach and pinky
shades in here I've gotten some use out
of also the yellow but I was really
surprised at how these didn't have the
same formula this is
and these are very thick whoo sorry just
had a moment there my camera fell over
bunch of stuff fell off my table here so
let's straighten out just a touch the
last thing I just want to mention here
and I know I've reviewed these
particular lipsticks a while ago but I
got another one and it was not because
I've wanted this lipstick solely I
wanted the lorac unzipped cheek palette
and this alter-ego lipstick came with it
the shade is called girl-next-door it
looks like a decent enough pink shade
but I do not enjoy this formula at all
it feels dry on my lips and not in the
sense that like it starts okay but then
it becomes drying it's just flat-out dry
from when I first put it on my lips I
have not enjoyed several individual
colors I've had and I don't like this
one either the cheek palette is nice I
do enjoy that but if you were getting
this palette and the fact that there was
a lipstick thrown in was really like a
selling point for you I just want you to
know this is not a really comfortable
lipstick formula pigment wise you know
it will show up on your lips there's not
a lack of richness of color as you guys
know if you've watched me for any length
of time I'm a big field person when it
comes to lip it's hard to forget when
you're wearing an uncomfortable lip
product it's like always on there you're
taking a drink of something you're
talking and it's hard to let go of the
thought that there's something annoying
on my mouth so guys those are my recent
makeup fails if any of those work for
you I say more power to you but they
just didn't work for me and I like to be
able to share that information with you
every now and then so thanks again for
watching and I'll see you next time bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
