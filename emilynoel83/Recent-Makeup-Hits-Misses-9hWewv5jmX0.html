video on this is kind of like an
unfinished business video basically
there have been times where I have
mentioned a product may be in a hole or
just kind of an offhand comment oh yeah
I picked this up recently or maybe I
tweeted facebooked about it said
something about it somewhere and I never
went ahead and followed up and reviewed
it so then I start getting tweets and
Facebook so I'm like uh you know I need
to go ahead and tell people what I think
about these things and just take the
time to go ahead and do it so um I'm
going to be taking you through some
high-end some drugstore products and
just kind of giving you a real quick
wrap-up of whether I liked it or didn't
like it and if there's something you
know that I have that you don't see in
this video that you want an explanation
on let me know in the comments section
there's a chance it may be in a video
feature at all all by itself or you know
I maybe I just forgot about it so let me
know I also wanted to make sure I got
this done before a drugstore haul video
coming up that I wanted to do and before
the emily awards so before I pile on
more product recommendations on top of
you I wanted to kind of you know recap
and follow up on those things that I
just sort of mentioned over the past I
don't know a couple of months or so so
yeah let's go ahead and get started
first thing is the two-faced amazing
face skin balance flexible coverage
foundation powder purchase this not too
long ago really cute packaging I am a
big fan of this powder this is this
powder keeps me my skin Matt longer than
most other powders I've tried it comes
with a little sponge I feel like it
gives really good coverage if you really
want amazing coverage use this like on
certain areas on top of foundation what
all sometimes do before the news when I
want really really good coverage
foundation and then do this on my t-zone
area so and that works well for me I
feel like it just I mean maybe it's just
a combination of what foundation I'm
using it with or whatever but this has
worked really performed well for me and
I've
and recommend that to someone who's
willing to pay maybe just a little bit
more for a powder that really works for
stint keeping you Matt next up product
from hard candy and it's the glamour
flage heavy duty concealer this I have
in what's my shade light oh and what
lose my shade in the powder perfect nude
this is light what this is is a very
heavy duty full-coverage concealer and
you know what I really do like this this
manages to be light it doesn't get cakey
because it's in this squeeze tube I mean
it's not heavy thick creamy a tiny bit
seems to go a long way and as i was
using this it reminded me of a product
that i have that i also really really
liked i blogged about this long ago and
it's the kat von d tattoo concealer
these two are so similar so if you want
to save money get the hard candy glam of
collage however I got this in light and
I think it may be a little light for me
I think maybe I should have gone with
medium however I was still able to tell
that overall the coverage was really
good and I liked it a lot and so just
keep in mind little goes a long way with
that another hard candy product is the
hide and glow cheek and it is a duo
cheek tint my shade is hot date so I got
the one that I thought would be the
brightest so I could really tell how
much of a whether or not there's really
packed a punch or not so one shade
bright pink to swatch it for you and
blend it it's right there seems a little
subtle to me I would expect a little
more pop of color with that and also
really kind of disappointed with the
lack of color pop on the darkest shade
I've just watched it there and gave it a
quick blend and that's what I came out
with if you're going to spend your money
on a cream blush and you want it to be
drug store I would say the NYC blush
uble cream sticks are better than this
this does try to get into that realm of
like a cheek stain but I don't think it
quite does it successful matchbox photo
finish light this is the oil free
version of their primer so it's going to
go on and feel maybe a little less heavy
than the g
formula and it's just kind of creamy if
I could show you here just get a little
bit out and as i rub that on I mean it
does look like a cream but it dries to
just nothing and it still gives you not
quite as silky feel as regular Smashbox
photo finish does but still pretty
smooth and silky and just the foundation
really does glide on on top of this and
this I'm wondering in conjunction with
this over my foundation so this under
this over foundation sandwiched in
between them I think things have been
turning up a little less greasy on my
t-zone as a result next up a couple of
drugstore mascaras this is the almay one
coat dialup mascara and the concept with
this is that you are going to turn if we
put there we go we focused you got the
three the 2 and the 1 and so you're
going to set it to three if you want
whoa you're going to set it to three if
you want to fly out of your hand like
that no just kidding three is most
volume 2 is in the middle and one as I
guess more natural lashes I find this to
be kind of gimmicky and I really didn't
notice I mean I noticed a decent amount
of difference between one and three and
the whole concept is is that you click
it to one or the other and then on the
little stopper that your brush that kind
of cleans off your brush either becomes
more restrictive and pulls off more
product when you have it set to one or
two and then it gets more wide open when
you set it to three so more product
stays on the brush and more goes on your
lashes I would have it set to three all
the time I mean I'm sorry call me crazy
but i never have days when i wake up and
say I just want kind of average looking
eyelashes today I just what average
while I know I want a big all the time
as big as possible and this isn't a bad
quality mascara but I feel like it's
just kind of gimmicky with the one two
and three it's trying to make you think
you've got all these options when really
it's not vastly different one to the
next and I mean I would always wanted it
three anyway I thought it war rather
well but it's still not as big and bold
as even my L'Oreal voluminous carbon
black so it's
like and I wouldn't buy it again lash
blast fusion this is the lash blast in
the purple tube it's supposed to be you
know that hybrid of length and volume
and whatever and I tried it and the
brush to me looks the same as regular
lash blast and I felt like it performed
just like regular lash blast to be
honest it's kind of like you prefer an
orange tube or a purple tube it's this
it's it's what brands do they barely
change their product they come out with
something different to try to make you
buy it I bought it and it's kind of like
okay I don't see the big difference
between this and regular lash blast it
didn't smudge it wore well it defined
the lashes I don't mind regular lash
blast my point is that this is just not
very different from it so take your pick
purple or orange because they basically
do the same thing overall I do like lash
blast as a mascara though a couple of
foundations Maybelline Dream liquid
mousse had really high hopes for this
foundation I thought it was going to be
great and when I put it on my skin I
felt like I knew it was going to be
awesome until maybe just a couple hours
passed and my nose was so shiny I wore
this on when I went to Nashville had my
trip there with Kaylee there was one of
my pictures I look back on and thought
when did my face turn into an oil slick
because right here the nose primarily a
little bit on the forehead and chin but
mainly the nose I was like good lord you
know I just had that foundation on for
maybe an hour at bay and I was so
confused but I love the way it looks
right when you put it on but it just
apparently the oils in your skin can
really break this down quickly next is
the mac pro longwear spf10 foundation
this was sort of a letdown for me this
is a high-end foundation I was really
expecting a lot I felt like this sort of
oxidized on my skin as the day went on
in other words turned a little bit
orangi looking didn't stay true to its
color when I first put it on in the day
I felt like my skin got a little oily as
I wore it and I don't get that with
Revlon Colorstay so revlon colorstay
wins out over this one i also had a
little bit of breakout going
around my nose and once I stopped using
this consistently i noticed that i
didn't have that problem any mom a lip
gloss that I tried that I really liked
is from NYX and it's called sweetheart
and I think this might have been a
product I mentioned in a hall if you're
looking for a really pretty and I have
it on right now kind of a peachy pink
lip gloss this one's so good I really
like the mega shine lip glosses as a
whole and this is a very good one so I'm
happy with that also really raving about
the NYX lip liners I have several of
them one is beige one is rose and the
other one is mahogany and mahogany I
want to talk about in particular because
this shade if i were to swatch it for
you here see that color there that
actually works very nicely if you have
sort of a nude lip or a neutral lip and
you're thinking men if I could just have
my lips looking a little more defined
I'm not saying draw a darker line around
them but if you use this sort of to
blend like you you start kind of filling
in and filling in and then kind of
leaving it a little lighter at the
center of your lower lip you have such a
pretty neutral lip and it's not brown
but it's just got a little more I don't
know maybe spice to it or something that
kind of that spicy color that gives a
little more brightness to your face and
I just really like this this is kind of
like my little transformer lip pencil
and so creamy it's really easy to fill
in your lips with if you want to the
Makeup Forever HD powder I have the
small size of this i think that the elf
HD powder is every bit as good as this
if not better and i will not buy this
again and I will continue to repurchase
my five dollar elf HD powder I run out
pretty much run out of my elf and so I
thought I'd give this a go see if it was
way way better no I don't think so i
feel like the elf even clings to my
brush a little better i don't know what
it is but they both appear the same on
my face but the elf just goes on a
little easier and
I mean there's such a drastic price
difference there i'm just going to go
without you know um what else do I have
oh one more thing from Mac it's the
Blitz and glitz fluid line and I don't
have any other fluid lines so I'm just
basically judging this as do I like Mac
fluid lines right or not and I'd say
totally yes this went on so so smooth
this color in particular I got this with
i believe it was with one of the holiday
sets and if you look closely at that i
don't know if you can tell but there is
a little bit of sparkle with that i
really really enjoy this and i also am a
huge fan of the little brush that came
with it and it is a 209 SE sorry not
super super familiar with the mac
brushes but this little brush is quite
quite good in terms of getting that on
and sometimes with cream liners it just
takes me a long time to get them on
because i'm like always having to dip
back in and the brush isn't quite right
or something's not right with the
formula but this all just came together
very nicely so very happy with that food
line alright guys that about does it for
the products that i'm following up on
right now if you feel I've left
something out just let me know in the
comments section I'll try to look
through all those and get a good idea of
what is still left to talk about but
nonetheless I still do have emily awards
coming up that's kind of my big
favourites videos favorites from the
past year so be on the lookout for those
and i'll have another hall coming soon
some more tutorials on new pallets and
stuff and reviews on new holiday stuff
as you can see what i've talked about
here didn't include any of my holiday
stuff so yeah more on that to come so
thanks again for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
