video we're gonna be moving soon we are
so so excited to make the move get the
whole packing process done with but in
the process of packing things
particularly stuff here in the makeup
room I have rediscovered so many
products that I'm like why was I not
using that I mean we all have those
moments when you're like reorganizing
and you pull out something it's like men
that's gorgeous
I should have been using it more and so
most recently I was going through my
pallets I've got a lot of pallets stored
back here in this clock so that I'd
address that in this video and share
some swatches and let me know if you've
like come across anything in your own
collection that you're like oh why was I
not using it first thing though is the
bone voyage palette I love my eyeshadows
from the balm and these are great but
for some reason has just not been a
palette that's been really on my radar
to use very often and it's really cute I
do have a full video on it it's got this
neat little like passport picture so
when you look in the mirror you actually
see your face like on this torch so
punch I shadow they're all really really
big and then there are three cream blush
slush lip colors down below in their own
little section but this selection of
colors in this palette is really pretty
random I look at this - sometimes I
wonder where do I go with this where do
I begin but I did use it for my look
today I used some of this gold actually
around here in the inner part of my eye
some of the mint green kind of working
outward and then this matte teal is
awesome it's so rich it's just a really
really strong color so I have that kind
of in my outer corner and I used a
combination of these two matte shades in
my crease quality is so good with these
shadows and you've got some like really
dark shades to play with as well so I'm
excited to get back to using that again
another palette that is so darn gorgeous
and I got this for Christmas it's great
if you do like playing with some fun
pops of color and it's the kat von d
palette in Poetica
and this does come with a neat little
there it goes the little black eyeliner
- but look at these gorgeous colors
slants at this I see two distinctly
different color schemes you know you got
your purples and your neutrals but
they're so fun to actually mix together
mix each side together and I believe I
was wearing this in my last beauty
broadcast live session and I worked in
some of this purple on the lid it's like
a really pretty iridescent tight purple
and then blend it out with some of the
cops are so much fun this is a really
seriously beautiful palette I also have
Kat Von D's Lady Bird palette which is a
lot of this kind of color scheme but
it's all matte just getting back to
using this really reminded me how
wonderful the texture is yes I skipped
over this one I was talking about the
phone but my meet matte nude this one
was hiding from me I have a little thing
that looks like a like a letter
organizer or something and my shorter
palettes kind of dip down below where I
can even see them and really isn't it
just a matter of seeing what you have to
help you actually use it like it just
has to be in view and then I think
there's probably like a 75% better
chance that you're gonna pick it up and
use it but if you love mattes and you
love neutrals this is awesome again same
kind of sizing on the shadows as the bon
voyage palette that I mentioned you're
like what I'm going toward mattes
I've been picking up my it cosmetics
naturally pretty palette which I love
but this is great also and just the
intensity of every single color is
outstanding purely matte Shea and also
just kind of nice if you need that one
basic like super dark brown you know
you've got it in here and you can work
it in with other shadows like your
singles or other palettes that are
lacking those kinds of shades and then
just a couple more neutral palettes that
I totally adore but have not been
getting use out of lately
as my Coastal Scents revealed palette
this I did an extensive blogpost showing
every shade in here and how it's either
a dupe for naked one or
get to so if you really want to save
some money I think the sells for like
around 19 bucks or something on Coastal
Scents website and really nicely
pigmented colors matte and shimmer and
like some really metallic shades in
there as well so I'll definitely link to
the post below where I mapped out all
the dupes because it's not necessarily
like a straight across like here's naked
one here's naked 2 it's kind of all over
the place if you've just been curious
about naked palettes but held off what a
great way to get like tons of those
shades I wish they put a mirror in here
that's kind of a downfall if you're
using this for travel and then also my
Sigma warm neutral smell this was
something that I know it been blogged
about in the past but just hasn't been
used real often or talked about very
frequently in my videos but I find the
textures of these shadows and anyone
else you know chime in if you've got
this but don't they feel pretty similar
to like the softness of LA rocks I shed
I love on some of the mats that are in
here because these kind of warm shades I
know they've got a great single called I
think it's topaz and it reminds me alive
this color right here some great pinks
this shade right up my alley like deep
burgundy plum it's just so great for
those soft pretty eye looks that you
want just blend it up into nothingness
you know like just that perfect diffused
blend on the outside of your eye there
are a lot of great like blendy kind of
shades here in both matte and shimmery
finishes and I don't even find the
shimmery stuff to be that like
outrageous either but those would
definitely be my five pallets that in my
packing process I fell in love with all
over again and I'm just gonna definitely
make a point to use these as we go
throughout the summer and as you can see
I kind of like them all for different
reasons like the Kat Von D and the bon
voyage you know great for those little
pops of color basic matte shades the
meet matte nude is awesome and then a
couple of pretty affordable neutral
options you know with the Sigma one and
those pretty pinks that I love and then
the revealed palette that's just
chock-full of naked and naked - dupes so
thank you for taking time to watch this
video guys it's probably going to be one
of my last videos that you see in this
makeup room so I hope you enjoyed it
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
