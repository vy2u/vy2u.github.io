products I love shopping my stash I like
digging through my drawers and finding
things that have been neglected and
trying to bring them back into the
rotation because this happens if you
have a big makeup collection it's really
easy to get caught up in the new
products this new palette that do
palette and then you look at the things
you already have and you're like why
have I not been using this so I'm gonna
start using it before it's too late and
I'm really enjoying this little floral
headband this was sent by Tarte in with
some brushes so I don't know it just
makes me happy it makes me smile to have
this on so that quite a few thinks
sitting in front of me here also I was
tagged in Cristen games favourite
shadows for a1 shadow look video and I
thought it might combine those in this
because I really haven't been using
enough of my shadows singles lately I've
been in full-on palette mode with a lot
of new palettes so I thought it would
pull some out that I want to be using
more and mentioned those so things I've
kind of shot my stash for there but
start off I want to mention this Ben Nye
cameo luxury powder now Ben Nye is
really the original behind the banana
powder that has really found its way
into a lot of contouring palettes but
they made the original like Ben Nye
yellowish tone loose powder in
containers like this and when that was
really hot I got that I also got a
couple of other shades including cameo
and I forgot how much I enjoyed using
this as an under eye setting powder and
yeah I've got like a ton of it here how
much is this it's like a three ounce
container of it what I like about this
is that it's a very very similar tone to
bare minerals well rested which I find
to be a really brightening topper for
any sort of under-eye concealer
especially if it's a concealer that
stays a little dewy tacky or really
needs to be set i've liked using that
product on top the one flaw of that
product is that i think you can easily
use a little too much at times if you're
not really careful and as the day goes
on that can look a little bit heavy in
that area
this however maintains that tone and
brightening effect not with shimmer but
just by the tone of the powder and it's
very very lightweight so i've been
enjoying this a whole bunch lately i'm
really glad
I pulled it out again the way I used it
I just kind of give it a little shake
before I open it up and then there's
usually just you may not even be able to
see it there but there's a little bit in
the cap and I just pick that up with the
brush that I usually use in that area
this is my Smashbox number 10 any kind
of fluffy crease brush Real Techniques
has a brush actually called the setting
brush that would be a really nice size
for this area I like using something
that's got a little fluff to it though
not so much a flat concealer brush
because I think those can carry a little
more product and pack on a bit more than
I want and these brushes can be a little
more wispy and just give you that light
application another product that's more
of a brightener than a concealer that
I've been using more is my Estee Lauder
Double Wear brush on glow BB highlight
and I have it in soft pink and I do have
a full review on this that I did I
believe it was last summer on the
Express channel and this is one of those
twist up products you know kind of a pin
style highlight it does have a little
bit of a pinky tone and you would shear
it out and it gives you kind of a
highlighted look right up in here and I
am wearing this today and I'm finding
I'm liking it a whole lot better now
that I'm not dealing with my melasma
issue because they're what I was needing
to do was really pay attention to
concealing and then to go on top of that
with any kind of liquid consistency
highlight would sometimes take away some
of my concealer coverage that I had
built up if that makes sense
so now that I'm not really doing all
that heavy duty concealing in that area
or coverage with foundation or whatever
it may be I feel like I can get a little
more good out of these liquidy
brighteners so this was one that you
know I spent some money on it I do want
to be using it and so I've pulled that
out back into my rotation again another
thing that I have rediscovered
absolutely loved this and I'm kicking
myself for ever having kind of forgotten
about it but it's the Milani brow and
eye highlighter this is the one in matte
cream and luminous lift so it's a
double-ended pencil and one just as I
said is gosh did I just spit all over
that but this one is creamy a little bit
I would say pinky toned
so and then this one has a little bit of
glow to it and it's so great used right
up here under the brow gives a really
clean look there you could draw this all
over the lid it becomes a nude base the
other day I actually tried it in my
lower inner rim it didn't last quite as
well as my almond cream pencil but I
mean it did give me some at least
temporary brightness in that area so I
just loved that a rediscovered eye brush
that I've been wanting to use a lot more
here over you know the past several
weeks has been my pencil brush from
Sigma and if you're kind of thinking
about what you already own it wouldn't
have to be this brush but maybe you have
a pencil brush from another brand but in
the context of my collection this has a
little more fullness than the e21 smudge
brush that I reach for quite often which
I still love that brush but this is just
really great for getting a very very
smoky look on the lower lash line so
today for example I worked in a deeper
shade with the smudge brush I'm going in
more toward the liner but then
everything that's kind of the bulk of
the color that's right there on the
lower lash line I used with this what
are all the lights and all the things my
see you later
well this is how it goes folks this is
real life so I'm gonna have my little
companion sitting down here he might
even chime in and tell you a few of her
thoughts as well gonna just jump in and
mention a few blushes one of them that
really prompted the whole idea for this
video for me is benefits Dallas this was
mentioned in my understated blushes
video there's products that don't seem
to be all that great at a glance but I
tell you what I love this shade and I
really like using it a little lower on
the cheek I'm wearing it right here
today and I just think it's so beautiful
it's kind of that pretty dusty plum
color but I elaborated quite a bit on
that
other video also a highlight type
product that I really haven't been
getting nearly enough use out of and I
am wearing this today it's my Cindy
Luminizer I've been using my mary-lou
manizer more here in there but this is
the one that actually has more of a
peachy tone to it so kind of a I don't
know it makes me think a little bit of a
rose gold miss to that are you gonna
hold that down there it's really
beautiful it's just like a pretty I
don't know blush topper type product
because the amount of color that's in
this it does kind of accentuate or bring
out more of a peach eNOS in a lot of the
blushes I use with it and here's another
really unique product that I hardly used
it all that I have been getting a lot of
use out of its my Smashbox Oh glow I
don't even know when I got this but this
is a product that it squeezes out of the
tube clear and it kind of has the
texture of Smashbox photo finish primer
but do you see any of the pink coming
out of that I really notice it on my
cheeks as I rub it into the apples of my
cheeks first off it rubs in very easily
with fingers rediscovered palette this
is the palette of spring I love this so
much my romantic eye palette it's
gorgeous you guys I've raved about this
in past years it's just so beautiful for
those few pops of color you know if you
are not a big color person but you just
need something that's gonna get you into
it a little bit that gorgeous pistachio
color at the bottom there's some pretty
plums and purpley shades today I am
wearing this I've got that shade called
honey moon that's the green on the lid a
little bit of this shade called
Everafter that's right beside it that's
kind of worked up into my crease and
slightly above I don't get much use out
of that shade in this palette normally
but it's great and then I've got cut the
cake and first-dance those are those two
plummy shades or ones a lilac ones a
plum down on the lower lash line so you
got a nice balance of matte and shimmer
in here the quality is some of two-faced
best quality I think in this palette so
I'm glad I pulled that out again because
it really makes me think spring and then
single shadows these are things that I
am setting out for myself as products
that I
want to use more of and several of these
these first few that I'm going to
mention are great for the one shadow
looks like Kristen was talking about in
her tag and one is the elf pressed
mineral shadow and this is called wine
tour look at this unique shade it's a
dusty lavender shade with a golden
shimmer in it it's really really pretty
and I love the texture of these pressed
mineral shadows was wearing this as a
one shadow look the other day all over
the lid blended up into the crease just
a bit and then also smoked out with that
pencil brush that I mentioned on the
lower lash line really pretty a very
subtle way to wear purple I love that
shade majorly rediscovered beauty right
here this is the infallible single from
L'Oreal and bronzed taupe this is so so
perfect for all over the lid and into
the crease I'm about positive I
mentioned this the first time I did a
one shadow looks type of video right for
those of you who don't want to even
think about like okay what color am I
going to put on my eyes and will that
work with my lip color and blah blah
blah this will work with anything it's
really neutral but has a really pretty
sheen on the lids that kind of makes you
think you did a little bit more work
than you actually did do if that makes
sense and on the topic of l'oreal
infallible did you know as I was a Sally
Beauty Supply I saw that femme Couture
is making a very similar style eyeshadow
for a little less per shadow I'll have
to double check but I think these were
like a couple dollars less than what a
L'Oreal infallible single costs I have
one in pyrite this is kind of like a
taupe with a little bit of purple in it
very unique type color really like it
and then I got emerald a really pretty
green it's more of like a teal type
color than a really true true green but
I enjoy it those are not so much
rediscovered as like a recent find I
really want to be getting some use out
of and then a couple of other singles
that I think you might find are just
great accessories to an overall look not
necessarily a one shadow look the one
shadow shades the things I think work
best in that way are kind of mid-tone
shadows that aren't too light aren't too
dark and have just a hint of shimmer or
sheen to them because then they recede
into the crease and look deeper but look
brighter on the lid that's the whole
concept behind one shadow looks for me
anyway a rediscovered single that I love
is a Sally girl single and
champagne this has a beautiful Sheen to
it
could make a nice even cheek highlight
it's very pigmented I think what that
little 99 cent shadow what goods that
gonna be it's really really nice I must
say and then hold the phones I've got a
cargo shadow I got this off of hope look
did not use it nearly enough
is this a darkest Brown the darkest
richest brown ever it's called Columbia
I'm thinking a crease shade I'm thinking
a liner shade I why am I not using this
and this is rich and soso dark how we
doing down there cutie rediscovered lips
number one oh I'm glad you're here for
this one this is actually fake from bite
this is what I've been wearing in this
video and this reminds me of like I
don't know fresh beautiful baby lips
kind of reminds me of her pretty lips
here like look at her lips and the
beautiful like just natural kind of
pinkness they have there that's what
this makes me think of because there's
not a lot of excessive shine when you
put this on your lips it doesn't have
shimmer or anything it just gives that
look of like the lips you had when you
were younger you know so that is bite
fig I have it here in a duo the
full-size would look a little different
from that now if you're into the cool
toned pinky nudes I had this on in a
recent video this is my matte lip color
from ELF in T Rose got so many questions
and compliments on this shade and these
are like twists up kind of skinny sticks
they remind me a little bit of the
colour-pop lippie but weren't alone this
has that nice matte finish I don't think
it's too drying but sometimes just for
effect I like to put a little bit of a
gloss on top speaking of something
that's kind of like a hybrid gloss /
balm I mean these give my lips shine but
I think they're very very comfortable on
the lips and they're colorless as well
do you want to grab those - those look
like fun these are from CEO Bigelow I
got them from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and one
is the lemon and pomegranate lip cream
smells so good like this is aromatherapy
in a tube for sure I mentioned this on
Instagram I just love that and then also
loving the cinnamon supreme 2x I don't
know it just brings a totally different
like scent experience to your mind when
you're wearing this and it says twice
the moisturizers twice the breath
fresheners so that's a really cool one
color that I'm really wanting to wear
more of as we get into spring and summer
are those Reds that have kind of like
that teeny teeny bit of an orange II
twist to them and one that's really cool
that's a little more on the shear side I
think it's very wearable is this one
from Revlon it's the shine formula of
their Super Lustrous lipstick and this
shade is called rich girl dread it's
wearing this just around the house the
other day really really like the way it
look I think at first I may have been a
little bit critical of this formula
because I was like oh that's not as
full-color as a regular Super Lustrous
lipstick is now for whatever reason I'm
kind of appreciating it a little more
just liking this for the color and I
actually think the Sheerness makes it
seem kind of you know low effort low
maintenance seems a little less fussy on
the lips I guess is what I'm trying to
say that is all I've got for you which
it seems like a lot for this
rediscovered favorites type video and
it's really fun to shop your stash it's
the cheapest way to show up I tell you
to look through the things you already
have and just picking out some products
that have been underused that need a
little more love thanks for joining
we'll see you again next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
