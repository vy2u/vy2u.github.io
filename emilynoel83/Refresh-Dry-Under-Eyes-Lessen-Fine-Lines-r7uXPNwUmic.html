about the crazy hair I've been cleaning
I've been doing stuff all over the place
and when you look at yourself in the
mirror toward the end of a day I don't
know about you guys but my eyes tend to
settle on one particular area of my face
and it is this area right in here
right in let's get all up in there for
you it's right under the eye and it
starts to look a little dry and you
start to see the lines a little bit more
this area look totally fresh right after
I did my makeup nose great long wearing
products and great coverage products but
as the day goes on they just don't
always end up looking perfect you know
like it did when you start just a quick
video I want to tell you about something
that has just been awesome for me for
being that little you know late in the
day or nighttime touch-up for the under
eye area to refresh it to bring it back
to life but yet to not take away the
work you've done earlier in the day
that's given you good coverage and it's
the elf daily moisture stick okay I got
this from the elf website that's eyes
lips face coms is enriched with
antioxidants and anti-aging ingredients
grape cocoa shea avocado macadamia aloe
and chamomile so this is a big honkin
stick of moisture-rich product it feels
maybe like you know lip balm does and
it's just got a lot of nice moisture in
there and what I like to do for my under
eye area is I just moisten one finger my
ring finger my middle finger whatever
and then let's get close there then I
like to just gently dab it and oh it has
the nicest little cooling feel as well
but I do it on one side and then I do it
on the other side just dab it on those
areas where you see lines and settling
and that is enough just one little dab
there it feels nice and cool if you have
other areas other lines on your face
where you feel like stuff starts to look
dry
just dab over it with this and it's
amazing you know I wouldn't recommend
just taking the whole stick and going up
under it
cuz it would be too much and it would
probably mess up your makeup and just
taking you know moisturizer and going
over it you know that would be you know
a little bit too much - but to be able
to go over finish makeup and just get a
little bit on your finger and just dab
right over those areas it's like
something about it like re rehydrates
you and it makes everything look a
little bit fresher and like new again so
I just wanted to tell you guys about
this I've been so excited ever since
I've been doing it and this type of
thing I mean you stick it in your car
your purse your desk wherever you're at
and just super handy wanted to let you
know thank you so much for watching I'll
see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
