joining me for this video this is going
to be a review of a new hair styling
device that I am really really liking
lately and it is from Remington and it
is called the T studio pearl ceramic
professional styling wand had to refer
the website to make sure I got that
whole name out there but um this is a
really cool styling tool it's different
from anything I've tried before why
because it is a curling iron but it has
no little clamp you know honest so
you're basically just wrapping your hair
around this and I was kind of feeling
like oh I'm probably not going to get
near the results I get with a normal
curling iron well that is not the case I
really really love the kind of curl this
gives and basically I'm kind of I've got
it open here on the website so i can
tell you the basics of the features it
is a one inch to a half inch styling
wand so basically you're one inch here
at your widest point and then it's going
down to happen which is a pretty small
curling iron when you get down here to
the bottom and I find sometimes the one
difficulty I have with this is sometimes
depending on how I hold it you know
comfort wise sometimes I'll be at a
certain angle and all my hair will want
to come down toward this in and get a
really small curl but that's okay I feel
like when you're getting down toward
this half of the styling wand as it's
called I feel like you get those those
curls that kind of remind you a little
bit of like Taylor Swift curls because
they're definitely a little bit tighter
than your average you know big
voluminous you know hot roller tight
curls and so there are a few different
factors when you're using this that I
think impact what kind of results you
get number one would be how much hair
you put around the styling wand at the
time I could grab out some hair here to
show you and if I put a big bunch around
it if I grabbed this whole hunk of hair
right down here and I don't have it
plugged in right now that's why I'm just
kind of messing around but you know you
just wrap it around like that and this
actually comes with a glove
so you if you don't like holding your
fingers too close to this you could use
the glove I didn't like the glove really
so I just use my hand and try to keep it
from getting too close but um anyway as
I was saying number one you know if you
put a lot of hair around this you're not
going to get as tight of a curl if you
you don't have to hold the hair on it
that long but the longer you do keep it
on there the once again the tighter curl
you're going to get and also um you know
there are different heat settings as
well on this basically it's got a little
digital readout so if this is plugged in
it's got a digital read out there and
it's got an up or down button to make it
hotter or cooler and then it's got a
power button there as well this also
does have in terms of features just want
to let you know um it's a 410 degree
heat that's the highest it gets has the
automatic shutoff it does come with that
glove and a four year warranty so I got
this for about 25 bucks at Target and
like I said I got it thinking this is
not going to give me the long-lasting
curl that I get with a regular curling
iron well really you know my curls don't
last all that long with a curling iron
being out in the wind like I was today
if I had done my hair with a regular
curling iron I mean it would be gone by
now the curl would but this kind of hair
like I mean if you want to go an extra
day your hair will hold this it's
amazing um you know I have fine hair
that doesn't necessarily take to occur
that easily but I was really surprised
at how after you know a day you know you
can even sleep on this ends like oh my
gosh I still have a nice amount of curl
here I realized I shouldn't have
probably worn a black shirt for this to
just lay it over here but um it is nice
the one thing to just keep in mind is
that this a half inch the smallest part
of this is a very tight curl so be aware
that the curl can be small but what's
neat about this and the way I like for
my layered hair I mean as you can see
here if I pull it out here I've got some
short layers up in there on but what I
like is that if I'm using it this way
and I'm twisting my hair around it I'm
getting more of just in
natural wave up towards the top and I'm
getting more of the curl down toward the
bottom and so I love that for my style
because then I don't have you know big
big curly hair up here but it's more
smooth and then it gradually goes down
into this slightly more curly look so
I've gotten questions about this when
I've worn my hair this way in different
videos that I've done lately it's not
too expensive I know there were other
products like this I'm not sure if you
know of other brands that you really
like I mean maybe share in the comments
section this is the only one like this
that I've tried it is light pink by the
way I don't know if that's coming
through on camera but that's kind of
cute as well thanks a lot for taking the
time to watch this review I mean you
could definitely rock this look with
your hair down or putting it up I mean
this would make an adorable ponytail or
some kind of updo where you just want to
give your hair more texture this is
definitely great for that for setting
the style however something I'll do is
just you know go all over it with this
and then just give a little spritz of
hairspray all around and then maybe tees
it up in the roots just a little bit to
create more body up in here as well
because you've got a lot going on down
here it kind of balances it out a little
bit just how I like to do it you don't
have to do it that way but thanks a lot
again for watching and have a wonderful
day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
