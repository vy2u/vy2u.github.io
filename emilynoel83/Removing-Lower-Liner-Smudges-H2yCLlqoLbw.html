video I wanted to show you something
that is a very very common problem that
people have and this is sort of a
tutorial and you might think well your
makeups done well that's because this is
kind of a tutorial on removing a problem
that can develop by the end of the day
now for me working in morning news this
is getting towards the end of my day and
as you can see which I hope this shows
because I can definitely see it as I
look at head on in my mirror this may
not show up on camera but my eyeliner is
creating a little bit of a problem now
under my eye you can see how that how
many of you have had this look at times
it looks like your eyeliner is just kind
of slowly sinking down right here
underneath what's happening on both of
my eyes and I wanted to show you two
different remedy ways that I remedy this
that you can get rid of that and
immediately freshen up your look and so
on this side what I'm going to show you
first off everybody needs to keep q-tips
both at home readily available and also
in your makeup bag this first one is
something that you may use while you're
at home and you actually have a bottle
of I makeup remover handy this is just a
from target its oil free it says
compared to L'Oreal I makeup remover so
it's like a generic of L'Oreal but the
first thing i would do to remedy this is
just moisten the end of your q-tip i'm
going to show you this method on this i
only and what i'm going to do is just
lightly without rubbing too much just go
right over the area not over i'm not
going on top of all my liner but just
over the smudged up looking area and
then take the other end that was dry and
go over it and in basically now you've
gotten rid of the problem but what have
you also gotten rid of well you got rid
of any make
that was originally underneath there
like you put can you should put
concealer when you do under eye
concealer that should go all the way up
to your under eye area now that's taken
off since I've used makeup remover so if
I want to refresh the line then I may
take out my say my revlon colorstay
black liner lightly go over my line
again many people say how do you keep
from getting it on your lower lashes
well it's almost inevitable when you're
doing a liner on your lower line so I
just kind of grabbed my lower lashes
very lightly and you can sometimes see
some wire come off and that's the best
way I've come up with to do it then we
want to make sure this stays so I'm
going to take a liner brush and dip it
in some eyeshadow powder I'm just using
a dark brown from Smashbox right now and
I'm just going over that line that I
just redid this will give it staying
power for you know at least another six
hours or so this could take you through
an evening if you went through the end
of your day and you notice you're having
problems this method could get you
through the night then I'm just dip into
a pressed powder or loose powder if you
have it whatever you have this is revlon
colorstay just getting into it with a
concealer brush that I reserved for dry
and I'm just going right up to just
beneath um where I have the liner I'm
getting
they're okay there you go you're done
and you've removed that and this may
look a little dramatic to you because I
you know typically wouldn't maybe go
over it because you don't have to you
can just remove replace with a little
powder and be done no added intensity
whatsoever but if you do want to finish
look that's you getting you can see
there's no more crazy shadow underneath
and now the other side what I want to
show you is something that you can do
more so when you're out on the go and
then you just realize oh my gosh my
eyeliner on the lower line is running on
me there is something that Revlon makes
called a makeup eraser pen and what this
basically is if you've ever seen within
with nail products when you mess up on
your nails and you can use that little
pin with nail polish remover to get rid
of the mistakes on the sides that's what
this is only what I makeup remover okay
this is just a pin that has I makeup
remover in it okay so um I think it's
like oil free it's not really greasy or
anything but you can use this much like
you used your q-tip before but i cannot
stress enough this does leave like if
you wrote on your hand with it with you
it wouldn't show up here but you would
see a liquidy slightly liquidy residue
with this so you need to get a fresh
q-tip this is why it's essential to have
these in your makeup bag because you can
carry this and acute it and remove your
problem so just go over the problem spot
with your pin okay then take your that
way I mean you might do that but you're
not you're only going if you left it at
that you would have so much makeup
running down there because the remover
would start to seep into your other area
so it's like this is a good product but
they almost need to forewarn people to
use q-tips because if you use it alone
and just let it stay there you know the
rest of your makeup is going to
eventually come off with that so you
need to anytime you
any kind of remove around your eye and
you're not planning to totally undo your
look you need to get it off there so now
I've removed that and then I could once
again just the very same method i just
did I could go back and intensify the
line we you know go over it again or I
could just do what I'm going to do now
just take some powder this is a really
quick step and just go right over the
area that I just put the remover on I've
dried up the remover so it's no longer
there and there you go once again no
weird smudgy line down there so that's
just one of two ways could you just use
the puff yes but it can sometimes be
hard to get in those small little places
so that's why I reserved a concealer
brush for small areas like that so um
you know this is just one of those
things that a lot of people ask how can
you keep your eyeliner on your lower
lashline and I would love to say that
there's just some Universal fix I mean
I've had a video out there for long
lasting lower liner and I stand by that
I mean I really believe that that works
but if you're going through a really
long day or you've been squinting or
looking down a lot or you know any
number of things can provoke your liner
to get a little bit smudge they're not
totally come off but just get a little
less finished looking and so these are a
couple of ways if you're back at your
makeup table and you have access to a
remover or you have an access to this
great makeup remover makeup corrector
pen from Revlon it's actually called the
makeup eraser pen those are two very
good ways but you do need q-tips which
are very cheap one of the most
economical beauty buys you can have with
you and then just have some powder handy
that is the minimum thing that you need
to once again protect the look from
running and as always you can go over it
with some liner top that with a
coordinating shadow and you'll be great
for you know at least another good while
so before it starts to run so I hope you
guys found that helpful i hope that kind
of clear
some questions people have one oh my
gosh what do I do when this happens
because you do not need to totally redo
your face you can make some simple
Corrections like that and make it easy
on yourself so thank you guys for
watching hope you're having a great day
and we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
