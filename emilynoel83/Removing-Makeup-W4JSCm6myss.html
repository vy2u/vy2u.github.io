this video glad to have you with me I'm
going to be talking about how I remove
my makeup and this is not going to
necessarily cover all of skincare I will
be doing more skin care related videos
in the future on different topics like
moisturizing and just all kinds of
things but this one specifically going
to focus on removing makeup so um just
to show you how I do it oh by the way I
wanted to let you know what's on my lips
in case you wondered it is the cover
girl wet slicks fruit spritzers and
berry splash so just a really light
pastel pink there on my lips and if you
were wondering but Kaylee had on her
lips in that last video because I
noticed some people were asking she has
on mac lipstick and angel which is a
nice light pretty pink and then over the
top of that we used revlon super
lustrous lip gloss and foiled which is
it really really pretty very reflective
light light shimmery shades so just to
clear that up and anyway moving on to
the topic of this video however remove
my makeup the main thing I use are the
OA daily facial slots I've talked about
these in previous videos and I think
some people still aren't it's not quite
clear that yes these do the entire job
for me in terms of getting my makeup off
all the face makeup all the eye makeup
and I have a double pack of these right
here there's 30 in each box and I think
you save a little money by getting like
two or if you go to like a big like
discount club or something you know a
place that sells items in bulk that
might be a good way to go can you know
you're going to use these all the time I
only use these once a day I use them at
the end of every day what I remove my
makeup whether I'm just doing it at the
sink or in the shower and this is what
one looks like one side has the little
like exfoliating scrubbers on it and
then you unfold it and it's got more of
a smooth side and when you get water on
this it lathers up it's nice and soapy
and it's every bit you know as much
lather as I need to get everything off
of my face um yeah it definitely does a
good job getting in around my eye area
it doesn't irritate my eye I mean I can
get everything off while or alive
line in everything and it does a really
good job even if there's any residue
from like my eyelash glue or anything it
will really really get it off well so I
would recommend these these that I have
are in for our for combination to oily
skin I think they have normal to dry as
well this costs I don't know if I just
mention this but that one box of these
costs between four and five dollars at
Walmart but anyway they do a really
really good job of removing your makeup
I've noticed my skin has been really
clear ever since i've been using him and
i started using them in college because
i thought you know i don't want to have
to do a ton of extra laundry you know
with wash cloths and everything so you
can just use these and you pitch him
when you're done and it's all good
you're all finished so and in terms of
some generic kinds i can't guarantee
that those won't irritate your eyes i
have tried some from say the dollar
store that didn't work quite as well
they didn't have like either the scrubby
side to them or they irritated my eyes
so just beware on that I i mean i can
tell you these work for me but some
people might have more sensitive eyes
than i do so but like i said for me i
can get right in there and it really
really does a good job of taking
everything off um more often than not i
will not need to use a separate eye
makeup remover to get rid of stuff on my
eyes but sometimes you know how you'll
wake up in the morning and you'll have
thought you've got yourself completely
clean but maybe there's like some little
bit of residue that you wake up with
like in the corners of your eye or
around your eye and if i find that and
there i will usually start off my day
when i'm doing my makeup so this this
might sound kind of weird like removing
makeup right before you do it but if I
find like any little you know extras
around my eye I will get that seems
weird got like the extras but i will i
will just get rid of it before I even
start because what's the sense in like
setting yourself back like covering up
stuff that was there the day before you
know doesn't make sense so I'll whip out
a I'm a cup remover for the longest time
now you can see I'm almost out i've been
using the Rimmel gentle eye makeup
remover it says removes waterproof
mascara hits oil-free this worked really
well I can
right there in you know my eye area
doesn't irritate all just dip the q-tip
I'll usually screw up the top dip a
q-tip in and just you know make sure the
area is completely completely clear
before I start doing makeup it's there's
no sense in doing makeup over an area
that has some kind of residue on it um i
was like i said i'm almost out of this
one um so I have a couple I don't know
what's with me in two packs these days
but I got this deal on the almay
oil-free eye makeup remover so that'll
be what i try next and i'll probably be
using that for a really long time and
before I use this Rimmel I used
Neutrogena oil-free eye makeup remover
and that was really good too didn't
irritate my eyes either so anyway
hopefully guys that gives you some ideas
on ways to remove your makeup I know
there are some people to go about this
in a lot of different ways cold creams
and you know lots of different face
washes and stuff like that but I've just
really found something that works and
I've been using this for years and it
really has improved my skin it's kept it
really nice and soft but gotten rid of
all the makeup and then like I said just
doing little touch-ups like with some
eye makeup remover before you start your
makeup will really give you a clean
palette to work with so hope you guys
like this video and maybe just learned a
thing or two hopefully I cleared up some
questions and thanks for watching have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
