in for this video this is going to be a
review of the Stila ultimate steal a set
and this is a set of four eyeshadows to
face products a lip color and a mascara
all in one and the reason why I want to
review this is because I've been getting
to test out some products from website
called Beauty ticket calm and it's a
site that sells a lot of different kinds
of high end makeup at really discounted
prices for example this set would sell
for fifty nine dollars and you get it on
beauty ticket for 2999 and for all these
products I think that's a fantastic deal
and the thing that really appeals to me
about this is that a lot of my viewers
and myself included really enjoy getting
a good value for makeup I focus a lot on
affordable products and the ability to
try out some more high-end products but
still it a good price really appeals to
me so that's why this is such an
interesting website it can be different
discontinued or limited edition products
or just over stock products you know you
may find things that are currently on
the market that they have gotten their
hands on for a discounted price and so
just check it out browse the site and
you can look through by brand there's a
bunch of different brands or there's a
little option for that just says other
brands on there drop-down menu and
they're you may find even more things
they just don't have as much of / brand
but it's a fun site to browse around and
you might really find some good deals
christmas shopping was a fun thing for
me on there because i found some really
nice sets and as i said this is one of
those sets this is sort of a limited
edition set but it has some great
products on there from stila and i have
tried their shadows before i've tried a
few different products here and there
the lip glaze and stuff but this kind of
reintroduced me to the brand i felt like
when i got it and I'm just really
enjoying the things that are in it
actually and I got the what comes in
this is the Stila illuminating tinted
moisturizer SPF 15 and it comes in shade
one um I tested this out I put it all
over my face and I wasn't super pleased
with how its
across my face I felt like it kind of
pulled a little bit i mean it wasn't
like one of those moisturizers that you
just put on your hands and it just lies
all over your face and okay I'm done you
have to kind of work a little bit too I
guess get the moisture of that product
to blend in all over your skin it has a
little bit of thickness to it the fact
that this says shade 1 i'm not really
sure about the whole layout of shades
and where this is concerned but it's
very it's very light but yet it kind of
blends i don't know if you can see how
light this actually is but if I blended
it on my hand here it kind of blends
away to nothing and it has you sort of a
sheer finish there so what I did was
just put that on under my foundation and
I felt like it gave me a nice little
glow underneath not necessarily a glow
you're going to be able to pick up on
that well once you put a foundation a
powder and you know a bunch of other
products on on top of it but still it
gives you a nice glow it might be one of
those products for you know a day when
you just want to get out the door real
quick but perk your skin up right out of
bed and after you wash your face you
know maybe put a little bit of this on
and you'll just have a slightly
rejuvenated look but still not this
isn't a product you would put on for a
lot of coverage other things in this kit
the convertible color this is my first
time trying this product and I must say
I really really like it okay the shade
it's a lip and cheek cream so you can
use it either way it's the shade is
peony and if you look at it here it's
kind of a a mauve shade but it's a very
understated almost bordering on neutral
nude type mob when I put it on my lips I
noticed I and you're not really seeing
that now because I have another product
on on top of it but I put it on my lips
and I really felt like it had a sort of
a there you can see as I spread it on
kind of makes you think of like an I'm
sorry for my horrible nails right now
but it's kind of a nude sort of look to
it up on my lips it really came across
like a perfect kind of slightly
neutrally nude shade then I put it on my
cheeks and I was picking up on a little
bit more of the pinky tone I think it
came across a little more
you'd on my lips because there's more
color naturally in my lips then there
would be on my cheeks so this came
across with a little more color on the
cheeks than the lips but so all purpose
and I could see that being a really
quick fix for people who again I feel
like a lot of the products in this kid
are kind of about convenience getting
right out the door you know and this you
know being able to be a cheap killer and
a lip color is nice don't plan on this
giving you a lot of shine on your lips
though you're going to put it on and
it's going to give you a little bit of
color a little bit of like I said that
neutrally nude tone but it's not going
to be one of those knockout shine type
products but if I'm going to go ahead
and put it on my cheeks I don't think I
want that either so definitely nice if
you want to experiment with a cream
blush and if you decide and I don't
think I like cream blushes you still
have a lip color out of this one so
that's pretty cool another thing I tried
guess I'll go on with the lip products
it's the lip glaze in ultimate pink and
it's spelled like ulta like the makeup
store and the way these work in case
you're not familiar there's a little
clicker down here and the product
actually clicks up through this brush
and so that way you can easily just
brush it on your lips and this smells
amazing i wish i could put my finger on
what kind of smell I'm getting out of
this but it's it's fruity it's and it's
a really light I don't know maybe I'm
getting a little bit of a citrusy sort
of tropical tone to it not coconut
though I don't know what I'm thinking
but I really really love the smell of
this what you're going to get color-wise
is a nice light pearly pink now what
you're seeing on my lips now is I got it
on the convertible color that's probably
long gone now but I I put this on and
then I kind of lined it with a separate
pencil this is not including in the kit
this is from Jordana it's the easy liner
in baby beri just to give it a little
more of the pink tone this is overall
going to be pretty much what you see is
what you get with this you can see in
the product it's a light pearly kind of
somewhat shimmery pink and not overly
sticky by any means I've always kind of
liked how these
consistency of these products I just
haven't really had the opportunity to
try them that much before only just a
little bit here and there but my
goodness it feels great on the lips I
could get a very moisturizing feel out
of this which is very important to me
this time of year the scent is fantastic
I can't stop smelling it when I have it
open so I better just go ahead and close
it but you're going to get a lightish
pink out of this be prepared if you do
want more color so maybe just take a
liner like I did I put on a little bit
of the gloss and then kind of went
around and defined my lips a little more
with the liner because this shade will
not give you much definition and that
can kind of boost the color up just a
little bit all right now let's talk
about the eye products the shadows I am
wearing a couple of them now and
basically you're going to get for
shadows out of this one shade is go
lightly and this I would describe as a
light brown with golden tones and as you
can see as it hits the light oh it looks
very light and then gets a little deeper
if the light is not directly on it this
is going to be the deepest shade you get
in the set so this can be a light
contour shade and another shade you get
in this is kitten which I know is a
favorite of a lot of steel of fans what
you're looking at what this is sort of a
kind of a pinky under toned light
shimmery shade that would make a
fantastic highlight or an all over the
lid shade with my eye look today I'm
using both of these shades I used kitten
all over the lid and as a highlight and
then I used go lightly all over the
crease and I didn't do it in a really
defined way I used actually a fluffier
crease brush I use my Sephora rounded
crease brush so you can see that's a
little bit bigger and I took some of
that shade and you don't have to be that
careful with it because like I said it's
not that dark both shades or shimmery
all the shades overall in this kit or
shimmery which may or may not appeal to
you you know it might have been nice if
they threw in one darker matte shade but
you know whatever works I guess these
are these are nice for a quick on the go
look but do be aware if you have aging
skin around the eye area these shimmery
shades may not be your best friend
so watch out for that but like I said I
just keep it kind of a light layer just
go all over the crease don't worry about
an outer V if you take a smaller brush
with this um go lightly shade you will
get just a little more concentrated
color but it's really not going to be
too harsh but for the fact that these
are two light shades I really like the
pearlescent glow I'm getting off of my
lids it's really nice I also to kind of
finish the look I just took a blackish
brown pencil liner went around about
halfway in on my upper lash line in
about a third of the way in on the lower
part and then I took go lightly and I
just kind of went all the way under it I
got this kind of topi light brown golden
look all the way under without looking
like I've really got a lot of liner
definition there so anyway that's how I
use those two I think those would be a
couple of great just grab and go shadows
the other two you get one is called
wheat and if you compare this to kitten
which I'm so sorry the colors really
aren't showing up that while I will have
to probably post some pictures on the
blog or something kitten has a little
more pink to it and this is a little
more straight up neutral still kind of a
light shade like I said I wouldn't mind
of seeing a wheat replacement maybe put
in a darker matte shade into these four
but hey it's the brand's choice not mine
right as you can see it's got it's a
pretty shade nonetheless it's got kind
of a little bit of a golden tone to it
but much lighter than Golightly see
those two side by side they would work
nicely together as well the fourth shade
you get is called mystic and this is a
pretty once again shimmery sort of teal
type shade that does again have some
golden undertones to it I wore this
earlier today I kind of switched up my
makeup wash it off try to put stuff on
again I was just having fun playing
around and this has a surprising amount
of bluish color payoff to it so you can
pack this shade on and expect to see
some color out of it so you got kind of
one colorful shade and three different
neutrals you can play around with and
the only thing with these is if you
compare the size of one of these and I'm
sure some of you are very familiar with
this brand
and you know I'm not telling you any new
news here but compare that to the size
of a Mac shadow and it's much bigger
these all come in these little plastic e
containers and you don't get any sort of
pallet to like sit them in so right now
I'm kind of at a loss for what to do
with these I would like to have a little
quad type palette I could put them in
but um i'm guessing i'll have to you
know look into that further maybe see if
stila offers something but when you get
this set you're only going to get them
like this so that's one of the little
downfalls to the kit that I found last
thing you get is the Stila major lash
mascara I have this on and I was very
very impressed with it I thought it
built my lashes up it was very buildable
you could do multiple coats with it this
is what the brush looks like the formula
is not too wet and I'm impressed with
how when you take the brush out it
really gets cleaned off nicely and I
think that's what helps it be buildable
not clumping each lash together so I
think it's some nice definition some
length that I was a little surprised at
how lengthening it was and it's not to
like it's not making my lashes have that
brittle really hard feeling you know
that some mascaras will give you so
that's the steel a major lash mascara
you're getting full sizes of these
products which is a really nice
advantage when you're getting a kit it's
always disappointing when you think
you're getting the full-size this and
then it turns out oh this one thing was
full-size everything else was miniature
you know so um that's why I think you
did the ability to prod to try this
high-end brand at that price is really
neat overall I was very pleased with it
just a quick kind of recap on pros and
cons love the convertible color really
love the lip gloss as well in terms of
the shadows I like the colors do be
aware if you're not a shimmer girl these
are all shimmery so the one downfall
there is that you don't get any matte
shades to mix in if you don't get a
palette to put them in the illuminating
tinted moisturizer is nice doesn't
spread quite as smoothly as i would like
but it still gives a nice kind of glow
to the skin especially if you were to
just wear it alone and the mascara is
really really nice as well so thank you
so much for tuning in watching my review
