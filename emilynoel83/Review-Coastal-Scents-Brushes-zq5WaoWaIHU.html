review of some of my brushes from
Coastal Scents calm it's a great website
for some really high quality brushes
that you can get some really really good
prices so I just want to tell you about
some of the brushes from there that I've
accumulated over probably the past
couple months or so and tell you how I
like them and maybe it can help you
decide if you're on the website what
ones you might want to try as well so
the first one is the Italian Badger
deluxe fan brush and look at that isn't
that a pretty brush it's got a nice wood
grain handle and a fan brush it's just
what you would think of a fan brush
being very thin and you know thin this
way but very wide out this way and what
a fan brush can be used for is to say
apply any kind of all over finishing the
veil or something like that there
anything very very sheer on your skin
but it can also be good for and what I
find myself using it for a lot is if I'm
using a loose powder eyeshadow or any
eyeshadow that tends to create a lot of
fallout down here on my cheekbone this
is great for just brushing it away it
brushes it away without pressing it back
down into your skin and messing up all
the makeup you've already done so I
really like that I'm really surprised
that I haven't gotten this in my
collection before because this is a
really great brush and it is three
dollars and forty nine cents on Coastal
Scents comm so just a great brush to
have in your collection and you don't
see a lot of these out in the drugstore
so if you see this on Coastal Scents and
it's not sold out I would get this one
so very good brush
next I want to talk about the angle
blush brush this is a short little guy
and it's got very soft bristles and it's
a good size for your cheek it's just
nice it gets you know really covers that
area well if you're into contouring or
anything like that or just blush in
general you know it's just nice the
angle I love the angle I love tapered
affects to my brushes and I just think
this works incredibly well it's probably
going to be the type of brush that I use
on a daily basis for blush it's just
really really good and now take a closer
look at it though because if you're a
bare minerals juicer um just see
anything familiar about this brush it
looks just like one of my bare minerals
brushes I mean with the exception of
this isn't a tapered brush but the
handle the the ferrule is like exactly
the same they're they're the same length
it just looks like the same kind of
brush the bristles feel the same you
know it's just so I mean you're getting
something very very close to the bare
essentials bare minerals quality brushes
so for only $4.50
so very very good brush so we're like to
patoot here
the next brush that I got here is really
really long look at how tall this brush
is it is so tall it's the duo-fiber
stippling brush and it's $7.95 the most
expensive brushes I have off of Coastal
Scents and just what cat helped I can't
get over how long this one is seriously
I compared to this little short guy it's
real
tall but anyway it's good for you could
you could use this kind of brush to put
on any kind of light coverage of you
know mineral powder or any kind of loose
powder I think it would do well with and
the duo fiber portion of it what that
means is that you've got these thing
this hair on top that is very very soft
like you're petting a cat right now but
the what's underneath here really feels
more like a normal brush and it
incorporates both of those fibers to
give a different kind of coverage when
you use it and what I used it for today
was with my foundation I used the
stippling approach and I just put my
foundation on my hand blotted my brush
in and then this is what you like if you
stipple your foundation on you just go
little by little and get the coton there
and then kind of blend it out and this
is great for blending I felt like it
blended my foundation flawlessly but it
did give me very light coverage because
think about it you're not just taking
your foundation out of the container
putting it on your fingers and putting
it on your face this is like the
middleman in this so you're you are
having to kind of get back in put more
on but it is a shear you're going to get
sheer coverage if you use this with
liquid foundation so just be aware of
that also I clean off all my brushes
before I use them and I thought that
would do away with the shedding with
this because I was warned on the website
that this brush might shed and it
continued to even after I after I
cleaned it so it you know I think it's
just a matter of when you're using it
with a liquid product those fibers in
the brush kind of want to cling to your
face where there's that moisture um so
I'm hoping that that dies down as I
continue to use it I've got to think
it's going to you know it's not like
it's going to go go bald or anything I
hope
but it really is a decent brush for 795
I've heard of brushes like this costing
far more than that so if you want to try
this kind of technique with your
foundation this would be a good brush to
to do that with the next four brushes
are all eye brushes the first one is it
the chisel fluff slash pointed crease
duet so if I do what it's got a that
means it has a brush on each end and so
this one the chisel one is a nice small
kind of crease brush I would compare
this to my essence of beauty brush that
I get from CVS I use in probably almost
any tutorial I've done that crease brush
it's pretty much the exact same shape as
this so if you're looking for something
similar there that is going to work for
you this works great and then this side
I enjoy this because it's not as big as
your typical eyeshadow brushes you know
how um I feel like some eyeshadow
brushes you put them on and they're so
big for your eyelids and this one
actually fits quite well so you have a
lot of control you can get the shadow
exactly where you want it um as far as
getting shadow on your eyelid so very
good brush the only thing is with
storage of this brush I can't I use the
Sephora inspired brush holders with oil
sand and you stick it down in and um
this doesn't I don't want to do that
with this because I don't want to mess
up the brush so it sits out in its own
special place
so anyway moving on and that one I don't
know if I said how much that one was
that was 395 the next one is $2 it's the
chisel angle fluff shadow brush and if
you'll recall in my I did a tutorial I
wanted to do one using just one brush
just to show how versatile this is
this brush can do it all it can do
put it on your lid it can do nice crease
it can highlight it can go around
underneath I mean it's just so
multi-purpose I really think people need
to get this brush in their brush
wardrobe it's so good I have nothing bad
to say about it I mean I just it's one
of those brushes you can reach for
probably cut your time maybe not in half
but you can at least cut out some of the
time you spend doing your eye makeup
just by streamlining all the brushes
you're using down to something like this
so move it on gotta move on um next one
is the eyeliner brush the superfine
eyeliner brush for about ninety nine
this is the cheapest brush that I've
gotten from Coastal Scents but it is
also probably my least favorite and it's
not that bad but it's just not really
what I was looking for I wanted a really
really fine tip and I wanted a tip of
the brush that where the end would like
hang together for a really really fine
eyeliner tip this one it's kind of hard
to tell but when it hits your skin it's
like the tip spreads out a little bit
more and it gives you a wider line and
sometimes the bristles separate a little
bit and then I mean that's never good
with an eyeliner brush you want it to
hang together and give you a nice
continuous line so this you know may be
good if I want to say set my eyeliner
with a powder and dip this into some and
go over it this could be fine if you
wanted to use like a powder as your
eyeliner but for liquid and cream I'm
kind of struggling with this one right
now
but anyway moving on the chisel detail
mini brush is $2.00 and it is so cute it
actually says mini contour on here but
on the website it's called the chisel
detail mini brush and it is so tiny like
look how little it is perfect for
getting shadow around your tear duct
area great for setting eyeliner or
working out a little bit of smokiness or
smudging this is great it's so little
you will be surprised when you get this
at how small it is because it on the
website it makes it look a little bigger
but this is tiny but I can honestly say
I have nothing like this in my brush
collection so that's great so um anyway
thank you guys for watching I hope this
