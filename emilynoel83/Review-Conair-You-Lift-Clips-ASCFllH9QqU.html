this little hair experiment that I'm
going to be doing I picked up this
product from Walmart not too long ago
it's from Conair and it's called you
lift and it's actually a set of six
clips in there and it says adds volume
lips from the roots and I want to show
you what these clips look like again
there are six of them and they kind of
look like that and you they really do
like clip shut kind of hard and then
there they are I want to just read you
what the back of this says it says clips
provide exceptional lift in just minutes
apply your preferred styling product to
your hair then insert that you lift
Clips close to the roots after the
styling product dries which should take
only a few minutes remove the clips so
this is not something you leave in your
hair like a bump it or something like
that that you walk around with this is
something that you do just as you style
your hair says for best results use on
dry hair section the areas that need
lift and volume apply styling liquid or
hairspray attach the clips and let hair
dry so let that styling product dry for
about two minutes carefully remove the
clips and gently style for the desired
effect and I want to show you this is
the picture that is on the front there
you can see girls got a lot of volume
and then here's the before and after so
you can see flat hair lots of volume and
then this is kind of the step by step
where here's your before you put these
clips in you know you kind of maybe
leave leave the hair down here around
where the bangs are and do this mainly
up in the crown where you might tease
your hair it's kind of just wondering is
this going to work
is this a real substitute for teasing
your hair because that's kind of what it
claims to be so I've got these I've got
my Tresemme tres two hairspray which is
my favorite in the areas that need lift
and volume apply the hairspray and
the clips so I would say I want some you
know right up in here alright so I've
sectioned off my hair I'm going to apply
a little bit of hairspray just kind of
surrounding the roots both front and
back there I've got my clip that I've
opened up here and I'm going to just get
my hair kind of within that clip I guess
you don't really want to pull up a bunch
of hair that's wider than that clip and
then get it right down at the roots
which I have it and then you just kind
of clip it shut alright there we have it
so I have five more clips to put in so
I'm going to put in one more behind this
one and then kind of do two like that on
each side and I will join you when I'm
done trying to make sure that this when
I would put it in it would stay really
close to the roots so there's one and
there's another I have two right here
and I have the one that you saw me put
in and then one right behind that so I'm
going to go ahead and give these another
two minutes so the ones that I just put
in on this side will have time to dry
and then we'll take them out and see
what we have doesn't snap to these and
they're kind of hard to unsnap with one
hand by the way so I've taken it out and
I guess I can see a little bit of lift
right there let's go ahead and take the
rest out
so without touching it here is what I
have I have definite looking lift up
here and I guess you're just supposed to
be able to style that it says gently
style for desired effect what do you
guys think I don't feel like I have a
whole lot more volume than I did to
start with and I did use them as
recommended you know it might have just
that little more you know bit of you
know I'm seeing a little lift right
there but it doesn't even necessarily
look look super voluminous or anything
like that
I feel like with my hair being so fine
and you no longer hair because the
longer your hair is the more it's kind
of weighing down what's happening up
here and so I feel like if I went
throughout the day this would kind of go
away and I don't feel like it has a real
good starting point to begin I mean it
come on it's not even close to that
hello there's not that amount of lift at
all I don't know if different hair types
might respond better to this if you got
more coarse hair maybe it would work
better I don't know but I just feel like
you know I have a slight bit of lift
right over here and the rest is just
kind of as it was you know online this
is probably not something I will use
again I don't feel like I trust this
product to give me the result that I
want and I don't trust that it would
last either
I feel like if I do want a lifted look
at the roots which I don't always but a
lot of the time you know I do tend to
like a little bit more look of volume
there I will probably go ahead and just
continue to tease that area a little bit
more because I feel like teasing plus a
little bit of hairspray can give you
more of a lasting result so that is my
review of the you lift again I can't say
for sure that it will or won't work for
you because I don't know what your hair
type is or how your hair might respond
to this or maybe you've got a better
hairspray product than I do but for me
not that impressed so thanks for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
