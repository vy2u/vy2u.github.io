got balls to juggle not really I can't
really juggle but these are the EOS that
stands for evolution of smooth lip balms
and I have three of them now I am slowly
building my collection of these things
these are awesome they are basically a
organic type lip balm I'm going to read
to you what they are all about here
actually they're called the smooth
sphere and it's a different kind of lip
balm than anything I've really tried and
I wanted to make sure I got it right at
their 95 percent organic 100% natural
and paraben free they are packed with
antioxidant rich vitamin e soothing shea
butter it keeps your lips moist soft and
sensationally smooth and so basically
this is what they are like here here's
one this is this one is called summer
fruit this was the first one that I had
gotten and so you have a little grip
there in a little flat place so if you
want to display them out on your makeup
area you can do that twist it off and
this is what you get so the summer fruit
scent is really as you might expect
fruity um when I first got this I
thought oh my goodness you know this is
a great scent it's it's pretty smooth to
put on it kind of has a little bit of
thickness to it but I think it really
does help your lips feel moisturized but
you can just put it on like like that
like you can I have something on my lips
already but I mean you can just easily
like swipe it on without even like
having to be precise or anything which
is awesome and you're gonna maybe be
more likely to find this in your purse
just because you reach in and it's like
you know you know the feeling you know
what that should feel like so I got that
I love the scent of summer fruit and
then I got the honeysuckle honeydew and
I thought oh my gosh this is even better
than the summer fruit it has like an
identical texture but it has a melon you
know if you like the honeydew melon
scents of different things you will
really like that so that I thought okay
that's my favorite
and I'm not even kidding I went out
yesterday and I found the lemon drop
which is the only one with SPF 15 sold
individually at my Walgreens store and
before like they were actually selling
these in a three pack and I already had
one of them so I thought I'm not going
to get you know another one but they I
have seen these sold in the three pack
like this anyway got the Lemon Drop SPF
15 and my goodness this is my favorite I
swear this is my favorite set of all
three if you smell like a lemon wafer or
a lemon cookie bar oh my gosh this is so
right on with the lemon scent and I'm
not necessarily one that like you know
if I had a bunch of scents to choose
from I would always say lemon was my
favorite that's not how it is but oh my
gosh this is just there's just something
about the accuracy of this scent and
lemon that is so good and this one is
smoother than the others it goes on more
smoothly the others you put them on and
they're moisturizing they feel good on
your lips but they don't go on quite as
smooth I like using all of these maybe
especially these two oops I just dropped
it these to the that seem a little
thicker I really like using them to
prime my lips because I know they're not
slick enough to run all over the place
and you put those on and then you go
ahead with your lip liner and it all
just seems to really hang together and
give you a nice base for you know what
else you want to put on there this one
is a little bit smoother it could still
make a good like lip base but it's just
got a little more slick more of a slick
smooth quality to it and it has the SPF
15 which is
so if you can find the lemon drop being
sold individually in your store yeah I
totally recommend it but I really do
like all three I think these are
fantastic little products it's nice that
they are like natural ingredients
they're really great like I said I've
kind of acquired these over time from
the store and there is I was looking on
the website so I would suggest going to
evolution of smooth calm I'm actually
looking at it on my laptop right now and
there's one more flavor there is a sweet
mint flavor there and you know you get
the scent but you do get a little bit of
a flavor as well especially with the
lemon but I just think these are Sony
I'm looking up other information here on
the site to maybe help you I have found
mine at Walgreens I also found my very
first one at a Rite Aid it was actually
my first time at a Rite Aid if you saw
my ends world where I was Tyler and I
were on that road trip that was where I
found that I was with Sara my
sister-in-law and Sylvia and we just had
a blast so anyway I found I found these
at Rite Aid and Walgreens they're always
at my local Walgreens but on the website
it says they're also at Target
CBS drugstore calm amazon.com and for
small grains and Rite Aid so you can
also put in you can put your zip code in
and it'll help you find the store
nearest you that is carrying them there
is an online store as well here B and
they sell in addition to those around
ones it looks like they sell lip balm
sticks and shave cream and stuff and I
just am very pleased with this brand I
think this is a awesome awesome
packaging idea it's neat that you can
get two lips at once different with this
you know you just slide it on and this
is just an awesome product then the
lemon drop is marked as being new so
it's I think it's sold out on the online
store let me check for you here I
thought they said it was
I'm not quite sure
sorry just doing a little research yeah
it says temporarily out of stock on here
but they're around three between three
and four dollars if you were to buy
these at the store and they're just
really really cool and I would recommend
them I mean maybe you think it's a
little gimmicky that they're in this
little round shape but honestly they're
super moisturizing they really do coat
the lips with a good layer of moisture
and this lemon to die for it's so great
so thank you very much guys for tuning
in for this video and the review athan
continues with I think one more video so
stay with me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
