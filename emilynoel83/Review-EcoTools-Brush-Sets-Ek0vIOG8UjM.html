this video I'm very excited to bring you
a double sort of review on two different
eco tools brush sets and I really kind
of set myself up for this yesterday
because I was tweeting like crazy I was
tweeting this person in that person and
I had mentioned that I got an Ecotools
brush said I think in the same tweet I
said I was going to post a video that
day and the video was not about the
brushes but a lot of people I think
thought it was and so people were like
oh I'm excited to hear about those
brushes and this and that and I'm
thinking yeah they thought this videos
about then somebody finally tweeted me
and they're like you know you're gonna
have to do a video on these brushes I'm
like yeah well I was planning to anyway
so anyway about these brushes I think
they're really great this is a great
brand they are earth-friendly
basically they're largely a natural
product they're 100% cruelty free they
come in these neat little like pouches
that look like kind of dull bub ziploc
bags but they open up and the brushes
are in there and the brush sets tend to
come with their own little carrying
cases as well so the first kit I'm gonna
tell you about is the bamboo five piece
brush set this one specifically says
great for mineral makeup they're on the
label and so what you get is you get
this little envelope looking brush
holder thing here that you can keep your
brushes in however look what I have to
do to make them fit like these are short
shorter style brushes makes you think
they're more like a travel product right
so I stuff them down in there I do not
like having to stuff this beautiful
brush down in there because it won't
just stand up and shut you have to like
push it down almost painful and then you
have to put the other one in there and
then you can seal it up okay it's not
like the worst thing you can do to a
brush it's not like I'm like taking it
outside and like rubbing it on the
street or something but I mean I don't
like having to smush a brush into an
area a little brush roll like with the
second set would be much better for this
so I don't think that was very well
thought out on the company's part but
whatever the case may be you can store
these however you want to get some handy
little brush guard things that would
idea but basically this set is really
cool and these brushes are so soft the
this particular style um you can see
they're kind of like a duo fiber like
dual toned I guess fibers there on the
brush and excuse me I don't know what I
use it but my throat is gonna be
problems today um basically these remind
me especially this little set with the
shorter handles that kind of had that
wooden look to them they kind of remind
me of the everyday minerals brushes
especially in their softness nothing
I've found is really as soft as the
every midday minerals brushes except for
maybe this set and that's amazing both
of these sets ran around $10 you're
getting like in this case you're getting
one two three four brushes and a little
case and then you get five brushes in
this other set in a case so that's good
if you divide that down per brush a
pretty good deal there so anyway how do
I use this particular set you get a
little baby kabuki brush which i think
is good for applying mineral makeup all
over it's a little smaller than a
typical kabuki so you're gonna get a
little more coverage with a smaller you
know surface area there on the brush so
it was good for playing that it's good
to just sit around because it's so soft
you sit there and rub it on your face I
don't know but I like using it also if I
contour my cheeks and I want to blend
out the contour a little bit these
brushes are nice and dense so when
you're doing your contouring I mean
you're gonna get a good blend if you
want to go over stuff with that
so that little kabuki brush is one of
the few truly usable kabuki brushes that
I have I have one I think from Smashbox
and one from Laura Geller to higher end
brands and they are really stiff and
really hard to blend with but this
smallish one is one a few small brushes
that you can totally you know do your
face all up with this and this was all
you had you can put on your mineral
makeup you can put on your bronzer and
your blush and probably make it work
with this so that's pretty awesome then
it comes with a bigger brush that is
good for powder bronzer or blush I
some people just kind of tend to like
you know okay I like a smaller powder
brush and a big fluffy bronzer brush or
you have different reasons why you like
to use brushes but this one I have
applied all over face powder with this
it has kind of a the bristles are
tapered down on each side but it has a
sort of like flatness you can see there
when I turn it to the side it kind of is
a little more flat like that and for
that reason since it does taper so much
I don't use it so much as a swirly brush
like that as I like to use it for like a
bronzer or a blush and this is a great
size for a blush brush actually to get
not too much product on there but just
enough it's super soft just like the
other one just shaped a little
differently so you know this could buff
on your powder this can put on your
bronzer and blush then you have a couple
other brushes here one is a concealer
brush but I think this makes a great
flat eyeshadow brush and then a terrific
little like eye blending brush crease
brush type thing these all have that
same softness about them so and I think
that's really important for an eye brush
I think with so many times you see
people doing videos and they're like oh
face brush is so soft well are the eye
brushes as soft as that because I want
to put something stiff and Scratchy by
my eye you know this is about what we're
looking at size-wise for this so it's a
nice kind of semi medium to large crease
brush it's gonna do well for blending
out that area this I have used with some
powder concealer products it works well
it would work well with a cream it's
also but this is also a great size if
you wanted to pack shadow on your
eyelids so just something to keep in
mind kind of pick a function and you
might want to stick with it unless
you're going to be cleaning these deep
cleaning these often but yeah these are
great brushes I love them overall a
really really nice set there and I don't
know if I talked about where you can
find these but drugstores Walgreens
Target Walmart all carry this kind of
stuff but they had differing selections
I think Walgreens had the best overall
selections the next one
I have to talk about is the bamboo six
piece I brush set and this is called the
little eye makeover on the go it says so
I love the setup of the way you store
and can tote around this product look at
this it's just like a little brush roll
plus it has a little mirror in there so
I think that's really cool definitely
keeps the brush is nice and neat and
you're not messing them up as you take
them around just a Velcro shut I think
that's really really great on their part
to do that and plus it's these little
elastic bands so that hold the brushes
in are like its height like it holds
them in there like a nice little uh I
don't know baby see there's something
it's like those brushes are in there and
they're not gonna slip out so you got to
understand that those are probably gonna
lose a little tension over time but
right now they're super tight and I
think that's good
so the brushes you have I'll walk you
through what you get in here and it's
neat with this
I set it says Ecotools here but it also
also points out what the brush should be
used for some of these brushes I like
better than others as a whole I think
they're a good a good set um but yeah
there's I have some preferences this is
the big blending brush this is big this
is like let me show you in comparison
size-wise to like say in this kit this
would function for me anyway as the
brush that I would use to put shadow all
over my lid because there's not
necessarily another brush that could do
that so this is kind of like large for
me it comes to an odd little point see
how it has this point and for that I
kind of thought well that could be kind
of nice to blend and like you stick that
little point area in your crease and
that really covers a lot of area and I'm
like that's nice and these are soft even
though these are dark and a totally
different color scheme with the bristles
than these they're still super soft I
don't know if they are as are they as
soft maybe not as soft as those other
ones but still very very soft so anyway
this one's kind of big so I would need
to supplement this with another smaller
brush like about the
size of this one that I use from Sigma
to pack on that color or if you got both
these brush sets this concealer brush
could serve that purpose so this is kind
of large kind of awkward for me with
that brush the next one you get is this
sort of angled o foot type brush and
this says it is a crease brush um I
don't know if this would be a crease
brush for me this is another one that I
was like I was using it this morning and
I was like okay like I started to put
color in the crease and I'm like I kind
of see why they call it a crease brush
kind of but I kind of don't like I don't
know with a really dark shades like it
was kind of sloppy to use this as a
crease brush but if you're just kind of
doing like a light wash and you could
just kind of go like that you know maybe
it would be alright but if you kind of
work it the best way I guess to use this
I think would be to not so much go like
that with the smallest part in your
crease but to kind of just use it
sideways and really pack the color in
then turn it going vertically to blend
it out maybe that's just kind of what
the way I was experimenting um next one
you've got here is a highlight
they say highlight I would call this
more of a crease brush this is pretty
good in size let's compare it to the one
on the other set others set is a little
bit longer this is kind of small this is
a size that I love love this brush I
think this is great for crease colors
it's great for blending out it's also
good to put the highlight up there but I
like this like it a lot I think this is
gonna be a brush I get a lot of use out
of just from the size of my eye it fits
it well and yes very nice and I like how
soft it is because when you're going
back forth back forth over your crease
you want it to be soft you know next one
you get you've got to the final two are
very small I love that you don't just
wind up with a whole set of oversized
eye brushes there's a variety in here
and so you can make this stuff work for
you this brush says
shade right here and this is so small
it's tiny like okay once again frame of
reference traditional eyeshadow brush
here from Sigma this is about half or a
third of that size overall so it's a
small brush still soft but this is
interesting because this makes one of
those great little detail brushes
remember that little tiny brush I'm
always pulling out from Coastal Scents
and I'm like you know you can put put a
shade around your tear duct and I pull
that out I've not found anything
comparable to that but this little guy
is so yeah put your highlight shade in
there if you want to kind of like go
back after you've done your eye look and
concentrate another color you know right
on your crease you have so much control
here if you just want small amounts of
color in certain places if you really
wanted to kind of dry out that outer V
or something like that this is a nice
nice little brush to have and you don't
see it everywhere it's rare the other
one you get is this smudge brush look at
how little and cute this is compare it
to the size of the crease brush it's
very small so you can see that this
would work well to smudge out liner
definitely yeah it's I mean I that's
kind of what I did today after I was
kind of getting to my finishing step of
my eye look I'd done my liner I topped
it with some powder and then just kind
of buff over it it's so little it's so
it's really cute too so anyway these
brushes overall I mean you heard my few
little complaints just with the one and
then and the carrying case it came with
and then this kind of big brush which
hey this could be nice if you wanted to
set your under eye with a little bit of
powders that your under eye concealer
there that's an idea that's actually
could work pretty well for that but I
think all of this goes to show is use
brushes how they work best for you just
because that brush has one certain label
that it says to do with it like calling
this a concealer brush this could be an
eye brush and do what works best I mean
that's how you're gonna get the best
look not by just following all the same
instructions on
on the back of a package so that's a
suggestions but those aren't the rules
so keep that in mind
anyway this little set folds together
nicely
overall this is great to have this brand
I'm so glad I just I I mean you guys
probably many of you discovered this
well before I did but I'm glad I went
ahead and bought them and tried them
because it's nice to have a brand that
you can count on in your drugstore for
brushes because you know Walmart -
Target Walgreens all these different
stores kind of carry their own little
no-name brushes and it's very hard to
refer people to certain ones when it's
there's not like a solid brand you can
put them with covergirl Maybelline
Revlon they're not all making like a
whole extensive line of brushes so I'm
glad that that Ecotools has this let me
know what you think if there are other
brush sets beyond these or individual
brushes you think I should try let me
know but I would as a whole recommend
this is this basically a rave review for
these products and I hope hope you
enjoyed this review so thanks again for
watching guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
