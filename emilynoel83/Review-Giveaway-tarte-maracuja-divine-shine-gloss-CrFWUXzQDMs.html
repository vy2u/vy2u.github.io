bring you this video because I have a
lot of good news for you number one it's
a review on some lip gloss which you
know I love but also i'm going to be
giving away 3 sets of 10 lip glosses so
i'm going to be detailing this all at
the end of the video these are the
brand-new tarte maracuja divine shine
lip glosses so i'm gonna first off just
kind of review them for you tell you all
about them show you all the different
colors wait you know what these are all
about but at the end i will explain to
you how you can enter this giveaway
which is really exciting and really
generous of tart because they contacted
me they said hey we see you've been
reviewing a lot of our stuff would you
like to you know have a giveaway and
give some lip glosses to your
subscribers stop I would love if you
would subscribe if you haven't already
that is my personal guideline for
getting into this contest but the rest
is all going to be handled through tart
through a link below but like I said
more details on the giveaway in a minute
first off the review
so these are the glosses at first glance
I know the first thing you notice is how
cute the packaging is I feel like they
all kind of have their own slightly
different color scheme on this print
which is a really pretty kind of floral
print on each end but it's really what's
inside these glasses that counts because
it's maracuja oil and I know I have
talked about this before in my skincare
routine in just in terms of being a
favorite product tart has this pure
marcucci oil and this is a really
hydrating oil that you can actually put
all over your fake and be you know a
fantastic moisturizer it just softens
the skin makes it feel wonderful so it's
not really much surprise to me that they
would put that ingredient in these lip
glosses and I don't want you to think
oil and a lip gloss like is it some oily
greasy lip gloss not in the least I mean
this has the wonderful texture that I
would want to lip gloss to have it's
slightly tacky so it's not going to
slide right off your lips something I've
noticed that I really enjoy about this
gloss is that these colors and I'm going
to get into the colors in a sec but the
colors go on somewhat sheer yet when you
put them on your lips it like erases the
lines from your letter lips look super
kind of plump and juicy without these
being a lip plumper at all have sort of
a minty scent and feel on the lips they
remind me sort of of the lipsurgence
jumbo pencils in that way it becomes
more comfortable as you wear it which is
interesting but with the maracuja oil
that claims to replenish and rebuild the
lips so if you've got chapped lips and
you're thinking oh now I'm confined to
just wearing a lip balm you know to
really get that softness back in my lips
no you can actually wear a lip gloss
like this and put it on and your lips
feel like they've had just a drink you
know what I mean rate vitamins in your
vitamin E there's also sunflower seed
oil like a treatment and a color product
in one because once this wears off your
lips continue to feel soft actually like
a little clicker thing here that you
just press a couple of times in your
product will come out now when you first
get them you're going to need to click
that quite a few times so you're
to be just clicking away you know like
you're clicking on a pin after that
initial time and when you go back to to
reapply this only click it like no more
than three or four times because you
just have to wait a couple seconds and
the product will start coming on it of
course comes out this brush tip which
gives you a lot of nice control as you
put it on it eliminates the need for a
separate lip brush or anything like that
i wanted to swatch him on my hand so you
could see them all side by side and just
see how the range of colors goes of
course extremely shiny the camera is
really picking up how reflective these
can be you're going to notice some
Sheerness in the lighter tones which you
know those aren't necessarily my
favorite pics of this group just because
when I put the gloss on I do want to see
that color but these can be layered over
lipsticks and you will get a lot of
those same benefits in terms of just
feeling nice on the lips and everything
like that you can totally layer that I
want to take you through the shades one
by one now first off we have dull face
and this is kind of like classic pale
pink baby pink type color it's also
described as pink grapefruit adored is
another light shade that has a little
more peach to it but overall it's a
little more sheer it's one of the most
sheer colors in the whole collection
charmed is kind of like one of those
classic pink colors and of all of the
lip glosses this is just one of three
where I was able to detect just the
tiniest bit of maybe a little shimmer in
there but as a whole they're really just
kind of like creamy color amused is
something girls who like a little bit of
pop to their pink are going to really
enjoy creamy luscious pink lips kind of
think Barbie tight pink that's the kind
of pink we're looking at yes who love
peach will enjoy tipsy this is another
one of those that has just a little bit
of like a golden pearl um to this shade
but overall you know it's going to be
just kind of a sheer peach next up we
have blissful which I'm wearing right
now and this is a nice coral I feel like
it's incorporating those orange tones
while still being super wearable very
creamy lovely color listen along with
adored is one of the more sheer colors
this collection and think about your
lips but just a little bit glossy it
still has that subtle creaminess though
it's kind of hard to put your fingers is
blushing bride and this reminds me of
kind of a classic moth I'm sort of
described as a plummy rose color has
that great creamy at criminal to it but
this is one of the deeper shades in the
whole collection shade is flush one
actually has some sparkle to it not just
a little bit of pearl eNOS but yes that
some legit sparkle in there it's a
really pretty deep berry color wanting
to experiment with a cherry red lip this
is such a great beautiful natural more
subtle way to go about it with this
gloss that's just a little bit sheer but
you're really still getting a decent
amount of color with this one and it's
just straight-up creamy beautiful red it
makes you think of all of those
wonderful juicy red fruits you could be
eating it's like wearing that on your
lip I had to pick my favorite shades out
of this whole group I would go with
these three which I feel like provide
really really nice color they are amused
which is that great hot pink color that
Barbie pink as I called it blissful
which I'm wearing now which i think is a
beautiful pop of coral and great as we
change seasons and natural beauty which
is that wonderful cherry red
