this video this is going to be a review
of some hair care products I know I've
been on kind of like a hair care
hairstyle roll lately but I promise come
this weekend I'll get some more makeup
related videos up but I did want to
touch on several different products that
are going to be great for those of you
who are always using a heat styling tool
whether it's a straight iron or a
curling iron or a crimper or whatever
you like to use or even a blow dryer so
and these products come from a brand
called salon la coupe and that is
actually a brand that's out of Canada
but it is available at stores like Ulta
and Duane Reade and they should soon be
available on Altus website as well so
some interesting products that you know
as I said specifically cater to the
health of your hair if you are a heat
styler like me um what's interesting
about these products is that a lot of
them say thermal straightening on them
and I just want to put it out there at
first that even if you straighten your
hair or curl your hair I probably curl
my hair for my job more than I actually
completely straighten it so just so
you're aware this stuff works either way
it's going to protect your hair for any
heat styling tool but it also does have
that added quality of helping lock in
whatever style you do whether it's
straightening or curling so just keep
that in mind I've read into some of the
products a little bit and it really is
good for either way so just so you know
the first thing I want to tell you about
is the thermal straightening cream
that's like a four blow drying and it's
it says blow-dry right here and
basically this is a kind of like a
relaxing balm and what you're going to
do it's kind of like a thick cream and
it pumps out here and i use only a very
little bit since i have kind of fine
here so i'll use like that much and
actually just kind of rub it between my
hands and you put it on the like the the
length of your hair not in at the roots
but like say if I were going to put it
on this ponytail for example this part
of the hair and I will put it on like if
my hair still you know a little bit damp
but I need to blow dry it
put it on there and it's basically an
added protection from blow drying heat
which I think can really wear my hair
out even more sometimes then I feel like
the curling iron does it just I mean
blow drying really does put a lot of
wear and tear on your hair that all
rhymed but so this is this is unique and
I haven't seen a lot of products
specifically to help protect your hair
from blow-drying but i have found i've
been using these products for probably
coming up on a month between three weeks
in a month and so and i use hair
products on like a daily basis so i've
really noticed that my hair has been
shinier it's been healthier and I I mean
that's a great thing if you can improve
the life of your hair because we all
think well you know you grow it out you
get it cut and you got a fresh new do
but if you are continually styling your
hair you do need to help keep it nice so
another thing so you got the this for
your blow-dry step the other thing is
something that you would spray on right
before you use your curling iron or your
straightener and this is a type of
product that's more commonly found and
this is the called the Flatiron spray
and it will help your straight style
last longer but it's also great for
right before you use your curling iron
and it's gonna you know if anything
enhance whatever heat styling you do so
this is not just for straightening but
it helped enhance my curls and not only
that but it just kept them really nice
and smooth soft and my hair came off the
curling iron nicely it very different
from if you've ever tried to use
hairspray before you curl your hair you
definitely will you know want to be
using something that is actually a
protectant to your hair the last little
step here of this is the sleek finish
cream serum so unthink of like a shine
cream or something that you put on to
just give your hair that last little
finishing touch if you have trouble with
like little unruly hair sticking up and
you kind of want that sleek style to
last I know I have that too and while
this might you know it's not like super
heavy-duty so if you got some issues
with like hair sprouting everywhere it's
help to an extent it the main thing I
notice what this is the shine that it
gives which is a little strange because
I've seen shine sprays and more of like
a gel type product that you put put on
your hair to enhance that shine but this
is actually a different concept for me a
cream serum and it says smooth smooth
sand teams split ends and frizz polishes
and protects hair from humidity and we
are all dealing with humidity now you'll
probably see these products used when I
do my weather styles video for like a
humid hair day or something like that
because um whether my hair has been
curly or straight it has held up a
little bit more I did like a curl my
hair so dark I did like a curly ponytail
this is the I'm at the end of my day
here I did this at one thirty in the
morning I've still got nice curls in my
ponytail you know and I've used this
with my straightener my hair has stayed
straight and sleek and smooth and so I
think you know for for products that if
you if you do have access to an Ulta
store or a Duane Reade store check out
this brand if you haven't already and
look at some of their thermal products
because like I said you're kind of you
know it's sometimes hard to find a brand
that has a full line of everything you
might need for every process your hair
goes through so this is truly from
beginning to end with your you know from
the blow drying to using the actual hot
tool on your hair to the finished look
you've pretty much got it covered there
and I hope you enjoyed this review guys
I hope it just kind of opened your eyes
to one more option you have for
protecting your hair and there is also a
another product here which I am still
going to try and I'm going to review it
when I have and it's the overnight
repair masque so this is kind of like a
all in all four steps but if you want to
get the one the one extra thing which I
am eager to try soon this basically
repairs your hair overnight so that's
exciting too so thank you guys so much
for tuning in for this video on la coop
hair care products and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
