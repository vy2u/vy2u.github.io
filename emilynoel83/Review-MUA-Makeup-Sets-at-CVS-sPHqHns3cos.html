hairs poppin I was trying to figure out
how to get my shorter hair up into a bun
and with all the layers in it it's
really really hard to get a decent bun
so hair is everywhere but thank you for
tuning in this is going to be all about
some recent finds some things I found a
couple weeks ago at CVS it is the brand
mua makeup academy actually all of this
stuff says mu a professional on it so I
know this is a brand that is popular in
the UK and many of you have recommended
it to me and this is really my first
time trying it out and I'm not positive
that all of these products are like the
equivalent to what is being sold in the
UK or if maybe these are some exclusive
sets to CVS I'm not a hundred percent
sure so I welcome your feedback in the
comments section if you notice some
inconsistencies with the kinds of makeup
you have access to if you're a big nua
user I have two holiday kits to tell you
about one I've got the stuff out of
right now but they were each $20 and
they had I think maybe a couple of
different lip kits available as well but
the ones that really interested me the
most were the makeup artist must-haves
kit and I thought that would just be a
nice way to sample a bunch of different
products and then this one is the
back-to-basics I set and it contains a
palette of brush and an eye liner and
they had a couple of different options
where the palettes were concerned and
also I just picked up an individual
brush because I don't know about your
CVS stores like how much of this line
they're carrying but with mine I think
they've had the brushes in stock for a
while and I haven't seen any like big
spread of individual makeup products it
was just like all of a sudden boom here
are some holiday kits and the brushes
really intrigued me price-wise they're
definitely a little more pricey just to
pay for an individual brush compared to
a lot of other individual drugstore
brushes and I was really looking him
over and the one that interested me the
most and just seemed the most unique
that I thought I could really use is
just called the crease fresh and it's
sold in a little box like this it has
number 315 on it and this is what it
looks like I am such a fan of a small
crease brush when I can find it but this
really reminded me of were those essence
of beauty crease brushes that I have
been talking about since like the
beginning of time on my channel you know
those little brushes they're like wooden
handles and I don't know that they're as
readily available and easy to come by as
they were years ago literally years and
years ago when I started my channel but
this is so similar in size to those and
it's just really really handy for
getting in the crease just getting
really precise with it easily getting to
the inner part of your crease and
building an outer V with it it's soft
the cut appears to be very even it seems
to be great quality so I think I'm going
to get a ton of use out of this I
believe this was like an $8 brush but
the larger the brush the bigger the
price tag there so I'll have to check
out and see if anything else seems kind
of unique and different and worth trying
these makeup sets sadly they didn't
really Wow me and the way I look at a
lot of this holiday stuff is like would
I be proud to have my name on the
to/from tag you know to give this to
somebody is this something I would want
my name attached to and I really don't
think I would in this makeup artist
must-haves kit I feel like there were a
couple of things that I really liked but
the rest was just sort of so-so
there's something called pro face primer
in here and I thought that was kind of
cool it's a small size and it's one of
those clear kind of silicone feeling
face primers feels a lot like Smashbox
photo-finish I know
elf has put out some similar primers
that are clear like that and a lot of
those have been a little more on the
greasy side I like that this has some
thickness to it it really helped my
foundation glide on smoothly on top
reminds me a lot of the maybelline baby
skin as well if you're looking for a
low-cost alternative to that kind of
primer from Smashbox that's in here and
that worked well another thing that
worked well was the blush and this was
kind of like an up-and-down feeling for
me because I think it looks beautiful in
the compact it is kind of a coral blush
with a little bit of a very very fine
golden shimmer and I thought okay that
looks beautiful i swatched it and
thought oh where's the color like I was
getting no color payoff in the swatch
but then I applied it to my cheeks and I
thought yes
you know I'm loving the color on my
cheeks it's just I think that's
beautiful I mean what like where did
that come from because it does look like
it should be good in here but it just
goes to show swatches are not everything
sometimes the way a brush picks up
product can be totally different from
the way a finger picks it up and then
transfers it onto your hand so I guess I
would say in the way that this blush
really matters which is an application
it did very well and I just really liked
the color and if MUA
expands in my CVS store and puts out
blushes that would be something I would
try there's a mini lipstick in here it
is labeled as nude lipstick but it's
pretty dark it's kind of like a one of
those topi a little bit more grayish
nudes I put it on I was really gonna
wear it for you in this video but I just
it was sucking the life out of my face
like I did not look very healthy was
that on I know that can be kind of a
trendy shade these days oh do you know
how to sleep I've been getting lately I
need life I need brightness to the lips
so actually what I am wearing is one of
the new colour-pop ultra matte lips in
the shade Scrooge and I love this
beautiful berry nothing like a really
poppin berry to liven up the face anyway
this shade it feels great it's very soft
it has a lot of shine it's just not the
color for me the other two things in
here are eye products there's a pro
eyeliner in the shade black kind of
interesting how they cut these and I
know you can sharpen them yourself and
get a more precise point but it's like
there's a blunt tip on the end and I
don't know you swatch reasonably well
and you would think okay there's a soft
eyeliner that should go on my lash line
fairly easily but when I was trying to
apply these over my eye look it's like
they would not transfer I really think
eyeliner pencils need to have that
next-level softness to be able to
transfer onto the lash line when you've
got a powdery surface there and this one
just was not doing that and I have
another one that came in the eyeshadows
set it's a brown and I was having the
same problem with it another issue with
these is that they don't completely set
they can be smudged and even after that
swatch has been sitting around for 10
minutes or so so that's a problem you
get a little mascara in here it's okay
for me I mean the brush is one of those
kind of classics spiraled around brushes
a little bit tapered toward the tip not
a gigantic brush I thought the size
managable the formula of the mascara is
pretty dry almost a little too dry out
of mine blowing that scary I wasn't
achieving a lot of great length and
thickness just sort of a natural look I
would say and so mama had to go topping
that off with some false lashes today
you know so with only 2 out of 5
products being a hit out of this kit I
would say it's not really worth the $20
and I wouldn't recommend it the other
kit is the back to basics I set and in
here in its own little box there is a
palette it's got this cream color and
these Browns right here that come off
matte there are some other like satin
finishes that are very nearly met
there's nothing super shiny in this kit
and like this kind of golden e bronze I
was really not very impressed that I
wanted that to pop more normally I feel
like I'm looking for more matte in
palettes here I was looking for
something that just popped a little bit
more to bring more life to what was
happening because it just all seemed
kind of dull for my look today I'm
wearing this sort of bronze e shade on
the lid I really had to work to build
that up like using the little brush in
here which is actually a decent brush
it's kind of a cross between a flat
brush and a fluffy brush it can apply
some shadow to the lid maybe not as
effectively as a Sonia Kashuk small
shadow brush which is really nice and
flat but I think it could do the job and
have multiple functions for you but
anyway on that bronzy shade I had to
kind of go back in and really press it
on with my finger to build up any sort
of pop with that shade in my crease i
layered both of the Browns I've got a
little bit of the black in the crease as
well and just underneath I use both of
these shades as a highlight and finished
look like I said nothing crazy different
that I couldn't pull off with a number
of different palettes that I own and
this shimmery plum you know that looks
like that should be a pretty color the
bronze seems like it should be pretty
but in application in use on the eyes I
felt like they were just lacking I did
apply them on top of a primer and I just
needed a little more pop now the extras
that come with this set are a brown
eyeliner same formula as the black that
I mentioned you know doesn't totally set
I ended up just going with a liquid
liner for this look because I was
struggling so much with getting this
liner transfer which is odd that I was
having that hard of a time considering
how easily it's watched on my hand but
whatever and
it comes with a nice full-size brush
here this says smudger detailer 3:11 so
I take it this is a brush that would be
available in the whole regular line and
this is great this is dense it's soft it
really does make a nice little smudger
here on the lower lash line I could see
it smudging out a nice creamy eyeliner
on the upper lash line perhaps so
basically any brush that I've come in
contact with with this MUA line I've
really liked though itty-bitty one and
the palette the little crease brush that
I bought on its own this one that came
with the set the smudge brush number 311
I mean that was great but for what
you're getting in these kits I kind of
thought 20 bucks seemed a little steep
let me know if you've tried any of the
other kits maybe there were some better
ones they're the ones that I didn't end
up picking up who knows but I just
wanted to give you a heads up on what
I've been finding in my local CVS store
thank you for watching and I'll see you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
