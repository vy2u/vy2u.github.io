video where I'm going to be explaining
one of my favorite Christmas gifts it's
the tart jewelry box palette such a neat
palette there is so much inside of here
I'm going to walk you through what all's
on the inside on the outside you can see
it's got this gorgeous kind of quilted
gold top and a necklace that you can
actually take off and wear if you want
to so in a second here I will show you
what all is on all the layers that are
inside this palette and show some
swatches along the way and then at the
end i'll give you my overall review of
this product so keep on watching first
things first we open up the palette to
our first level of eyeshadows
so what you're getting here all in all
is that 16 shimmery shadow colors so you
can see they really have a lot of depth
to them a lot of these shades what I
like so much is that you're getting so
many really nice jewel tones if you are
one of those people who maybe you tend
to gravitate more toward the neutrals
but if you want to branch out and try
some color these are all really wearable
colors i feel like the shades are in
many cases very creamy feeling there are
a few of the lighter shades where I kind
of felt like okay maybe that could be a
little more pigmented or have a little
more to it in my in my personal opinion
some of the stars of this palette I love
these top two especially together that
kind of sort of golden e butter cream
shade and that burgundy are awesome
these shades right here it's kind of an
old gold and then more of a metallic
gold those are gorgeous the copper is
incredible right there and then this
shade is very interesting what I'm
focusing in on here looks kind of like a
purple but it has sort of a blue
iridescent and at times it can even look
Brown if you're familiar with the shade
label whore from Too Faced it has kind
of that similar idea there it's not
quite how it appears and you just kind
of got to try it to realize overall top
layer of shadows very good you have tons
of colors to experiment with and I
really don't think you're going to get
bored with then the top flaps kind of
spin out and what you have on the second
layer are the matte colors
now keep in mind these are all
full-sized colors so think what it would
probably cost you get you know 32 full
size high end shadows and then think
about what you actually wind up with
here this is it's great to kind of have
them separated I like having the mat
separate from the shimmer because
oftentimes that's kind of how I decide
what I'm going to do you know I really
want you know that purely shimmery shade
on the lid but then I really want to
find a matte shade to put in the crease
or maybe as a liner or something like
that so many of these shades can double
as gorgeous liners i love that plum this
is a great go-to shade it's interesting
because rather than being black it is a
pretty deep charcoal that does not have
shimmer it's so nice this blue is lovely
and so is this green right here kind of
a I don't know a jungle green it's
really pretty this robin's egg blue is
another lovely shade so again if you
want to experiment with color I mean
these are not unwearable shades so and
they do coordinate nicely with some
other shades in the shimmery side so
just use your imagination the one thing
I don't really like is that I mean I
love the shadows don't get me wrong I
think this is a fantastic selection of
eyeshadows but they don't have names and
sometimes I'm not even sure how they
would lay that out on this palette but
it's so useful when palettes like those
from urban decay and to face lists the
names and when you're trying to do a
tutorial people can know what you're
using or you can more easily remember
what colors you used here there are
little numbered like clear sheets that
are laying on top of this when you get
them but it's just not practical for
those to stick around all the time or to
refer to them constantly so that's kind
of the mist where the shadows are
concerned next we pull out the drawer
that has our bronzer highlighter and lip
gloss
I am nuts about what is known as the
soft pink Luminizer here this is kind of
it reminds me of like candle light when
you put this on your face you have the
most beautiful glow but also just a hint
of the golden shimmer it is such a nice
finishing touch for pretty much any
makeup look that you have the size of
that these are big these are the size of
like what you would get in a compact the
bronzer is also really nice keep in mind
it's a shimmery bronzer so that may
affect how you wear it this could be I
think this could be very good on fair
skin it could be good on a little bit
deeper skin as well it's not orangi it
just has the nice sort of bronze tone it
has kind of a almost creamy feel to it
and a really nice shimmer but this isn't
going to be something you may want to
contour with this is what you want to
give to kind of give you that sunkissed
glow where the Sun might naturally hit
you
now these lip glosses I think really
offer something for everyone therefore
the girl who likes the red lip the
person who wants the neutrally nude lip
and someone who likes the pink lip as
well and you're going to get a mix here
of creamy shades and shades i have just
a little bit of sparkle to them to point
out those shades that have a little
shimmer this one that kind of a peachy
golden e shade this one right here kind
of your classic mauve this bright berry
and this one down here peachy pinky a
little bit less gold than that shade so
a little more peach in that one's a
little more go red is very nice and
would be a nice topper to any red
lipstick but my go-to combination I use
this on New Year's Eve and I loved using
this pink and this berry shade for the
ultimate bright pink lip I went all over
my lips with the with this kind of
Barbie bubblegum pink and then I went
over parts of it with this deeper paint
to give it some dimension but I let this
pink really shine through on the bottom
part of my lower lip it made a really
pouty full look these two are just
dynamite together and last but not least
we have the eyeliners
I have tried these liners out and
they're supposed to be long wearing
eyeliners and I've got to say I wore
these even on my lower lash line which
is kind of like my personal danger zone
and what you've got here basically also
to walk you through the shades shimmery
black green kind of a golden e yeah
golden shade a plum and regular black
they wear very well there they're very
creamy you don't have to try hard to put
them on but in terms of some of these
shimmery shades my goodness these are
some of the best shimmery liners that I
have tried because they did this tart is
not attempting to put large chunks of
glitter into an eyeliner pencil that's
kind of my pet peeve when you run into
really chunky glitter in a pencil in an
eyeliner pencil of all things how is
that supposed to glide on so the shimmer
is really fine and look at that green
how gorgeous is that green picture that
on the lower lash line you know I mean
and then top it off with one of the
shadows I just think these are great
little liners downfall here these are
very hard to get out of the container so
pretty much as soon as i'm done with
this review I'm nabin all of these out
of here and putting them somewhere else
in terms of the overall palette I mean I
think it's an awesome palette I really
enjoy the makeup that's inside but if
you are looking for something that can
really be portable something you can
travel with I think you would have to be
very very careful if you wanted to toss
this in you know a big bag and travel
around with it because in terms of its
practicality at least for mine I can
tell that that's maybe supposed to kind
of attached here at the sides and in
sort of a magnetic way the front is has
kind of a weak magnet there you can see
that doesn't really cling very tight so
that can easily come undone and these
sides already kind of are loose so I
don't feel like there's anything really
tightly holding that in again if you
want to really work with this take the
necklace off the front but yeah I worry
about that because if this does kind of
come undone you've got instantly
bunch of broken eye shadows on the
inside and this top you wouldn't want to
put a whole lot of pressure down on top
of that either so while this looks
gorgeous sitting out on your vanity
don't plan on it to be unless you've got
a very secure way of traveling with this
don't plan on this to be your maybe your
go to travel piece so that may be one of
the only down pulls that this has
because I really really enjoy the brand
the products inside are awesome and to
give you just a few more words about
this brand because there's a little kind
of info sheet here that comes with it
and tart is a very kind of fun people
friendly product and animal friendly as
well it's cruelty free so it's not
tested on animals it's also formulated
without parabens mineral oil phthalates
sodium lauryl sulfate synthetic dye
synthetic fragrance so and even more so
there are a lot of those bad things
taken out and in it are what are called
skin vigor aiding ingredients vitamins A
and E vitamin C grapeseed oil mineral
pigments and cocoa seed butter so a lot
of thought I think has gone into the
creation of this brand the development
of the products and this is just so fun
to go through a big palette like this
and have so many options just to open it
up in place so that's what I feel like
I'm doing often times when I'm in here
and my makeup room ideas come in and I
start playing around and I walk out with
tons of product on my face most days but
anyway hope you enjoy my review of this
and I hope if you get a chance to check
this out and let me know what you think
of it so thanks again for watching guys
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
