foundation and powder and these are
pretty new launches they came out around
the same time that the Fergie collection
came out but these are part of just wet
and wilds regular lines so it's a cream
foundation it says and just a pressed
powder so I'm going to be showing you in
this video my review as well as an
application and talked about you know
how this goes on the staying power and
that sort of thing a names and stuff
like that seem a little bit funky
because I am light in the foundation and
medium and the powder and the powder
even though it's named medium seems even
just a little bit lighter than that
foundation so basically the foundation
runs dark that's something to be aware
of this is being labeled a cream
foundation and I think that's pretty
accurate it's a little bit thicker than
a lot of the liquid foundations that are
out there now like Revlon Colorstay
Revlon nearly naked L'Oreal Lumi L'Oreal
True Match just some of those different
kinds that our liquid foundations are
very liquidy this has a little bit
thicker texture and it still it seems to
provide pretty much medium coverage as
you see the application you'll see it's
going to even out the skin tone as a
whole but it's not quite full coverage
to the point that it takes care of
things without the NEET without needing
a concealer to come in as far as the
finish on this foundation I mean when
you put it on it doesn't seem to be like
glowy or shimmery it has no shimmer or
anything like that in it but it doesn't
seem to be like super super matte like
some foundations are it has kind of just
a natural finish so I like that the
powder is a pressed powder and it
doesn't have a mirror anywhere in the
compact just always like to point that
out because some that that's a handy
thing to have on the go it does come
with a sponge and here's your powder
powder actually has quite a nice feel to
it it's maybe not quite the quality
level that I see in L'Oreal True Match
or that Revlon nearly naked powder those
are a couple of my favorites from the
drugstore right now it still seems to
pack a little bit of coverage so when
put it on on top of the foundation you
do notice just that just slightly
enhanced coverage level and once you do
apply this on top of the foundation you
do look totally matte so I think a
really oily skin person might see that
finished look right after applying the
makeup and be like okay I'm totally
matte you know I'm set for the day I'm
not gonna have any problems with this
issue starts to come up in how this
wears during the day because this is a
little bit thicker foundation it has
just I feel like a little more moisture
content to it than a lot of the other
foundations and for a dry skin person I
think that's great you know if you feel
like your your look starts to look extra
cakey or dry or cracked kinda seaming
throughout the day this is something
that might you know gives a little bit
of hydration back to the skin but if
you're oily you know it's going to have
that matte appearance once you get done
applying these two but as the day goes
on for me is like a combination skin
person who is closer to the normal side
of things during winter time even dry in
some places I still get a little oily in
the t-zone with this it's not it's not
major and I know I mentioned that a lot
with foundations oh I needed to touch up
a little bit with powder later in the
day I didn't have a huge issue with this
but I did have a little bit of oil in
the nose and forehead area I wasn't to
the point of like breaking down the
product I didn't feel like you know the
foundation totally disappeared or
anything to that extent but I did get a
little bit oily and I think that's just
a reflection of what my skin type is I
would love to hear from a dry skin
person who's tried this because I have a
feeling it would perform better at least
in the staying power department for that
I want to take you through the
application I just kind of dotted this
all over my face I could sense you know
just a little bit thicker texture that
this foundation has so I put it all over
and I blended it out with my Sigma f80
brush I feel like that just gives a
really nice even application to the
foundation and then I did go in with my
covergirl plus ol a concealer balm just
on those areas where I felt like I
needed a little extra coverage you can
see my skin tone is really evened out
with this foundation but it does leave a
you know some areas where you still need
the concealer then
I went in with the coverall pressed
powder and the main effect that I see
from this you know a little bit enhanced
coverage but a really really matte
finish and like I said how long will it
stay matte I think that's really
dependent on your skin type you're an
incredibly oily person expect sort of a
breakdown in this foundation throughout
the day if you're about like me you're
somewhere in the middle a little bit
more towards normal but do have you know
that combination issue sometimes around
the t-zone be prepared for a touch-up I
think a touch-up of the powder or of you
know whatever powder you prefer to use
will pretty much solve that problem
you're dry I think this could be you
know a good foundation to try for your
skin type I can't guarantee that I am
just me but if you do want to try this I
think it's definitely not the financial
risk that a lot of the foundations in
the drugstore would pose I mean I'm
noticing prices getting upwards of 11
and 12 dollars for drugstore foundations
if not more sometimes and these are
under five dollars I mean I think the
powder is just like maybe around three
dollars and the foundation perhaps three
to four dollars depends on where you
show overall pleasantly surprised with
the quality of this foundation and
powder if you've tried them I'd love to
hear what you think and thank you so
much for watching I'll see you next time
