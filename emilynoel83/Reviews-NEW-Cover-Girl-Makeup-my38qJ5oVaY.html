bunch of new covergirl products I just
saw them earlier last week at Walmart
ever since I got have I've been playing
around so I could do this review for you
and they are a brand new foundation it's
the covergirl clean whipped cream
foundation there's also like a little
three-in-one blush thingy here called
clean glow blush there's a brand new
mascara called flamed out and there are
three new lip products new products fun
I mean I get so excited when I see like
a new display in the drugstore or
something and this stuff totally
blindsided me because I hadn't been
hearing anybody talk about this at all
and then all of a sudden I walked down
the aisle and I'm like walk down the
aisle sounds like a wedding but I walked
down the Walmart aisle the makeup I'll
and I saw this at the end of it and I
was like cool this is happening okay and
as I do this video it's gonna cut to
some demos like a demo on the foundation
of the blush and the mascara so you can
see how those things actually apply but
let's start off with the foundation
again this is covergirl clean whipped
cream foundation I got it in shade
325 there's a little number there on the
front and I didn't even realize these
had names cuz it was written so tiny on
the back but really teeny tiny there's a
shade name and I have buff beige and
that seems just about perfect for my
skin tone and your product is like this
as you can see it's not a real liquidy
product it definitely is not like as
solid or light as say Maybelline Dream
matte mousse it's more similar to the
texture of Revlon Colorstay whipped only
this maybe has a little less moisture to
it or it feels a little less moist as
you apply it to your skin for the Revlon
Colorstay whipped you're getting 0.8
yeah point 8 fluid ounces and for this
you're getting point six I don't really
mind the lesser amount of product in
this one but I do appreciate the much
more compact size of packaging here this
is just much more hand a lot less bulky
to store - the first thing I noticed
when I applied this foundation I was
like wow this is
really full-coverage like it has the
potential to be you can apply it kind of
lightly to your skin and you're gonna
notice like some pretty good coverage
but then if you go on top of some spots
and add just a little bit more product
you're gonna see it basically I mean I
would say for minor imperfections it can
eliminate the need for a concealer for
some people it's not gonna be that way
for everyone probably but I mean like
for me for example if you've got a
little under-eye darkness if you've got
some sunspots somewhere it pretty much
covered those up entirely for me so the
way I applied it go to the product kind
of dab it all over my face for that
initial amount of product that was on
there I used my Sigma f80 brush it's
just a nice flat top brush I feel like
it gives really even coverage I love the
way it blends out pretty much any
foundation I own but I did that and then
like I explained you can go back to the
product and build up a little more just
with your fingers you know wherever you
need a little extra coverage so
extremely pleased with the coverage this
has a very matte finish on the skin I
mentioned that the Revlon Colorstay
whipped feels like it has a little bit
more moisture to the product and I do
think that shows this has more of a
natural finish on the skin I'm not
calling it dewy or glowy or anything
like that but just I mean it has kind of
a skin-like appearance this one really
makes you look matte after you apply it
so easy to blend in good coverage matte
finish as far as staying power goes for
the last few days have been wearing this
kind of looking at how long it's worn
after about six hours on me I notice a
little bit of doing this a little bit of
extra glow around the nose and the
forehead and the chin I have kind of
combo skin I do tend to get a little
more oily here I can be a little bit
more dry around my mouth between my
eyebrows even lately I've been a little
bit more dry around my jawline but when
I said I noticed a little bit of oil
after six hours that was on a very like
I was not running around very much I
wasn't even going outside a whole lot
points where that it wasn't totally like
breaking down the product like it wasn't
like okay where did the foundation go it
was still very much there I
noticed a little bit more oil than I did
when I first applied it and had that
flawless law it was easily corrected
with a little bit of powder I was good
to go for the rest of the night I would
say in terms of my recommendation for
who could use this I wouldn't really
suggest it to people on the absolute
extreme ends of the spectrum really
really oily I think you could see this
being a little bit heavy on you yes I
think you would love like that initial
wonderfully matte finish on your skin
but I mean for my skin being somewhat
normal to combo and still getting oily
after six hours I could see this
especially during these summer months
you know you're sweating a little bit
you're being outside more I could see it
maybe being a bit much for people with
extremely oily skin also if you're
really really dry that super matte
finish I wonder about it possibly
clinging to some very dry areas you
might have and not giving you like the
radiant bit of a glow that you might you
know want from a foundation but if
you're normal if you're kind of combo if
you don't have a whole lot of oil
problems or a ton of dry problems this
may be something you want to try if you
enjoy matte finish that could be good
for you if you like full coverage you
know it's gonna be that again if you are
super oily and you want a good
foundation to try that covergirl outlast
stay fabulous is gonna be a little bit
thinner texture it's more liquidy and
that's got very hardcore staying power
got aging skin or a lot of fine lines I
don't want to say this couldn't work for
you but there are some other foundations
on the market that I think could do a
little bit more as far as the appearance
of your skin goes like L'Oreal visible
lift is actually a nice foundation that
gives a little bit of a radiant look not
glittery not shimmery but it just seems
to have a little bit more of a skin like
appearance I feel like this one the
Revlon Colorstay does as well but like I
said matte full coverage if that's what
you like and you're not super oily or
super dry you might want to try that
okay the other new thing that I saw was
this covergirl and it is the clean glow
blush and it comes in a little packaging
like that it says lightweight blendable
matte color so being sold as a line of
matte blushes there's not a ton of matte
blush in the drugstore so I thought that
was kind of
exciting I got the shade in 110 called
peaches and they all have the same kind
of format where you've got a dark shade
the light sort of blush color shade and
then the lightest shade and as you can
see there's no sparkle in this at all
not even a satin finish this is totally
matte and the way I like the appearance
of this best on my cheeks is when I
blend my brush over all of this I feel
like I get a little bit more pigmented
color that way I tried at first just
like sweeping my brush in here just
sweeping it here there this can work for
a little bit of a contour but I don't
feel like like this alone packs a lot of
punch if that makes sense just as a
blush this middle shade I run across a
lot of drugstore blushes that have a lot
of sparkle and frosty finishes and for
this they had several different shades
they have this peachy shade I think they
may have had more of a rosy shade it's
kind of spice colored she actually give
this a thumbs up I mean it's not the
most astonishingly crazy awesome product
you know in the drugstore but it's nice
to have more matte options coming out
and I do like this color
so it's something I'll keep using next
new thing is this flamed out mascara
check it out it's got a pretty - beer
with some purple flames on it anytime I
see a new mascara I it's like I have two
old voices it'd be one saying don't do
it you've got too many mascaras and then
the others like you must try this new
mascara so I tried it and a lot of you
wanting to see a review so I'm doing it
for you right but this is what the
packaging looks like claims to have this
special what did it call it a volume
igniter brush yeah the brush is kind of
like an hourglass shape it's kind of
short from left to right but it's really
I don't know if you can tell here but
it's very deeply pinched in the center
and in terms of the tip like there's not
really much going on there it's just
kind of a traditional mascara wand this
is not a rubber bristle brush I in terms
of the way the formula is I would call
it I wouldn't call it a specially dry
but I don't find it to be
as wet as say a Maybelline Great Lash
formula is initially as I apply this I'm
like wow that built up volume really
quickly or it made it let me restate
that it built up thickness on my lashes
quickly didn't necessarily give me the
look of more lashing my small issue with
this is that this is such a deep curve
in here and I really like to you know
get the mascara on and then I'm totally
one who really wiggles in the brush and
tries to get it right there at the base
of your lashes and it's like these two
kind of bulbous areas here you know
they're getting in contact almost with
your lash line and then this little this
little gap here that dips in like that
doesn't get in there the same way and
when you push a little bit harder to get
it in there then you start hitting your
eyelid and so I don't know if that makes
sense but it's like I prefer a brush
that's kind of a little bit more you
know just one solid shape so that way
it's easier to navigate you know what I
mean and this didn't do that well with
separation that's the thing it built up
thickness but it didn't make them look
it's nicely separated as like the clump
crusher or you know regular lash blast
or anything like that hard to get like
just that consistently separated nice
look throughout all the lashes you know
what I mean just because it's so pinched
in and it's like you have a segment of
brush where you really don't feel like
you can get to anything that had a lot
of issues with this flaking off onto my
cheeks or problems with it smudging and
smear everybody's got like different
experiences and different preferences
with mascara but I'm not all that
thrilled with this one but not least
or maybe least I don't know this is the
the lips licks smoochies does anybody
remember lips licks just the regular
like kind of tinted lip-balm product
from covergirl
I remember having like pretty much every
one of those at one point in time
they're kind of a sheer lipstick they
feel a little bit moisturizing on the
lips just kind of a step down from the
opaque really saturated color that a lot
of lipsticks has are these smoochies
seem to be just a little extension of
that line of lips licks and I swear I
think
they've duplicated some of the colors I
wish I still had some of those lips
licks but I mean it was several years
ago probably the last time I was really
using them and so I don't have them
anymore to do it a distinct comparison
but you might just check in the store if
you're considering buying one of these
maybe go back to the regular lips licks
and see if there's some overlap I know
for a fact okay this shade called
hashtag sweet tweet they're trying to
appeal to the Twitter audience here this
one I thought was going to be like just
a sheer pink color no this is totally
clear gloss and I know that there is a
lip Slick's that is just clear gloss but
if you look at it there
it's swatch right there can't hardly see
it at all maybe if I really built it up
can you see any don't be fooled this is
just like that same clear lips licks
that one called sweet tweet so I mean
not worth it for me if I'm gonna put
something on give me some color other
one here this is hashtag see you later
with an eight so and so this is like a
light frosty pink and I swear there was
a shade in the regular line that looks
kinda like this one too I didn't really
think about it much while I was in the
store but once I got it home I was like
this looks familiar I think there's a
light frosty pink already like there's
that kind of almost clear one and then
there's this pink see how Frost really
light frosty pink lip can look a little
bit dated sometimes depending on how you
wear that you can boost it up with a
with a lip liner or a gloss over it or
something like that but this just comes
off very light and I don't see myself
wearing it a lot I only has tags smooch
okay this is the one I'm wearing today
and this is just kind of a neutral soft
pink I amp'd mine up just a little bit
with some of this Jordana baby berry lip
liner but overall color that you're
seeing here on my lips is from this so
as you can see it's just like a
traditional pink it looks like it would
be totally creamy but when I got it home
I started putting it on and let's see if
the extreme closeup will show
actually kind of gritty it's got kind of
a gritty shimmer in it that neither the
other two had and let's see it side by
side here see how it's you know it's a
warmer pink but there is definitely like
you can feel it as you put it on and I
don't really like that feeling like a
little bit of grit to the shimmer and I
not cool I know that they had some
darker ones in the display as well my
advice to you is if you've already got a
bunch of the regular lip slicks at home
give them a good look and make sure to
compare before you buy new ones
otherwise in some cases you might be
buying the exact same thing I think I
feel like these all just kind of have
the same scent that I remember these
lips lips having it's kind of like
smells like makeup but a little bit
sweeter so there you go guys that's all
the new stuff I have another thing I
want to mention about the foundation
I've tried the regular clean liquid
foundation and it clearly broke me out
like after a couple days of wearing it
this one has not had any adverse effect
on my skin that's just me I can't
guarantee how it's gonna work for you or
if it's gonna break somebody out or
somebody's going to be allergic to
something but I found it interesting
that the clean and the bottle did not
agree with my skin but this one worked
fine and this also does not have that
strong Noxzema scent that some of the
clean like powders and foundations can
have from covergirl so anyway thanks for
watching guys I hope you enjoyed this
review and I'll sign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
