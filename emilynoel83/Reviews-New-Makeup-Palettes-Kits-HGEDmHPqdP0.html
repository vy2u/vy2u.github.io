like I do I think you're gonna really
enjoy this video this is going to be a
lot of different reviews on 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 different sets or pallets of makeup
I know that Christmas time is coming
soon as well so once I get my hands on
some of the holiday kits I'll try to let
you know like what I think about those
and maybe another video like this before
Christmas time so if you're wondering
what to put on your list or what to get
for somebody else that may be helpful
meanwhile these are just some relatively
new pallets that have come out and have
lots of swatches and pictures along the
way and if I have other videos where I
featured these things I will definitely
link to those as well first palette I
want to talk about is when I am loving
so much it is the feminine palette from
Urban Decay this is so awesome I am
loving this little kit even though you
know it may not have as many shades as
the naked palettes or you know some of
the brands larger palettes it does have
a gorgeous selection of shades that
really caught my eyes really drawn in by
that bordello shade it's like a gorgeous
shimmery rose then you've got your light
highlight DC is a really pretty lilac
and you've got gunmetal highjack as a
gorgeous teal lost is a great Brown and
I'm really glad they threw a neutral
Brown into this kit because last weekend
I was doing a look with this where I
combined the just these two pretty much
it was gorgeous today I'm wearing this
kit and I'm using more of this pink
shade bordello on the lids and the brown
in the crease and a little bit of a CDC
smudged underneath so it's really really
versatile II haven't picked up the vice
palette yet I saw them both when I went
to Ulta and I was actually more drawn to
this I don't know why I just love those
shades it's simple its quick it's easy
its small portable the Too Faced return
of sexy palette I have a tutorial out on
this this is my going goal for childhood
cancer awareness video I use this and I
use these more neutral colors here I
also did a blog post with more swatches
and my
on this overall what you should know
about this palette is that it is 100%
shimmery some shades are more like
sparkly than others actually contain you
know like some little glittery bits
other shades are more just a little bit
metallic I think it's a gorgeous palette
and I love it I really love what's going
on with the smoky side and how they give
you like kind of like a rosy shade
almost like a rosy taupe type color
purple section is probably what I've
reached for the most when I've been
wanting a purple look lately this is the
part I go to it comes with a really nice
quality liner as well this is the
perfect eyes waterproof liner so I
really like this palette but what it's
lacking is obviously some matte shades I
know a lot of people are like you know
if it doesn't have some mad I'm not
really interested so if you like shimmer
I think this is great you can still get
gorgeous looks with this palette alone
think the colors are absolutely gorgeous
but if you love mat you're not getting
any they're the difference with that and
the lorac Pro palette obviously is the
lorac Pro gives you half matte half
shimmer it's just that easy top is matte
bottom is shimmer it's very you know
simply laid out for you is a lot of
neutral shades a lot of classics that
you would want like you know golds and
champagne colors and browns
light to dark also a great classic matte
black but you do get some fun colors to
play with like garnet you get a nice
deep plum I also love the mauve shade I
think that is a super matte shade that
they included in this kit but it's
really easy to use I have a tutorial
showing an all matte look that I really
hadn't ever done before on the ice and I
just loved it got lots of good feedback
on that but the shades are super sonn
thing to keep in mind just they all have
a tendency to give you a little bit of
Fallout meaning when you stick your
brush into one of the colors it can get
a little flaky so make sure to tap it
off before you start applying on your
eyes you eyes that I mean the shades are
gorgeous they swatch beautifully as you
saw there but I mean they are also just
beautiful on the eyes and super
blendable so I would really recommend
this palette was I have more than just
eye palette in this video but another
one I've gotten tons of questions on is
the Mallee in the buff palette and what
you have here is actually an eye base
this is kind of a Paint Pot style style
base if you know what I mean it's not
one like Urban Decay primer potion two
faced shadow insurance that you put on
and it kind of disappears onto the list
it's just kind of like a base color and
it makes everything else pop a little
bit more when you put it on I've learned
the hard way don't use too much of that
it will crease if you use it very thin
though it's just right it actually does
prolong the wear of the shadows and it
makes each one even your lighter colors
really stand out from one another comes
with a brush it's a double-ended brush
one side is like a more full crease
brush the other side sort of a smudger
brush that can also be used in the
crease for a little more control really
soft really nice quality on the brush
and the shades are overall really warm
and they're pretty much just in the
brown family I mean with the exception
of this color that's kind of more like a
grayish taupe everything else is really
kind of a warm brown or golden type
shade and that's nice I enjoy using the
palette for that purpose when I want you
know my warm Browns and that kind of a
super neutral look
however the question of course is if I
already have the Naked 1 and the Naked 2
you know do I need this thinking this is
going to give you something extra in
addition to what the naked palettes do I
don't think it really does I don't think
you have to have this if you already
have naked one especially because there
is a lot of overlap you're getting deep
Browns and gold's but even with the
naked one you're also getting some
plummy shades and some really dark like
charcoal almost black colors you know
that come in The Naked 1 and here I mean
it's gorgeous and it's natural but it's
just mainly Browns if that's what you
want you may want this power shades
measure up to the quality of the urban
decay shadows I knew I already liked the
malli
formula the way her shadows go on but
for sheer variety I don't think this is
a must-have if you've already got your
Naked palette a product from Malley a
holiday kit that I'm just floored by and
I just had to get this even when I saw
it online before I saw a presentation I
had to place my order for this it's her
hi shun liquid lipsticks but it is a
library of 10 oh these are referred to
as being a slim line because they are
smaller than the regular size now
lipglosses variety is great here there
are some shades that I already have just
a few I'm like blossom
that's a shade that I love I'm wearing
them on my lips right now or a bunch of
new shades I think some brand new shades
just in her line now in this kit and
what's really cool is that you get a
super deep shade that's very on trend
for this season like this deep berry
then you get a nice range of pinks from
like almost a plum II pink to some
lighter colors this heartbreaker red
shade is awesome I wore that to the
Cardinals game I went to a couple weeks
ago it was stunning I love that color it
makes your teeth look so white or opaque
on the lips even if you use a nude shade
it really does show also love that you
can take these out like all the way to
the border of your lips and there's no
feathering out or anything like that
it's a phenomenal formula just
comfortable to wear it has good staying
power obviously if you're eating a lot
or you're drinking or kissing or
something like that these are gonna wear
it down they're not a long wear lip
product like a stain or something like
that that's better than some of the more
slick or greasy lip glosses so I love
these and I love this little kit I have
this kit from benefit it's called she's
so Jet Set and it says living the luxe
makeup kit and it is a cute little box
here that comes with sort of a little
grab bag of benefit products you've got
the professional Pro Bowl to minimize
pores you get a little eyeshadow quad
here actually that seems to be the
equivalent of like a full-sized
eyeshadow quad that you might see from
some brands the blush is kind of small
it's like a half peach blush half sort
of golden highlight type color you get
one of the benefits they're real mascara
and if you're not familiar with that
it's the kind that has that little spiky
end there see how there's little tips on
the end that can help you kind of flare
out the lashes I do like this mascara
it's not my all-time favorite but it's
pretty good the challenge with this
little guy you don't have much wand from
here to here so it can be a little
difficult it's like all brush so it can
be a little tricky to get around with
certain parts of your eye get a soft
kind of peachy lip color very nude
live like what's in this kit but my only
complaint personally and I had the same
thing with the how to look the best at
everything kit was that not every
product in here it lifts out like it's
cool that you could take the
professional with you you could take the
gloss out with you but your blush and
your eyeshadows stay in here and to say
if I just wanted to take the eyeshadow
somewhere I've got to take the whole box
and so I think it would be kind of cool
if that was just like a little pop out
thing but if you were giving this as a
gift to somebody who wanted to test out
some benefits stuff I think this would
give them a great idea of the brand I
really do love the quality of these
shadows but I wouldn't rush out and get
this kit for the shadows because these
are some basic colors you're probably
gonna already have blush is pretty but
it's not amazing so I just gotta give
this kit sort of an average rating I
like the stuff but I don't think it's an
absolute rush out and get it type of kit
another thing that I was kind of
disappointed by from benefit was the per
cup artist as clever and funny as this
packaging is I love how it's kind of
like there's your pickup artist perk up
artist that guy on there and then inside
you've got these little compartments
they all open up individually so none of
them really dry out but one says correct
that's the yellow once it's cover and
one says Brighton problem is is that
these basically don't do enough there's
not enough coverage there's not enough
impact results whatever you want to say
yellow does an okay job of like
brightening up your under eye area but
the cover one the one that's basically
the concealer is not thick enough these
are all a very very thin thin texture
and it's really easy for them to just
rub them in they just disappear entirely
and that cover part like you can't count
on that to cover up a lot of redness
spots discoloration on your face I mean
I feel like I would put this stuff on
and then I'd be like okay I need to grab
another concealer because this didn't
work the brighten that's another part
that like totally disappeared I thought
this was going to be like a pretty you
know kind of glowy thing to wake up
maybe my inner parts of my eye area and
once again just kind of a greasy feel
and it sort of disappeared so I
my tip would be the correct is okay
they shouldn't they shouldn't have just
made these all the same texture the
concealer needs to be a little thicker
so it can cover more and the brighten I
was just like where to go where to go it
disappeared so sorry but I'm not a fan
of but only something I know I've talked
about on Instagram Twitter whatnot this
is from laura geller it's the
fresh-brewed beauty kit and for coffee
lovers like me this instantly catches
your eye and you think oh that's so cute
so I was really excited by this kit
there are actually some products in the
kit that are caffeine infused which is
kind of neat but basically with this kit
it is a neutral matte kit that's what
we're talking about here you get a
balanced and brightened full-size I know
I love this product my mom loves this
product this is a powder foundation
swirled with different shades different
pigment in a blush and this is known as
the baked impressions this is a new sort
of line you notice it's not domed up
like a lot of her baked products are
it's pressed in and it's got that Coffee
Bean detail but this is sort of a much
neutral blush I'm wearing the blush
today I think it's pretty I like not one
of the blushes you look at and go what a
stunning blush it's just kind of neutral
um and that's what it's supposed to be
and that's okay the thing that I have
been using the most out of this kit has
actually been this great highlight it's
the baked highlighter in French vanilla
this one is domed up a little bit comes
with a little double ended thing here
you've got like kind of a paddle side
almost that you can use here and then
you've got a smaller side you can use it
around the eyes what I love about this
is this is not a shimmery highlight at
all voted on today and I love how it
does actually function to light in
certain areas brighten them up but no
sparkle wear this to like fill a rock
perfectly lit powder in spotlight this
is less golden and even less shimmery
than that just a really natural finish
maybe just kind of a satin finish I
don't know I really really like it you
also get a trio of eyeshadows neutral
matte eyeshadows and they also have the
little coffee bean imprint there's
absolutely no fallout with these they're
relatively easy to blend and you can't
wear them you can wear them wet or dry
you're buying for someone who wants
natural mat makeup I think of people
with even aging skin and they're like
yes this is what I want because I don't
want a ton of shimmer attracting
attention to wrinkles around the eye
this could be really good for you this
whole kit could be very wearable for you
it comes with the gloss as well this is
the color drenched grunt loss and cafe
au lait it does have a little bit of a
coffee type scent I really like that
gloss as a whole I mean it's got a
couple of Laura Keller's outstanding
products the balance in Brighton and the
highlight the other things are nice
little extras they're not the type of
products you're going to probably win
over because they are just super base
they're not wowing me incredibly but
they are nice products to have and if
you want to get this for somebody supply
them with some makeup basics or if
that's what you're looking for you might
really enjoy this kid I hope that was
informative for you guys again I'll be
trying to do this again before Christmas
time so I can talk about some of the
different holiday things coming out my
favorites that I talked about in this
video have got to be the Urban Decay
feminine palette love this Mally set of
lipgloss is going to be using those
non-stop and I also love love love the
lorac pro so thank you so much for
taking time to watch have a great day
and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
