for this video all about Milani stuff
new Milani stuff that they have come out
with they're calling it kind of their
new 2012 collection the PR department
they're sent me some things to check out
and review I wish I could say I was
super excited to tell you about all this
stuff there are a few things there are a
few things that I I really do like out
of this collection but there are some
things that I'm just kind of like you
know not too pumped about so but it's
still important to tell you about those
things so as I've always said you know
it's important to know about what
doesn't work just like what does work so
I'm gonna go through all of it in this
video for you so thank you so much for
the outpouring of support for the newts
brand-spankin'-new Channel Beauty vlog
cast I just launched that this past
weekend and I am just overwhelmed and
overjoyed by the people who are saying
this is something they want to see and I
think it's gonna be super fun to just
feel a little more free about posting
non makeup related things because
that'll that will be where it goes on
beauty vlog can be used to saying vlog
vlog cast if my mouth doesn't really
want to work that way but anyway back to
the makeups this Milani stuff there are
a lot of like new overall new products
and in some cases just some new shades
there are also some new nail polishes
which I've only had a chance to use one
which I did really like the color
I've had it on for about a week and it's
kind of chipping off a little bit but
they have some fast dry nail polishes
and this is fast fuchsia so as I try
some more than nail polishes there's
some new clitter ones as well I'll let
you know down the road how those work
but for now just the makeup and these
powders these are the new face powders
the they're called illuminating face
powders and when I first saw these I
thought oh my god those are gorgeous
like the way they've imprinted sort of
that floral rosebud type print when it
comes right down to using them I feel
like these are just kind of a
watered-down bronzer or blush you know
what I mean I think they're trying to
say this can be your ultra smooth
highlighter bronzer and blush when
really when you're trying to make one
thing do so many things
not necessarily gonna do any of those
things very well light enough to be a
highlight not bright enough to be a
blush not dark enough to be a bronzer
that's basically what this comes down to
and that's this is my opinion I mean
this is how it worked on a medium kind
of average skin tone you look one here
this is called beauty's touch and you
know it's just a really really light
pink and it doesn't come off I mean this
isn't a concentrated swatch there sorry
trying to flip you off but it this is a
pretty concentrated swatch of it on my
finger sheared out I mean it just looks
really really pale amber nectar this one
is kind of it has some peach tones in it
this is the one actually that might be
most feasible to use as a blood actually
gives a nice peachy glow to the skin and
I do kind of like that as a blush it's
not a very bold blush but if one of
these were to be used as a blush it
would be the one called amber nectar and
then Hermosa Rose is the one that seems
to me would be the most like a bronzer
but it really is not deep and dark
enough I mean it even for a light skin
tone I wouldn't necessarily advise it
because look it's just kind of there and
it's not quite bright enough to be a
highly sorry to say they look gorgeous
and I love the concept with the
packaging but I think you know trying to
get a product to do three different
things in one it's not always an option
next up there is a new liquid eyeliner
it's like one of those pin form
eyeliners it's called eye tech extreme
and I have it here in I believe it's
called blackest black and I've been
using this one quite a bit it's got kind
of this flexible longer tip then I've
seen on some felt tip liners but this is
a felt tip and it's kind of flexible
what it reminds me of is like the tip of
the L'Oreal carbon black liner intense
it reminds me of that just in a pin form
this dries really quickly you don't have
like a bunch of wait time after you draw
it on your lash line and it is instantly
a matte black it's not a shiny patent
leather kind of black just totally matte
black one thing I've noticed is as I
wear this throughout the day the
intensity
is not always as good I feel like the
covergirl 24-hour line blast is a little
better on just looking black no matter
what all day long and this one faded a
little it's gonna get the job done but
the covergirl one is just a little bit
better in terms of intensity they also
have a brow tint pen and this is
felt-tip brow color I have it in dark
brown it is maybe a little finer than
the liner I showed you can make some
really fine like hair like strokes as
you can see here really kind of soft
looking and I think this would be a
really great thing actually for someone
who really has to draw in their brows
like if you don't have a lot of brow
there at all and you kind of have to
reconstruct it I think this would be a
natural way to get the the fine hairlike
look back on there however for me I only
fill in a couple of places you know like
maybe a little bit I have a scar out
here actually that I always fill in
every day and when I was going over this
when this liquidy product is going over
other hairs makes some of your brow
hairs stick together they're just
filling in teeny spots here and there
like I am you might want to go for a
pencil it's just easier to work with
they have come up with some new shades
of their runway eyes shadows and these
basically are packaged just like the
baked eyeshadows these are baked as well
so I mean they could call them baked but
they're calling them runway eyes and
what these all have in common is
basically that they have kind of a
glittery really glimmery shiny
appearance to them and if you keep up
with my blog I have already blogged
about these and swatch these for you but
we get into the wet versus dry thing
here with these they can look very flaky
when worn dry I feel like they don't go
on with near as much intensity but when
you wear them wet it takes away any kind
of a powdery finish a lot of people say
well why would you even want to bother
take the time to put on something wet
well the process of using a dry shadow
with adding a little water and making it
wet and I have a whole video about how
to do that by the way I mean it totally
looks
it could be a cream it looks like it
could be a liquid I mean it just kind of
glows on the lids so I'm a fan of that
technique for that reason because it
takes away all powdery appearances this
one is called golden touch so that's
kind of the lightest one then you've got
peaches and cream which is a pretty
peachy shade and then the other one is
Antigua and this is you are green with
golden notes to it there so again these
all kind of I don't love the way they
apply dry I do think they're gorgeous
wet then Milani also just launched a few
more shades of their baked eyeshadows
which I've reviewed and I like these a
lot and I think these new shades they go
on really nicely dry and wet wet is
again gonna take away any powdery look
it's gonna look really slick kind of
foiled in a way these all and have a
slightly metallic look to them when
they're worn wet the colors we have our
copper excess which is very pretty you
can see you know they're kind of swirled
with different tones they're not all one
flat got a pretty pink that is if I can
get it open
this is must-have fuchsia if you like
hot pinks and you're looking for a great
hot pink to wear on the eyes this would
be it haven't seen any other probably
vivid hot pink like that in the
drugstore and then this one just makes
me think peacock it is green fortune and
this is neat because it's green swirled
with like purple and deeper greens a
little bit of turquoise in there very
very pretty there are a few new shades
of the crystal glosses these have been
around for a while they're kind of small
compact packaging which I lightly says
these have is here to medium coverage on
the lips which I'd say is pretty
accurate there's the these aren't really
you know heavy opaque super opaque
glossy also claim to have a cotton candy
scent which I probably wouldn't have
called that out as being cotton candy
but it is kind of new shades that they
have they've got a clear which is
totally self-explanatory you know clear
glossy shiny they also have one called
sheer dark honey which I thought who
this could be so interesting and it made
me think of the dark honey
Clinic stuff that they have but this
just made my lips look kind of gray
other one is pucker up and this I wish
this looked more like it did in the
packaging because I think that's a
beautiful coral shade but it's really
too sheer on the lips to tell that it is
this color I really love that I think is
just a wonderful pink not too bright but
it is really really pretty in its fruit
punch and it might look a little
intimidating in the packaging but I
promise this will show up with some pink
on your lips but it will not be
overboard crazy pink so that one's great
I also really think raspberry icing is
beautiful and this is kind of like more
full coverage on the lips you can lay
build it up a little bit more for even
more color but my picks in that whole
bunch and my picks overall kind about
the things I'm talking about in this
video
fruit punch and raspberry icing couple
of really really nice glosses and the
final thing that I'm going to talk about
brand new thing is the oat flash or the
hot flash however you know what decide
you want to say it and these new full
coverage glosses so these claim to
really you know be totally colorful on
your lips not sure at all totally okay
also claim to have an extra glossy
shimmer finish and that's only really in
my mind that's only due to the
reflective kind of shimmer that is in a
lot of these not because they're shiny
these aren't like a wet look shiny lip
gloss an applicator that's kind of flat
on each side so I think that allows it's
kind of flexible so it allows you to put
it on kind of in both the directions
which is sort of behind that the color
the pigmentation it's like a blue tone
Sparkle which looks kind of odd like the
color is gone you know the pink or thee
or whatever shade you're wearing has
worn off but you're left with just kind
of dry sparkle on your lips which looks
really strange there is a standout shade
in this bunch for me though that I think
is worth it and the one I'm wearing now
which I do kind of like this is called
quick flash and it's just a light pink
soft light pink and that's the shimmer
that's making it look glossy it's not
like a wet
wet-look shiny gloss but I do like this
pink that's a pretty good one I'm golden
Flash is sort of bronzy this this I like
as well but it may be a little dark for
some people it may be a little more on
the brown side than I think a lot of
people might want to wear star flash is
kind of like a I would call this like a
lilac pink so there's just a little
purple coming in here but it has a blue
toned shimmer in it like the sparkle is
absolutely has a bluish hue to it and it
just looks really unnatural on the lips
I mean it's kind of fun to put on if
you're dressing up or doing something
crazy I mean it might be fun yeah she is
like a classic hot pink so I love the
pigmentation of this I love when you put
it on it is totally like they say
full-coverage pink but just be aware
it's super bright and this one was not
really shiny I don't know if it doesn't
have quite as much sparkly stuff in
there I mean it looks like it does but
it just is a little bit dry in a flash
this is purple guys with blue sparkle in
it I wouldn't wear this in public I
don't know what to say I mean it's it's
pretty it's pretty to look at but how
many times do we buy something based on
being pretty to look at well it's in the
tube we want it to look good on our
faces and I don't know if you're looking
for purple this is it hot flash is
stunning I love this red and I don't
feel like I run into a lot of great red
lip glosses it's looking a little more
tomatoey orangie red as I show it to you
here but this is actually kind of like a
blue based red I think it's really
wearable I think I just picture a night
out you know a winged liner and a
beautiful red lip with this and you
wouldn't have to wear a lipstick with it
you wouldn't have to do any layering
just I really love this shade this would
be my pick out of all of those glosses
for sure so I hope that lets you know a
little bit more about the brand new
Milani 2012 stuff there are probably
some more new shades other than what I
have I don't think I have everything but
I have a lot of the new varieties of
things that you'll be seeing in
drugstores if you're not already seeing
that if I
to share some standout things I mean I
love a couple of these crystal glosses
the ones in fruit punch and raspberry
icing and I love this red called hot
flash from the other from the new
lipgloss line I really do like they're
baked shadows I think they're stunning
wet liquid liner is pretty good
these are alright although you can
really only wear them one way they only
look great worn wet so there's that of
course these were kind of a Miss for me
these new powders which look awesome but
they don't really perform so thank you
again for watching you're having a
wonderful day and I'll see you next time
