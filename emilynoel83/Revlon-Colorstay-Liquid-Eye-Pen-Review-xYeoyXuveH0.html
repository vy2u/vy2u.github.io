review for you today on the Revlon
Colorstay liquid eye pin so this is
different from other Revlon Colorstay
eyeliner products there are two that
I've talked about in the past that I
have loved so much and it's the regular
pencil liner that kind of twists up in
numerous shades and also their liquid
liner so this product really had a lot
to live up to in my eyes so I'm just
going to describe it for you first and
I'll tell you what I think so far
basically this is according to the
packaging which I try to hold on to if I
know I'm going to review something I
have this in the shade is a blackest
black remember that I'll come back to
that it says our unique flow-through
felt-tip pen provides controlled
application to create a precise line
blah blah blah whereas up to 16 hours
won't smudge or smear all day 16 hours
is generally the claim with a lot of
these color stay products so basically
you've got this thing that really looks
like you could toss it in with your
little you know pen or pencil jar and it
would fit right in basically and the cap
is very tight on there so that's a good
sign to me in terms of how long this may
last before drying up because that cap
really is tight and then this is what
the tip looks like um it's a very very
fine felt tip and um it's I find these
to be very easy to work with
in my experience because and you may say
well that tip sure looks a lot like you
know basically like like this tip does
on the traditional liquid liner however
I think there's some added ease with
something like this because you don't
have to worry about going back to the
container you can be sitting here and
working with your line and then kind of
mess with it some more and you never
have to break away from your
concentration which some people probably
get into when they're used to doing
liquid liner and go back to the stuff
you know so this is a very good thing
for a beginner in terms of using that
of a tip so now sort of for my take on
this first off is an application once
again I give that a very good grade I
found this so easy to use however the
shade is blackest black if you can see
that what would you expect that to be
just about as black as you could get
probably well I use this for a tutorial
not too long ago what you may have seen
and I kind of commented ok this is this
is like kind of watered-down almost it's
not a true black and it also I don't
want to have to go back over my eyeliner
line and even sometimes when I did it
didn't totally make that much difference
and especially if you're going over a
light shimmery shade which chances are
more often than not I'm going to have
that kind of shade on my lid drawing
over that with this it's kind of a
challenge it won't just show up you know
true pigmented black like this one will
every time no matter what so to give you
a little frame of reference here on my
hand on this side is the Revlon
Colorstay the pin that I'm reviewing
here and right next to that right here
is the traditional Revlon Colorstay
liquid liner so you can see I can
definitely see in person that this is
not nearly as dark as that this was one
stroke guys I didn't go over one of them
more I just clearly wanted to show you
what the difference is between these two
and you might be saying well fact that
it's not very black doesn't really
matter to me so if that if that is not
an issue for you and you are a beginner
with eyeliner this may be a good thing
to use however if you've used liner for
a while you're comfortable with liquid
liner you're comfortable with this sort
of format this is the way to go this is
the best I've ever tried it truly stays
on it's very black if that's what you're
looking for and just works really really
well so I can't give this a better
review this is just great in my eyes but
this um you know they need to work on it
and I'm just not sure if it's possible
to turn out something quite as
you know great as that through this
because if you're continually going over
shadows with this you know the tip will
not always remain the same it loses
quality I've used these kind of things
before something that I cannot vouch for
right now is how long this will last
before drying up in my past experience
they haven't lasted very long so I will
keep an eye on that and I'll keep you
posted maybe I'll post it on my blog the
day that this runs out on me because
I'll keep you know finding ways to work
it in because I do want to figure out
after a semi-regular muse for you guys
how long this will truly last and that
might make a big difference to some of
you because you don't want to have to
repurchase this over and over again this
cost and my local Walgreens it cost
around eight dollars um like I said if
you're a beginner if you like that felt
tip pen design and then intensity
doesn't matter to you so much that might
be a good thing but if you're really
looking for high quality liner and you
know you want that rich black shade
which those are the two I'm comparing
both are in blackest black go for
something like this so anyway thank you
guys so much for tuning in for this
review if I left any questions that
answered feel free to ask me about it
and I hope you have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
