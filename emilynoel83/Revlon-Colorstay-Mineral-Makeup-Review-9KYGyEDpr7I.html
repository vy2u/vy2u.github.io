reviewing a product that I really don't
like very much so gonna be interesting
this is Revlon Colorstay mineral
foundation in light/medium it's a powder
foundation powder mineral makeup it says
up to 16 hours of wear to use twist the
top of cap to extend the brush and then
it brushes down into this now I'd like
to start out by saying that if you guys
have watched many of my videos you know
I am a pretty big fan of Revlon
Colorstay products I enjoy their
foundation I like their pressed powder
I like the pencil liner the liquid liner
the eyeshadow I mean I I'm really a
pretty big fan of most things but this
just did not live up to the rest of that
line in my opinion um basically this is
how it works
you twist off this cap and there's a
little brush inside the cap now this is
not the only brand that actually makes
their foundations this way
I think Milani has a mineral foundation
like this I'm sure there's others I'm
just not really thinking of them right
now but anyway you've got the top and
it's got this little tourney thing here
and when you turn it the brush comes
down this brush is so small and it's
just if it's just too small I mean let
me show you like just for a frame of
reference here here's the sides brush I
would probably normally do my mineral
makeup with something about that big
this is the size of the brush it's kind
of hard to see because it's black
everywhere so I'll hold them this way
but come on it's so small let's compare
it to just a blush brush look how small
it is still this is just a freaking
blush brush and another thing is the
bristles are so unflexible like look how
you know you take
brush like this sit on your face the
bristles spread as you use it you know
it covers some air in this look what
happens it barely moves you know so it's
just it's stiff it just does not seem
like really high quality it just needs
to be a little bigger and a little more
flexible and I don't even know how you
could make a bigger brush and have it
even work with this it's not a practical
solution here I mean I can see why
somebody thought okay it's all
self-contained and you just go like this
and they swirl it in here but I mean you
get a little product on there and it
just I just can't make it really work
for me in that way I don't feel like I
need it even coverage with it now this
is what it looks like on the inside so
it's got about let's say you goes it
goes maybe an inch inch and a half deep
there and then you got a little sister
so you'd probably like have this in
there shake it up take your brush out
extend the brush swirl it and put it on
I think that's the designed use but I
kind of gave up on this after one try
with it and I decided okay I'm just
going to use this and put a brush now a
bigger brush down in it or tap it you
know out on a cap of something which I
just think it's too much trouble I think
of your product that I paid what did I
pay for this I paid probably more than
ten dollars for this and it's like if I
have to do that much wrangling around to
get it to even not just to apply it I'm
not even criticizing how it applies
right now just the simple application
process if I have to go to that much
work to get to apply what I feel is a
correct way it's already throwing up a
red flag for me on that now ask for this
color I do feel like I have the right
color and when I do put it on initially
I like the finish it's not really like a
shimmery mineral makeup like some have
that more luminous look to them and some
people really like that and some people
kind of prefer you know especially if
you have an oil
to your skin you know you kind of want a
mattifying look there so this is I mean
I think I found it to be pretty mad this
is a little bit pinky I've heard people
criticize this all the shades are being
too pinky but I mean I don't think I
have a real rosy complexion by any means
but it still happened to work for me
there in in that way it also has SPF 10
and that's a nice thing
not all mineral makeups have an SPF in
them so I'll give you a little credit
there but like I said it initially
applies well but this claim of up to 16
hours of wear that's a big claim for a
mineral makeup let alone you know a
makeup really anything that says gonna
be 16 hours now I have a makeup that
says it will last 16 hours and it truly
does and it's the Rimmel lasting finish
that claims to last 16 hours its
transfer resistant and I really really
like this I've been using that even more
than my Revlon Colorstay don't remember
how long does Revlon Colorstay liquid
say it will last it doesn't say on my
packaging here actually
it just says looks fresh all day but I
believe it would have similar claims it
would be very long-lasting and I like
that foundation too but this just does
not last that long I believe I put it on
one day maybe one weekend I put it on
maybe mid-morning and by mid-afternoon
it was like I was I remember looking at
my skin like time around my eyes I
didn't like how it was settling kind of
around my eye area and it just kind of
looking at my face was like what
happened to my makeup you know I just I
don't know I just I just really expected
more out of a product with the Colorstay
label on it you know I mean like I said
it's not like I'm trashing Revlon ads a
whole because I like so many I think so
many of the Colorstay products are just
fantastic but this mineral foundation
just did not do the job for me and
in the realm of application it initially
looks nice but I mean if it only looks
nice right when you put it on then
what's the point really so I guess I
would say I don't recommend this product
I just I think there are better
drugstore mineral makeups out there I
know after I post this someone will
probably wonder well what do you like a
mineral makeup wise well I like everyday
minerals
I think that's currently my favorite
mineral makeup brand that is out there
right now it is an online brand but it
is comparable in price I mean there's a
lot of different sizes you can get but
it's not I don't feel like it's
overpriced by any means I would say I
like my L'Oreal they're natural better
than this although that has gotten
criticized I think some people think it
goes on even maybe a little too much
coverage or a little too thick but I I
kind of like that have I mean I think
you've just got to learn how to work
with some of these different brands and
by the way let me show you for a quick
comparison here the brush size
difference this is what you get on your
L'Oreal bear natural foundation this is
the Revlon I find this size brush to be
adequate but this is just too small so
just to give you a whole frame of
reference there I mean you do I think
for people who find this going on too
thick maybe you need to put a you know
be a little more careful with the
foundation because it's easy to lose
track as you put on a mineral makeup and
you put kind of maybe more on than you
need because you don't feel like it's
harder to tell what it's doing something
but it is doing you know doing something
guys kind of look at yourself in
different lighting and say okay do I
have what I need here I like mineral
power better than the Revlon Colorstay
that's for Maybelline what else I think
I like I don't have the full Jain
mineral line but I have what's called
their mineral sheer powder from Jane I
like that better than one color stays so
anyway I hope this was helpful to you
guys is you're kind of browsing through
the drugstore mineral makeups and maybe
this will just give you
little offensive you know what this is
like and like I said some people may
love this but it's just not for me so
thank you guys so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
