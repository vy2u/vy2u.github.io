review on a new nail product from revlon
and really in the scheme of things it's
not a new concept but this is something
that just in terms of what I've tried
I've really liked and it is these glue
on nails which I think are really cute
to begin with I don't know if you can
see there but the tips have a little
like sort of crisscross print on them
these are so cute they are short I mean
their length is actually term medium but
they are a great length a great fit for
my nails and I think there's so many
nails that you get it's a 24 pack of
nails from what's called the runway
collection and the kind of just showed
you is Stella and so you get this pack
of nails you get everything you need
that comes with it not only of course
the nails and lots and lots of different
sizes you get the glue you get the file
you get the little orange wood manicure
stick to help you get them on and I just
love how the designs are so cute and
also the size is so manageable I love
this medium length for just everyday
doing things you know and also I feel
like they stay on so well like i've worn
these i'm going to be going on day five
wearing these and i'm probably you know
you would think maybe they're nearing
the end of their road and maybe they are
but you can't tell because these have
not come off they still look completely
fresh and like a nice you know really
nice manicure and you might be saying
well I like to do my own nails and I
really like doing my own nails too but
every now and then you know I got a few
of these packs because I thought it
would be nice to have that time when you
can you know not have to even worry
about chipping or breaking or anything
like that and do you stay on great and
night have you know after a couple days
you know my skepticism kind of wore off
and I was like I don't even have to
worry about these coming off I don't
even have to like take this glue in my
purse because they stay on that well
part of the reason why is because there
are so many size options you can really
get sizes that actually fit your exact
nails I think in the past the reason why
I would have these nails like this
coming off I am kind of popping off a
lot sooner than they should was because
they weren't an exact fit for my
nails and here I feel like you have
plenty of options where that's concerned
you may have tried these self-adhesive
nails that aren't blue like this but
they have kind of a sticky adhesive
already on the nail as they would sit in
a tray like that and then you just take
them off and press them on more press on
nails not glue on nails like I'm talking
about here I've tried those a lot I did
that a lot for like proms and stuff like
that and I really just I had to worry
about whether or not those would stay on
because you know you might touch
something he had to always bring the
backup glue and it was kind of weird
like oh I gotta put this blue on and
it's goopy I mean the the sticky stuff
can kind of sometimes get around the
outside of your nail and stuff sticking
to is just gross so I really am NOT a
big fan of those but i do like these for
how long they wear and yes you are
putting glue on your nail and you're
gluing on the nail but I mean it is
really nice just to have that you know
ensure that you've got great quality
looking nails they look you know like
they were done at a salon and they're
not going anywhere so that is awesome so
in terms of what different kinds you can
get there's all different varieties I
just wanted to show you a few from like
I said the runway collection what I have
on now is Stella and these have that
little kind of checkered print on the
tips and so there's they're really
really natural but yet have a cute
little added touch there they're really
light and then another set that I
thought was really fun is called studio
and these have a little silver tip with
like black crisscross across it so that
would be really fun for you know kind of
a formal look and these are all medium
length that I have them in and then the
other one i have is sequence and this
would be a really pretty like wedding
kind or maybe got a big dance or
something like that just really really
cute glittery print there so um
basically yeah this is a great product
in terms of false nails I it's just
they've stayed on wonderfully well
haven't had to touch him up haven't had
to do anything with them they stay
looking fresh and bright and nothing's
chipping off and they just feel super
strong so I mean I can
you know do whatever I want typing
cleaning you name it and they stay on
great so I just wanted to pass that
along to you guys um and thank you so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
