the Revlon lip butters I've got seven of
them now I feel kind of like the Paula
Dean of the makeup world does that so
much butter on hand right now I've
talked about him before but I do want to
still pass along my review on these
because I've still been getting a lot of
questions about so in this video I'm
gonna go through what some of my
favorite shades are you'll get to see
all the shades on my lips I'll have a
lot of pictures throughout also I'll
talk about what some comparable products
are and just my overall view on these
these are new product from Revlon and
the displays are still coming out right
now like I just recently saw a new
display put out in a local Target I've
bought mine from Target and Walgreens
those have been the two places I've seen
them what I have heard these will become
permanent items in the line as well so
that would lead us to believe that they
will be everywhere eventually I've heard
a lot of people talking about these like
their tinted look as I've tried more and
more of them it wasn't just a fluke that
you know one was really amazing but I've
tried so many different colors that's
led me to believe that these are truly
saturated lipsticks I mean they are
lipsticks with a lot of extra hydration
and tinted lip balm I think of something
as something that goes on more sheer
that doesn't give you a lot of color but
maybe gives you a lot of hydration this
gives both hydration and Couser big
color selection as I think you'll find
if you've got like the full display in
your store you're gonna find that there
are a lot of colors to choose freely
think the packaging is the revlon
colorburst sort of almost quilted
looking its imprint there on the side
only lip butters are different colors
depending on what shade you have sent it
so don't think as I read off yummy names
that it's gonna smell like red velvet
cake or a berry smoothie or something
like that
it is creamy it has no shimmer you can
definitely kind of build up the color a
little bit and get that nude lip look
but it's not a dry nude lip it's a very
hydrated looking nude lip I believe this
is one of two that I have that actually
has sort of a frosty look to it it has a
little bit of shimmer this is also
probably one of the most wearable ones
that I have it gives that little bit of
a peachy kind of a salmon II almost look
to the lips berry smoothie is the other
one I have that I feel you know
definitely has some shimmer to it I
think this is a great transition into it
just a slightly deeper lip that is very
easy to wear still and just a beautiful
color so this is a really pretty pink
and it is sometimes I think lightness in
colors can almost be a little harder to
wear at times just because these do seem
kind of like a multi-purpose almost
three-in-one type product where you know
it's your lip balm it's your lipstick
and it can almost appear to be your
gloss keep in mind that you can layer a
lip liner with this and just deepen it
up a little bit the shade I'm wearing
now which is one of my definite
favorites is called sweet tart it's a
definite pink I mean you know there's no
getting around it this is a real true
pink it's not a light pink it's not a
dark pink it is just pink and I love it
the next one I have is lollipop and this
one is real vibrant fuchsia this is not
subtle at all it looks great I had this
on I think maybe in a in a picture I
threw on my blog and it's just very very
saturated color it's a little bit deeper
red and I honestly think some people are
gonna find this more wearable fan
brighter Reds this one as well as the
one I just mentioned I feel like those
are the ones I have to be a little more
careful about applying even though you
get tempted to use these just as if they
were a lip balm because that's how they
feel you have to remember that this one
it's gonna go on just as bold as it
appears
it award to the ones that I really like
and I think are the most wearable and I
would say that's peach parfait because
that's just it's just enough color it's
for people who really don't necessarily
want super bold notice me lips but still
pretty lips I think that's a great one
and I think berry smoothie is probably
the most wearable of the pinky berry
tones that I have I gotta say I like
them all I think I'm gonna get good use
out of them all but a couple that are
probably my favorites are sweet tart
which I have on now and also red velvet
which is you know as I said that deeper
red it's great to know that you can
swipe these on and you've got all that
moisturization there but you can't add a
gloss over the top of it or do something
a little bit extra to just alter the
shade and make it just right for you
pros I think these are a great
combination of color and feel not only
are they nice rich saturated colors but
they feel great on the lips not just a
tinted lip balm I feel like these are
lipsticks legit lipsticks that just have
a whole lot more moisturization
moisturization than most do sorry about
my voice today by the way I've kind of
got a cool also love that these are our
kind of that three-in-one product as I
mentioned this is the lip balm the
lipstick and you know if you're
satisfied with that amount of shine
that's like a lip gloss price I think it
can possibly be seen as a con is that
these are not major staying power
products and again staying power any
time anybody asked me about staying
power I always have this little thought
in my head like it's different for
everybody I don't know what you're
eating I don't know if you're eating a
salad with an oil-based dressing I don't
know if you're going and running a
marathon with it on you know it's gonna
be different for every person
I think average we're you know speaking
and just you know let's say you haven't
gotten to your meal yet I think could
get through most of the morning with
good color on your lips with these but
be prepared to reapply as neither
there's no scent and I gotta say they've
given them such yummy names like creme
brulee and red velvet and lollipop and
you know it would be awesome cuz I like
since some people that's not going to
bother
at all and I get that but I mean if this
thing not only looked this good but
smelled like red velvet cake I mean I
don't know what I'd be doing right now
these actually remind me quite a bit of
the Palladio herbal tinted lip balms
which is something I've raved about for
years now probably these are you know in
a much more classic lip balm style but
these are like tons of color with these
and I feel like they're maybe not quite
as hydrating as the lip butters you
don't have the shade selection in these
lip balms like the lip butters do but
they are kind of along those same lines
as being more of a lipstick and less of
a less of a tinted lip balm and also
something else that really struck me as
being similar texture wise I have one of
these Mac machines supreme lipsticks and
Berrigan
and I got to say the texture on that is
so similar the finish of being you know
it goes on feeling almost like a lip
balm it looks like a lipstick but it has
a glossy finish it's very similar to
that as well so it's always nice to find
that high-end item that you feel like
you've almost duped with the texture of
a drugstore product
I think these are great if you have one
it's gonna be that product in your
collection that I think you're going to
be reaching for over and over again for
the convenience factor it's very
wearable I feel like just the texture
alone makes you think it's more wearable
you know what I mean like sometimes I
think we think in terms of colors oh
that's a wearable shade that's not
wearable but I think with the texture of
these because they feel like lip pumps I
think it might actually cause some
people to go out of their comfort zone
just because they feel so comfortable on
the lips they are not these you know dry
matte products that suck the life out of
your lips there get putting something
back in and I think for that reason you
know this is the product that I not only
want to have on my lips but I want it to
be like the first thing that touches my
lips because of the moisture content
that it has suggest trying at least one
this season and see if you like it
I really can't say too much bad about it
but these are just my thoughts on the
product thank you so much for taking the
time to watch and let me know what
shades are your favorite if you have
some have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
