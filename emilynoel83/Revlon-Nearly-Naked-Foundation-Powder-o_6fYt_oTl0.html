nearly naked foundation and powder so
this is a new thing that I found it
ultra it's not out yet in your local
drugstores it's probably on its way soon
but this is a foundation with SPF 20 and
then you've got this powder as well and
so I used both of these in my look today
I also used a concealer as part of my
face makeup so in this video I'll show
you the application give you my reaction
to how well I think this works and then
because a lot of people request this
when I'm reviewing foundations to show
how it looks come back and show how it
looks after it's you know several hours
or a day's worth of wear so I'll be
doing that at the end two or all what I
think you've got here with this
foundation is a really liquidy
foundations it's a little more liquidy
than Revlon Colorstay a little less
coverage than that foundation I'm using
that as kind of a benchmark here because
I know a lot of people are familiar with
Revlon Colorstay but this has sort of a
finish that I can't describe this
totally matte there is no sparkle or
shimmer that I can detect in this
foundation but overall it leaves you
with a finish that's a little more
luminous I guess I would say reminds me
actually a little bit of like the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi if you're
familiar with that that was another
foundation that had a real liquidy
texture it was easy to blend in it did
not have any shimmer or sparkle to it
but it just managed to give you a more
natural finish on the face then you
bring in the powder and this powder as
you'll see in my application has kind of
a unique texture to it it feels more
like different high-end powders that
I've tried as opposed to a drugstore one
because it's not chalky and powdery it's
weird to not describe a powder as being
powdery but it hangs together it's got
more of a rich texture when you swatch
it with your finger it's just got a real
smoothness to it that a lot of powders
from the drugstore don't seem to have
set about five or six applications of
this since I purchased it has been about
all I've used since I bought it just
because I really wanted to see how it
would perform with different primers
different moisturizers and as a whole
this is not as hardcore where
staying power is concerned as my Revlon
Colorstay or as much as the whipped
cream Foundation which I really really
love I think that's just it's a great
finish very blendable very easy to use
but at the same time this is a little
lighter on the skin because it's
definitely a medium coverage product
it's gonna even your skin tone out but
as you're gonna see in my application
certain things that you use concealer
for all the time you're probably still
gonna need to bust out that concealer
will check out the application and then
we'll talk staying power at the end so
I've put on a moisturizer and I applied
my Tarte clean slate flawless primer and
so now we're gonna go to the foundation
which I have in shade 115 nude as you
can see there's no pump here so you just
kind of got to shake it out and I'm just
gonna roughly apply this all over my
face it's a very liquidy foundation I
mean I found Colorstay to be somewhat
liquidy as well but this seems even more
so I love the different Sigma synthetic
brushes like this to blend out
foundation today I'm using the angled
top kabuki f-84 this is the one I've
liked using a lot for foundation it's
not with the sharp cut edge it's got
more of a tapered cut which I think
makes it very easy to work in circular
motions with this as well as just you
know applying like this as far as the
finish on this goes I mean I feel like
it's a matte but it's not as like flat
looking as some foundations look it
doesn't have like a dry appearance on
the skin but it definitely doesn't
contain any shimmer like Revlon
Photoready does well it evened out my
skin tone overall I've got you know a
little blemish here there that I just
want to cover up so I'm using my Revlon
Photoready stick concealer to take care
of those areas and I'm using my p80
brush from Sigma to blend this out this
is just like a little flat top really
soft dense synthetic brush really
pleased with the look after a concealer
you know you just add that additional
coverage to the areas where you need it
is found
has had a couple minutes to sort of set
on the face I can still see you can see
where the light catches it it's like
your face is still a little bit glowing
but I like the fact that there isn't any
added you know shimmer or glitter to
make that happen it's just the nature of
the the foundation so the powder looks
like this comes with a little um
sponge puff type thing got a texture
that almost feels creamy I love the way
this powder feels because some powders
feel dry you know you touch your finger
to it and powder flies everywhere this
really hangs together when you swatch it
on your finger it just has a nice
texture to it so I'm just gonna take a
small to medium sized brush here and
just dust this over I'm gonna go over
half the face first so we can see how
this changes the finish of everything it
mattified me a little bit more it looks
like pores are definitely a little less
obvious after the powder has a texture
that makes it not appear to be like
sitting on top of your skin like some
powders do so yeah this definitely gave
the skin a little more perfected look I
mean I can still see through to some
freckles that I have a whole you know my
skin looks really natural but it does
look you know a little bit more
perfected so I'm gonna finish off and do
the other side
now on both of these products easy to
apply I felt like the foundation just
blended in very easily it's really
liquidy it would be nice if this had a
pump for that reason but I mean you can
still get it on your face and you have
plenty of time to get it blended in
without it starting to kind of set on
your face so that was good for the
foundation and as far as the powder I'm
really really impressed I feel like this
has a more I don't know advanced texture
it doesn't look like makeup and I know
that's probably what you're looking for
if you have bought something called
nearly Nate are you for the lighting
change but that's mother nature for you
this is eight hours later and so we're
looking at how the foundation held up I
did no touch-ups
I really tried not to touch my face at
all as well because that can really help
out the staying power of a foundation
we're not like leaning on your hand or
touching your face so just a good rule
of thumb in general but see a little bit
of shine going on on the nose that's
pretty normal for me but I don't feel
like the product has broken down I mean
it doesn't look out and out greasy it
just looks a little more dewy I guess
then the face looked when this was
freshly applied my skin is not
particularly oily this time of year I'd
say my skin's pretty normal right now so
if you were really oily I wonder if
maybe you would have some more issues or
you might really require a touch-up
somewhere in the midst of that
eight-hour day for no touch-ups I'm
actually kind of impressed I don't feel
like this oxidized a whole lot or really
changed color or got deeper as the day
went on some foundations do that to me
and I don't think this one really did
I'm pretty pleased with this product I
mean as many times as I've applied it I
don't feel like I've had any negative
reaction on my face in terms of
breakouts I felt like the coverage was
pretty much what I expected it you know
was able to even out the skin tone but
concealer needed to come in and take
care of the rest especially impressed
with this powder I mean if you are
currently enjoying whatever foundation
you're using and you just want a great
powder I would recommend this
I love the texture of it one thing I
would note is that I got light and I
feel like it's still kind of deep fur I
mean relatively deep compared to most
light shades I feel like this is almost
more of a medium I said finish wise this
is pretty close to the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi
I like that foundation I feel like this
the staying power for this one might
have been just a little bit better for
me as I think back over the past few
days and you know I've gone out and done
stuff in the evening and I feel like you
know this required pretty much minimal
touch-ups just a little bit over the
t-zone and I still feel like the look is
pretty fresh and pretty good you for
watching this review I hope it was
informative for you on the nearly naked
products out from Revlon if you've tried
them let me know what you think and
thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
