tuning in for this video this is going
to be a review on two products I've been
getting a lot of questions about lately
and it's the Revlon Photoready
foundation and powder and I'm going to
be comparing a lot in this video these
products to the Revlon Colorstay items
because I feel like that's a really well
known product and you'll get more of a
sense of what this is like if I sort of
compare it to that so anyway starting
off with the Revlon Photoready
foundation I think the concept here is
that this foundation is going to really
make you look fresh in pictures or just
really not maybe in the literal sense of
like you can only wear this when you get
your picture taken but you know what I
mean it can it can just give you the
flawless appearance that you might want
if you were going to be photographed or
just you know it on camera or something
like what do you say we take a little
break from the review and we go take a
look at some of my favorite photos since
we're talking about photo ready
foundation let's take a look at just
some of the pictures that I have out
around the next photo I love these are
and these are not necessarily in
chronological order either but this is a
picture of my little sister in my
sorority her name is Sarah and that's me
she that was when I decorated her room
we did a room decorating thing I was in
Pi Beta Phi by the way so hello to all
the Pi Phi is out there who might be
watching and I miss you Sarah
what I find unique about this foundation
compared to Revlon Colorstay initially
is that there is a little hint of sheen
to this I don't want to say shimmer
really because I don't want to give you
the sense that there are like particles
of glitter or anything like that in this
product but there is just sort of a glow
that this foundation will give you that
for example regular Revlon Colorstay
will not I feel like this also blends
very evenly across your skin like it's
just very easy to smooth out it really
just kind of hangs together and it just
really spreads across your skin very
easily I've used both Revlon Colorstay
and this with a primer and this really
blends across your skin quite well in
terms of staying powder power I think
for the fact that this does give you
that
slightly more dewy look on your
complexion I feel like that doesn't it
doesn't always look as good as it did
when you first put it on if that makes
sense you know where Revlon Colorstay
the nice part about it is I feel like
what I do put that on it's going to look
that way for a long long time I mean
it's it's that's called color stay this
is called photo-ready this makes you
think you know this will make you look
nice for maybe a particular event or
occasion but the Revlon Colorstay is
really gonna see you through the day oh
here's another picture from the college
days this is me and my best friend and
roommate Beth and we just had a great
time I think this was gosh I'm trying to
remember exactly what year this was but
I think this was not too long after we
moved in together and we didn't know
each other at all but we each had kind
of bad roommate situations on our own
and so they ended up moving in together
and eventually both dropped out of
school and then me and Beth got together
and we were just the greatest of friends
here we are wearing burger king crowns
and looking kind of crazy I think I just
got out of cheerleading practice judging
by my outfit victim but we really had a
great time together and I really miss
Beth a lot is it gives you a really
fresh look like I said with the dewy
glow I have that on today and I do feel
like I can sense a little bit more you
know glow is coming through on the skin
but it has OK coverage for example what
I really noticed a lot was when I put
this around my eyes I felt like I you
know sometimes when I put a foundation
on around my eye area I'm like well
maybe I could go without the concealer
or you know on this given day when maybe
my circles aren't so dark or whatever
but with this I really had to make sure
I used a concealer because the
illuminating factor in this foundation
almost seemed to make the circle stand
out a little more oh my goodness this
picture was from back in high school you
can't see it to like close up but I have
like shortish hair and I have bangs and
I was in New York with one of my fellow
high school cheerleaders we were named
all-stars for cheerleading for the
universal cheerleaders Association and
so we got to actually perform
on TV in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade so that was super fun and here we
are just on the streets of New York we
got our picture taken and we had to wear
like these red jackets and like certain
outfits were every day for practices and
stuff but that was such a cool
experience I Love New York and I love
just getting to you know sightsee and
see everything that there was to to do
but also to be part of such a huge event
and I actually saw myself in the parade
my you know my parents family back home
are watching it and that was just really
really cool I also I'm concerned for
people who may have fine lines and
wrinkles around the eye area when you
use anything that has sheen or shimmer
it is going to make those areas really
stand out more on your skin so if you
are facing a lot of like maybe wrinkly
areas that you don't want to stand out
or or large pores or situations like
that situations I just said situation I
was just watching a Jersey Shore reunion
I have got to show you this picture
because this is something I'm just so
proud of I was in Elle magazine for one
of my videos I did on a celebrity
inspired look and this is a look at that
picture
it's a freida Pinto look that I did on
the People Magazine's 100 most beautiful
and so you can see a picture of me you
know basically no makeup on and then me
with the freida Pinto look that I had so
you may notice some of those other
youtubers there so that was such an
honor to be in there with them and just
to get to experience that and it was
just a really really cool thing and I
will always remember that and treasure
that picture now I'm saying the
situation Jersey Shore people you know
what I'm talking about but anyway I do
feel like it has a really nice look but
it's almost if you have good skin you're
going to have better luck with this and
if you have problematic skin with a lot
of maybe acne scarring wrinkles or
things that you want to cover up this is
kind of like definitely light to medium
coverage and you are going to have some
certain challenges with what the shimmer
does does to you however it does give
you a certain glow a certain look that
regular foundation isn't always going to
give you so you kind of are giving and
taking a little bit with that this
picture is so special to me because this
was when Tyler proposed it was actually
during a homecoming pep rally in college
our senior year and he was giving a
speech as captain of the football team
called me up there did I did not realize
what was going on and before I knew it
he was down on one knee I didn't even
have time to really contemplate you know
what all was happening there but it was
caught on camera on video camera and
also in picture so I just I just love
that picture you can see the kind of the
surprise on my face and looking back at
the video you can tell Tyler was really
nervous I think in terms of staying
power like I mentioned it's not going to
necessarily stay looking quite as fresh
as it does when you first put it on like
I've gone through a whole day with mine
and while I feel like okay that's
looking all right now and there have
been other days when I've worn this and
I felt like gosh you know when I used to
rebel on Colorstay when i use maybelline
superstay 24-hour makeup it really
seemed to hold up a little bit better
when you're talking more in terms of
shimmer and Sheen and then you add a
little bit of oil that may have come up
around your nose throughout the course
of the day or your t-zone area then it's
really going to show somewhere and if
that's not what you're looking for then
you may just you know be aware of that
this is not necessarily a photograph
although my sister paints so well you
might think a lot of her pictures are
photographs but this is a picture of her
and I actually she she created this off
of a photo that was taken and this was
the moment she told me she was engaged
and you can you see like I'm like so
happy and excited and we're just like I
don't know just one big hug there we're
both so
so happy so I love looking at that
picture it really gives me a big
pick-me-up what I look at how happy we
are also in terms of the powder moving
on to that I have that in light medium I
don't know if I told you this is in
natural beige that's my shade their
light medium is my shade for the powder
and I believe they have it in
translucent as well but what you're
getting here you have a little brush and
you have this compact of powder and when
you look at the powder I'm really not
seeing the shimmer really in this powder
I think it may have just a slight you
know sheen to it but it's really for the
most part going to slightly mattify I
guess the rest of your makeup when you
put it on top I noticed this this
product is sort of a not so much of a
factor to me I feel like if you got this
and you didn't want to spend you know
another 12 dollars on this product then
you may be better off just using your
favorite loose powder that you already
have I sort of like the look of using
this in my Mary Kay loose powder over
the top because that powder provides the
little bit of extra coverage that I want
this powder is not bad but it doesn't
really I don't see why they really made
a special powder to go with us because I
don't feel like it's really serving a
whole lot of special functions now here
is a picture that I absolutely love from
our wedding you can see we're doing the
little I guess traditional thing where
you kind of link your arms and you drink
the champagne and you can see we're
standing right there by the cake I've
kind of got this on a little stand here
but because it's like a really big
picture you could either hang on the
wall or put like I have it here but you
can see our our cake and you know
everything and it's just just a really
neat picture I love the way it was the
lighting happened to be at that time
it's just just a really great memory and
I like to keep it out here in our living
room where I can always see it you know
it does seem to make this a little more
matte but besides that I really don't
see why you couldn't just use any powder
that was your favorite powder to use I
don't
exactly understand what is special about
this particular powder other than if you
just wanted to stay in the same line
maybe you're trying foundation for the
first time and you thought I'm getting
that foundation in that powder because
there are the same thing I don't know
that's just my idea all right more of me
and Tyler this is our engagement picture
which I I just really really like this
and my cousin Melanie is in photography
so she has taken great pictures for a
wedding and for the engagement and
everything like that but in case you for
those who don't know me and Tyler Tyler
is six six and I am five feet tall so it
just seemed fitting to do a picture like
this that I love it I just were in front
of kind of like a metal backdrop there
and it's just a really happy picture I
love that bottom line on the makeup I
feel like if you have a lot of problem
areas on your skin if you day to day get
up and you are doing a lot of concealing
and you just feel like you've got a lot
of areas that you're not happy with on
your skin you may not necessarily want
this product as your daily wear thing
because it's not going to give you as
much coverage as Revlon Colorstay that
little bit of Sheen is going to
highlight some problem spots and you
know it's not necessarily going to do
you a whole lot of help in that in that
aspect however if you feel like okay I
have normal skin I don't get too greasy
throughout the day and I don't have you
know a whole lot of state wrinkles or or
maybe major discoloration and things
like that and you may want to give this
a try it gives you the sort of glow that
you might kind of feel like you have in
the summer time I feel like it's not
it's not over the top it's not it's not
dramatic like you know ooh
that girl's got shimmery skin but it is
definitely a contrast from regular color
stay here is a memory from high school
yeah this is me and Tyler at a
homecoming dance our senior year I had
gotten really sick the night before I
think the day of as well so I just was
not feeling well but there is no way I
was gonna miss that
and this is Tyler actually sitting on my
lap which is kind of strange but that's
the way we took the picture but yeah I
was really not feeling very well we made
the best of it but I remember being so
nervous that I wasn't going to make it
to that dance ultimate question I mean
does this make you look better in a
photo than another foundation would well
I do think it allows you to keep
somewhat of a natural glow in a picture
but ultimately if you're seeing your
flaws through your foundation you're
probably not going to be happy with the
picture you took so if you feel like the
current foundation you're using is doing
a good job of giving you coverage and
not making you feel like you've got a
mask on then you know maybe you don't
even want to spring for this but if you
do really enjoy the dewy finish and
you've already got good skin to begin
with maybe give it a try I just know
that it's up against some stiff
competition in my book when it comes to
drugstore foundations because I love
Revlon Colorstay I love Rimmel lasting
finish and I love maybelline superstay
24 hour I think all of those hold up
throughout the course of the day a
little bit better than this does however
this has that little something extra by
adding that little additional gleam that
this has to it which you know as I
mentioned has its pros and cons so thank
you guys so much for tuning in for this
video I hope you found it informative
and fun and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
