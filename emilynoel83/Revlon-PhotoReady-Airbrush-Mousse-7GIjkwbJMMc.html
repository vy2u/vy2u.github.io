reviewing a brand new drugstore
foundation formula unlike anything else
I've tried and this is Revlon Photoready
airbrush mousse makeup so this is
something really unique the texture
reminds me of opening up a can of
whipped cream putting it on your hand
and then blending it in and you've got
kind of a lightweight liquidy substance
there so there's already a photo ready
foundation out there so in this video
I'll kind of provide a little comparison
I'm going to talk about staying power
we're going to talk about what skin
types this would be good or not so good
it looks kind of like it's in just any
sort of typical Foundation packaging but
guess what it's an aluminum can so you
actually shake this up and you will also
note that says container may explode if
heated I think this is the only
foundation that has a warning likable
there on the back guy one thing to be
aware of don't dispense too much of this
product at first I thought it was gonna
come out like a mousse and then dissolve
into a very small amount of liquids so I
like went with tons and then like I have
way more than I need here so just go
with a little bit I'm just gonna put a
very small amount here to give you a
little example on my hand but here we go
as you can see you get it out there and
it looks like kind of a whipped cream
look closely here you can see little
bubbles breaking my shade by the way is
beige natural gonna touch it and it's
almost gonna collapse a little bit of a
creamy light liquid and I'm really gonna
blend it here for you so you can see it
has some luminosity to it there are
actually tiny shimmery particles in this
just like the other photo-ready
foundation that's out there it's going
to feel kind of moist and creamy as you
as you blend but then when you finally
kind of got it all smoothed out you're
gonna notice that this actually feels
pretty lightweight it's gonna feel
lighter than other liquid foundations it
feels lighter than Revlon Photoready the
original just plain old pump out liquid
foundation but what they have in common
is the fact that they both have this
slightly luminous finish and that's
where I want to get into
skin types and who this is best for
because if you have oily skin already if
you've got an oily t-zone when you put
on a foundation that has the these
little bit of luminous sparkly effects
to it it's going to make your skin look
even oily err okay so you may want to go
for something that's like a traditional
Revlon Colorstay also people who should
be aware of foundations with shimmer are
those who have uneven skin texture if
you've got wrinkles in some areas large
pores acne scars anything that changes
the texture of your skin shimmery
foundation is going to point to those
areas and say hey look at me over here
and another thing that's kind of tricky
about this is when you blend something
in and still kind of sitting on top of
your skin you might be like oh okay I
just put it on it looks good but then
you go throughout the day and it doesn't
whereas what's got home from work not
too long ago so I've been through a
whole day already and I can tell like I
don't have big pores but when I look at
the pores on either side of my nose I
can tell they're more visible I can tell
fine lines on my forehead are more
visible now than they were earlier in
the day so that's just something you
need to be aware of with a luminous type
foundation like I think a little bit of
a glow is nice but you've just got to be
aware that sometimes it's easier or more
effective to get that glow from maybe a
pretty glowy blush or just a hint of
highlight in certain areas where you
don't have large pores when you're
putting that foundation everywhere that
shimmer and glow is going everywhere
with these photo-ready
options now if you got dry skin and you
feel like your complexion looks dull but
your complexion is relatively even
you're not dealing with lots of wrinkles
or uneven texture and this and that you
might enjoy this a lot of these do I
like better to me they perform very much
the same this is just a little bit
lighter but overall let's say you
already have this photo ready and you're
thinking man do I need to try that new
one they look so similar the finished
effect on your skin this is just a
little bit lighter and it comes out as
that fun mousse but when you really get
to blending it in and you look at
yourself it looks like this one looks
too coverage wise this is going to even
out your skin tone it's going to
cover minor flaws it's I wouldn't count
on this to erase your darkest circles or
your biggest blemishes and things like
that because as I said if something's
bumping out or something's cratering
into your skin it's going to draw
attention to those differences that are
anything other than smooth expect that
you may see some more flaws in your skin
later in the day than when you started
especially if you're oily so I hope you
found this review useful on the Revlon
Photoready airbrush mousse makeup again
the only thing that's really different
about this is the way it pumps out like
a mousse but once you really start
blending it in and when it comes right
down to it it's going to give you a
similar luminous look like Revlon
Photoready liquid makeup does so just
keep that in mind thank you so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
