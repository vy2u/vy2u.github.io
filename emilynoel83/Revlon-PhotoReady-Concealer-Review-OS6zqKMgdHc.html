this video this is going to be a review
all about the Revlon Photoready
concealer so the Revlon Photoready
foundation has been out for a while and
so when I saw this concealer I thought I
really want to try this and I've been
using it pretty much non-stop since I
bought it and primarily what I use a
concealer for is the under eye area
although I do have some areas kind of
around my nose I have some broken
capillaries around my nose that can look
a little bit red right there and of
course we all have the occasional
blemish here and there so I had some
areas like that around my nose that I
concealed so here and here were the
places where I used it but just to give
you an overview of the product um it's a
stick concealer and you know some of the
stick concealers that I've tried from
the drugstore have been very thick and
they sort of have some drag to them you
know when you put them on it's like if
you want to go directly from the product
to your face you'll feel it pull just a
little bit you know if you have aging
skin and your skin is starting to get a
little bit creepy or more lightweight in
that under-eye area that's really not
something you want to deal with it all
so I was hoping that this would be maybe
a little bit more lightweight and that's
exactly what it turned out to be it
twists up you get that much product in
there and the shade I have is
light/medium the lightest shade was fair
and then it went a few shades deeper
than this so basically as I applied this
I felt like it really glided on the skin
really easily I just feel like it sweeps
on so nicely and it's very low effort to
blend in
sometimes with concealers you want to
apply them over a larger area than just
you know right in here I mean sometimes
you may have uneven skin tone and you
want to use some concealer instead of
taking out a bunch of foundation you
want to use concealer to even things out
more and so that can be hard when you're
taking the traditional stick concealer
and trying to make that work as it is so
thick and
this I feel like it's the type of thing
that you could you know block out a
whole area and it's practically reminds
me of you know a really nice stick
foundation but it is nicely pigmented as
I put this on my under-eye again I felt
like it really glided on then I go in
and I blend it out with my finger some
people might use I mean you could put it
on your finger first and dot it on if
you wanted to but I like to get it on
there and then take my finger and use
the warmth of my finger to kind of Pat
and blend just a little bit to really
get that going on my under eyes so I
guess the question that remains is how
well did it really cover my circles I do
not think this is the most heavy
coverage concealer that is out there to
be used for under-eye I think like you
think about the Mallee cancellation
concealer and Bobbi Brown and I mean
recently maybelline dream mousse
concealer which we're not seeing I mean
at least I'm not seeing in my drugstores
lately and there's been lots of talk
about that being discontinued which is
one that I really liked and I thought it
was creamy and good coverage but this
may be something that I look to as a
drugstore concealer to sort of replace
that it's obviously a different texture
but it is creamy enough - I feel cover
some circles hard candy glamoflauge is a
nice liquid more liquidy concealer but
it is very creamy and it doesn't take a
whole lot to do the job but if you
prefer you know this stick format where
you can basically just draw it on your
skin blend it in and if you have larger
areas I mean I like glamoflage but I
don't know that I would want to really
take that over you know really large
parts of my skin if I had a lot of you
know blotchiness I wanted to cover up
this is you know a good texture to be
able to do that and I always top off my
concealer when I go over my under-eye I
lightly dust with like a light tone
powder or a yellow tone powder if you
have that and that really I think
mattifies the area and keeps you from
seeing a lot of circles so I really
enjoy this for the under eye for a quick
concealer I think for other parts of the
face it's good because I have some
uneven texture
I have a zit that was right here that it
was kind of doing that thing where you
know like it almost scabby type of
texture on my skin and you know if
you've got the wrong kind of concealer
on there you can see that and so I felt
like this smoothed over it and then I
topped it with some powder and it really
concealed it nicely so I give Revlon
Photoready concealer high marks for
being sort of a new age of drugstore
stick concealer and I was telling my mom
bad I'm like this is big this is this is
good stuff and I hope people are able to
pick this up and try it out and like I
said this would be also something good
to layer if you have extremely extremely
dark circles and you want and you find
this is not doing the job I suggest a
salmony based concealer or corrector you
know to go right in over those areas and
then you can kind of blend over it with
something like this and I think it ideal
coverage for super dark bluish tone
circles so anyway thanks a lot for
watching guys hope you enjoyed the
review and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
