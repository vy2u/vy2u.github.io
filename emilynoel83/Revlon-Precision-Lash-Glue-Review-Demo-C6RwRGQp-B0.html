me for this video I'm gonna be doing a
little demo and review for you today on
a product from Revlon it's called the
precision lash adhesive I actually have
a really natural set of false eyelashes
on this eye so in a minute or two here
I'm going to show you actually how I put
this on but first off just to tell you a
little bit about it and what makes it
different from typical lash glue I'm
looking around here for my regular lash
glue you know usually it's in a tube
somewhat like this and you squeeze it
out or you squeeze it on to something
and then use like a pointed q-tip or a
brush or something to get that glue on
to your lashes and I think one of the
areas where people run into a lot of
problems with false eyelashes is with
the glue either putting too much glue on
the lashes and then you've got kind of a
goopy mess to correct or you put them on
and you don't let the glue get tacky
enough first and this is a product that
I think or sometimes the glue is just
bad quality I mean I have used and
gotten used to using like lash grip and
duo and I find that I have had pretty
good luck with those but you know like
the little ones that will sometimes come
with lashes I mean that would just
playing doesn't really stay very well
for me it's not kind of giving up on
that but anyway I feel like this is all
a lash glue that can really solve a lot
of the frequent problems you have and I
can tell you it does hold really well it
held just as well if not better than you
know my duo glue and my other kinds and
it what amazed me was how little of the
product appeared to be going on the
lashes so anyway what you got here is
instead of squeezing it out you actually
have a little applicator it looks like
this and the glue is actually it goes on
to the lashes and sort of a clear almost
bluish tint and then um it dries
completely clear you wouldn't know it
was on there but what I like about it
also is that you don't have as much
waiting time I felt like I could wait a
good 45 seconds with the duo glues and
things like
that the traditional lash glues on the
lashes just waiting for it to get to the
point where I felt it was tacky enough
to put on and really stay but anyway
I've got some lashes here what I have on
is the Revlon beyond natural natural
defining these are really good lashes
for everyday just to kind of thicken up
your lash line but anyway I'm taking the
lashes and just holding them there and
then I've got my little wand here and
basically you're just going to take that
wand and you can probably I don't know
if you can see yeah you can kind of see
this the product going on there and that
is really all you do you get the
smallest amount of product you need
you're not wasting a bunch by you know
getting it on your eye and then there's
extra because I'm kind of paranoid I
just do one more swipe of it and just
really make sure you get the ends there
as well and then I'm gonna wait that the
packaging says wait 20 seconds and so
that's about what I'm gonna wait here
not sure I'm kind of watching the clock
here but anyway you know you can see
that it's on there and it has this sort
of like actually a bluish tint so now
okay it's been at least 20 seconds and
I'm just going to place this I'm gonna
kind of Center it up on here's my little
handy mirror here I'm gonna set her it
up on my lash line okay and then kind of
take the outer edge and make sure that
is secured down and then make sure the
inner edge is down and then I kind of do
a little bit of you know I kind of like
basically blink on to my finger and it
really makes them stand up nicely and
there we go I mean it's so it's so quick
and easy that's I mean this is some of
the easiest quickest lash application
that I've gotten is with this product
another nice thing about it if you want
to take this with you if you're going
out and you you know just want to have a
insurance policy kind of in case those
lashes start to come out if you have an
end that is starting to come up I mean
this is really easy to actually get
right in there and dotted on rather than
having a tube where it's like you've got
to find something to get it in there
without removing the whole lash isn't
starting over so I've been really really
impressed with this I think like I said
it will hold throughout the day night
whatever you need it to do - take them
off it's very easy I mean they peel off
just like any other you know lash glue
that you've tried now once you've got
them on there and you do feel like
they've set take a mascara you know use
whatever mascara you prefer and I just
like to do a light coat just to blend
and kind of make sure they're a unit
they're kind of one with my regular low
eyelashes and it's just that easy so I
would definitely recommend you try this
it is available in your drugstore and
also as for the lashes lashes that I
really like Ardell has good lashes you
know a lot of the ones that you can find
it like Sally Beauty Supply Andrea Mod
lash those are good but some of the I
feel like Revlon has kind of come up
with some good things in terms of their
lashes because they're so lightweight
and they really do look natural on the
ones I have on now like I said they're
the natural defining they're the beyond
natural and then they have another
beyond natural that I wore last night
that I thought was awesome I mean they
look really long and I need to clean my
mascara off of them this is kind of like
baring my little stack to you know clean
off but these are the long volumizing
and I tell you what they actually do
look somewhat natural but we're really
glamorous
so those beyond natural lashes are great
and then just kind of a standard one
that I've used a lot are the fantasy
lengths in intensifying and these kind
of have like a you know some some lashes
are longer some are shorter it's it
still comes off looking very natural but
as a lot
thickness to your lashes so definitely
worth checking out these lashes paired
with the precision lash glue another
thing I like about the lashes is that
they are at a perfect fit from my eye I
know we don't we don't all have the same
shape and size eye but I never have to
trim on these or make them shorter or
longer they just really fit you know the
shape I want and you know having a
little extra length on the outer part as
opposed to the inner part is really nice
so yeah I got nothing but good things to
say about it so thanks so much for
tuning in guys have a wonderful day and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
