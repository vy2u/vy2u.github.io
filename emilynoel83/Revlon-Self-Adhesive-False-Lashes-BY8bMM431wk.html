reviewing a product for you today it is
from Revlon and they are these new false
lashes called fantasy lengths and these
are self-adhesive lashes and I'm gonna
get into that in a minute because a lot
of you are probably rolling your eyes
thinking no way not self-adhesive lashes
I would not do that well I tell you
these work and so I'm really really
excited to tell you about these they
come into a couple of different styles
here at least that I have
they have intensifying which is a little
bit more of a thick lash and then they
have defining which is a little more
natural and that's what I have on right
now is the defining set and I have no
glue on these okay that's the first
thing I've got to tell you about is the
fact that these are self adhesive and I
thought I read it on here and I've read
that on different ones before I know
NYC makes some quote self adhesive
lashes yeah they don't stay on and then
there was another brand that I tried
this at self adhesive because that was
the first thing I went for when I very
first tried false lashes I thought you
know if I can dodge having to use glue
that's awesome well went ahead had to
learn how to use glue because I figured
when they say self adhesive they're
lying
well this brand isn't I love Revlon for
so many things and now I love them for
one more thing and it's their false
eyelashes so I'm gonna walk you through
what you get because each one of these
is sort of like a little kit first you
get obviously the false lashes that are
here they come in this little box with
full directions here showing you what to
do and you also get a little practically
a little directions pamphlet here and
these are so easy to use it's funny it
looks like it's the things that need
glue that really need the full pamphlet
but that's fine you know I'll take it
and you get this little tray that comes
with your lashes and they're covered the
adhesive is covered by one of these
little things that looks like I don't
know would that be like something that
holds like mini it looks like a mini
like denture holder probably or
something like that I don't even know
but as you can see what's still in there
if you see that black band
that is your spare adhesive and then the
lashes come right on the bottom of that
that's where they're sitting and so that
covers them up and you also get one of
these nifty little guys this eyelash
applicator that you can use and I guess
what you would do is go something like
this to make sure it was pressed onto
your lash line and if you're like me you
kind of like have a habit of going in
there with your finger anyway so this is
nice to have though because some people
you know maybe you can't get their
finger all the way on the inside and so
that's neat that they supply you with
that with every pouch I'm not talking
like per set of - you know these come
individually and you get that with every
one of them so that's really neat I'll
walk you through my experience with
these which this is my first time using
them and I used him for work I went out
on a limb and set because when I pulled
him off I thought wow this really is
sticky I was thoroughly prepared to go
ahead and put some glue on him but they
really stay they have stayed throughout
my entire work day they don't give any
indication like they're going to come
off they're on there you know and that's
great they feel I can't feel them as
much because I think when you've got
glue on your eyelid I think even though
it's not necessarily an uncomfortable
feeling all of you that have worn false
eyelashes you've had that feeling one at
one important point or in time or
another when you put on false lashes
with glue it's like you can feel them
and you can feel and kind of look on the
inside and I couldn't feel these at all
they were trimmed to a very nice length
already pulled up the defining ones that
I have on here they're at a very good
length to where I didn't they don't go
all the way down to the inside they come
to about here okay right there on me and
I feel like I have maybe kind of
average-sized eyes but I love that
they're kind of a little bit flared out
at the ends especially these defining
ones are more like a demi lash that
where they're you know a little bit
longer at the ends and these are more
kind of full all over but I think both
of these could be worn in so many
settings they're not outlandish as you
can see but it's like you know
and easy way to give them a little boost
which I do this with regular last use is
I put my finger at the base and kind of
blink and that's like how you curl how I
curl my false lashes as I wear them but
they've stayed on wonderfully well I put
them on top of of course eyeliner and
eyeshadow and and all that and I was
telling my mom about these today's just
like how do they you know can't they
don't they shift around or how can that
be a strong adhesive it really really is
sticky so I'm thrilled with that I mean
I would feel comfortable wearing these
anywhere and not be scared that they
were gonna come off oh there was one
thing when I was pulling them off of
this strip I kind of took them like I
would take any I kind of took him from
the end and just tried to gently pull
off but I did sort of you've got to be
really gentle with these when you take
him off because I almost kind of got him
got a couple of these like outer lashes
kind of going the wrong way cuz I think
I pulled it a little bit too much and
you're kind of able to form them back in
but not as well so I mean you can't
really tell with them on my eyes right
now but just be really gentle when you
take them off because it is kind of a
fragile band that you're working with
but that adhesive that's on there really
sticks and I have red because I haven't
taken these off yet and I still have to
go somewhere today so I'm not gonna go
ahead and take them off but I have red
I've done some research on these and
people say that they're easy to take off
too so I'm I'm glad to hear that and
they do I mean I can tell if I just kind
of start to get the tip off here it
feels like what it would be like to take
off regular false lashes that have glue
on them what else you can you can of
course try to wear them multiple times
since you get another adhesive here and
then you could continue wearing them
with glue I mean I don't see why you
couldn't go on wearing glue after you've
used your second adhesive strip they run
in the store between about five or six
dollars so that's kind of that's a
little more expensive than some brands
are like you'll see them buy in like
saying Walmart by other lashes that are
much cheaper but they're not self
adhesive like this if you are just
starting out I mean you don't have to
wait for the glue to get tacky you just
pop these babies on there at a good
length already I highly doubt that
you're gonna have to trim these to fit
your eye if you do that's really no big
deal even but I would really recommend
these to people who are just starting
out and don't want to have to mess with
the glue but you want the effect of the
false eyelashes I think this is
revolutionary because it's the first
kind of tried that has this capability
just to be self adhesive and truly be
that way so defining again is the more
natural intensifying a little bit more
bold it comes with your instructions it
comes with some application tools and
things like that and it just works
really well so I can't say enough good
things about these lashes and I hope you
guys do get a chance to try them out at
least once and see what you think and
please of course leave your feedback for
me so thanks so much guys for watching
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
