reviews for you today about a couple of
different long-wearing foundations one
of them has been recently featured in
one of my new product updates and the
other is one that I've been using a long
time so I'm going to talk about Rimmel
lasting finish foundation and also
Revlon Colorstay foundation
okay so first I'm just going to describe
what each of these what their claims are
I guess as far as the Rimmel lasting
finish it claims to be a mineral
enriched foundation I know mineral
anything is really popular right now it
claims to be a 16 hour transfer
resistant foundation it says it won't
rub off it says transfer resistant
formula looks freshly applied for up to
16 hours in rich with minerals to help
bring energized skin comfortable wear so
it's in a little tube kind of like a
plasticy tube this squeezes right out
and then as the blond colors stay I
happen to have this it's the color stay
with soft flex for combination slash
oily skin also in this shade I wore soft
beige and this in Revlon I'm fresh beige
it said looks and feels fresh all day
soft flex provides all-day comfort
oil-free shine control natural flawless
look transfer resistant it doesn't look
like Revlon actually gives like an hour
amount of time that it should stay on
but it's in like a kind of a glass jar
sort of thing um um it just you know
pours right out or you can dab it onto a
sponge or whatever so as far as my
opinions on each of these I've been
using Revlon Colorstay for a really long
time I like it a lot I found that it
works just really well on my skin it
definitely does stay and
the texture of Revlon Colorstay is
really smooth it's not as thick as you
would expect I think I came into both of
these thinking okay long wearing
foundations they're going to be pretty
thick and feel pretty heavy on my skin
but really neither of these do that okay
so they're both a fairly what do I want
to say I'd say they're both like a
medium coverage foundation medium to
full coverage depending on how you
choose to apply it but the texture on on
the Rimmel lasting finish is quite
similar to the Revlon Colorstay I would
say maybe perhaps feels just a tiny bit
thicker on the skin but it they both
have a really similar feel they both
spread well they hang together nicely I
don't know if you sometimes you put a
foundation on so you dab it all over
your face and then you wait a little
while and you come over to this side to
start blending that it's already started
to like set into your skin a little bit
both of these are pretty easy to blend
they don't um you know go ahead and like
if you dabbed a little over here and
hadn't blended it yet and you know it's
kind of confusing but that what I'm
trying to say is that they don't set in
to your skin too quickly so you have
time to you know get a sponge and blend
it or use a foundation brush or use your
fingers and I've used pretty much all
methods with both of these and they work
fine staying power now this kind of gets
into I with Revlon Colorstay I also use
the color stay pressed powder and I
think that that is a wonderful
combination
I love Revlon color stays pressed powder
and I just think that when you use it in
conjunction with this foundation it is
by far I mean I just don't have issues
with my makeup staying on when I use
that combination it's really a great a
great mix I mean I just really like
Revlon color stays pressed powder period
so with this lasting finish I'm pretty
sure this lasting finish foundation
is the only lasting finished product
Rimmel has so I went ahead and used my
Revlon Colorstay pressed powder on top
of this too and so in doing that I
really feel like it obviously as you
might assume the Revlon Colorstay
pressed powder works best with a Revlon
Colorstay product however if you know it
did okay with this but I really feel
like I have the longest wearing best
texture the texture of a foundation
sometimes can change as you wear it I
don't know if any of you have recognized
that but you know throughout the day you
can see that when where your face
started out nice and smooth and matte
sometimes that's the oiliness of your
skin comes through a little bit more and
this just wears very well with its own
powder this doesn't stay 16 hours I'm
sure you know I don't know if I've worn
it for a full 16 hours but in a workday
that I've worn it it does stay you know
it's obviously still on my skin but I
feel like I get more of a matte coverage
that lasts me longer with the Revlon
Colorstay so if you see what I'm saying
here sure this is going to if you don't
wash it off yeah it's still going to be
on your skin but how nice does it look
how clean does your skin continue to
look throughout the day how fresh does
it look and I would say Revlon Colorstay
probably beats out that product in that
category and like I said it's got a nice
pressed powder of the same brand of the
same color stay line and that's
obviously going to probably work a
little better
also the Revlon has an SPF 6 in it so if
you're looking for that quality of
foundation it has that and both are
oil-free as far as actually just using
the product out of its container I do
prefer that you know just being able to
squeeze it out right onto your finger or
onto a sponge as opposed to this jar
format I really don't love that but it's
not really a big
Abell since I don't really travel with
my foundation a whole lot but yeah this
either of these would really be an OK
bet for you I'm being really picky to
find anything wrong with the Rimmel
lasting finish okay it's a real it's
really good it does say it's a mineral
enriched foundation and honestly you
know how is one going to detect that oh
yeah this foundation definitely had some
minerals in it I mean I really can't
can't say for sure but they say it has
it in there and it hasn't I can't say
that it hasn't irritated my skin at all
it hasn't caused breakouts neither of
those have Revlon I've been using for a
long time and I haven't had issues with
that but I also wanted to let you know
that you know some people had I put out
my video that first featured this just
with some new products I had and I
weight tend to like to wait a while
before I review something because I've
used this now for a couple of weeks and
I think that is you know helps me have a
more honest review about the product
rather than just you know I open it up I
put it on my hand and now I'm going to
review it that's that's never going to
be what I'm going to do when I review
these products so keep in mind it takes
me a little while to get to review I am
trying it and I'm really testing it up
against some other products so so bottom
line either of these would be a good bet
for you these are long wearing
foundations they do live up to their
promise in that way but Revlon has other
Colorstay products as well as concealers
and that whole family of items is going
to give itself I think a little
advantage over this one Rimmel lasting
finished product that doesn't really
have a powder it can work with or a
concealer or something else like that
they may come out with something like
that and then of course we'll have to do
another review so thanks for watching
and I'll let me know if there's anything
else you guys want to see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
