product from hard candy in this
revved-up review that's kind of my
no-nonsense review that I do real quick
just want to give you the info tell you
what I think about it and not clog it up
with a bunch of other products so
product I'm talking about right now is a
new product in the hard candy line you
may have noticed it in stores now
and it's called Fox in a box really cute
name as many of the names of their
products are this shade is called hot
flash and first off I just want to show
you the packaging of this this is kind
of like a little cardboard box reminds
you of some of the benefit boxed
products that you've seen it really is
cute they've paid attention to the
presentation of this product and it
really is nice and when you open it up
you know it opens just kind of like a
little box like that you do get a little
brush here this is the type of brush I
might use for a highlighter it's very
very light it's not unusable by any
means it is somewhat soft but I wouldn't
want to use it for a blush like this
because I think a blush this colorful
could get streaky and a little bit hard
to handle with a very small brush so I
want to show you kind of how this one
works this I chose the one that had the
brightest color possible because I
really wanted to see what this blush was
made of they had some that are like
these quadrants of color they had some
that are split right down the middle to
shades so you know just kind of look for
what you're most interested in the way I
like to use this blush you could swirl
it all and just get kind of a muted pink
look but what I like to do is take my
blush brush kind of go over this side oh
I want to give you an up-close look at
what these actually do look like you can
see you're getting kind of matte on this
side and a little bit of shimmer on this
side you've got kind of just a medium
tan color a light sort of champagne
highlight looking color a real kind of
Barbie doll pink and then a hot pink
shade kind of a raspberry
teller sort of like the color of my
walls here in this room so what I would
first do to apply this is to kind of
take my brush and go just over the one
side of it just tap it in it doesn't
take a lot this is a bold colored blush
and then kind of swirl this on the apple
of my cheek here and it's really a
pretty blush I mean I feel like this
gives you a nice pink glow that could
really be buildable it could really be
intense I'm using it about as light as I
possibly can right now and I just think
it's a it's a lovely kind of berry flush
that this this blush gives you and like
I said if you didn't want it looking so
berry you could blend them all together
then what I would do though my step
number two would be to just dot it over
the other to the lighter side and kind
of use that as my highlight and this is
nice because it's a highlight that's it
you know it's lighter than what you put
right here but it's not overly shimmery
so I think this is a gorgeous product I
think benefit now has some competition
because this is nicely pigmented it's
less expensive you're getting that cute
packaging that you might have liked in
the benefit products but you're getting
a really really nice blush here so I
think hard candy did great with this I
do also like their baked
blushes which they first came out with
when when hard candy first came to
Walmart there's one called living doll
that's a gorgeous light pink
there's bronzers the baked bronzers that
I like but these blushes are also really
really cool so if you get a chance you
know maybe look over the selection in
your store see what you might need or
what colors that might interest you but
be aware that this shade called hot
flash really has some punch to it and
will be a lot of bang for your buck wear
this blush is concerned so thanks so
much for watching guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
