review of a new product from hard candy
and it's going to be a revved-up review
so that means quick to the point nothing
really added in this is all going to be
about one product so you can get the
infant information you came here looking
for so this is called blah saholic and
this is one big lip gloss the shade that
I have here is called gorgeous and if
you get an up-close look at that you can
see that it's kind of a pinky mauve
color and if you get a really close look
at it you can see that there is actual
not shimmer but legitimate pieces of
glitter in this i've swatched it here so
hopefully you can see there there is
some actual glitter in this gloss you
can also tell from this swatch that this
is not going to be one of those opaque
you know thick with color lip glosses
this is going to have sort of that sheer
gel like quality to it with that slight
hint of color I've got it on my lips now
my lips are not naturally very pigmented
at all so here you're seeing just how
much color that that's going to give it
gives makes my lips look like a light
mauve color and if you got really close
you could probably see some of that
glitter coming out just a little bit but
the glitter is not super obvious I mean
you can see that it's there so if you're
anti glitter I mean that's one of the
first things you need to think about hey
this has glitter in it and some of the
other shades have even more of a
pronounced obvious looking glitter this
is maybe one of the more subtle ones but
what's really going to blow your mind
about this lipgloss is when I pull it
out of the tube q the jaws theme that's
what I was thinking and I guess I first
opened this for the first time like duh
pull it out and it is angel I can't one
like look at this compared to my lip
like that's so big if you compare that
to let me grab a NYX lip gloss just for
a look at an average sized doe foot
applicator compared to this big one look
at that it's really big and I mean this
just that the name says it all blah
saholic we're going to give you a lip
gloss that is glittery and it's got just
this huge applicator and it's also got a
scent that is kind of sweet it's got a
sweet um taste to it as well and that
kind of brings me to my next point about
how it actually feels on your lips it
feels really smooth it is not sticky and
therefore the staying power of this
isn't like the most fantastic staying
power you're ever going to find
sometimes stickier thicker lip glosses
will stay longer just because you're not
going to be as prone to licking them off
your lips and this one with the flavor
is inked practically encouraging you to
lick it off your lips but at the same
time it has a thickness in the
consistency of this to where you put it
on and it's like you're not going to see
the lines in your lips it's going to
overall smooth out your lips without
being a thick colored gloss so that's
interesting how can any gloss that as
this sheer kind of cover your lips and
give your lips that look of nice
smoothness it's it's kind of interesting
how it does that and it almost is like a
now I got to say this really carefully
it almost reminds me of a plumper not in
that something in the formula is an
irritant to my lips that is causing them
to plump but just in the texture of this
formula it is a little bit thicker and
it's almost providing this thicker glaze
over your lips that is making them look
more plump than they actually are so I
hope that made sense to you but that's
basically what I'm getting at here is
that it's thick without being sticky
it's not incredibly long wearing but it
does give a nice look to your lips if
you're anti glitter you may not like
this at all but if you're a lipgloss
aholic like
this like the name of this gloss you may
want to give this a try if not just to
pull this out one day when you're
sitting on the bus or you're sitting you
know at work at your desk and then you
pull this out and somebody sees you
using it's going to be a great
conversation starter I promise so thanks
for watching this revved-up review I
will have more to come and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
