of review series and I'm calling it
revved up review and basically what it
is is a quick review it's kept you know
quite short and it's basically focusing
on just one product so I'm kind of
thinking like you know if you were just
randomly googling a product and you just
wanted to review on that product didn't
want to spend a whole lot of time doing
research just wanted kind of a quick
concise but complete opinion of what
that product is like I could do that for
you without having to search through you
know a list 15 products long on a random
you know other kind of whole related
video or something like that just the
straight up review quick and simple so
that's what I'm doing and just you know
picking different products that I've
been trying and kind of wanted to share
my opinion about and I'm going to be
doing quite a few of these videos here
and there so the product I'm talking
about in this video is from Maybelline
and it's not brand new but it's
relatively new to the line and it's the
shine sensational lip gloss in the
little squeeze tube here now I've only
tried one kind of these but I can tell
that if the formula is any anything like
this one it's a really good product it's
this one is called tempting toffee and
you can see what I also what I like
about this is there are a variety of
like kind of textures and looks to these
glosses this one happens to just be a
nice creamy kind of natural rosy shade
and I have it on my lips right now it's
really nice I think for fall too because
if you're used to wearing a nude lip
really often I feel like this shade is a
nice kind of transition for that because
you're not going all out red you're not
going with like a deep berry but instead
you're just keeping it light and kind of
natural so basically it's got the
slanted tip squeeze tube and you know
just to pull out a little swatch there
you can see as as you would wear it a
little bit sheared out that's kind of
the look you're gonna get and so it's
the type of shade that I feel like
really looks good on a lot of natural
lip colors because we have a lot of I
feel like a lot of us have sort of mob
or slightly pinky tones to our what
and say you put this on top and it's
kind of like okay that doesn't look
drastically different from my own lips
but looks better it has a really nice
scent and I that's one of my favorite
things about this actually it smells so
good
it's smooth and it's just sticky enough
to not be kind of running around my lips
but I feel like it has some decent
staying power so I've enjoyed this on
top of a lipstick and right now like I'm
wearing it just on my own you can top it
off with some lip liner for a little bit
more definition but overall I really
like this this is probably gonna prompt
me to buy some more of these but this
shade I just found this I was looking
through a whole selection I thought this
shade in tempting toffee was really
outstanding and like I said just a
smooth creamy gloss and it seems like
sometimes in drugstores you know it's
loaded down with glitter and shimmer so
this was nice to see so hopefully you
enjoyed this review I'll have more
revved up reviews to come so thanks so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
