for you now that's where I get review
out really quick and concise and just
focus it on the one product so you know
exactly what you're getting when you
turn on this video and this is going to
be a review on the Physicians Formula
concealer twins concealer here and so
what I've got is the one for yellow -
light so basically one end is a yellow
tone concealer the other is more a
traditional light colored skin tone
concealer and I had mentioned this in
maybe some dailybooth photos where I
said I used this concealer and so I've
gotten some questions you know what do
you really think of that and so I've
been trying it for a while and to be
honest here's my opinion I think this is
a good concealer for brightening but I
don't think it has the best coverage I
to look for a concealer that has better
coverage I mean I think the Bobbi Brown
concealers and correctors are top of the
line awesome
if you're trying to save some money the
Maybelline Dream moose is a really great
one that I use on a daily basis this can
be nice to even use a little bit in
conjunction with say the Maybelline just
because it does have that slightly
brightening effect the yellow works nice
to kind of counteract some of the real
deep dark areas but still I wouldn't
rely on it on its own to cover it up
here's what we're talking in terms of
the yellow that's about how yellow it
looks there so when you blend it out you
know you can blend it out and I don't
know if you can sort of see the swatch
that I've got going on there but it has
a just more of a I feel like skin
brightening quality and I'm not talking
this has shimmer in it don't get me
wrong there but I feel like with its
it's um coverage level it's just
somewhat of a light coverage and it um
definitely does not get cakey but I feel
like it has more of the effect of okay
it's gonna brighten those circles a
little bit so if you have just minor
under-eye circles this could do the job
but if you've got some major areas to
cover you might notice brightness but
you know sometimes you can turn your
head and look in your mayor and then
you're like oh wow well there's the
circle again you know you just by how it
catches the light so may not be enough
coverage for someone with severe
under-eye circles but
still might be enough to help those of
you who just have minor problems or you
just want to use it around your face to
just brighten up some areas of
discoloration so thanks so much for
watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
