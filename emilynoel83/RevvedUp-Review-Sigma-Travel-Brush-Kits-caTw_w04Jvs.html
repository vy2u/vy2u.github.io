revved up review for you that's where I
try to kind of focus in on one type of
product and really get the review out
quick concise complete to the point you
know so you don't have to sort through a
ton of information to really know what
you want which is this product worth
buying so what I'm going to talk about
are these travel brush kits from Sigma
one of them is just the regular travel
brush kit and one is made up of some of
the premium brushes so I'm going to kind
of tell you what the difference is and
which one I think really can give you
the brushes you need for a full face
look without having to really take
anything extra so looking at the regular
brush kit what you get is a face brush
so this is you know they've kind of
changed up their numbering and to be
honest some of the numbering is worn off
of some of these brushes but you do get
a great face brush I enjoy using this
quite a bit just to get my bronzer all
over my face or even my blush it works
well for that too you get a stippling
brush which many people rely on for
their foundation application so that one
works really well I really enjoyed the
angled blush brush it's kind of in there
you can see as I take it out of here but
I mean these are smaller shorter brushes
but yet you're getting a good ample size
I feel of the you know top of the brush
then you've got a great little brush to
do some crease work with kind of a
pencil brush you've got a nice fluffy
crease brush that can blend everything
out you've got a concealer brush or a
brush that can be nice for packing
shadow and really exact areas on your
lid or you've got a flat you know
typical shadow brush kind of reminds me
of the elf eyeshadow brush that can also
do that for you so you get all these
brushes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 brushes there's
also a little pouch here this is a
really really nice carrying case and
they're pretty much the same type of
carrying case for both of these so as
you can see you get a good variety of
brushes there and overall I feel like I
could put together my whole face with
this kit if I if I needed to and you've
also got this what's nice is this extra
little pouch if you had
couple more brushes you wanted to take
along so that's an option with both
brush kits as you can see you also have
a zippered pouch right over here that's
pretty large really you could fit you
know some good regular full-size brushes
they're probably now with the premium
kit you're getting brushes that can do
more specialized functions you're
getting this really kind of neat brush
it's sort of an egg shaped brush taper
to the tip can be good for a powder
application good for contouring bronzer
whatever the case may be although it
might take a little getting used to to
use that brush if you're used to more
the typical powder brushes you get a
stippling style brush only this is
really nice for highlighter it's kind of
as you can see it's tapered so it's not
blunt all the way across like the other
stippling brush was but this can be nice
for really light applications of powder
like highlight so as you can see a
little more specialized you get it kind
of this jumbo size concealer brush which
is a little bigger than what I might use
so I'm not really going to reach for
that a whole lot you get this large
fluff eyeshadow brush which I personally
think is bigger than i would want it's
just for my eye I mean yes I could get
an application of you know a flat base
wash of color on there but it's just a
little bigger than I would like I kind
of prefer the regular shadow brush in
the other set you've got this really
short it's called a short shader brush
but this can be nice for kind of doing
some smudged out liner or you know you
you pick the use for this basically it
can have multiple uses but it's just you
know it's kind of a different style of
brush might take some getting used to if
it's not you know a typical brush you
use and then you've got this brush which
is a small tapered blending brush and it
is definitely tapered to the tip you can
see it comes to a real point there it's
not like some of those big fluffy kind
of more like a dome top to it so this is
also going to be a little more precise
with your shadow application definitely
not really to be used as a big blending
brush and then you've got a very nice
eyeliner brush which I actually really
think is great you can see that tiny tip
on there you're going to give really
precise application that's a really
great liner brush so basically all in
all with with each set they both have
their advantages if you can get them
both I think they are great and you
could definitely easily travel with two
but if you really want to narrow it down
and pick one this has much more I feel
like specialized choices yes they could
all be useful on your face but they are
a little bit more like you know they're
not your traditional brushes this set is
a little more typical but you still do
get a stippling brush you get a pencil
brush concealer brush you know a nice
angled blush brush so if I had to pick
one I would probably go with the regular
traditional set as my best top pick for
a brush set that can get you through get
your whole face on with just one set so
thanks so much guys for watching and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
