revved-up review a really quick review
on the elf conditioning lip balm SPF 15
these are part of the studio line and
you'll find these on eyes lips face calm
and I really really like these I know
when I was doing my haul video I kind of
went on about the size because these are
really kind of big I mean if you look at
them and look at just kind of how much
space the product takes up and then how
much packaging surrounds it it seems a
little excessive and just to hold one in
your hand you know it takes your whole
hand to hold it it's going to take up
some room in your makeup storage it's
going to take up some room in your purse
you're not going to necessarily fit this
into a little clutch if you wanted to
take it out and I think the quality of
the product itself is awesome and it's
also really inexpensive so I don't feel
like they're really jacking up the price
on you because they've given you all
this extra packaging or whatever but i
think that the product is really really
nice so basically i have two different
shades in this i have romantic rouge
which is what i have on now get a look
at that and then i also have mellow
melon which is a lighter shade and these
are a little bit i'm kind of tight to
open them up but i do want my thing to
be closed tighter than you know
constantly opening up on me and this is
kind of a look at what the product on
the inside is like so it reminds me a
little bit of those jelly bombs from hip
i don't know if they still make those or
not but i love those I thought they had
a really Pleasant scent and they just
gave your lips a nice hint of color
these kind of remind me of that only
maybe not quite as glossy I smell just a
hint of sunscreen there so not a bad
smell but that's it's not overly fruity
but you just kind of put this on with
your finger you could use a lip brush if
you wanted to and just kind of smooth it
on and you can see it's sort of
buildable so if you just want that light
touch of color you know just put on a
little bit but and I had a little bit on
it first and now you can see another
layer and you get that
kind of like this is sort of that cherry
popsicle cut it's not overly shiny it's
not high maintenance to work with the
feel of it you know it really does feel
like you put on a lip balm only it
doesn't it's not quite as I hate to use
the word greasy but some lip balms you
know you put them on and they're just
kind of slide the texture of them just
kind of slides around on your lips this
has a little bit of thickness to it it's
still very easy to wear on your lips but
if that helps the staying power quite a
bit and put this on and sort of finish
it off with a lip liner or even put a
light color gloss over this there this
is so versatile in terms of how it will
work with the other products in your
collection but I really like this shade
that I have here but I want to swap it
out and show you the lighter color too
it's called mellow melon and it just
kind of has that a light pink look to it
maybe a hint of peach and by the way
both of these shades are just kind of
creamy you're not putting on a lot of
shimmer and I just think that that adds
to the natural look that these have this
gave off you know the similar texture
but just a lighter color and I put on a
little extra of this just to make the
color come through a little bit more but
I would really recommend these I think
these are a good buy on the elf website
I'm not sure if they will end up putting
these in Target stores or nose up for
these thanks so much for watching let me
know if you've tried these what colors
you like because availability wasn't so
good there were a couple of their colors
I wanted to try but I noticed they were
running out on the elf website so if
you've tried any colors you like a lot
let me know what you think have a great
day and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
