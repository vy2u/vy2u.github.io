video I'm sorry if my makeup and hair
whatever doesn't look super flawless
right now I've gone through I've been up
for more than 12 hours right now so it's
been on there a while had works today
and the work has been going well um my I
am have been asked to get some clips of
my anchoring on YouTube and I really am
not honestly not sure how to like work
with our editing system that we have at
work to be able to reformat it to put it
on YouTube I'm not out there
cyberstalker so you'll have to bear with
me on that but I think there's another
way I can do it by actually kind of
taping off of my TV which has a really
good picture so it may work and then I
can just do it real easy that way rather
than having to go in through our
computer systems and and all that stuff
because I really don't deal in editing
so so I'm not really familiar with that
but anyway um thank you for all your
interest there and if you do want to
know more as far as how this is going
and if you're interested in TV news
careers things like that I'm doing a lot
of things related to that on my blog
beauty broadcast blog spot.com and I
have posted pictures of my different
anchoring looks and things like that so
if there's a particular one you enjoy
you could always comment there and say
hey I would love to see a tutorial on
this and I can do that and it's a little
bit harder obviously for me to schedule
in tutorials because I'm sometimes a
little groggy at 1:30 a.m. and that's
when I put my makeup on for the day but
those are always things I can do on the
weekend so I am up for that if you guys
have any requests but anyway um this is
going to be a review for a primer I've
been using and really liking it's from
Rimmel and it's called fixin perfect it
comes in one color which it does not say
on this bottle but I believe when you go
to the store it says something like a
book huh
and so that may strike you as kind of
weird but this is something that works
for everybody
and I've been asked before our primer is
really necessary and do they really work
that well and I had to honestly say you
know I don't necessarily feel like
everybody needs to wear a primer and I
still don't feel like it's absolutely
essential but if you do have struggled
blending foundation at times and if you
do really feel the need for something
that smooths out your skin and something
that you want to make it last longer I
have found one that I think will
actually help with that and this claims
to smooth skin and minimize pores I'm
not sure how much I've noticed with
minimizing pores I actually don't think
I even noticed that that was a claim
until I really really looked at the
packaging but um you're going to be
interested to see actually what color
this is if it's a little squeeze tube
and if I squeeze out a little bit here
on my finger you can see that this is
don't know if you can see but this is
actually kind of like a peach shade okay
and this would work on anybody's skin
because as I blend it into my hand right
now um it does I noticed that it does
brighten up my skin but it does pretty
much totally blend away it has a smooth
feel um if you are familiar with what
Smashbox photo-finish
feels like um it is not quite as um what
do I want to say the moisture of the
primer does not quite disappear into
your skin like photo finish does it's
like that you'll rub onto your skin and
then your skin almost feels like there's
almost nothing on it then here you can
feel just a little more softness or
something there's a little more softness
a slight amount of moisture that comes
onto your skin that helps you blend that
foundation when you put it on there and
this is I mean known as a foundation
primer but you absolutely don't have to
use a liquid foundation on top of this
to get the benefits from it you could
use a mineral foundation in fact I would
recommend
something like this with minerals
because a lot of people fear that those
don't last maybe quite as long so that
is one thing that I I mean I think it
would be good for that I used this on
air quite often and I have noticed on
days when I sometimes just wake up put
my moisturizer on and then forget to put
this on before my foundation I think I
noticed that it doesn't quite last as
long and I have been occasionally using
my Rimmel lasting finish foundation and
I find that um that paired with this
which is of course the Rimmel brand
works very well together in conjunction
with one another and like I said it
looks apricot color but don't be scared
I really think any skin tone it does
seem to brighten just a little bit I
won't say it evens out but um certain
areas like I put it right up under my
eyes just because I know that's where a
lot of concealer and makeup of that type
is going to go but this is a really good
primer it's probably one of my favorites
and I've tried Smashbox photo-finish
I've tried philosophy philosophy the
present which is also kind of claims to
be like clear makeup um what else have I
tried I was down here my old drawer
I just tried at Smashbox bronzing primer
and those are good like don't get me
wrong photo finish is great stuff but
this for some reason I just like how
it's kind of creamy you put it on your
skin and you feel like okay I didn't
just put that on for nothing it didn't
just disappear and I feel like it is
kind of clinging to the foundation when
you put it on there this is a really
hard thing to describe and I'm kind of
realizing that as I decided to review
this but basically um let's boil it down
to this if you um use any kind of makeup
and you worry about how long it'll be
able to last on your skin this primer I
think would be a good thing for you to
at least try it's only about it's no
more than four or five dollars and one
color fits all whenever it will be zero
zero one
the only color that it comes in it's a
nice little tube here I've heard some
people say hey this works great as an
eyeshadow primer I have used it a couple
times is that too and I agree with that
for the most part although I think this
is designed to be a face primer um it
doesn't have to be something you use
with your liquids you could use this
with your minerals as well
um and I just like it a lot I think it's
it's great stuff um really I feel like
it extends the wear of my makeup and
when I have to wear my makeup as you can
see like I mean it around 1:30 in the
morning is when I put my makeup on and
now it's past 1:30 in the afternoon and
it's still on and it has pretty good
staying power I feel like with this and
it does work with a variety of my
foundations don't feel like you have to
by Rimmel for this to work so I feel
like I might be kind of rambling because
I'm not quite sure what to say all I
know is that this is good and if you
want to try an expensive primer or
experiment with your very first primer I
would try this out so thank you guys so
much for tuning into this video I
appreciate everybody who has watched
left comments I know it's been kind of
hard for me to get back to all of those
comments but I really appreciate it and
I'm taking any requests and feedback
definitely taking it into account so
thank you so much for watching and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
