this video I hope you're all having a
wonderful day this video is going to
compare two different Rimmel foundations
so I will get to that in a moment first
I wanted to address something I've
gotten a few questions about which is my
question of the week feature which I
believe the last one I did was some at
some point before Christmas and I really
loved doing this I thought it was so
interesting to get all the responses the
questions got totalling them up and then
the following week giving you the
results of that question I thought it
was a lot of fun however it became quite
a bit of work when these questions
started getting somewhere in the
ballpark of 350 400 responses and I had
to count those up and when they were
kind of open-ended questions and there
might have been you know a dozen
different categories you guys were
answering in it just got to be a whole
lot of work and very time-consuming and
I just thought you know there's got to
be a better way and a big thank you to
the folks who regularly read my blog and
comment because they suggested hey do
the question of the week but do it on
your blog because I do have the
capability there to do a poll and then
you know I could ask the question and
give a week to total it up and then do a
video on like what the results were or
just base it off of that particular
topic for the week and and do it that
way and so that would be way easier for
me so that is the way I'm going to do it
and I will have a link to the to my blog
over on the side but if you want the
address it is HTTP colon slash slash
beauty broadcast dot blog spot.com and
over on the right hand side of the blog
you'll see a poll question and this will
be the question of the week the poll
will close I think I've got it set to
close on like Sunday nights so answer
the question by Sunday night and your
vote will be counted and you can
actually see every time you answer you
will be able to see you know how the
results of the poll are going and
you can also you know I believe you
don't have to have an account or
anything like that to go ahead and
answer the question so that will be way
easier for me we'll still have the
question in the week we'll just do it
that way so anyway thank you guys for
being cooperative with that I'm sure you
will all just a rush on over there and
answer it but this week's question is
actually what is your favorite part
about doing makeup is it the face makeup
the blushes and bronzers the eyes lips
you know so just go ahead and answer the
question it's quick and easy and and
I'll give you the results next week so
onto this video I'm really excited about
this I was I've been kind of planning
this in the back of my mind for a little
while the Rimmel lasting finish
foundation how many times have I raved
about this stuff I love it it is a
16-hour transfer resistant formula it is
a mineral enriched formula so it does
contain minerals the color soft beige
200 is absolutely perfect for my skin
tone it truly does live up to its claims
of lasting a really long time and I wear
it about almost every day for work which
is under some bright lights that can be
kind of taxing on a makeup so I wanted
to see how that foundation would compare
to this other liquid Rimmel foundation
called stay meant I'll read to you about
the claims it's this is also in color
200 soft beige and these even though
they are different formulas the colors
are pretty much identical so if you had
tried one of these and wanted to try the
other chances are it's gonna still be a
match for you you can go ahead and get
that same color you had in the other one
this is an oil-free formula so is this
one I'll read you what it says it says
shine control formula with 12 hours
matte coverage the other one with 16
with skin pure complex where visibly
purified complexion and gentle botanical
extracts to help suit sensitive skin
oil-free non comedogenic non acne genic
fragrance free paraben free okay so they
met you
notice if I'm saying this and you're
thinking that name of that product
sounds familiar that's because this has
been packaged very differently for quite
some time and now the packaging has
changed and it's quite possible to
formula has changed as well and anyway I
just want to tell you basically what the
characteristics of each of these are and
then what would make one of them better
for a person with certain qualities to
their skin so anyway the blasting finish
this one is more liquidy and in
consistency I'm not quite sure why I
would almost expect the one that claims
to be more long wearing to be that thick
or almost creamier texture but it's not
and the way I wear this I wear it a very
very thin layer of it I use my stippling
brush and I which is extreme close-ups
sorry a brush like this this is my brush
from Coastal Scents and I put some
foundation on my hand blot my brush on
it and then like stipple it all over my
face and I get a very very small amount
of makeup really on my face but lasts a
very long time so anyway I've used this
continually I really really like it I
like how it stays it doesn't turn
blotchy it doesn't do anything my skin
to break it out however for the past few
days
I've been trying to stain that
foundation I actually have it on today
this is the first day that it's been
tested through one of my work days and I
must say it applies a little bit
differently like I said the texture the
consistency I'm going to show you here
on my finger consistency is a little bit
different see how it stands up like that
the other one isn't quite like that okay
that little dab it see if I can actually
show you here this almost is a little
more runny it would almost run out of
the container see it's not it's just you
know it's about to run off my finger
right now so I better put it down
but now that that probably matters a
whole lot to a lot of you but it's just
it seems a little bit more of like
almost I don't want to say it because I
don't want to make you guys think it's
truly a lot like this but it's it's a
little bit of that mousse II feel like a
mousse yes it just a little bit thicker
but yet still like it's like there's
maybe some air in it but it it's not
running off your finger I guess it went
on easy it didn't quite it was a little
bit harder to blend simply because it
wasn't so liquidy I put this on just
with my fingers and I did notice
instantly after I put it on to touch my
face there was no feeling of like doing
this or anything after I put this on I
always set it with powder so that pretty
much takes it away anyway but it's not
it doesn't go to that completely
necessarily dry finish if you have dry
skin and you're not I mean everybody
should moisturize but if you have dry
skin this may be a little bit more
difficult for you to apply simply
because the formula just doesn't seem to
have quite as much moisture in it
however this is really heavy on the
oil-free non acne jack this they're both
oil-free so you could get away with
using either one if you have problem
skin in my opinion but if you really are
an oily skin person I think this would
work really well for you because I have
managed to go through the day and I'm
seeing like hardly any shine to my face
this is I've not touched up anything
since what would it have been right
before the newscast 5 o'clock this
morning
Central Standard Time so um yeah I think
it stayed really well I'm not even
seeing I've seen maybe a little shine
around my nose but honestly not that
much so and and just that my skin to the
touch it does feel I mean it feel soft
it doesn't feel dry but it does feel
shiny and
so this claims to last for 12 hours so
that's pretty good for a foundation I
have not used it obviously as many days
as I've used this so this can have a
little more backing to it but my initial
reaction for the stain mat is that this
would be a good bet for those of you who
have oily skin that still want a long
wearing foundation that does not feel
heavy on your face but just it's
something that you know you don't want
to worry about you know breaking
yourself out I think a lot of people
have turned to mineral makeup at that
point but then you may wonder you know I
would like to have a liquid foundation
so this would be this would be a good
bet I love the packaging it's kind of
like the skinny little flat bottle and
it just works really well
so basically bottom line either of these
is great if you have a little more
problem skin you may be better off with
the stain mat but the lasting finish
truly does last a really long time but
both stand up to the day very well so
thank you so much for watching and have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
