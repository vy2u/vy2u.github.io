for you today the review is on a product
from Rimmel it is called light beam lip
gloss ok so to tell you a little bit
about just what the gloss itself is like
it is a pretty much a translucent gloss
I know it looks like it might have a
little bit of a pinky berry shade from
what you're seeing here but really it
goes on basically clear you're not gonna
get any color much of this but it's a
nice little squarish to by like the side
it's good in your hand like that really
matters and this has some very unique
features so I mean you might you might
have heard about this you might have not
by the way the color is after hours this
sort of reddish shade berry this has a
light on it okay see that it actually
lights up and the purpose is that it
also has this little mirror on it so
let's say I wanted to put this on and it
was dark out take it out turn the light
on the light shines on your face and I'm
looking in a little mirror here and you
can totally see what you're doing if you
were putting this on at night so I love
that concept that is just such a cool
concept and I just I'm kind of surprised
that nobody is really even just a simple
thing of having a decent sized mirror on
the side you know I'm surprised nobody's
really thought about that and put that
into like regular practice for lip gloss
now but this is cool but I love that
little light but I mean it's you guys
think of this product in two different
ways one is the packaging and the whole
doodads aren't like the mirror and the
light and the other is the product
itself and if I ask myself well what I
buy this again for
the actual lip gloss that comes in it I
would have to say no because I mean
there's nothing wrong with clear lip
gloss
anybody can get some good use out of a
clear lip gloss the only thing is if I'm
out and I'm going to reach for something
I usually want something that would give
me a little more color you know that I
can just swipe on I have to worry about
okay I want to put the clear gloss over
something else there you know what I
mean so that's the one drawback the snow
I'm not really crazy about you think
it'd be free but I'm actually snowing
it's almost like a coffee sort of scent
a little bit chocolaty maybe it's just
it's really sweet but it's definitely
not fruity and it just does not have
much color like if I put it on my hand
then it's just clear it's not even
incredibly shiny the texture is it is
moisturizing it is not very sticky but
it's not the kind it's not like oil
slick lip gloss and I like I like to
call it you know the stuff I just put it
on there and it's like you know veering
off your mouth it's so slick so it's not
like that I mean the texture is good I
would just like it to be a little more
thicker with color but it is really cool
packaging life like I said the little
light I think that's come in handy for
me so much it's like your I will keep
this in my purse for the simple fact
that I turn the light on and I can find
stuff in my purse it's like a flashlight
you know only a really cool flashlight
with built-in lip gloss so you know I
will just keep this in my purse for the
sole purpose of finding stuff and it's
come in handy quite often and it's you
know it's a conversation starter you
bring this out and every night guys are
like oh my gosh that's so cool you know
it's just fun to MEC play around with
nobody realizes lip gloss can do stuff
like that this is also by the way this
is part of Rimmel's
I think it like I want to say
underground or I don't know what exactly
that new little side line is they've got
going now but it's part of that sorry if
I didn't get that
namely I'm not quite sure to really
write offhand but it's it's a new thing
it's not real expensive I don't know
it's all around five bucks or so five to
seven dollars I want to say for it and
you know if you want something just
really fun but you could just like
shocked the or like be like oh I'm gonna
do my lip gloss you look like you know
go for it I mean you're not gonna be out
a lot money-wise and you know it's just
fun it's fun to have overall I would
recommend it just because it's so
innovative just beware that the product
may not be exactly what you expect from
looking at it from the outside but I
hope this review was of use to you I
hope you can you know think about it
when you're out in the store and maybe
it will lead you to a fun new product
all right thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
