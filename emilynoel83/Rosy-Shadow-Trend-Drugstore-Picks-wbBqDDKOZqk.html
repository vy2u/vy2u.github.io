you've gotten into the naked3 craze and
you really enjoy it chances are you're a
fan of rosy toned eyeshadows right
there's a lot of really nice rose pinky
colors in this palette started digging
through the rest of my stuff thinking
there's got to be more here you know
there's got to be other neat little
drugstore singles trios palettes that
could give you know kind of a similar
look inspired by The Naked 3 is what
I'll say cuz not everything is an exact
do not let's do this video because if
you've got the Naked 3 and you love it
chances are you may want some more
shadows that are kind of like that or if
you're skeptical about this and you
don't want to spring for it maybe you
know one of these little drugstore
options could give you a taste of the
kind of look you'd get with this or if
you tried this and you didn't like it
maybe you'll like some of these options
best so I'll just start out with the
look that I did today I combined two
different
wet and wild trios that I think both
incorporate some pretty pinky eyeshadows
even burgundy and Brown which I think
makes for a really pretty look I used
walking on eggshells so I used these
lighter two shades kind of around the
inner corner and the inner part of my
eye and then I went inward with the
knock on wood trio and I used this pink
I also used this pretty burgundy in the
crease and some of the brown in the
outer corner and then I just really
blended that all out up just above my
crease and then use that as my highlight
really enjoy the look these are so
affordable I love these little wet and
wild trios and nothing in here is too
sparkly at most I'd say it's like a
slightly pearly finish to a satiny type
finish with this look but nothing too
too sparkly and then I pulled in this
little shadow which is so cool it's the
long lasting lustrous eyeshadow from elf
and I need to double check the name cuz
there is no little sticker on it but
this is like a creamy like moose like
eyeshadow but it's very shimmery and
kind of rosy like that so I just used
that as a little bit of a topper just on
my lid just really lightly I did
use a whole bunch of it but it doesn't
maintain any sort of like a tackiness to
it it really feels dry you know once you
swatch it out or once you put it on your
lids for that reason it's great to just
add a little more pizazz to your look
but not worry about affecting the
staying power of it so I really like
that little guy also in case you missed
my get ready with me Valentine's Day
edition this was the quote that I used
there and it's called rose for romance
it's from L'Oreal and this really I
think emulates the kind of look that
that I would get with the naked 3
because it's got a nice really shimmery
pink and a lighter pink this really
pretty kind of grayish taupe and then a
deeper shade as well but you could
really you know go smoky with this if
you wanted to so back to wet and wild
real quick I normally think of the petal
pusher 8 pan palette as being a purple
palette for some reason it just
registers in my mind like if I'm
thinking about using purple I think
about that palette but really cover up
this half and it is totally like a rosy
kind of you know pinky toned look if you
just focus more on this side because
you've got a light shimmery pink you've
got a little bit deeper mauve shade with
a really pretty light golden sparkle in
there this super dark burgundy and then
something that's kind of like a shimmery
charcoal also from Maybelline and this
is one of Maybelline's best quads I
think and I'm kicking myself because I
hadn't tried this until like just last
year sometime um Kristin game was like
you haven't tried the quad and designer
chocolates it's so pretty and it's
really only got one kind of rosy pretty
pinkish color going on there but
everything else complements it so well
and it's like this can be your shimmery
pop and then you've got this great matte
Brown in here
sort of a pearly really light shade
something that you could use to blend
everything out as well so I just think
that's a phenomenal little quad little
duo that I've really enjoyed for so long
and it really got me rolling it with
enjoying these hard candy baked trios so
much and it's the one in secret
rendezvous and it has a beautiful light
pearl
pink as well as a very pretty rich
burgundy color these two shades just
these two I mean if you didn't throw
anything else in you could get a really
pretty look with this but deepen it up
with like a matte Brown or a charcoal
shade and it can take on a totally
different you know more complex look but
this is a really pretty duo to have a
single that definitely is a pretty darn
close dupe to the shade buzz in The
Naked 3 palette that's that nice
shimmery pink is from Ulta and it's the
single in hopeless romantic
this shade I mean I'll admit I have not
explored ulties line nearly enough just
the Ulta brand makeup but a while back I
had stumbled across this particular
color and I just thought wow that's
gorgeous and sure enough it is you know
just like the shadow and the Naked 3
really nice pinky colored base that
would work well with anything I've
mentioned so far is from Maybelline and
it's the color tattoo metal in Inked in
pink and I've had this one for a while
it's still doing great in terms of not
getting you know really dried out and
stuff but this is a really really pretty
pink color you can use as a base I think
it will make any of those pink shimmery
shades just pop even more so good to
have and this could be used on its own
and at least on me it goes nowhere it
doesn't have to be topped with a powder
you know I haven't mentioned a ton of
matte stuff in this video but I do want
to give a shout-out to one really
special shade it's from makeup geek and
it's the single and cupcake matte kind
of pinky mauve color a really
interesting shade I think this would be
gorgeous blending out a deeper shade
that's in your crease or you know all
over the lid lastly a little mention to
some shadows that are definitely less of
the cool pink and more of the warmer
kind of rose gold type color and it's
this quad from Sonia Kashuk it's the
monochrome quad and the shade is called
textured rose and these are really cool
because you you're getting like four
different finishes one is totally matte
one has a very fine golden e shimmer one
is more of like just a really soft kind
of pearly finish and then this one is
total sparkle it has almost a wet look
to
or tip for using these pinky toned
eyeshadows and not making your eyes look
sickly I think one of the keys is to do
something with your waterline I think
it's very important because that area
can naturally come off a little pink or
red on a lot of people so if you take a
nude liner like this is the Rimmel
scandaleyes in nude I've talked about
this a lot but it's a great liner to pop
in there and it instantly makes the eyes
look wider more fresh takes away any
look of redness so that's a great thing
or just use black using the black will
create a great amount of contrast with
the whites of your eyes and again it
will keep you from having a reddish look
that sometimes the waterline can develop
and just have that kind of a tint just
naturally way I hope this video was
helpful to you thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
