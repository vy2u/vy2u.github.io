demonstrating today is sort of a bluish
purple eight look I came up with out of
my 88 Coastal Scents shimmer palette and
the reason why i say bluish purple is
because i really thought i was going
with sort of a navy blue kind of look
here but right in front of me at the
lighting at my mirror it kind of comes
off purpley so whichever you like I
guess you can kind of go more intense
with certain parts of the of the look
than others and go more towards blue or
purple depending on what you like but
I'm also going to use a couple different
techniques in this video that I don't
usually use and also for my lip color
real quickly it is the l'oreal hip high
intensity pigments jelly bomb in plush
really like that stuff but if you're
interested in learning more on how to
recreate this look as far as the eyes go
keep on watching guys the first step of
this look is going to be to prime your
lid and I'm going to be using my be
luscious shadow magnet in light and this
is just a you know I primer but it's
it's sort of a cross between your
typical I primer and also like a cream
shadow so because it does kind of leave
your lid somewhat light so if you are
going for a white color on your lid this
will take care of that for you and after
that I'm going to grab my palette and
I'm going to use let's see which one did
I use I use this one just kind of one of
the sort of sheer sparkly shades it's
one two three four up on the left-hand
side of the palette there and just I'm
going to use my elf eyeshadow brush and
just kind of pack this on top there
haven't done my hair yet so don't mind
there alright so once you get that on
your lid I'm going to take my one of my
crease brushes from essence of beauty
this isn't the fine crease brush but one
stage up and i'm going to mainly be
dealing with a couple of blue shades
here on the palate this one and the one
right above and I saw these and I
thought I want to do a bluish look but
really on my I they come off a little
more on the purple east side so they're
kind of like purpley blue so just so
you're aware that if you haven't tried
those colors in your palate yet that's
what they are and so I'm going to go for
the shade I guess I didn't point out
exactly what shade i'm going to do it's
going to be this one right here and so
that's just a nice medium to deep blue
shade it's just one it's two up from the
very center of the palette and I'm just
going to start putting this in the
crease and it's going to start to look
kind of deep but what I like about these
shades and the shimmer palette is that
they're pretty easy to diffuse and blend
out and whatnot and this is the type of
shade you kind of have to keep keep
building up
I'm going to work towards kind of an
outer V here
and just continue building the color
outward as far as you are comfortable
okay and now that you've done that we're
going to take the color right below it
it's that deeper Navy looking shade and
we're just going to use that to deepen
up the outer part of the lid and crease
okay guys the next step for this look is
we're going to highlight with kind of a
peachy shade we're going to go to up off
the left-hand side here and we're going
to use this color right here so this is
just a nice sheer peach shape and just
take a fluffier shadow brush and apply
this all the way up to your brow ok now
for lower liner we're going to use some
shadow for that and I'm going to go back
to this deepest Navy shade here that we
use and I'm going to use a brush from
coastal scents that I've used I used
time to time and i think i'm going to
use it more it's the mini contour it's
tiny it's a tiny tiny brush and I'm just
going to dip into that and sometimes
this is just easier to use if you want a
more a less precise look than with what
a liner brush can give you and so I'm
just taking this that deeper Navy shade
and just kind of running it lightly sort
of blending a little bit with the outer
part of the shadow look and otherwise
just running it right under the lash
line for liner I'm going to use my
Revlon liquid liner only this color it
looks like it's black but it's actually
black shimmer and so it just has a
little more of a sheen to it it's really
kind of difficult to pick up on unless
you're looking at it right here in
person but that's going to be what I use
on the upper lash line so I'm just going
to make a line from inner to outer
corner with that I thought why not use
the black shimmer shade go all the way
with using the shiver ballot and the
shimmer liner it's just slightly less
intense than than the regular black is
2 i'm not really winging this out at all
i'm just kind of bringing it down to the
corner of my eye and leaving it at that
and then i'm going to do something
different with my lower liner here i
don't usually line my waterline but i
did on this sign it's kind of because i
wanted to really see if my revlon
colorstay liners were good in the water
line so I'm just going to use my liner
in black and just kind of lightly do
that I'm usually not a fan of this look
but for some reason with this particular
look that I've got going on I actually
kind of like it so just go inner to
outer corner with that and it really
kind of makes it look like the the
shadow you've got underneath just really
diffuses out to nothingness so that's
kind of neat you're going to need to
curl your eyelashes then I'm going to
use my maybelline define a lash volume
mascara and just go ahead and apply a
coat or two of that to your eyelashes
it's going to give you a pretty natural
look still in my opinion and another
thing I don't usually do I'm going to
put a little bit of that mascara just to
touch on my lower lashes just to kind of
keep that little sort of light smokiness
down there going alright guys that is my
look for this sort of bluish purple
shimmery eye look it's just really easy
to recreate the liner and shadow is
pretty basic for this one so it's just
something you can kind of pick up and
try real quick with your 88 shimmer
palette from Coastal Scents so I hope
you guys like this video and thank you
very much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
