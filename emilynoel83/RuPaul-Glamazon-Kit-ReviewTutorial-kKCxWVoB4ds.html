here so what better time to just go with
some excessive makeup usage and do a
drag queen look this is RuPaul's
glamazon makeup kit it says limited
edition cosmetics set if you watched my
Christmas and birthday beauty haul this
is one of the things my sister got me
I've taken the products out obviously
but it comes with several different
things for like your color cosmetics so
the eyes lips and cheeks and it's really
just about going over the top and just
glamming it up to the extremes and there
really isn't much of a guide with this
kit in terms of like how to get the look
so I just went off of the look that I
saw RuPaul with their on the front and I
went with that as well so it's bold eye
shadow a pretty bold colorful lip and as
far as the face makeup I just went very
full coverage with that used the Estee
Lauder Double Wear face and body like
the really really full coverage stuff
and the double wear powder as well just
to give like that really flawless face
look so I'll have all those details
below but let's get started
so since I'm using loose powder shadows
I really want to give them something to
cling to so I'm using this base from
Sigma and the shade is persuade it's
just a nice nude shade then I'm taking
the shadow and sunny side up it's this
really bright yellow it does have
shimmer in it and I've got some in the
cap here it'll only take a little bit in
my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush and
I'm just gonna start patting that on the
inner part of the lid taking this right
around the tear duct and a little ways
onto my lower lash line next we're gonna
take the blue shade and it's called Blue
Bayou just a really true like royal blue
has a little bit of shimmer in it not
quite as much shine to it as the yellow
has and I'm just using a flat eyeshadow
brush and picking up some of that and
then tapping off the excess I really
would have been thinking I would have
probably done my eyes first and
my face makeup so I wouldn't have to
worry about fallout but we're just gonna
be really careful here and I'm just
lightly overlapping a little bit of that
yellow we may go back and pull some more
yellow over it it's kind of tricky
because the yellow and the blue they're
to just totally different shades so it's
a little tricky to make one seamlessly
fade into the next but when you're
working with these bright shades I think
it helps to just go little by little
keep building up the color you want
don't slap it all on there feel like you
have to put it on all at once I'm going
to start working on this outer V a
little bit I'm just gonna place the
shadow exactly where I want that outer V
to go and we'll worry about blending it
out a little later so packing a little
more on the lid and then I'm just
flipping my brush over I use this
technique a lot it's just great for
getting the shadow placed in the right
spot and what I'm thinking of when I'm
doing this outer V is not letting it
drop down below this kind of imaginary
line between the corner of my eye and my
eyebrow and we will have pink that's
surrounding this too so we really don't
want to let that V get too low from the
looks of the picture the blue doesn't go
in too terribly far here so I'm going to
stop it about mid eye and just continue
getting the shape that I want here and
then we'll take care of the blue on the
lower lash line I'm gonna take an angled
brush pick up some more of that product
and I'm just gonna take this right under
my lash line all the way to the yellow
and kind of overlapping that some you
just want to kind of connect that up to
the balloon then I'm going in with just
a little bit more of this yellow
like I said overlapping the border again
it just makes it look a little bit
softer and then just soften the edge of
this blue I'm just going with a fluffy
brush we don't want to lose the
intensity of the color overall so I'm
mainly just kind of going back and forth
over the edge
there's definitely some hot pink in this
look but there's no pink shadow included
fortunately I have one it's shocking
pink from Milani just the perfect pink
to get the look that is on the
this bomb I'm going to take my little
a36 brush a great precision brush that
still gives you a really soft look so
I'm picking up some of that pink and
we're gonna bring it right in here
to the inner part of the crease just
overlapping the edge of the yellow first
and then you're just gonna carry this up
right over the top of the blue and I
really am applying a little more
pressure with this brush now to make it
a little more blended between the pink
and the blue and then the pink actually
comes right around the outside so I'm
continuing to use this brush and I'm
taking it down just below our outer V of
the blue and taking it maybe a third of
the way under my lower lash line just
really lightly getting lighter and
lighter as I go and then I'll go over
the border of that with a bear brush and
I want a little more blue intensity
right there in the outer corner so I'm
just gonna take a slightly smaller
crease brush or a smudge brush and just
really make sure I'm getting the most
blue right where my crease is right in
the outer part there is a black liquid
liner that comes with this kit and it's
got just a pointed kind of felt tip
applicator there so I'm gonna take this
across my upper lash line and I will
tell you that I feel like this liner is
a little bit watery you know a lot of
times when you shake up an eye liner
feel like a little something in there
that's helping the product get all mixed
together and this liner doesn't have
that so as you can see you know you're
not getting a really intense black line
as you go along so because of that and
since I do want a little wings to come
off at the end I'm gonna go with my
really super black Milani ultra fine
liners feel like I have so much more
control with this and I'm gonna stay in
line with basically where the blue
shadow is and create a little wing right
toward the bottom of that outer V there
and then this kit comes with a brown
eyeliner it's not really intense enough
I don't think for the waterline judging
by what the picture
doing and sort of what I want to do with
this law I'm just gonna take a black for
my collection this is perfect black from
two-face it's a really black liner and
I'm gonna take that in my inner rim all
the way to the innermost corner and then
I'm just pulling it down onto my actual
lower lash line just a little bit here
and I'll smudge that just kind of
smudging that out going over it with a
little bit of the blue eye shadow next
I'm curling my lashes and the kit comes
with a mineral volumizing mascara in
very black it's got you know a
traditional type brush here a pretty big
brush and this is a really dry formula
mascara this one can throw on a few
clumps if you're not careful but we are
doing false lashes so this is just kind
of a preliminary step I'm using my
covergirl LashBlast clump crusher here
on my lower lashes just cuz I know how
long wearing this is you know there's
some false lashes going on with this
look so I'm wearing my red cherry number
43 s a lot of lengths a lot of thickness
with the I'll apply those and then we'll
finish things up still got some glue
drying over here on those lashes but wow
look at those eyes I feel like some kind
of you know Barbie doll or something
there is a mineral blush that comes with
this kit the shade is dream girl so I'm
going to tap a little bit of that into
the can just to show you a swatch of
that color you can see it's kind of a
soft peachy rose but with tons of
shimmer so I'm gonna dust some of this
on my cheeks kind of funny how soft and
pretty natural this blush color is
compared to the wild eyes but all the
focus on the eyes I guess oh wait
there's a bright lip - oops this shade
is called diva it's kind of a raspberry
type of color and RuPaul does not hold
back on the lips at all if there was
ever a moment to kind of go outside your
natural lip line this is it I would
actually wear this color any day of the
week I think it's beautiful
it doesn't look exactly like what's in
the look on the box but it's still
pretty nice juicy full lip there you
know what I was just thinking like if
you were to look at me from a distance
you
I just think this is like my typical
makeup look get a little closer it's
definitely some wild color and stuff but
this was so much fun and honestly if
makeup is not fun for you then something
needs to change so I had a really good
time trying to recreate this amazing
look that RuPaul's rocking there on the
cover of this box but I thought I'd talk
a little bit about some of the products
and just what I thought about the kit as
a whole or its color and just the stuff
in this box that gives you color these
two eyeshadows I thought were amazing
really really pigmented for a shimmery
yellow to show up like this one does I'm
super impressed and the blue is
obviously very full color as well
I thought the blush was really nice and
super wear of and I really like this
gloss as well um it's definitely opaque
like full coverage on the lips very very
shiny hook it like a little bit outside
you know my natural lip line just to
give a little extra umph there and I
thought the look came off really well it
stayed in place I've eaten pizza rolls
today I mean it's all going good I
really feel like the pink though was a
key part of this I look like when you
look at the way this all came together
it would have been great if they
included the pink in this kit I mean I
had it that I could use on on its own
but a really nice matte hot pink
eyeshadow can be a little hard to come
by sometimes mascara the one was pretty
big and I do really like the dryer
formula mascaras but this one actually I
don't know if I've ever said this before
but might have been just a little too
dry kind of hard to get like a nice
smooth application and not need to mess
with some clumps here and there so
didn't love that also wasn't a huge fan
of the liners either a liner you know it
may be a great liner but I don't feel
like there's anything in there like when
I shake up this Milani one here how
there's something that's kind of helping
mix the product together here I think it
ended up coming out kind of watery
because even when you just go shaking it
up it like it doesn't really get blended
together or something it's a
dark-chocolate waterproof automatic eye
pencil I don't really see how this fits
in to this look because it's really kind
of a
subtle brown lights as eye pencil but it
almost makes me think of more of an
eyebrow type thing and another issue
with this is it really can be smudged
around a little bit it doesn't totally
set but one thing's for sure this kit
was really a lot of fun and just the
inspiration that you get from this kind
of a look I think it's just really fun
to play with it and do something
different now and then like the
philosophy that's inside the cover of
the box that says be willing to make
mistakes but don't beat yourself up over
them have fun and that's what makeup
should be I hope you guys had fun
watching this look if you're a big
RuPaul fan um this might be something
that you want to collect and have you
know but as far as the best quality
makeup in the kit it was definitely the
colorful stuff like the eyeshadows the
blush and the gloss but I had tons of
fun making this fierce look so thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
