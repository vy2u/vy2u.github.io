with me for this video I just wanted to
hop on and do some kind of like product
updates with you in a lot of cases it's
some things that didn't really work for
me the first time around like when I
first got these products and started
using them I may have even mentioned
them in a video that I wasn't super
impressed by them or in some cases
they've been so ho-hum they just haven't
come up at all because I was kind of
shopping my stash lately and finding
some things that I wanted to get use out
of I realized that some of these
products I actually really like and if
you use maybe a little different brush a
little different method or whatever you
can really change the way they go on so
yeah I'll just jump right in and start
explaining the first product I mean I
wouldn't say I so much have this huge
transformative method for making it ten
times better or something I just hadn't
picked this product up in a while and I
think it might be just changes in my
skin that have made me appreciate it
more I guess and it's the l'oreal
infallible pro glow I was never really
super against this foundation when I
first got it but now I think my skin is
really really even I don't have a lot of
discoloration to cover up and I just
think this looks really beautiful on and
I've been a fan of the concealer that
goes in this line as well not so much
the powder still can't get on board with
that powder that's like the split pan
and half has a little bit of shimmer and
half not I'm not really sure what's
going on there I have this in the shade
natural beige and I do like putting it
on with this little guy which I have
used so much um it's the pro mini
flawless airbrush from Sephora and this
was like a Rouge perk type item but I
know they sell this in a full size brush
also and I use this all the time I think
maybe it's the combination if this just
being really good for me right now
coverage wise and then the smaller brush
like sort of enhances what coverage this
product has so just kind of a random
thing there but I picked that up again
really liked it also and I've been using
this primer a lot with almost anything
but this primed and peachy cooling matte
skin perfecting primer I really like
that alongside this product this says
matte that says glowy but they work
really well together and I just feel
like I had a good staying power okay
here's another thing these Fenty sticks
which of course this was all addressed
in depth in the Fen
review video but the matchsticks which
they magnetized together that's always
gonna be fun but I mentioned that these
are kind of dry and they tugged across
my skin as I applied them and I just
wasn't super impressed with the finished
look either because I thought the
dryness was showing and one of these
like I got the matchstick stria one of
them is like a glowy highlight then the
two that I felt I particularly needed
the help with were the shade and linen
and amber I had the trio and light so
linens gonna be the shade I use like as
under-eye concealer brightener basically
and then amber is what I'm using to
contour with and people had suggested in
my comments section of that video to try
it with a facial oil and so I love argan
oil I've got that downstairs but what I
have handy up here is this far Sally
rose gold elixir so I think any kind of
facial oil here's the way I did it I
didn't really mix the stuff out on my
hands I just dabbed the oil over the
spots where I knew I was gonna apply
this stick it doesn't take a lot by the
way just a little additional oil will
make these products slip right on and
also when you're done and you've got
them all blended in those areas look so
much more hydrated and what the contour
it was just about kind of like ease and
sweeping the product on you know it
happened so much more easily the
blending happened faster so again I used
that Pro Mini flawless airbrush for the
concealer part and then I love my Real
Techniques contour brush to handle any
kind of cream contour shade that works
really well but I was glad to make these
work because I love the shades I think
they're really really good shades
another thing and this you know I
wouldn't normally like demo these two
side-by-side but I wanted to mention
them both in the same video I got this
product from Catrice and it's called
camouflage cream and this is the one
called wakeup effect and this is you
know one of those peachy concealers and
I remember thinking maybe this is gonna
be a lot like my erase paste for Benefit
and it's actually quite a bit lighter I
don't know this might be comparable to
their lightest shade but it ended up
being like this super light peach I
ordered this online so I wasn't really
sure what I was getting um texture wise
it is creamy I wouldn't say it's maybe
adds creamy as benefit erased paste but
it's definitely a workable texture
doesn't go on feeling too dry and for me
to correct dark circles it's a little
bit light it doesn't
actually camouflage them but in terms of
a brightener like further out on the
cheek it's amazing and I know this video
because I just use the Fendi thing it
won't exhibit this as fully as I would
like to but I'm still gonna show you
anyway instead of popping this on the
caverns of my eye which you know
benefiting Ray's space it's gonna take
something else to tackle that I'd a bit
more on the outer part like top of my
cheek area and it's a beautiful
brightener there it's like really really
nice so for me I guess rather than
casting us aside and being like oh it's
not gonna correct my under-eye circles
which is what I had done for several
months here I'm realizing that it can be
a great brighten or elsewhere on the
face so if you haven't tried that you
might give it a go here's another thing
these NARS liquid blushes when they say
liquid blush like that is so exactly
what these are they are not like a thick
cream or a mousse they are straight-up
liquid it's gonna pump out and it's
going to like actually run down your
hand if you turn your hand it's very
very thin and I'd heard like nothing but
great things about these I've got him in
all the shades Nora sent these to me and
I've been playing with them on and off
and I just felt like it was kind of
bothersome like the product was pretty
but the application was not like
flawless for me and I was of course at
first relying on my ELF small stipple
brush which I love for all kinds of
cream things and it just gives a really
light application it doesn't apply too
much pressure on the skin but I don't
think this is the perfect brush for this
product so sorry elfs most double brush
I still love you but it's just not right
for this exactly for me anyway I think
for as liquidy and thin yet super
pigmented as this product tends to be
and I'm holding it here in the shade
Dolce Vita so this is like a rich rosy
color this kind of streaks it out just a
little bit like there are so many little
ends to this brush and while it does
give nice lightweight application it was
a little - streaky for me so I would say
find a synthetic brush that's like just
a normal blush brush like this one from
Wet n Wild super affordable I pumped
some of the product out onto my hand
spread it out a little bit so you're not
like globbing up a ton on your brush at
once just lightly dip your brush in and
then blend it in like normal blush on
your cheeks and it's gorgeous and this
is such a dense and soft brush it's like
it's going to be even application on
your cheeks the look I came away with I
think is so fresh and so pretty and this
is indeed a wonderful product in a
gorgeous shade it just needs the proper
brush here's another brush situation I
got into this Too Faced peach blur this
product like I do feel like I understand
it I mean it is a finishing powder it's
very light when you touch it like you
don't see so much product on your skin
but you do feel it like it feels very
smoothing and just a light amount of
color and when I did my peach video I
just felt like this wasn't doing enough
I didn't feel like I was seeing enough
effect out of it
and what I think this needs is a more
dense brush for me a dense brush and
like a sweeping motion across the skin
and then I do see this sort of perfected
smooth look to the skin I'm still not
saying this particular product is like
an absolute essential for everybody
because I'm thinking about stuff like
Milani prep set and glow which is sort
of along the lines of this but I think
maybe does an even more effective job
but if you've got this and you're just
considering like how can I best make
this work I have this brush from Real
Techniques and I believe this is the
blush brush it says 300 on it and it's
from their bold metals line and I always
felt like it was a little dense for
blush but I really pick up some product
like I make an effort to really get some
on there and then just sweep it across
the skin and I swear I do see it's kind
of a blurring effect a little bit of a
soft matte I would say it's like a mix
of matte in the most soft pearly glow I
guess might be the best way to put it if
you're thinking about a product like
this just get this one it's more
affordable and it works no matter what
just some observations there that's kind
of what this video is about just sharing
a few findings I have had some new it
cosmetics products on my hands for some
time now and one of them is this brow
power powder if you're familiar with
their brow power pencil it's kind of
like a universal brow pencil they make
it in the shade called transforming
taupe and so now they've basically taken
that shade and they've put it into a
powder and I think brow powders by the
way are very very beginner friendly I
think if you are just starting
with trying to familiarize yourself with
how to even out and kind of perfect your
brows I think a powder is one of the
safest ways to start out because you're
gonna get the softest look you can
experiment with different shades and
different brushes but you're going to
get a much softer effect than you are
with pencil because wouldn't you'll
agree like when you're grabbing a pencil
out it takes a little time to understand
how to really lightly and effectively
use a brow pencil the instinct at first
might be to press a little harder and
use it heavier than you need so powders
can be great and this one this
transforming taupe this shade can work
in brows as dark as mine it really can
but I felt like when I just used this
powder I was not getting an even enough
look and it wasn't lasting very well not
to mention the fact that my brows are
pretty full and they can kind of go in
all directions and I need something with
a little more hold so I grabbed this
little wax pencil and multiple brands
put these out I've got mine from wet and
wild
I think Milani makes one I know honest
hacia makes one but what it is is just a
literal pencil of wax like if you've
seen brow palettes that have a little
pot of wax this is just that in pencil
form so before you ever pick up that
brow powder just put this through your
brows just go all over wherever there's
hair and then go into your powder and
you'll find that it clings better
you've got actual hold happening in your
brows it lasts throughout the day like
there's so many benefits to combining
this powder with a wax stick another
product that I really don't - after
using that bite champagne discovery kit
if you haven't seen my bite reviews by
the way on the holiday kits I reviewed
three by holiday kits in one every
holiday season I try to review the bite
stuff ASAP because I'm very concerned
about it selling out and I want you guys
to know about it so one of those kits
included one of their cream lip glosses
and it was a beautiful champagne color
had a lot of pop on the lips and you
might remember me saying I have the
oyster pearl shade and I didn't feel
like I could make this one work well I
think I was trying it on top of shades
that were too light like light berry or
light mauve rosy kinds of shades that
just weren't meshing with this it wasn't
showing off the brilliance of this shade
what it takes to
make this shade show up I think and look
it's most beautiful is a really dark lip
color so now that we're getting into the
season of darkness on lip colors I'm
starting to figure out the situation
where this can be beautiful so for
example today I'm wearing Glastonbury
from the Charlotte Tilbury line this was
a shot by stash item 2 so I've got this
shade on all over my lips this is a
matte lip color and then you see this
bite shade it's so hard to describe I
mean I glanced at it it looks moth it
looks taupe it's got a little bit of a
bluish reflectivity to the sparkle in
there a little bit of silver even but
you'd add that in the center of your lip
and it is so gorgeous with this dark
color like it adds so much brilliance I
already loved this lipstick but I feel
like I like it ten times more with this
gloss on top like that's so so pretty
and you could certainly like go all over
your entire lip do you guys know I love
the impact of just center of the lower
lip with a gloss of that kind so yeah
that's my video guys just some products
that may have been kind of either
average or in the I don't think I liked
it category but you work with it a
little more you do some tweaks in the
application he'd actually turned them
into really workable products and my
friend David and I had kind of discussed
this idea on and off about dud to stud
like this was a series I wanted to do
and I was thinking about calling this
that I think now as you've seen me go
through these products they weren't
necessarily dud products to begin with
they weren't totally over on that end of
the spectrum where they weren't workable
I mean like for example this NARS blush
this is a beautiful product I just
personally hadn't yet touched on exactly
the right way to put it on and so now
that I have I'm sharing that No maybe
misunderstood - stud is what I could
call this video but I hope this helps
some of you guys and it might just
inspire you to think about some of the
products you have in a little different
way but thank you for your time and I
will see you very soon bye Oh many more
holiday reviews are on the way this
lorac pro 4 I am absolutely going to be
reviewing that I have just I've had to
wear it I've had so many questions about
that palette but you can't have a
palette that large and not take days to
try it over and over again with
different looks because if there's so
much in there so I did a little quick
look with it again today I'm just kind
of trying to get a feel for everything
and my review will be out on that very
very soon I assure you
so thanks again guys I'll see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
