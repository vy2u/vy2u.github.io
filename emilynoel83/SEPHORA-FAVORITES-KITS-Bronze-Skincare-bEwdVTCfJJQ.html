video I'm going to be talking about
these Sephora favorites collections that
I got recently I have the one that's
called bronze bears all I also have a
skincare sampler called power of the
pedal but I just wanted to tell you a
little bit about what's in these boxes
what I thought of them these particular
kits that I got $40 is the highest
priced one so I think it's a nice way to
get a good amount of product to sample
from higher end brands they could also
be a really nice gift II thing this time
of year for a graduate or you know
whatever you might be celebrating
because you just really don't see quite
as many gift oriented options you know
for makeup kids this time of year so
talking about the bronze bears all kit
first there are eight things in here a
lot of makeup products but there is a
nail polish and also a tanning product
the tanning thing is the one thing in
here that I haven't tried yet and it's
from Vita Liberata I think that's how
you say it it's called
a phenomenal lightest heir to the 2 to
3-week tan mousse so I'm kind of excited
about this because it is a mousse and I
have myths from when I've used my San
Tropez tanning mousse and I really like
the mousse like format I thought it went
on really well so I will be giving that
a try but I just haven't yet this is the
way the stuff comes in the box and
you'll see I have a few things in here
and still because these are items I
already had in my collection so I wasn't
gonna bust into what was new in this kit
but you do get a marvelous Moxie gloss
in the full-size and that's in the shade
called trailblazer and I'm wearing that
along with the lipstick that comes in
this kit so I already had this in the
mini sized but this is like a peachy
gloss with a little golden shimmer if
you're not familiar with the bare
minerals marvelous Moxie formula it is
kind of minty you feel sort of I don't
want to say a tingle on your lips but
it's just very cooling when you put it
on so I'm wearing that on top of this
Tarte Park Avenue princess Amazonian
butter lipstick so I didn't have this
already this was new to me and it's a
nice kind of a sheer nude type lipstick
I feel like I have to build it up quite
a bit to get the color on my lips but I
do love the look of
paired with a lipliner so a lipliner
that might be slightly deeper like my
Milani spice liner looks really nice
with that very creamy and very
comfortable but today all I'm wearing is
this lipstick and this gloss on top and
I think it's a really nice kind of nude
lip now a couple of the face products
you're getting in here is a NARS Laguna
bronzer and Becca opal shimmering skin
Perfector and I think these are pretty
generous sizes you know even though
they're not full size there's quite a
bit to sample there and I already had a
Laguna actually in a sample size and I
have the full-sized opal so that's kind
of what I'll be talking about and
gesturing with and I tell you what you
probably haven't heard me talk a lot
about Laguna bronzer just because for me
I was looking at my bronzer collection
I've just got a lot of drugstore
bronzers that I really like so I haven't
necessarily become too clingy
to the Laguna but I know a lot of people
love it and I am wearing it today kind
of as a contour I put it around my
hairline as well it's nice you know it
seems to have like a little bit of
shimmer like you look really closely at
the compact and I can see just a little
bit but then I put it on my skin and it
basically performs like a matte so if
you haven't tried this and you haven't
you know sprung for the full-size I
think it's a really nice value what
comes in this kit and then you also get
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector in
opal and this is probably one of my
favorite shades in the shimmering skin
perfecter line I think this kind of
color wears really beautifully on the
skin because it definitely has
brightness it has life it really catches
the light it's very pigmented and bold
but yet I don't feel like it's as if I'm
putting a streak of white frost on my
skin you know there's just enough of
like that soft kind of maybe a little
bit golden golden might not be the right
word to use but there's just something a
little bit like baiji mixed in with this
that makes it I think really wearable on
the skin so my kind of face color that
I've got on today I've got the NARS
Laguna bronzer I have on benefit
coralista blush and then over the top of
that I've got the opal and I just kind
of dusted the opal pretty liberally all
over my skin and I also went ahead and
put this on the eyelids a little bit as
well and my brow bone highlight and I
used the NARS Laguna in the crease so
that kind of leads me into the next
product which is a full-size Laura
Mercier caviar stick and this is in the
shade copper and I use this as kind of
an eye base it doesn't really do it
justice for what this shade is because
it's absolutely a beautiful color here
look at the way that catches the light
this beautiful rose gold and these are
really cool because you know you have
that time to blend them out smudge them
out but I find that they do set and even
though this has a lot of like metallic
sheen it still does set for me I've got
a couple of other sticks from this line
and they just glide on super smooth very
very easy it would be a very quick like
no-brainer look to just take this all
over your lid and leave it at that and
maybe put a little crease color like
this Laguna really makes a nice crease
shade I think to another eye product
that's in here that I was really excited
about is the Smashbox always sharp
waterproof cold liner and this is in the
shade Penny Lane so it's kind of a brown
with a little bit of a golden shimmer
and oops I just kind of buried the lead
there I took this off and didn't even
think about it but what every time you
unscrew that cap the tip of your liner
gets sharpened and like taken to a
really fine pointed tip and that's
awesome and this is totally like I don't
know cause this to be a rediscovered
thing for me because I own a lot of
these Smashbox liners that I got in a
different kit a while back and they're
really good they go on very smoothly I
had a lot of shimmer on my lids and I
felt like I still got an impact out of
this liner so there's the swatch kind of
a deep brown with a golden e kind of
rose gold shimmer in it so really cool
liner to have if you want you know to
step it down a notch from just the
straight-up black liner I'm really
liking it today it's a more subtle look
on my eyes but very much enjoying that
and definitely going to be using more of
my pencil liners in this always sharp
format so that leaves the Sephora
formula X nail color that comes in here
and this is
shade I had on my nails like full on
maybe a week or so ago and then it
eventually started to chip on me so I
redid it and it's so flashy and pretty
it says revved-up in rose gold metallic
and it is awesome for giving you full
color in one coat this is only one coat
I love that I loved how quickly it dried
to like those are two Biggie's for me
for a nail polish if you can give me
full color one coat dry very very fast
you're gonna be like my best friend but
this kind of shade I think is awesome
because it it isn't full on gold it also
isn't totally silver it looks good with
a lot of the different jewelry I wear
and just matches anything looks a little
more finished than no nail polish at all
so loving that that might be one of my
favorite little discoveries in this kit
so bottom line
very happy with the bronze bears all kid
it's $40 the only thing I hadn't tried
like I said yet is this sunless tanner
but all the other makeup products I was
really happy with anything that's
downsized like the Tarte lipstick the
Becca highlight the NARS bronzer you
know there's still kind of generous
sizes as far as the sample goes and then
you've got like a full-size gloss
full-size caviar stick full-size
eyeliner so I think it's a really good
value if you like things in the bronzy
color family and you might really enjoy
that now the next thing that I got I
adore this kit this is the power of the
petal skincare powered by plants fruits
and flowers set and I was looking on
Sephora's website and I didn't see this
on there but I thought I'm gonna talk
about it anyway because I have seen
Sephora favorite sets go out of stock
and then come back in so like with the
new lip kit I remember trying to get
that I couldn't get it and then finally
it came back so I'm just going to give
you my thoughts on this and if nothing
else maybe the individual reviews on the
products that are in here will help you
out but I hadn't used anything in this
kit before I think high-end skincare is
a great thing to have the opportunity to
sample because you know these things
individually are going to cost you
significant
more than say a drugstore item might and
you really kind of want to find out like
does this work with my skin does my skin
have some sort of reaction to this does
this give me the result I hope for so
for $38 I think it's pretty cool to be
able to test these out so there's one of
these things that I haven't used yet and
it's the fresh black tea instant
perfecting mask I totally should have
done this last night while I was
watching Bates Motel but it says
advanced antioxidants immediately
reveals softer firmer skin and this is
what it looks like it's super creamy it
looks like some sort of I don't know
thick pudding thick vanilla pudding or
something so I'm excited to try that I
think that'll be fun this rose stem cell
cleanser really attracted me to this kit
because I have quite a few Peter Thomas
Roth skin care items that I love from
both the Rose line and the cucumber line
by the way the cucumber foaming cleanser
it's called like cucumber detox or
something so good smells amazing and my
skin always feels soft after that so
it's like I wonder how the Rose stem
cell bio repair cleansing gel will
compare and it definitely has that rosy
scent that the mask has the row stem
cell mask that I've used a law says
repairs renews illuminates skin five
perfect reparative Rose stem cells for
Rose extracts with collect colic acid
help repair the signs of aging skin and
this is for all skin types and I just
now use this this morning and you know
the Rose scent just loved that
absolutely loved the experience of just
cleansing with this and I also liked how
it's a gel cleanser and sometimes I find
with certain gels maybe it's just
different drugstore ones that I've used
so I'll dry my skin off and it feels
very tight this my skin just felt really
soft and clean but not at all over dried
or tight or anything like that so I'm
going to love using this guide and it's
a two fluid ounce size so that could
totally go in your travel bag any of
these things could you know go in your
carry-on bag if you're flying as far as
moisturizers go I feel like you're
getting kind of three levels of moisture
to me
I think the lightest weight one is this
la Henrickson shear transformation for
all skin types it makes me think of a
gel cream it looks white and creamy but
in
immediately like just goes to an almost
liquefied State on the skin I could
totally see this working for someone who
is on the more oily side and it says you
can use it AM or PM but just keep in
mind from what I can see there's no SPF
in that the award for the cutest
packaging in this set is this little guy
from LOX eaten it is the goodness Pavan
Selim cream Perfector it says perfecting
cream here on the back and you're
getting 0.28 ounces of it and this is
one where the scent is so real it I feel
like I'm smelling something I've smelled
time and time again like if you go
outside after its rained and you take a
whiff of a real flower that's out there
in your backyard like it's that kind of
scent soft soft floral but very real not
artificial seaming in any way and I love
the consistency of this cream like for
me at nighttime I think this is a great
option because it's not like a balm it's
not like super thick and feeling like
you're kind of suffocating your skin but
it offers so much moisture it's so rich
and creamy definitely a step up
moisturize from the LA Henriksen but
this is probably the moisturizer from
the kit that I have worn the most and I
just really like the way it smooths out
my skin feels awesome and then this oil
this is a Basha oil it's the Tsubaki
beauty oil it says on here and this is
one of the more like moisturizing
intense kind of thick oils that I've
used I used it one morning under makeup
and I thought it was a bit much and then
I tried it last night before bed and I
think it's more of a nice like intensive
nighttime hydrating treatment I think
it's super dry skin would love something
like this I need to use it a lot more to
tell you like any results that I've seen
on my skin but so far I think one of my
favorites in this kit other than the
rose stem cell is this oh wait there's
another thing I like to the Tata Harper
hydrating floral essence this says
moisturizing toner it's just like a nice
facial mist you can use it says spray
three to four pumps over face and neck
use throughout the day for instant
hydration I I think this is great first
off this little mini sized sprayer it's
perfect fine mist and the scent you know
lightly floral I almost get a little bit
of a like it what am i smelling there
it's like floral but with a little bit
of spice what is that it's not heavy at
all but it's really refreshing that's a
lot of mists will do it helps take away
the powdery appearance of my makeup but
scent wise and just the experience of
putting it on it's really giving my
glossy a soothing basement with the
rosewater and in it it's definitely
giving that kind of a run for its money
because I love the smell of this and
then the last thing in here is a pretty
good size for an eye cream of this
totally premier cru eye cream so I've
been wearing this pretty much every day
morning and night it's one of those
things where I like it I don't know if
it sets itself apart enough from another
eye cream that I really like from the
drugstore which is the Sarah the eye
Repair Cream that stuff I always feel
like it offers the moisture but it
doesn't get the area greasy and this
doesn't really either but I don't know
I'm a little torn on it maybe I just
need to keep using it more it's one of
those things that I used and I think
okay it's good but is it great but again
my top three from this set would be the
lock seat on we'll just call it the
cream Perfector love the Peter Thomas
Roth rose gel and then the hydrating
floral essence really good stuff and
this is the way everything looks in this
kit so you give that somebody it's a
really nice presentation the plasticky
part does totally come out if you wanted
to store other things in this box but
very nice well done Sephora favorites so
that is my experience with these Sephora
favorites samplers love love loved the
skincare one I think it was just really
useful to get to sample so many skincare
things but the bronze bears all is right
up there with it because I love the
quality of the different products in
there I love that so many full-size
things were thrown in for $40 so thank
you guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
