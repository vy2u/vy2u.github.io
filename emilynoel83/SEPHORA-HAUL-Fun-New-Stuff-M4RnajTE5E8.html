and here's a story with this video I'm
going to be a super casual little
Sephora haul not a massive haul but I've
got some kind of interesting little sets
of things that I came up with on the
website and also a big splurge as well
so I'm going to share that with you and
yeah I've been sick for the last couple
days with a cold cuz I'm sitting down
shooting this it is what time is it
11:00 after 6:00 in the morning
I was up at 4 a.m. feeding ease and I
start coughing just like can't stop
coughing and you know you got this baby
almost lulled to sleep in your lap and
you can't stop coughing it's like I've
got to get this baby put down and get
out of the room so I don't disturb you
no longer feel like I can fall back and
sleep at this point even though I
probably should be getting sleep I'm
like I'm just going to get some coffee
and go upstairs and do something
productive a bit eager to shoot this
haul for several days now so I'm excited
to get to it that's for the sake of time
getting things done my hair isn't really
done today
but I am wearing a super cute shirt look
at this don't you love that I had
discovered this shirt on Instagram and I
was like I need that now I'm two for two
on girls anyway what you came for was a
Sephora haul right so I'm going to get
into that ok here's one thing I got this
vibes vibes vibes set from milk makeup I
had never tried anything from milk
makeup and this had four of their little
sticks in here I get the feeling this
brand is all about like convenience and
ease and kind of natural look type stuff
these are the four little sticks that
you get in there just mini sized sticks
and you also have a bunch of these
samples of sunshine skin tint like all
the shades it seems like as for the
sticks the one that looks like a little
bit bluish here is called cooling water
and you can really see through on this
one like how much product you're getting
it's just like that top part of the
stick this is really smooth very
slippery it does feel cooling and the
description says apply around eyes to
Dee puff apply to neck face body to cool
and refresh the time in the whole makeup
routine that I see myself using this is
like after eyes
moisturized and maybe I want a little
added hydration / coolness on the eye
area I can whip this on real quick but
there are a couple of other things from
other brands that I have been using
lately that feel exactly like this like
today I put the milk under one eye and
also just elsewhere on the face for a
little extra moisture and there's this
elf prep and hydrate balm there's also
this hard candy sheer envy coconut water
primer stick these feel exactly the same
as the milk one does you know they slip
on they do feel cooling this elf prep
and hydrate balm I swear this is like
that studio daily moisture stick that I
raved about in the past and it's like
they just kind of repackaged it tinged
it blue it seems like because it's got
the same sort of claims like shea
vitamin e very moisturizing feels like a
very similar product there and then the
hard candy again they all sort of look
the same I mean I could use these more
and probably give you a closer
comparison with time if you'd like that
but I just just something I noticed
right away another thing that's in this
kit is the blur stick and I haven't
actually watched any videos about the
blur stick but I have seen I guess a lot
of interest in the blur stick and I've
had people ask me about it as well and
so that just looks like this little
beige makeup stick here and to me it has
the consistency it reminds me of if they
took benefit Porefessional and
solidified it into a stick this is what
it would feel like it's got a little
dryness to it and if you take it
directly to the skin like my first
instinct was to just go around my nose
and the sides of the nose and just swipe
it on there
it does have some dryness to it it
doesn't apply like ultra smoothly it's
like you go from the cooling water stick
which just sweeps on like nobody's
business and then this has a little more
pull I do feel like the blur stick
mattifies my skin like underneath makeup
I used it kind of like a primer for the
t-zone and right at the onset I could
tell I wasn't seeing my pores quite as
much and it does say swipe all over the
face for a matte blurred finish can use
a loan or act as a primer under makeup
but did it make a big difference like
once the makeup was on am I seeing a
remarkable
Princeton like the surface of my skin in
the areas where I applied it I'm not so
sure that I am this is probably my
fourth or fifth time using it I don't
really think that's quite enough because
different products go on top of things
differently there are so many
combinations out there so that's going
to take some time to really understand
whether or not it's working but there
are a couple of like color cosmetics in
this kit as well there's a matte bronzer
stick and then the lip and cheek stick
in the shade perk and this is a really
pretty kind of corally pink nice like
bright cheery poppy type color and I did
use the matte bronzer stick as my
contour today and me it really feels
like the type of bronzer color that can
just double as a contour really easily
and it is matte I swiped it on like
right from the stick and then I use my
little Real Techniques contour brush to
blend it out and it does blend very
easily you know I have no complaints
about that really it's not necessarily
the kind of thing I see myself seeking
out like oh I need that product in the
full-size but it worked well enough I
did think this lip and cheek color was
just gorgeous so that's my blush today
and let me tell you this space needed
some blush after you know being sick you
just kind of need that little pick-me-up
I feel like it might have just a little
bit of a satiny finish there but there's
that pre Coralie look and as with most
like lip and cheek duo products I like
them better on the cheeks than the lips
just because this feels a little bit
drying once it's blended in on the lips
and I just need moisture moisture
moisture today but on the cheeks I think
it's gorgeous and it didn't really leave
too much of a rant of you or attacking
this behind same with the bronzer stick
as well so all in all I do think it's a
fun little kit to experiment with I'm
very glad that I got these products in
the small sizes because I just don't see
myself probably going through them
quickly enough to constitute a full size
and nothing's especially blowing me away
enough to make me feel like I need the
full size you know I'm saying so that's
the little vibe 5 budge kit from milk
you know it's funny every time I say
milk these days I make a conscious
effort to say it milk because my mom and
I think a tiler too used to tease me
about always saying it like milk like I
would always say
milk or pillow I would say those words
like there was an e in them instead of
an I like oh the brand is milk no it's
milk it's also pink but I can't quite
say pink like some people say some
people think like it's like pink a lot
of times I say pink I say pink where is
this video going my friends I don't know
the splurge that I spoke of at the start
of this video is a new visor palette
visi art I don't know I got the warm max
you guys it's just it was speaking to me
it was like pulling me into the screen
your palate just looks so good and I am
glad I have it I will say that I think
it's beautiful I love the looks I've
done with it I'm wearing it today let me
just point out what I'm using mostly
today this is kind of my soft crease
like above the crease blending it out
color I've got a mix of this gorgeous
cranberry color here and it's dark brown
that's kind of my outer corner but I did
it pretty lightly I did this look very
fast I've got some of this like smudged
on my lower lash line this shade while
it didn't necessarily impress the pants
off a man a swatch I love the way the
light shades in this visor art palette
and another one I'm going to mention
here I love the way the light shades
apply they're so intense so I have this
like on my innermost corner and as my
highlight I've only worn this palette a
couple times so far obviously if you're
not into the warm neutrals like don't
get it it's very very warm I don't
really feel like I'm to the point where
I can say yes it's wholeheartedly worth
the money or no it's not I'm still kind
of trying it out but here's something I
got to tell you guys I have the regular
neutral palette or what's it called
neutral mask regular neutrals this is
the neutral matte and I never actually
purchased this this was given to me by
Kristin game now let me give you a sense
of how Kristin game is this is how she
rolls okay she's amazing I love her she
sent me a wonderful Christmas gift and
then like threw this in because she
thought she heard me talk about this she
already had this she said I haven't
really used it a lot so thought you
might want it I was joking with her when
I opened I was like oh
just throw-in that visor palette on top
of everything but she's so amazing so
generous and I really like this too and
the interesting thing is this this
offers some warm I mean you see this
orange II kind of like terracotta shade
in there and this color up here this
peach offers a lot more punch than it
might even appear so you have warmth in
this palette and you have cool kind of
smokiness with this one really all
you've got is the warm stuff and it
doesn't get as incredibly dark as this
palette does with the matte black and
the matte Brown so as it stands now I
feel like this is kind of the better
value because I was able to get a really
nice warm look with this as well but I
still like this I might have to bust out
some kind of really in-depth comparison
video there if you're into it I love
using hulls as a way to gauge what
people are actually into so I appreciate
your comment another thing that I got
was a new lash curler and while many
things that I buy makeup-wise do not
come under the heading of being needs
they're much more like once this would
be more like a need I think because well
I really like my Tarte lash curler this
is served me well I've enjoyed it there
are times when I feel like I really got
to make a lot of effort to hit my
outermost lashes right here like it
won't always pick it up and especially
if I'm in a hurry
it's like it's not going to go there
it's just going to grab the easiest
lashes to get so I was looking through
the last rollers on Sephora site and I
saw this one by tweezerman and it said
pro curl lash curler effective for most
eyes shapes
ideal for round eyes Plus this has an
allure VESA Beauty Award winner for 2016
and it's a beautiful shade of rose gold
and there's a little thing floating
around in here I don't know if you can
see there's like 1 2 3 extra little pads
in there I've never seen that many
extras given but it says narrower top
bar ideal for round eyes I think they're
talking about this right here I don't
consider myself to have exceptionally
round eyes but maybe they're a little
more round than a lot of
eyelash curlers cater to I suppose
because as soon as I use this the very
first time not even really trying to pay
that much attention I stuck it on my
lashline I felt like it was hitting my
entire lashline really well if you feel
like a lot of lash curlers just aren't
getting every lash this might be
something to look into
because it just really worked well and I
love the sponginess
of the thingamajig here the rubbery bit
what do we want to call this that thing
see how as I squeeze it kind of sinks in
just a little bit that's what really
helps my curl resistant lashes get a
good curl in them is when there is a
little something to squish into there so
I love this you know it's not super
cheap but at the same time I think it's
got something special going on and I
feel like finding the right lash curler
it's sort of a you didn't know what you
were missing out on kind of moment you
know you feel like well this is just how
life curlers fit my lash line I guess
and you just sort of come to expect the
average but this is definitely like
awesome
Oh wonderful two minutes left yeah I'm
not going to have this thing wrapped up
in two minutes I got to go downstairs
unload my memory card a little bit and
come back well what do you know I also
found a hungry baby downstairs so I
unloaded two things I unloaded the
memory card and I loaded some milk now
the thrilling conclusion of this haul
actually I've got like four more things
to talk about here I got this mascara
sample here I don't know why this
particular mascara I hadn't heard
anything about it I just kind of laid
eyes on it button let's give it a go
it's a Sephora brand lash craft
lengthened Volume Mascara and so I've
used this one and I was not impressed
not impressed at all it is an
interesting little brush here because
it's like oh a lot see how it's kind of
flat when you look at it that way and
then oh yeah there's all the bristles so
that's what it looks like and I just
didn't think it did much for my lashes
at all it took two coats of this to do
what most even average mascaras give me
in one coat plus I was getting all
jacked up about how great that lash
curler was and I put
some of this on I'm like oh start to
take the curl away like it you know even
a good lash curlers work can be undone
by a mascara that might be too heavy or
just you know whatever it is about the
consistency is straightening out the
lashes again baby hair is just but this
was just kind of a Miss mascara for me I
gotta say now for lips I have three
different little lip kit type things you
know things that I thought were a better
value than just vine one lip product one
thing from fight they have this little
perfect pear set and I love the way they
put this together because they put in
one color that's a total home run for me
a shade I know for sure I'm going to
like and then another shade that really
I don't think I own in my collection so
the color like that that I'm speaking of
here is thistle and I was wearing this
on snapchat and Instagram not too long
ago and it's a very like grey little
hint of lilac in there little bit of
dusty pink maybe and I found it to be a
very interesting shade and this is their
amuse-bouche formula which is very
luxurious very rich creamy has some
shine on the lips especially right after
you apply them and these are the small
size by the way you're getting minis
here but I really like that and I was
surprised by it and it's a unique shade
for me like I said and then the other
color in this duo is rhubarb and that
was the shade that I thought would be
the homerun that's the color I'm wearing
right now yeah it is gorgeous classic
berry totally at my alley so I think
they had some other duo options
available but this again is the one in
rhubarb and thistle and another lift duo
that I got is this buxom lip plumping
persuasion kit and here you're getting
one of their full-on lip polishes which
I've tried plenty of those over the
years that was not really the reason why
I got this kit was more like the added
bonus but the shade you're getting there
is sandy I have not worn this one yet so
I will go ahead and swatch it looks to
be kind of a sheer pinky nude see all
that shine there and these buxom full-on
lip polishes tend to have a little bit
of a tingle but it's not a painful
tingle at all to me it's more like just
a pleasant kind of cooling
to type single but what I was really
wanting to try was the other thing
that's in this kit which is this product
right now and this is the mini wildly
whipped lightweight liquid lipstick in
laundress why do I want to try this
well buxom is under the bare essentials
umbrella
are they still right am i right on that
so I knew I love the bareMinerals Jin
nude liquid lipsticks sorry I'm like so
congested right now I know I don't sound
wonderful but I think those Jen nude
liquid lipsticks are like the most
comfortable best if matte liquid
lipsticks if that's what you're after
like I love that formula and so I
thought maybe if I got soup maybe if I
got into this buxom line I would be
opened up to a broader shade range and I
might like this as well well I guess
what I'm trying to say right now I tried
to wear this color today but my lips are
so dry like they are they've never been
this bad all winter long they are so
chapped from this cold like on the
inside the inner part of my lips the
outer part of my lip I put on some balm
I did some lip exfoliator they still
just didn't feel right like there's too
much dryness on the surface of my lips
so I couldn't really honestly feel the
texture of this enough from the little
bit I could tell it seems to be kind of
like the Jin nude but even more like
whipped a little more mousse like but
until my lips are in really good
condition I'm not going to be able to
get a good sense for the overall feel
and the staying power because like I
said I just feel like I've got this dry
like mask of lip on top of my regular
lips but let's swatch this color for you
so you can see that this is called
laundress and is a pretty pink it came
off as like a real match for my the
color of my shirt today I guess if you
wanted to you could layer the glossy
thing over this but for me in this kit I
see them as two distinct things I
wouldn't probably try to layer the gloss
over this product if I want Matt I'll
just go for that but when you got it
cold it's just not a matte liquid
lipstick time like no I need I need
creamy
I need nourishing another lip kit I
tried through the beauty the lip contour
set and this has the shaped trend
Center and bombshell of her liquid matte
lip colors and also this pencil that
says lip contour in trendsetter as well
and I was wearing this recently so I
will pop up a picture if I can find it
saved in my phone but basically here's
what they say to do you line your lips
in that sort of a pattern really mostly
around the perimeter but kind of
feathering it in with that trend setter
lip liner and then you apply a thin
layer of the trendsetter
liquid Mac and then the liquid matte in
bombshell at the center of your lips
what I didn't really understand is
whether or not you're supposed to let
that first layer totally set and I
gather that maybe you're not because it
sounds like you want that bombshell
shape you apply at the end kind of fade
in with everything so I don't like the
thought of kind of painting the second
color like getting it mixed in and then
putting it back in your tube you know
what I'm saying there but I did it I did
it for the sake of the look I wanted to
see if I can make it turn out and look
you know as good as it looks there and I
thought it did look nice definitely not
in love with this formula the liquid
matte though I'm not saying it's the
worst I've ever tried but it does remain
tacky you will continue to have this
feeling like pressing your lips together
that things are sticking just a little
bit and if you're really sensitive to
that kind of thing it might bug you but
that my friends is all for this haul
thank you so much for joining me I hope
this was fun for you I haven't done a
straight-up haul in a while so this was
fun for me even though it is very early
and I'm kind of sleep-deprived and I'm
kind of sick I'm still having fun
because this is fun to me thank you guys
again I hope you have an awesome day and
I will see you very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
