super excited about this video because
it's really a video that's kind of a
week-long project here slash challenge
and we're calling it the singles cruise
and the idea here is to get more use out
of these crazy eyeshadows singles that
are sitting around and you're always
tempted to grab for a palette and
different things like that and what
about the singles and this is going to
be a collaboration type thing with my
buddy Kristin game she's gonna be
challenged to do this to our friend
David actually challenged us both to try
this he's kind of our idea person you
know he's come up with a lot of great
ideas on my channel over the years and I
think he knew we've got a lot of these
eyeshadows singles floating around in
our collections so it's time we go ahead
and you stuff and maybe when this is all
said and done you all will be inspired
to use some of your neglected eyeshadows
singles as well so here's the way it
works these are the rules you're going
to sort out all of your shadow singles
no duo's no trios just single shades
into four separate bags one is going to
be light shadows one is going to be
medium mid-tone shadows one is going to
be dark shadows and then pop so your pop
of color really bright shades go in
their own bag and so I noticed as I went
through that process I had all kinds of
brands I even had some shadows in there
that I don't particularly love there are
some not so favorites but you know
they're part of the collections so
they're in there and each day for five
day is gonna grab one shadow from each
bag and that's gonna be the basis for
the look now according to David's rules
you can add in like any liners you want
any cream shadow bases or something like
that but as far as eyeshadows these are
going to be the ones that you'll be
working with and if you've really sorted
out your shadows properly you should
have enough of a range to make this
happen
we'll see if I say that at the end of
the week but yeah that's how this goes
I'm super glad that kristen is going
along with this dudes I've kind of got a
partner in crime here and you can check
out her channel I'll link to it below
and if you want if I Dave it online and
take a look at some of his work he is on
instagram at makeup underscore whisperer
alright so Monday day one gonna draw out
my shadows for you so you can see that
process go down I think there was some
concern from David about Kristin and I
knowing the feel of certain shadows that
we have so I'm really just going to
stick my hand in and pull the first
thing that I grab I'm not gonna be like
rummaging and feeling around because I
will be able to know what certain things
feel like so this is my bag of like
shadows I'm just gonna reach in and grab
I got one this is from L'Oreal and it's
one of those new color riche single and
the shade is 202 sunset my bag of medium
shades is rather robust I'm gonna reach
in here and grab one without hopefully
spilling too much oh this is a perfect
medium shade this is from Milani it's
0-4 in Bella cafe and this is my bag of
dark shadows so I'm going to reach in
there grab the first thing I get my
hands on oh it's in Ayane single this is
a brand available at Fred's super Dollar
y'all and this shade is called rodeo
it's a really rich dark brown with kind
of a satiny finish the interesting thing
is that in all my light medium and dark
bags I do have some colors in there you
know they're not maybe things I would
classify as a pop because those go in my
bag of pop sheds but so far everything
has been very very neutral so here's my
pop of color reach in there grab one out
okay we've got a turquoise vibe beyond
today this is from essence and the shade
is called jewel up the ocean and this is
a really shiny metallic light turquoise
so for the day one look I first took the
Milani Bella cafe shades so this is my
light neutral crease color and I just
blended that in my crease just getting
warmed up here with my Sigma e25 brush
and then I decided I really wanted to go
with this dark smokey vibe on the upper
lids so I took the ayane rodeo dark
brown color a little bit of satin finish
although it performs very matte on my
eyes and I patted that all over the lids
wet it up into the crease a little bit
and then I've got this shade this
L'Oreal single it's one of their newer
singles in the shade called sunset and I
gotta admit I
this is kind of the throwaway shade of
the look like it didn't offer very much
and so I thought it would just lightly
put this under the brow it barely shows
up and then I used a small brush trying
to sort of target that around my inner
corner and yet not much impact from that
shade wouldn't really recommend it and
then on my waterline I pulled in my
Smashbox always sharp liner in midnight
so a nice true blue there in I chose to
top that off with the essence kind of
light turquoise shimmery shadow and
don't be like oh no that's where she's
gonna put the pup every day I happen to
really like teal and turquoise on the
lower lash line with paired with brown
eyes I think it really helps the eye
color pop a lot and then just kind of a
finishing touch to the look I did choose
to shape my outer V a bit more with that
rodeo dark brown color and I finished it
off with some black liquid liner my
Jordana color Envy across the upper lash
line and I did covergirl super sizer on
the upper lashes covergirl clump crusher
on the lower lashes and the falsies are
our Adele whispies and this is the way
it's going to kind of go everyday this
week I had my foundation and powder and
a little bronzer on before I did the
eyes and then I definitely wanted to
gauge what the eye look would be before
I chose my blush in my lip color so once
I got this all put together I decided
for my blush to be this Too Faced love
flush blush and love hangover so it's
got a little bit of a coral eat peachy
pop there and then on the lips I went
over all kind of neutral nude I used my
Milani nude cream one of my favorite
nude lipsticks that has a little bit of
a pinky twist and then I mixed in on the
outsides my ELF matte lip color in the
shade praline and this I reached for
this a lot is kind of a nude lip mixer
type color so yeah that is the day one
look I would say I was pleased with
every shadow I used except the L'Oreal
one that was kind of a dud
I have pretty firm this line that we're
good but it seems pretty hit and miss
overall if you're going for L'Oreal
shadows go for the infallible singles
good morning and welcome to day two so
I'm going to draw out my shades that I
will be working with today
well that
or I can't see first thing I pulled out
oh it's a very frosty shade I put some
Silver's in my light bag and yeah that's
what I got I got tin from NYX my medium
shade will be first thing I touch oh my
oh they're really shiny jig but not
quite as light good lord this is laura
geller baked brulee eyeshadow in orange
blossom and it's a very yellowy kind of
sparkly golden color
we're going metallic today good news as
I know whatever I pull from the dark bag
is gonna be nice and dark but watch I'll
randomly pull out like a copper whoo
cool and I'm actually wearing a navy
shirt today this is the lorac eyeshadow
single and sapphire barely been used but
a very nice rich Navy shade remember
when lorac came out with like a set of
it might have been like a dozen singles
that's what that one's from my swag is
my pop of color and today it will be
another one of these Milani ones it's
the Bella Rouge shade in the Milani and
Bella eyes singles line that's what it
looks like here is how I achieved this
look I used my Milani eyeshadow primer
as I did the previous day first all over
the lids then I took the laura geller
orange blossom and i just patted that
all over the lids I decided that was
gonna be my lid pop today and then I
just took one tap into my lorac sapphire
and dabbed that on my outer corner it
was more than enough shadow for that
area and I dabbed it on there kind of
overlapped a little bit of the gold that
actually looked a teeny bit greenish at
times and also built that up into the
crease as well then I used an e 21
smudge brush just to get a little bit of
that Navy on the lower lash line then I
pulled in my pop which where isn't there
a pop with this look so far but the
Belarus shade from Milani I use that
with my wispy white ether t-6 brush from
Sigma just on the border of the look to
provide a little bit of a transition out
of that dark navy and then I use that
really shiny silver color just sort of
as a pop around the tear duct and also
very very lightly a
the brown and to finish the look I used
a nude liner on the lower inner rim
black liquid liner across the upper lash
line with as many colors as were
happening on this eye look I just wanted
that nice dark black line or blush I'm
wearing this makeup revolution baked
blush and make love instead and then on
the lips I'm wearing at colour-pop
lippie stix in babe wash so that's that
for my day to look all right everybody
here we are on day three it is Wednesday
it's gonna reach into my light bag first
okay I pulled out a L'Oreal infallible
single in the shade blinged and
brilliant so a nice kind of light
shimmery shade it's not crazy light but
it's definitely reflective I'm just
reaching and grabbing the first thing my
medium shade is this NYX glam shadow and
it's in the shade amber fire so this is
very shimmery and it's not really a far
cry from the last one but a little more
golden next up we're going to grab a
dark shade and today it is oh it's
another l'oreal infallible single this
is the one in golden emerald so a really
rich olive color and this one also does
have some shimmer I'm really hoping we
pull something matte pop of color
reach in and we have oh my gosh an even
more brilliant green color this is from
Kat Von D this is the shade called Iggy
I actually had this in my shop my stash
drawer and I hadn't used it yet so I'm
gonna be using it today and it is close
to my last one but a little bit more
bright since every shadow I pulled was
shimmery I decided to take the
opportunity to use a cream base I used
my Maybelline Color tattoo in creamy
beige and with my little Real Techniques
shading brush I just went all over the
lid and into the crease and then I
thought to add a little something to the
crease I had a hunch that this NYX glam
shadow in amber fire might actually
deepen up a little bit when it's not
hitting the light so I used that in my
crease and it did kind of work that way
it's a little sparkly and I promise
we'll get to the greens but we're just
laying some groundwork here I used the
blinged and brilliant infallible single
and I got that all up under my brow as a
highlight and then I also use that with
a small detail brush just right around
inner corner to brighten that up you
want some green upper liner so for kind
of a lighter base I pulled my color pop
pencil in teaspoon and I went all the
way across my upper lash line both sides
went for sort of a thick line and I also
did wing it out at the outsides because
I just while I knew this Kat Von D
shadow and Iggy was intense I still
wanted it to have a little something
extra to stick to so I used an angled
brush and I just dabbed right over the
top of where I put the green pencil and
I just loved the intensity of that look
then I took a black liner and this is my
plan all along to have kind of a thin
black line still defining my eyes so I
used the Jordana color Envy on my lower
lash line I used my Maybelline master
precise skinny just any black liner that
you like to wear in the waterline and
kind of smudged it a little bit on the
outside as well and then I took my
deeper more all of the agreeing with the
L'Oreal infallible single in golden
emerald and I just smudge that all
across the lower lash line so I was
still getting a kind of a smoky
definition there but it wasn't as bright
as the top liner and to finish the look
I used my covergirl super sizer mascara
on the upper lashes and my clump crusher
water-resistant on the lower lashes I
did not do false lashes because I really
I didn't want it to be too thick on that
upper lash line I wanted you to still be
able to see what was happening there
with the liner so this wasn't like my
gut instinct look when I thought I've
got these greens I just thought it was
gonna be a whole like super green look
but then I thought no let's try
something different than what you might
normally think to do and so I do think
the liner is fun and that is a fun way
to integrate a color while still keeping
it kind of wearable and as far as the
rest of my look both today and yesterday
for my foundation I was wearing the
almay aged essentials makeup this is a
new product that you may have seen in
the haul video blush today is the Milani
rose blush in the shade Coral Cove and
then on my lips I've got this NYX butter
gloss in the shade maple blondie so just
kind of trying to keep it light and easy
on the rest of the face since if you
really get a close look at the eyes
there is some nice green intensity there
so yeah this was a fun look although I
did pull out all shimmer it was kind of
a fun obstacle to try to work with so I
will see you tomorrow happy
Thursday although nobody's watching this
on a Thursday I'm joined by my friends
the makeup bag here and I'm just gonna
pull out the shadows that I will be
using today and yes these shadows that
I've previously picked have not been
going back into the bags this is a lorac
single in the shade called serenity a
little bit of a beige EP chi undertone
to it but very shimmery I did curls with
this medium bag
I would actually gain some muscle I
think I'm gonna drop my medium shade and
it is okay we've got a grayish color
it's Bella gray from this Milani line
yes I had a lot of these dark color of
the day will be gosh another one of
these NYX glam shadows but it's in the
shade sable so it is dark it's like a
very dark brown but it does have some
sparkle one of those kind of hard to
categorize shades because of how shiny
it still is but it's dark color today
will be ooh yay I was kind of hoping I
would get a purple look today this is
the L'Oreal infallible single and burst
into bloom I think this was limited
edition and I used the heck out of this
while this was available and hadn't used
it much sense but it's a gorgeous like
radiant orchid type color step one for
today's look I used my Milani eyeshadow
primer all over the lids and then I used
the L'Oreal infallible single and burst
into bloom and I just went full-on all
over the lids with my little Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush and I used my
Sigma e25 to get that all up in the
crease I sheared it up just above the
crease I really went big with this shade
because I know from experience it's a
great one shadow look so I just spread
that all over that entire area then I
used my lorac shadow in serenity and I
was hoping a little bit of the deeper
side of this shape would come out using
my 36 brush I just applied this kind of
like a transition on the border of the
purpley shade just to kind of warm it up
a little bit add a little different
twist I don't know that it shows that
much but it's a subtle effect then I
used on this L'Oreal silk kissimmee
liner in black on the lower inner rim
and I smudged that below the eye as well
a little bit of this liner will smudge a
long
it's a really soft nice liner and then I
used a different liner on the actual
lower lash line I used color pops frill
which is kind of a grayish silver with a
teeny bit of a lilac twist to it and I
topped that off with the Milani powder
shadow the Bella eyes in Bella gray so
it almost feels like a color-block this
look a little bit because I really kept
purple on top the grey on the bottom and
then I went ahead and lined across the
upper lash line with that pencil liner
and I used the NYX glam shadow in sable
just to sort of clean up that wing make
it a little more precise help it blend
down into the gray a bit more finish the
look I used almay one coat multi benefit
mascara on the upper lashes I used two
covergirl clump crusher on the lower
lashes and then I applied Salon perfect
lashes that style that's very
symmetrical and wispy that I've been
wearing a lot lately put those on and I
just love to have those framed this look
that was very you know purple all over I
just really enjoyed that effect and then
if anyone's curious my foundation today
I am trying a different foundation and I
feel like at least in my little camera
monitor here I can see the glow when I
turn my head it's the infallible Pro
glow from L'Oreal lots of questions
about that my blush today is my
covergirl soft mink classic color blush
that's kind of a neutral blush but it
has a little bit of a glow and then
throwback to an all-time favorite lip
product my Sonia Kashuk shine luxe sheer
pink luxe shade here it's kind of a
peachy nude it has tons of shine it
looks like lipstick and lip gloss mixed
together thanks for watching this look
and I'll join you for my last look
tomorrow hey guys it's Friday the
singles cruise is coming into dock and I
am just gonna grab out ooh that's a
Sally girl single in the shade called
snow I don't think they're selling the
Sally girl singles anymore but these
were some surprisingly good quality
product from the medium bag the shade of
the day is
oh it's matte it's from NYX and it's
matte and it's the color called um
skinny dip so we've got this nice plummy
shade that's you know definitely not too
light not too dark from the dark bag
today it will be oh yeah one of these
L'Oreal singles I think this one should
be better than the
and I pulled on the first day it's one
of the color riche singles this is in
the shade quartz it's a nice rich brown
it is deep but I think it has kind of a
satiny finish but not least pop of color
of the day is ooh yeah Kat Von D single
this isn't the shade paranoid yeah there
are definitely some of these in my pop
bag and this is a really fun like
electric blue alrighty the plan of
attack for this look I used my Milani
eyeshadow primer all over the lids then
I first went into the crease with my
Sigma e25 brush and the skinny dip shade
from NYX and this is a gorgeous color
actually it sheers out beautifully and
it gave me just the matte depth I was
after there in the crease to just kind
of get this look going then I knew some
brightness was coming so I wanted to go
ahead and pop on the white and then do a
little overlapping so I used snow from
sallygirl
and I put that on the lid first just
patted it around the inner corner and
then use that a little bit just under
the brow as well next up I took Kat Von
D's paranoid with my small shadow brush
from Sonia Kashuk just patted that all
over the lid took it right up to the
crease I didn't really pull it up into
the crease too much because I wanted
some of that plum to show but I just
wanted them to you know merge and kind
of blend at that point rather than muddy
that up in the crease or the outer
corner too much with a dark shade I
decided I just wanted the blue pop and I
would use my L'Oreal color riche shadow
in quartz on the lower lash line just
for a little smudgy smokey Brown liner
there I used my e21 smudge brush on the
lower lash line to finish off my look I
used a nude liner in the lower inner rim
I used honey dude from colour-pop right
in there to brighten it up and then I
went across my upper lash line with
black liquid my Jordana color Envy liner
I've been weighing out my liner a lot
lately so I decided not to do that today
use covergirl super sizer mascara on top
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
on the bottom and then I popped on these
lashes that I love the salon perfect 6
15 s and really this is all about doing
the peekaboo eye effect if that's a way
integrating color that you like this is
basically how to do it because you've
got your brightest shape confined to the
lid and then I think lashes compliment
that kind of a look really well because
you know the look shows so much more
when you're looking down or you close
your eyes but when it's open things look
a lot more subtle because you've got
this nice little haze of falsies coming
up there and sort of covering up the lid
space a bit more I'll swear on my face I
went with sort of a cool pink look I
used my covergirl Katy Perry K cat matte
in kitty purry and that's all over my
lips and then on the cheeks a shade that
coordinates with that color beautifully
is my city color matte blush in
blackberry so I've got that right in
here and then I did want some glow on
top of that so I use my L'Oreal True
Match Lumi highlight in Rose and that's
where my glow on the cheekbones is
coming from so the challenge is complete
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you'll head over to Kristen's
channel and see how she did on her
different looks for the week this was a
really fun idea so thank you to David
for inspiring us I hope this concept
inspired some of you as well just to get
used out of the things maybe you haven't
been pulling for lately in your makeup
collection because that's really the
point you know you're kind of on the
spot to create these looks sort of
quickly so you're not able to just pour
over what is the absolute best way to
put these together it doesn't have to be
perfect but you're getting reminded of
certain good products in your collection
you're just making use of something
besides a palette for one set in my case
you know I reach for balance a lot so I
just thought I'd do a little wrap-up on
a couple of the disappointing things
that I used throughout the week I
thought these L'Oreal color riche
singles I love my L'Oreal infallible
singles that's this packaging style and
I just don't really think these measure
up so well there are much more sheer
intensity I feel like you have to work
harder to build them up these are just
fantastic granted they are going to be
more expensive than these but they're
much better quality I also wasn't loving
these NYX glam shadows they look pretty
just to glance at and they're so sparkly
but that doesn't really translate on the
eyes too much and I just thought the
intensity wasn't really there with those
shadows however the next prismatic
shadows which I think are the ones more
readily available where you would shop
for NYX products those are great and I
think a big improvement for their line
however the nude matte shadows as well
this one that I used today love that one
if you're looking for particular colors
with a lot of intensity the Kat Von D
shadows I have more than just the couple
I used this week and they are so darn
intense you get a lot of product I don't
think you would ever really use one up
unless you were really going for that
color every single day but insanely
pigmented unfortunately didn't notice a
bunch of fallout with those so that's a
really good sign and I often reached for
these Milani Bella eyes singles not by
choice you know I just reaching in my
bag for them and several of these were
pretty good as well I like this Bella
gray certain ones seem to require a
little more building up if you really
want to show off that color on your eyes
but overall they're pretty good so thank
you so much to everyone who took the
time to watch I hope you enjoyed and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
