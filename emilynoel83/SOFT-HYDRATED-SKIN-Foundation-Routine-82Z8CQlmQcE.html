here pardon my deeper than normal voice
I'm getting to what I hope is the tail
end of my cold but it's resulted in some
coughing and that's kind of roughing up
my voice a little bit so thank you for
being here and here's my question to you
to start off this video do you ever feel
like you go in phases of being like
really interested in different aspects
of your makeup for me right now I'm in a
real like foundation base makeup phase
now that I don't have fun with eyes and
lips and all that good stuff but it's
like I'm really enjoying trying
different foundations achieving
different looks on my skin and seeing
like how I can achieve the best full
coverage look how I can achieve the best
like hydrated dewy look and so I brought
you the full coverage look recently and
I hope you guys enjoyed that video
because as the laura geller cover lock i
think it's a fantastic foundation and
today what I want to bring you is
something that's a little bit lighter
coverage wise on the skin I still think
it makes the skin look super nice just
in terms of everything being really
evened out but it's more of a hydrated
look it's a bringing life back to your
skin not just through the look of your
skin but also the texture the feel of
your skin because I have had a cold
recently like I said and my skin has
gotten so so dried out maybe there's
some hormonal things that play there as
well but my skin just even to be soaking
wet in the shower and I feel my face and
I can just tell the texture is
something's changing with my skin and so
the last few days I've really been
playing with a look that gives a ton of
moisture back to my skin and it's just
kind of a fun thing to alternate in
there with the matte full coverage stuff
that I like as well on top of like my
whole skin feeling dry when you've got a
cold you got that awful like dry nose
situation and dry lip area so it's like
I just needed to give my whole skin a
drink again and something that would
kind of make all of those areas that
we're getting try absolutely to the
point of being flaky I need something
that would just heal them up basically
so hopefully this work is of interest to
you and if you can't put it to use right
now maybe you can stick this video in
your hip
to come back to it at a time when maybe
you've been sick or you've just been
dealing with a skin change and you can
use these sorts of techniques so here's
what I did I kind of did a double
moisturizer thing here I started off I
applied my Kiehl's ultra facial
moisturizer which has an SPF 30 and he
is my SPF somehow with this look so I
use that and it's really a lighter
weight type of moisturizer then on top
of that I've got my Bobbi Brown
hydrating eye cream this is an eye cream
that I actually got for free with an
order from the Bobbi Brown cosmetics
website and just got thrown in I was
like full-size eye cream thank you very
much so I have been using that lately
and it works really nicely and then
additionally I'm using an extra heavy
duty moisturizer what feels very
heavy-duty for my skin it's the it
cosmetics confidence in a cream and I
just you know blend that in all over my
face and then a foundation that I don't
know maybe I just missed the boat on
this I haven't thought I've heard anyone
really discussing this particular
product all that much but I think it's
amazing and it's this Tarte foundation
called empowered hydrogel foundation and
send the shade light neutral and I
remember getting this shortly before Eve
was born and I had played with it a
little bit on and off and I liked it
from the start but it's kind of a
situation where when your skin really
needs some extra moisture that's when
you become aware of all this product can
do for you so I get this around all over
my skin you can use a little spatula to
get some of the product out by the way
probably should have been using a
spatula for my moisturizer and eye cream
in the tubs but hey we're not perfect
here but I'd add that around everywhere
and I'm trying out this new royal and
langnickel Mota complexion brush it
reminds me a lot of like a dense
foundation brush from Real Techniques
kind of like the buffing brush or the
expert face brush or some of the more
dense brushes from Sigma and I just
blend that in all over my skin and let
me tell you the skin feels so nourished
after you have double moisturized and
use that gel cream foundation it's just
like you're giving your skin a great big
drink and that's not going to be
something that a really oily skin person
is going to want to do but
it definitely serves me well right now
and then I'm using this concealer from
Becca it's the aqua luminous concealer
and I have it in the shade light kind of
like the foundation I don't feel like
this concealer gives the most coverage I
might describe it as more medium
coverage but this concealer is never at
all drying on my skin it never dries to
like a thick place that other concealers
might it is great for being paired with
more of a dewy look you know so I blend
that in all over the skin just kind of
use that same foundation brush or my
fingers or whatever and then even though
I'm going all like dewy and hydrated on
you guys I still feel like this look you
can get away with some setting powder
and I'd like to set the under eye area
because I think it a makes it look even
better more flawless and B it just locks
in the staying power of the concealer I
think and then also it's great to set
your cheese zone I'm using the Laura
Mercier loose powder and making sure to
get around my nose because when you're
blowing your nose wiping it with a
Kleenex a lot I'm not saying this look
can't rub away but when I set it with
powder it works a lot better and guess
what you can use this powder very
lightly all over the skin and you still
don't look heavy you know it just kind
of balances the texture just a little
bit but my skin you know I'm kind of
adjusting to this but there is a little
bit of tackiness there and I've realized
that you're going to have to have some
of that if you really want the dewy look
and if you really want a lot of
hydration in your skin so those are the
main steps and then I've been playing
with some new things from I Kate house
which is a very very affordable makeup
site and I've got this Beauty truth
contour and sculpt palette so even
though that contour and sculpt shade
looks a little scary I use some of that
just very lightly under the cheekbones
this is not a super sculpted look here I
use some of the accentuate shape as my
blush a really pretty pink blush gives a
lot of life to the skin and if you want
to tone it down a little bit you can use
that highlight or correct shade which
are both matte and then I used some of
the glow which is a really really
pronounced highlight I think I used some
of that just right on top of my
cheekbones finished off the look with
several spritzes of my hard candy shear
and be hydrating primer mist and let me
tell you this look is so supple the skin
feels stoner
it feels so like brought back from the
dead you know what I'm saying so I love
just the overall effect for what I'm
needing right now and just to let you
know additionally what I put on my eyes
and lips I just did a quick one shadow
look with my L'Oreal infallible shadow
in bronze taupe super easy just patted
it on the lid blended it up into the
crease a little bit no fuss there no my
lips I have kind of a cocktail of
products I use my NYX slide on lip liner
in nude suede shoes one of my favorite
nude lip liner is probably my ultimate
favorite nude liner and I got this like
tinted lip balm from ELF and bear kiss
I actually really like these and it was
a nice thickness to them there's a nice
moisturization that happens when I wear
those on top of that I decided I want a
little more shine I'm using this new
buxom lip gloss that I got in Sandy that
was from the haul that I did previously
and that actually feels really good on
my lips the cooling sensation that I'm
getting there it actually feels very
soothing right now so that is my
finished look you guys I even took a few
pictures in my natural habitat down in
my nursing chair where I spend a lot of
time throughout the day and there's some
nice natural light coming through there
you can just see how the skin looks so
refreshed I think it looks so vibrant
with this kind of a look and again I
love my full coverage and there are ways
that you can take even a full coverage
foundation and boost up the moisturizers
that you're using underneath and kind of
help out the look in that respect but
this gel foundation just works really
well the staying power of this look -
can't stress that enough it's been
really fantastic and that surprised me
so much and it's kind of taking me out
of my comfort zone because like I said
I'm not set to that completely matte
actual dry feeling on my skin but yet it
really can withstand a day and that's a
date with a newborn with a toddler
running all over the place not touching
up at all so this hybrid gel foundation
whatever the heck that really means it
works really nicely thank you guys again
so much for spending time with me today
I appreciate it so much and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
