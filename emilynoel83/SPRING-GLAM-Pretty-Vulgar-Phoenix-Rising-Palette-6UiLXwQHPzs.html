me today we are doing a tutorial using
the Phoenix Rising palette from pretty
vulgar and if this sounds a little bit
familiar here on my channel I did
mention it among several new palettes at
Sephora I did sort of a palette roundup
review type video and this was
definitely the favorite palette of what
I talked about and we're looking at a
very very rich warm color scheme here
there are a lot of very intense mattes
there are some gorgeous shimmery
metallic shades but it's a perfect
balance I think and the amount of
richness in here I think these shades
offer so much versatility those really
deep dark colors there's a beautiful
shimmery purple on that we're working
into this look today and we're kind of
keeping it I guess maybe a hair on the
light side for what this palette can do
because I think it could potentially go
much much darker than the way I used it
today but I wanted to make this sort of
a spring ish look but in a nutshell if
you missed a video where I really
reviewed this palette I think what's so
special about it is that they've given
you just the perfect configuration of
colors here in terms of light medium and
dark but also the textures of these
shades are so good and they don't get
out of control when you put your brush
in you don't have a ton of fall out
everywhere yet you have in tremendous
intensity they're really fun to layer up
one on top of the next you've got some
interesting kind of mid-tone shimmers
some really dark shades some nice mattes
up in here in that kind of orange a warm
brown family and I just think everything
works together so nicely if you're a fan
of warm shades this is kind of like the
ultimate palette to have I think and
when I reviewed this I did compare the
quality of these shadows the experience
using these shades to visi our shadows
those shadows also are super duper
smooth they're a little bit goes a long
way shadow but yet they don't get out of
control as you use them and so that's
definitely the experience I had today I
really enjoyed how the look came out so
here's how to do it alright guys so I
have primed my lids and I'm gonna kick
things off with kind of a nice warm
peanut buttery brown in my crease this
is called my ash and I'm using my Sigma
e25 brush I just feel like this shade
and this placement of the shadow is kind
of a good place to start
something I really like about these mats
is I feel like I can use just a little
bit and it tends to take care of the
entire step you know I'm not constantly
going back and forth to the palette it
has a nice sort of spread ability across
the skin but yet when I tap into my
palette I'm not kicking up a lot of
powder excess you know it's just kind of
staying under control so even though
these shades are generally kind of
intense you know in this palette it
remains pretty easy to work with in my
opinion so now that I've kind of got my
crease situation set up there I'm going
to take it down a notch just a little
deeper I'm gonna use light my fire right
here just a little bit darker Brown and
I'm going to focus that kind of in the
outer part of my crease so the first
place I put my brush is where the most
product goes and then you can kind of
blend I find myself doing like small
circular motions even in the crease
small circular motions and sort of
working the shadow ever so slightly
inward
now I'm just gonna take a bear brush and
kind of whisk over the edge of what's
happening there and then we'll do the
highlight and a nice shade in this
palette for highlight is called always
rising it's a peach and it has just the
slightest hint of Sheen and I really
like that it doesn't look too stark you
know it's not like a full-on white
alongside all of these really rich warm
shades and then if you want to add a
little more shimmer like I can take this
untamable shade and give myself a little
glow on top of it all
now I may come back and do a few things
to kind of accent and even further
deepen the crease but for now I'm going
to move on to the lid area and I'm also
going to use untamable again and this is
going to be kind of like a little pop
around the inner corner so you can use a
really teeny tiny brush I find that I
can kind of multitask with my flat brush
and just dab it right around the tear
duct and boom it's all kind of taken
care of
and then I'm going to just slightly pull
that color right up onto the upper lid
this is a shade that packs on really
nicely so I feel like a patting motion
really effectively builds it up then I
just want to do this total like one
shade seamlessly fading into the next
across the lid so I'm gonna start with
fierce desire to me this shape feels
kind of like a soft copper and I'm gonna
Pat that and kind of pretty much on the
inner part of my lid overlapping the
lightest shade
and then I want to go into this purple
right down here this is called devilish
darling it's a nice purple with some
shimmer the sheen on this I think is
really beautiful and it plays so well
with these other like burgundy tones so
for that shade we're shooting to put
that right over the center of the
eyeball
and then I'm going to use a little bit
of this reddish shimmer called
resurrected sin a little bit of that
toward the outside basically covering
the outer corner with this shade
I grabbed just a little bit more of the
my Ashe Cutler right here
this warm brown that I started with and
I'm getting a little bit of that blended
right there in my kind of inner part of
the crease that's an area where my
crease isn't as deep and sometimes my
look just doesn't feel quite as complete
in that area
if I'm not really careful and kind of
tend to it you know and I don't want to
make it too dark so I'm taking a little
bit more of that peachy highlight and
just kind of running it over the entire
thing next up what I want to do is work
in one of these really intense mattes
and just add even more drama to this
look on the outside so blowing smoke
really pretty deep red I'm just using a
small brush where I can totally control
the color really well and I'm not
looking to overlap too much of what's
happening on the lid because I think
that's really pretty but you might just
kind of go on to just simply the outer
corner a bit as you're as you're working
the shade in a little on the outer
corner a little in the crease but
pulling it up and outward in the
direction of the outer tip of your
eyebrow to me that's what kind of keeps
my looks in line sort of ends up always
giving me kind of a lifted look to the
eye but these mats are so ridged down in
here I love them so again focusing on
the outer corner a little bit onto the
lid and then mainly getting it upward
and outward
what's sort of funny about this palette
is so many tones in there make me think
fall you know like just all the richness
and just those fall type shades that
we're all reaching for that time of year
however I think you kind of give it a
springy spin when you start playing with
the purple that's in here and that
somehow kind of gives it this added life
and brightness a little bit of an
unexpected twist about an eyelash here
but that's a small detail that I love
about this palette that I think really
changes it and makes it fun and I am
gonna go in just with my finger
now that I've done some blending swirled
around some more shadow I do want to
reinforce the fact that that purple is
happening right there on the center of
my lid
or my lower lashline I can't decide if I
want to make it really dramatic and like
line my inner rim or keep it sort of
bright I think I do want to keep it
bright actually I woke up with some a
little bit of redness in the ice you
know a little tiredness there and I can
always benefit from having a bright
lower inner rim so this is my wet and
wild ultimate brow highlight I need to
sharpen this but this is just such a
perfect product in here and I find so
many times I'll check my makeup later in
the day and this stuff is still hanging
around and even when you're working with
all these reddish shades around the eye
it just keeps everything bright on my
lower lash line I think I'm gonna go
into light my fire here just our nice
rich chocolatey milk chocolate Hershey
bar Brown now another direction you can
go with this palette is a very very
orange e one because as fire is super
intense
and then I think I'll continue inward
with the slightly lighter brown from
about the center of my lower lash line
inward and I'm kind of tempted to make
that whole lower lash line area just a
bit more smudgy so I'm using the best
brush for that is this in step up crease
brush from Real Techniques and the cut
of it I always show this whatever I use
it but it's kind of a uniquely cut brush
here it could dab shadow on the lid
really nicely but when you use sort of
this end where it's all been tapered
tapered tapered and then you've got this
end here
it makes smudgy shadow just really it
just does a really good job with that
effect so going back into my ash and see
you just use the tip of this brush and
run it right along and maybe it's the
shape of my eye the amount of space I
have in that area it just fills it
beautifully
okay now forging ahead we're going to
take my Milani stay put Matt 17-hour
wear eyeliner in the matte black shade
and I'm just going to run this right
along my upper lash line
I mean nothing defines a look like black
liquid liner when you're playing with
colors when you're working with
something that just feels a little bold
to you I feel like nothing sort of I
don't know grabs the look and calms it
down like a nice black liquid liner not
that this is a particularly wild look
but I would say one of the wilder looks
I did recently was with the palette
bingo or the eyeshadow bingo over on
Jen's channel and my look ended up
really intense it kind of felt a little
out of control at times but once I laid
some eyeliner down and got some mascara
going on there everything seemed to just
make sense on the eye
now under the liquid liner I'm going to
this super-rich plummy kind of wine
color it's one called fly-by-night and
I'm just kind of pressing this shade
with an angled liner brush right
underneath the wing and I tell you what
this shade is so rich it works in with
black liner so amazingly well it totally
just blends right in I love that
all righty guys next steps are just
curling the lashes putting some mascara
on top and bottom and some lashes too
and then I'll show you how it all ends
up so here's the finished look I put on
my Neutrogena hydro boost mascara and my
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
on the lower lashes and then I'm wearing
some red cherry 43 style lashes here so
they're a pretty long lash with a nice
little flare at the end which I thought
would fit the shape of the eyeshadow
look really nicely on my cheeks I've got
the Neutrogena essential cheek palette
the collaboration with Kerry Washington
I've got this bronzer on and then this
kind of poppy colored blush which i
think is very springy a little bit of
the makeup revolution liquid highlight
in champagne on my cheeks and then my
lip color is the strip-searched shade of
the new Too Faced natural nudes
collection so this is that really light
peachy nude I worked in a little bit of
my L'Oreal color riche mastermind liner
just gave it a hair more depth around
the outside and then for a gloss I got
this in I think a Sephora play box it's
the Sephora ultra shine lip gel in the
shade perfect nude and so that's kind of
a sheer gloss but it gave some shine all
over but again I am a huge fan of this
palette I think it's easy to use while
offering the potential to have a lot of
intensity I loved working in the purple
for this look because I think it just
takes the whole idea of the palette
makes it a bit more springy but when
you're doing a look think about the
whole picture because you could take a
traditionally very full type eye and I
think it's all about the way you
complete your entire look as to how it
all comes so for example when I was in
Houston I had posted an Instagram
picture of this look and and so many
people thought old-hollywood when you
look at it well what's actually old
Hollywood about it it would be the hair
and that bold red lip you know
everything else about the look if you
take those two factors away it's
basically like a standard full coverage
makeup look with a neutral eye so like
with this look I take this kind of color
palette on the eyes but then I pair in a
soft glossy nude lip a little bit of a
soft coral cheek kind of a nice dewy
highlighted sheen there on top of the
cheeks and it feels like a really fresh
look to me
also the foundation I'm wearing is my
ordinary coverage foundation and I wear
that in the shade 2.0 in light neutral
or light medium neutral I'm not sure
which one of those words tells you
exactly what color this is but you know
what I'm saying as far as your look
think of it more big picture wise
because this could have easily become a
rich dark intense look maybe with a more
intense contour on the cheeks and a
deeper lip color and whatever but there
are ways to take that seemingly fall
look and keep it kind of soft and light
so anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and thank you for being patient
with me for getting this tutorial out I
know I mentioned this palette a while
back in that Sephora palettes video I
hope you're having a fantastic day and I
will see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
