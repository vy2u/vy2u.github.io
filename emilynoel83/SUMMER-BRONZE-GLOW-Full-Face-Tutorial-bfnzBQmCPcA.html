this glowy bronze goddess type makeup
look I really like this kind of a look
for summertime I personally like these
kinds of tones on my skin I'm gonna be
taking you step by step start to finish
for the full face and along the way you
know mentioning and using some of my
favorite bronzy type products I've got a
few great multitasking things that kind
of carry over from the cheeks and the
face to the eyes and I think that's
always nice when you're going for that
low maintenance I look anyway and that
really is kind of the look we're going
for even though we did put a little work
into this look you know I want it to be
the kind of thing that just looks good
out in person in nature in regular broad
daylight as opposed to something that
really only looks good under super
bright lights or on Instagram so I hope
you enjoyed the look and here we go
first things first I moost Erised I
applied my eye cream and I used my
benefit specialist dreamscreen SPF 45 I
talked about this in a best in beauty
video maybe a couple months ago and it's
got a very light silky almost primer
like feel to the skin so it is kind of a
nice step if my moisturizer doesn't
contain us yes then we're gonna move on
to foundation today I thought I'd use
the Shea Moisture weightless Shea serum
foundation one of my favorites love the
natural look that it gives and the
natural feel it's a very very light
weight so I'm going to put pump right
here on my hand I have this in the shade
nude and you can apply this any number
of ways I really like applying very thin
foundations like this with a dense brush
it is to really enjoy the application I
get lots of coverage to this product but
not a lot of heavy feel so that's good
and I think this foundation has a very
natural looking finish on the skin it
was in my foundations that don't look
like foundations video it you know
sometimes I look at my skin when I've
got it on I can see just a little bit of
glow that my skin is picking up but it
doesn't look artificial it doesn't look
like you know that's because there are
particles of shimmer in this or anything
like that it just I don't know it seems
to come about naturally it blends out
very easily one pump is ample for the
entire face for sure I think a lot of
different skin types could get away with
using this foundation just because the
nature of the product is so lightweight
but I think normal the dry skin it might
be best suited for me I want to do just
a little bit of corrector I'm using my
benefit erase paste in medium this has a
really nice peachy color in case you're
not familiar and I'm just going to dab
this a little bit in my dark caverns
right there on the side of the nose
that's where I really need it most right
now I do feel like the foundation
provides some coverage over you know
other little areas where I might have
some discoloration but I'm just gonna
take it all around here and then this is
my Beauty Blender micro mini excuse me
and I'm just going to dab that over the
product sometimes I'll use my fingers
sometimes I'll grab for this I do love
the way that it's right in that little
spot and it just feels so gentle it
really almost feels more gentle been my
finger so when I use this in this area
now I'm gonna do a little bit of
brightening and this is the maybelline
instant age rewind this is in the shade
neutralizer and this kind of follows the
theme of lightweight products on the
skin because I feel like this product
oops and it doesn't have a lot of weight
to it it's very very thin but it can
pack a punch in terms of brightening so
I'm going to go kind of under the eye
just went down the nose as well really
kind of focus on lifting this whole
section here right on top of the chief
another thing I like about this color is
that it's lighter than my skin tone but
not by like multiple shades the goal for
this look is for the skin to look
in bronze but not to like done up you
know so I don't want to go too far with
like the heavily highlighted and
contoured look but there are some places
that is just more flattering to Brighton
so that's what I'm doing here and then
since the micro mini is the dampened
Beautyblender of the day I'm going to
dab this all around just give that a
nice soft blend
I slept so good last night
I woke up this morning and I thought
what day is it like what time of year is
it those mornings where like you were
just in such a deep sleep you can't even
like place yourself on you know what's
happening in my life right now I just
let's oh well I'm surprised I didn't
come in here with like actual sheet
creases on my face for this tutorial cuz
I slept hard okay we have foundation we
have corrected and we have brightened
the skin and now I just want to do a
little light setting and one new loose
powder I'm kind of loving trying all
these different loose powders one that
I'm using now is from Clinique and it's
the number 20 invisible blend it says
blended face powder and it did come with
a little like retractable brush too but
an interesting thing about this powder
like you know how sometimes you get a
loose powder that's brand new and full
and it's like you've really got to tap
it into the cap this like I first did
that but it is so fine it's such a
finely milled powder it like poured out
of its little holes like water
practically it was crazy and I'm like
okay no tapping necessary there I'm
going to get a little bit of this on my
ELF small tapered brush and I'm just
gonna dab this on the under eye to set
everything there and this truly this
powder I've tried to lay it on thick a
time or two so far and it really was
invisible like you just can't see it
beyond the under eyes I would say only
set the areas where you really feel like
you're gonna need it so for me I'm gonna
set a little bit on the nose on the side
of the nose a little bit up in this zone
and then just a bit on my chin my
chinny-chin-chin and then that will be
it really don't want to be over powdered
for this look and I've got a little hot
powder bronzer coming your way because I
am using the lorac take me to tan t go
little palette here love the names we've
got tan Antonio 10 Diego Cabo San Lucas
and tenta Cruz so four different shades
of bronzer those top two in typical
lorac fashion are matte and the bottom
two are shimmer
so yeah I'm gonna be using a variety of
these shades I've been having fun kind
of bouncing around with these I'm gonna
be using couple adds eyeshadows and it's
just gonna be fun
so talking contouring for a second like
I said I don't want it to be in the
category of slaved over I want it to
just look like it naturally appeared so
I'm gonna be using a little bit bigger
brush that won't be quite so precise
with everything and I'm gonna bounce a
little bit between these two shades that
tan Antonio and the tan Diego and I'm
just gonna lightly sweep this in the
hollow of the cheek area just for a
little depth there this brush is so
multifaceted because you can kind of use
it lengthwise see how it's a little bit
longer there because the ferrule is
pinched you can use it that way to
really lay down product and then once
you feel like you've gotten all the
product on you can just kind of buff it
and I'm gonna do that same kind of
bouncing between those two shades and go
around my hairline so really enjoying
these bronzer colors I like the matte
and shimmer options and one I also like
that the light bronzers actually do
still show up they're not so light that
it's like well why was that in there
everything is capable of making some
sort of an impact and I've got a big
like zit under the service here I don't
know if you can see but it's like it's
just plotting its next move it's one of
those that's where no it can't even just
instantly make the appearance it's it's
the slow burn type of zit I'm gonna take
some of the 10 Diego shade sorry I
cannot say these words in it like a
normal I can take that down here on the
neck really tackle the jaw line with
that color and get it all up in this
area and it may even take a little bit
on the shoulders you know why not always
fun to do your right shoulder with your
right hand now that we've kind of laid
the bronzy foundation we've done the
workhorse bronzing / contouring now
we're going to do the glow and I'm gonna
use Cabo San Lucas for that so that
would be more of the golden e bronze
that does have a little shimmer and the
shimmer in these glowy type shades isn't
too extreme either this I'm going to
like kind of cross over my entire
4head not really making any effort to
contour I mean I just kind of want this
shade to be like the veil that goes over
everything right on the top of my cheeks
I'm hitting down the nose the chin now
we will be coming back to this palette
because I will be using it on the eyes
too one of my favorite blushes to really
mesh with an overall bronzy look is from
Too Faced and it's the pink leopard and
that's because it's like a pinky bronze
and there is a lot of pink in this blush
but there's also a lot of neutral that
ends up getting mixed in when you apply
it to your brush and I just love the
glow it's not too intense but it's so
like just right almost gives your cheeks
the appearance of like yes I was just
outside in the sunshine
and last but not least for the face
we're going to highlight and this is my
Physicians Formula shimmer strips this
is in the shade Vegas strip I also
really like this one this is called
Waikiki strip it's the peachy glow
bronzer and this is called the light
bronzer I think of them both kind of
like highlights this one gets a little
bit darker and um you know it can do a
lot if you're using these different
shades as eyeshadows but it doesn't get
quite as light for the highlighting this
palette I think I said this in another
video but when you mix all these shades
together it can be a very similar look
to Becca's champagne pop but I'm going
to mainly focus on the top of this
palette with my up and up highlighter
brush and I'm just gonna sweep this
right on top of the cheekbones and I
chose this particular highlight for the
amount of kind of golden eNOS golden
eNOS that it has I think it just really
works well for the bronzed
look
and I'm going to take a little bit of
this just down the nose that always kind
of makes the whole face look like okay
yeah it's not just the cheekbones that
look fresh and I like to kind of go just
above this eyebrow area it's a little
glow when that zone catches the light
not up to the zip bow and then I'm just
going to put a bit on the Cupid's bow
area again I'm just sticking to that
like the top two shades and this in the
strips and then since we have just used
a bunch of different powdery textures
I'm going to use a setting spray this is
the hydrating floral essence from tada
Harper that came in that little multi
pack from Sephora the Sephora favorites
set for skin care and before I move on
to eyes I'm gonna put on a little bit of
lip oil this is the Milani moisturizing
almond cocoa I like to put on a little
bit of this to kind of get the lips
feeling a little hydrated before
whatever lip products I put on really
nice hydrating treatment these little
lip oils for the eyes I'm gonna do just
a little brow touch-up with my color pop
dope taupe pencil this is still the
still tickin still got product in there
even though I feel like I have to twist
it up every single time that I use it
because it is kind of a creamy skinny
pencil it's just a really nice natural
tone considering that I don't need to do
a full-on recreation of a brow I'm just
filling in a few key areas and I don't
need a ton of color to do that I just
very lightly touch up the few little
zones where I need it
and then I'm getting the last little bit
out of this elf wet gloss lash and brow
I swear it's just got the tiniest bit
left this needs to head to the empties
bin after this now for the eyes I'm
going to use a little bit of Milani
eyeshadow primer first just a tiny dab
will do ya between both of the eyes dab
it on the lids and then pull it up
through the crease and up under this
whole zone then here's what I'm going to
do I'm going to pull out my tan take me
to tenth ego palette and I'm gonna use
some of this lightest shade in the
crease with an e25
this is tan Antonio in case anybody
forgot and just gently lightly giving
myself a little natural definition in
the crease this whole look is really
kind of inspired by what I was wearing
in that Sephora favorites video and I
used a lot of products in the Sephora
favorites bronze kit but the overall
look was just glowy light really you
know lightweight product and just kind
of that outdoorsy natural vibe next I'm
going to bounce over to my Physicians
Formula highlight and I'm gonna take my
lightest shades and dab that on my lids
this is my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow
brush that I'm using here and hitting
the tear duct with those colors - also I
think I'll just very lightly go up under
the brow with those also
and then last little eye shadow type
step here I'm going to attend to Cruz
which is your deep kind of brownish
contour with a little bit of shimmer and
I want to use this in my outer corner
just deepening it up a little bit it's
still not gonna look like crazy overdone
but just give it a little depth for an
outer V blend over the edges see it's
not too dark but it's just a little I
don't know it's a little something and I
could not love this little makeup
academy 315 crease brush anymore I mean
this is great for putting colors in a
more concentrated spot on the eye
everybody needs a small crease brush
particularly if you have small eyes and
you feel like your shadows look muddy a
lot um larger brushes can kind of
misplace the shadow on your eyes if your
eyes are really small so this is great
to have got it from CBS I think I spent
$8 on it and it's just perfect and just
blend over that side as well and that
same shade I'm picking it up on a pencil
brush and I'm gonna go a little bit here
under the I wouldn't call this a smoky
eye by any means but we're just you know
defining the eye a little bit down here
and then I feel like my lower lashline
is looking a little bit pink so I grab
oh I thought I grabbed Palani I grabbed
the Jordana one the continuous almond
they're basically the same thing I'm
just going to put a little bit of that
nude color in the lower inner rim
and then the last time I did a bronzy
look I really like the way this liner
looked it was the Smashbox always sharp
in penny lane so if you've got any kind
of like dark bronzy brown eyeliner that
you want to use I'm just like using it
to kind of thicken the look of the lash
line a little bit and these Smashbox
liners are so cool these always sharp
ones because when you twist the cap off
you get a nicely pointed tip every time
then I'm going to curl my lashes
I've got my little dynamic duo here for
mascara I use the super sizer there's
the original super sizer as my favorite
for upper lashes particularly if I am
NOT going to be putting on any false
lashes I really like what this does for
my eyelashes so I'm going to apply that
up top and then I'll do clump crusher on
the bottom which I just really like how
it defines lower lashes of like how it
stays on the lower lashes and it's not a
tutorial if I don't have to reach for a
q-tip at some point in time
and I'm just going to curl the other
side and repeat those steps
lips for this look um I think a nude lip
look does look really pretty I had kind
of a nude lip going the last time I did
this sort of look but I kind of like
even better the your lips but better
type of shade on the lips because it
looks even more natural this is the
L'Oreal velocity balm and lovely mocha
love this kind of colors got a little
bit of shine to it it just I don't know
perfect low maintenance color
and then if you really want to have some
fun you can like dip back into your
little physician's formula and kind of
dab in the center of the lip yes I know
it's powder or to mush your lips
together and you get this nice little
glow enos happening there so the look is
all complete again just really love
working with these tones this time of
year bronzers and highlights are so
multi-purpose don't think that you can
only use them on your cheeks or in your
contour or your forehead they can
definitely translate to the eyes and
make beautiful eye shadows but I do
really look forward to sporting this
look throughout the summer because I do
think it does look good in person you
know somebody could be sitting in front
of you and thinking wow you know that
looks like good skin I feel like the
products we used weren't too heavy and
where we did use glow we did it kind of
you know strategically in the most
flattering places so I hope you enjoyed
this look it was a lot of fun for me and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
