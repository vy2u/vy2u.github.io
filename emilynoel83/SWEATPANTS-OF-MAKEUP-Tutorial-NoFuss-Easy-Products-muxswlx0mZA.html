some videos these days that are your
request I asked for some on my Facebook
page recently and as I was going through
my video list where I just kind of jot
down any video idea I see in the
comments section or wherever I saw that
I had a request from Cindy B and she
said can you do a video called sweat
pants of makeup which I've said about
surge makeup products that are very easy
very simple to use and she said you know
comfy easy products all about just
simple application and so I've kept that
idea on the back burner for a little
while and I feel like I've kind of
naturally come to a lot of products that
would fall into that category things
that don't really require a lot of fuss
or touching up and in some cases things
that can be very multitasking on your
face as well so this is a very beginner
friendly tutorial this is a very like I
want a pretty natural look to take to
the office or you know date night or
wherever you want to take this look it's
simple and don't let the red lip fool
you this was just as easy to put on as a
nude lip a coral lip a brown lip I show
like four lip options at the end of the
video but every single product that I
use in this video was hand-picked for a
reason because I feel like it's low
maintenance effortless just really
really simple stuff and you might be
thinking old sweatpants of makeup do I
always love the way I look in my
sweatpants well it's not so much about
appearance as it is just the
practicality of everything and the
easiness of everything and just the
comfort low fuss element to the look
that you know about because you were the
one sitting here applying it but other
people you know you see in the world
will see you and they think oh there's a
put together lady I put together lady
that's a way to put it anyway I hope you
liked the video if the tutorial turns
out to be super long please please keep
in mind that this does not actually take
a long time not in tutorial mode I just
you know start talking about things
sometimes it takes a little longer
alright guys I'm here you ready for some
easy makeup let's jump in this is my it
cosmetics CC plus illumination if you're
really anti glow if you've got super
oily skin and you know
this is something you'd want to stay
away from you could definitely just try
the regular it cosmetics CC cream
because I really like that too
but I get out of pump and may need a
little bit more and then I'm just going
to dab the stuff all over my face
and then I think the easiest way to get
the best coverage out of this product if
that's what you're kind of trying to
maximize you know you're taking this
step you want some coverage on your skin
obviously it's to take a full brush a
full dense type Foundation II brush this
is the f-84 from Sigma but there are
some other options on the market and
I've got a little set of some other
options that I'm going to be testing
side by side with these I'm just kind of
having this around on the skin and the
reason why I chose this product is
because I think for as little effort as
it takes to go around and you know just
blend this in all over your face you get
maximum impact you know I feel like it
does a lot for my skin it takes my whole
complexion and evens it out but it also
gives it just this really healthy glow
and then you know by concealing I can
kind of go around and further perfect
you know those certain areas that I need
to deal with
Oh duh and another really remarkable
thing about this product is that that is
my moisturizer - so I had nothing on my
skin when I started this and then just
been put that on this is in the shade
medium for me and I mean if I did
nothing else put nothing else on my skin
just had to run out this would be you've
just a nice little step to help even
things out where is my brush your
concealer I think one of the easiest
forms of concealer to work with is
definitely a stick concealer and this is
the Almay age essentials and it has SPF
20 and I will clarify what shade I have
this in because I don't have the shade
on the package it does remind me quite a
bit of like Revlon Photoready stick
concealer only I feel like this just has
a little more creaminess to it but I
just think it's awesome that I can use
this and you know I'm pretty dark in my
inner corner and stuff and I can use
this as just an all-purpose anywhere
concealer redness around the nose you
got it it has the coverage but it also
has this smoothness creaminess that
doesn't make you look real dry and I
also love this because I don't feel like
there's just one way you can blend it
out if you just want to use your fingers
I have done that often and it works fine
if you want to use your micro mini
Beauty Blender love that too or and this
is like the P 84 this is the baby put
myself in the eye is the baby version of
that brush that I blended out my
foundation with this is a great option
as well so you just you know do whatever
you want because this concealer is just
very very easy to work with there's
definitely a reason why it shows it for
this video so I just kind of do a
dabbing motion and the coverage is just
great
my voice to me I don't know if it sounds
different but it feels a little hoarse
this morning and it's because we were
watching the ESPYs last night and they
did a little package on Cleveland and
LeBron and stuff and there's a part
where do you guys remember after
Cleveland won the NBA Finals and LeBron
just shouts Cleveland and it's if it's
really loud it's not like one of those
fake shouts but I'm not going to wake up
the whole house this morning and ever
since that was uttered by LeBron like
bub and I have joked about like all this
randomly shout out Cleveland and last
night we're doing it in Bell was still
up and she was just like she was trying
to say it too and just having an
absolute blast laughing her head off as
we were just going back and forth but
then I wake up this morning in the back
of my throat actually feels scratchy I
mean if you've seen any sort of montage
or story of you know the Cavaliers
winning that's probably been included
shouts it with the most like passionate
roar that I could even imagine a person
saying or shouting a word with all right
next um a little bit of powder see we've
got a decent glow on our skin and I
don't want to take all that away but I
do happen to know that I like a little
setting powder on the under eyes so I'm
using one of my dollars two dollars one
of my dollar store fines this is LA
Colors this is a color nude just a nice
little mattifying powder I decided to
use something different from Milani
multitasker today because that one is
kind of hard to find and this is about
things being easy so you could run into
your local family dollar or wherever
your LA Colors stuff is sold and grabbed
this I'm just using the elf small
tapered brush and I'm just getting this
product a nice little dab right there on
the under eye and you've got to be a
little bit in tune with your skin here
and know where do I need a little bit of
setting powder where and where's the
minimum that I can get away with it for
me I know I want it up in this area and
I want it down the nose sides of the
nose a little bit of it on the mouth
and also um just a little bit in the
center of the forehead and that to me I
feel like it can create a makeup look
that will last I won't be feeling the
need to be constantly touching it and
that helps out for the easy sweatpants
of makeup philosophy in this video next
this guy and I mentioned this in a video
about multitasking palettes and this is
one of the closest things to that
Charlotte Tilbury instant look in a
palette it was this guy because it has
some eyeshadows in it it has a blush but
like a couple of blush shades or like
kind of a neutral a little bit bronzer
is shade and a couple of great
highlights up top and I think this would
be a nice little gift for someone who
was just starting out with makeup it's
called book of beauty minimal makeup no
makeup makeup that's what the little
label on the Mac says and part of why I
love this is because I don't think you
can go too far wrong with any of these
colors you know the blush is not too
bold but it shows the highlights are
glowy but you know they're not insane so
what I'm first going to do and I've got
the Sonia Kashuk number 29 brush this is
a little bit fuller than like my Milani
blush brush and I'm going to use this
for a few different things because I
think it can do blush it could do a
little bit of you know some bronzer
types of it I'm going to take this shade
that looks like a borderline bronzer or
a neutral blush and I am just going to
dust that lightly kind of on the temples
around the hairline a little bit this is
going to be just the most subtle thing
I'll take it just a little bit lower on
the cheek area right in here this is not
a full-on contour guys it's just like
easy you know just adding a bit of
dimension to the skin
then our matte peach blush we're going
to use that and that's going to be our
blush right here kind of focusing it on
the outer part of the apple of the cheek
and sweeping upward this is a subtle
blush but it's very pretty like don't
get me wrong it's gorgeous but I kind of
wanted to include something in this
video that I didn't feel like people
could go too far wrong with you know
just a really simple and if you're a
little deeper skin tone I would
straight-up use that color probably as
your blood
go back to my little bit smaller elf
small tapered brush you've got two
highlighting options here the white is
going to be a little more pronounced and
then this sort of like Daisy type of
highlight that's a little more subtle
and I'm going to go for that today tap
off any excess and just brush this right
here on top of the cheekbone area no big
whoop and you're not going to go too far
with this product it's subtle then after
I do those basic face steps I will take
my hard candy shear and be hydrating
primer mist and just give myself just a
few mists kind of let it fall onto the
face and I feel that that really takes
away any amount of powdery look to the
skin it just takes that makeup and makes
it kind of ghost you know skin now for
brows I have kind of an interesting
little brow find here from the
purchasing a brow product standpoint I
think this is as easy as it gets because
you could buy this and have like three
products in one so I think it's very
easy from that standpoint you know it's
a few little steps once you actually put
it on your brows but it's this this
stuff is sold together and if the eye
booster four and one brow boosting kit
and you get a brow fill in shade you get
a highlighter under brow highlight you
have this little like brush tool here
and then also a tinted gel to go over
the top so it's very all-encompassing if
you're really not wanting to think too
much about it now this pencil I don't
normally like larger you know size
pencils for the brow area however this
is one that you can sharpen like
Maybelline put out that big old pomade
stick and it's like okay this is nice
for the first few uses but what's going
to happen when that wears down with this
you know this is a sharp Atal pencil
you'll just use the larger hole in your
duo sharpeners that you might have and
but the shade for me like I can just
very quickly dab this kind of a thing
over my areas that need to fill in now
if you feel you know you've got to be
much more careful
your brows because you've got to do a
lot more work on them you know recreate
a brow perhaps I would suggest maybe
something with a finer tip where you
feel like you have even more control so
I love NYX micro brow
I've been trying those L'Oreal and
little brow pencils that are like the
size of a NYX micro brow or an honest
hacia brow Wiz and I do like those as
well for my brows I can wear that medium
shape that that comes in and it seems to
work nicely so you know you got to kind
of know your own situation but I just
wanted to throw this little guy out
there for somebody who maybe has a few
places they need to touch up and touch
up their brows with and they don't want
to go purchasing just a bunch of
different products you can just buy one
thing it's got a lot in it and can I
just say that anytime I'm talking in a
video and I'm doing my brows I always
take longer
like I'm fascinated whenever I go back
to edit a video I'm like why did I spend
so long with my brows I never take that
long with my brows in real life but just
cuz I'm talking I'm not even really
thinking so once I do that fill inside
I'll just take the little brush for a
second and kind of make sure
everything's evenly distributed and then
you can just use this little neat
highlight thing which reminds me of I
don't know two-faced has a product like
this benefit has high brow it's super
creamy you could really get a defined
nice cleaned up edge to your brow using
something like this but I just kind of
dab it under there and and then blend it
out with my fingers you could use a
brush for this also and it says
Universal Brown on the gel end and this
isn't one of those like super heavy duty
gels where like it's not like benefit
gimme brow where you could possibly use
that product all on its own because it's
got a lot of color in it and a lot of
added thickness this is just a lightly
tinted gel that's all it is now for the
eyes I know I want to do a little
brightening on that lower inner rim I've
got my Milani shadow eyes and almond
cream this is one of the best things I
think for lower in a rim you can use it
so many other ways not just on the lower
inner rim this could be an under brow
highlighting product this could be
and all over the lid neutralizing type
bass then all the lids going to use a
little cream product here that is just
so so easy where's well just super low
maintenance and it's the Maybelline
Color tattoos stick and it's the one in
bronze truffle I'm going to draw this
all over my lid I'm also going to draw
it up into the crease and what makes
this so dang easy is that I'm literally
going to you know shape this I look
exactly where I want it so I'm going to
where I want that shape of the outer V
I'm just going to pull it up right there
you know easy okay is everything covered
boom before it has a chance to set it
eventually will but these are a little
bit like thinner and creamier than a
regular color tattoo in the pot but then
I take this Real Techniques base shadow
brush but I just kind of lightly blend
over the edge of that product and maybe
kind of get it into the crease so you
make sure nothing no not too much
product is settling there but it's an
easy easy blend and then boom you've got
lid shadow you've got crease shadow and
it could not be easier you've already
used your brow product to get a little
bit of a more finished look happening
under the brows and they've got some
other pretty shades you know you could
play around with but this is definitely
the most like if you didn't know what
you were wearing if you didn't know what
lip color you were going to do this
would work with absolutely anything and
just kind of think okay what basic shape
am I going for here do I want just a
little bit of a outer V blend it's just
the perfect tone because it's not so
dark and you can't go too far wrong and
then a little synthetic brush is all you
need here even like one of those brushes
like I use for concealer one of those
would be fine for this sort of step to
and then if you decided hey I got a
little more time on my hands I'm going
to do something a little more complex
use that as your base your long wearing
cream shadow base and then go into your
pixie palette and you could you know do
a little added pop on the lid or
something more dramatic in the crease
you know you
you be the judge and I'm going for more
like wide-awake super bright and look
but you could also easily take this
stick and go on the lower lashline and
get more of a smoky liner effect now for
your upper lid liner these liners are as
easy as they come and yes they're
smashbox so you're going to pay maybe a
little bit more for them but if you hate
having to sharpen a liner and you also
hate how retractable liners can
sometimes get a dull tip these always
sharp liners are the way to go and I
wanted to just recommend a couple here
I've got Penny Lane which is a kind of a
deep shimmery bronze and it's nice for
very subtle easy liner like this is
probably the easiest because there's
just even if you do mess it up a little
bit doesn't really show that much and
then Sumatra is a nice deep chocolatey
Brown and this gives a little more
definition but either one is nice
yesterday I was playing around with the
penny lend a little bit more so I think
I'll do Sumatra today but you twist the
top and every time you twist it you get
a nicely formed pointed tip like it's
brand new out of the package and how
long have I had this little thing in the
corner of my eye wonderful but I just
love how this liner gets right in there
you know our our upper lid tends to you
know right before it hits your lashes it
there's a curve to it and sometimes
liners don't always hit that little area
that they should should get to you know
that gets right in next to the lashes so
this is great for that and then if you
want that to appear more smudgy right
after you put it on you can just go over
it with a q-tip to soften it a bit
next up I'm going to curl my lashes and
I love my regular covergirl super sizer
if there's one I could recommend it
would be that one but I am almost to the
point of using this fibers one up so
I've like tried to be using this one
every day this week because I feel like
it's on its last legs but you know
either one will get the job done
and I just apply a couple of coats of
this to my upper lashes and I'm actually
going to just leave my lower lashes for
this look bare I have found what I'm
doing the really natural looks keeping
the emphasis on the upper part of the
eye really does help you look a little
bit more awake but check it out I mean
for me that's a pretty big lash for just
mascara so I love my super sizer and
then I'm just going to curl the other
side and I always curl and then
immediately put mascara on almost like I
just used a curling iron on my hair and
then I'm going to spray it with
something you know that's kind of the
mentality
okay so face is done eyes are done it
would not be a sweat view to makeup
video if I didn't bring in the original
product but years ago I referred to as
the sweat pants lipstick and that is the
Neutrogena moisture smooth color sticks
these are so so comfortable they are the
most hydrating thing that hey excuse me
I remember a few years ago visiting
North Dakota in the middle of winter and
I had one of these on my lips the whole
time
never got chapped and dryness and
chapping happens in the summertime -
these are so low-maintenance they feel
fabulous on the lips I absolutely love
these and there are a lot of great
colors so I wanted to actually show you
how different shades will transform the
look because this is just a one-step
thing whether you go bright it's just as
easy as going light with one of these
but I wanted to show you the pink nude
you know this is going to be your
softest option from this line I think
really natural and easy and then if you
like something with a little more
brightness kind of a coral pop for the
summertime fresh papaya I think is
beautiful this is one of the originals
that released if you like a deeper
neutral Brown berry I think this is
beautiful and it's also really nice
combined with pink nude and then as I
sit here I want to pop on cherry pink
and this is one of the full glam you
know bright shades look how one swipe
the fullness of the color but it does
stay in place and it feels so good like
if you've never tried a Neutrogena
makeup product this needs to be that
where you start I tell you what
absolutely transformative for a natural
look that everywhere else you know just
about healthy-looking skin very simple
eye you pop on that pinkish red lip and
you are just set to dominate the day
right thank you guys so much for
