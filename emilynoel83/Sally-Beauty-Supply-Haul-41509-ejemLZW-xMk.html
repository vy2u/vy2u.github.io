and it's a sally beauty supply hall so I
love going there i love them i can spend
so much time in that store really just
looking at all the different products
and learning about different things so i
wanted to just walk you through it's not
a big hole but you guys say you like
holes so like why not do a halt on it so
um I got three of the china glaze nail
polishes which are actually buy two get
one free right now so our finger paints
which I love and I tried those before
this is actually my first China Glaze
perches i bought finger paints a while
back and i think those are awesome
quality too so a couple of things to
look for when you're there um I got
three colors the first one is in
avalanche and it's a gorgeous um kind of
like I don't know it looks a little
lighter in person that it's coming off
on camera here but it's like a silvery
charcoal metallic sort of shade and I
have it on my toes right now I'd show
you but I just feel funny like pulling
my foot into this is the camera shot but
it really looks like this I mean it
comes off I put two coats on and it
looks like exactly like it does in the
bottle so I saw what a pretty shade you
know that's just kind of unique and
that's what I wanted to go for shades
that I didn't feel like I was seeing
everywhere else um so I've tried that
one and i like how smooth it goes on and
the drying time isn't outrageous i don't
feel like i'm sitting around forever but
i am sitting around a little while
though um i thirst shade i got was
golden meringue gorgeous peachy shade
with some golden undertones there and
then the last shade was summer rain and
this is looking a little more right on
camera than it is in person what it is
is a medium pink and it has when you
look at it in a certain light it looks
like it has a lavender undertone which
is really pretty so you're probably
seeing this something yellow bright pink
where have I seen that but this is
really a unique color if you get to
looking at it if you go to sallys look
at number 145 summer rain and see what
you think of it because I think it's a
really really cool shade um I also
got this little nail gizmo that they had
there I'm can't quite remember how much
it cost but it's like double ended and
it's like a really fine file so like you
could you know make adjustments to your
filing like fine adjustments on the
corner of your nail you know if you want
to go for that kind of squared off look
but still somewhat round your edge a
little bit I mean it's just it's just a
nice little detail shaper thing for your
nail and that wasn't very much I don't I
mean I wouldn't have spent much on it so
and then I was looking for I've been
looking for a good hairspray ok I think
um well I've got several I like but I
like him kind of more for different
purposes than others I really like the
so gorgeous hair spray from Sally's for
example but um I've lately been looking
for something that can be really quick
drying and work really well if I tease
my hair at all and I want to give it a
spritz or something that you know I put
it on my rollers one and they sit there
the so good gorgeous was good for that
but I was kind of looking for something
that was more strictly a strong hold
hairspray as opposed to a volumizing
hairspray so I tried out something it's
in the back at least in the back of my
store they have a hairspray sort of
section at this really tall generic
value products wish you guys know I love
those I had the matrix amplify um to
color or two color shampoo and
conditioner um and it's the generic kind
and I love it it works great that's what
i've been using matrix amplify and then
I found this matrix Vavoom freezing
hairspray fast drying I had found aveo5
product that you used to claim that but
they don't make it anymore so anyway I
can't even find it at Big Lots so you
know it's bad when you can't find it
there all of all the ingredients that
list the ingredients on the back it
compares it to the actual matrix of
baboom freezing hairspray and they're
exactly the same I've double check to
make sure and the scent on this is so
good like if it were a body spray I
would spray it all over if it wasn't
gonna be sticky I would spray it on my
body
but it worked well on my hair today just
kind of you know helping hold the curl
and helping me style it kind of adds I
as I what's the word I'm looking for
style it as I like combed it out I guess
but um this is under review I won't know
if I like hairspray the first time I
have to keep trying it and has to kind
of earned my seal of approval so I'll
let you know what I think about this but
they did have other kinds too there was
a matrix amplify generic hairspray but I
like I said I was trying to get
something more of like a fast dry rather
than a volumizing thing and then what
the inevitable happened when I went up
to the to check out the girl asked so
would you like to try a um foot softener
for dolly 99 and I was like okay so i
got this heel to toe aromatherapy spa
pedicure feels like new foot softener
softens corns and rough cracked heels
and calluses and you know we all get
like those rough areas on our feet like
on our heels after it's been wintertime
and now it's spring and you're wearing
those sandals and you want your feet to
be all nice and soft and i use these
when i did my China Glaze pedicure on
myself yesterday and I wore some
open-toed shoes for the first party
today I had to put on some boots because
i had a story in an orchard pretty peach
and like strawberry plants and
everything everywhere off topic but that
was what I had to put my boots on for
that but anyway I feel like I'm getting
really off topic today but um but anyway
put this on my like the balls of my feet
in my heel and it's still soft today so
that's a good sign and I didn't put a
whole lot on yesterday but this is just
maybe a little option I don't know if
all Sally stores kind of promote the
same thing up by the cash register but
it looks like this says heel to toe and
it has it has beeswax in it lanolin and
various other things that I would rather
not pronounce right now so
that's what I got from sallys and also I
let this out of my hall that I did in my
video with my sister lightly but what I
recently but what I have on my lips here
is an elf product it's super glossy lip
shine in mauve Lux and this is the shade
I got it at meijer when we were there
it's like a deep ma shade with a little
bit of subtle subtle gold shimmer to it
so on yeah that's what I have on right
now so I hope you guys enjoyed this haul
video and thank you so much for tuning
