you today on a new look product that I
just recently got that I really like and
I'm not sure the issue is I'm not sure
if since I got it at Big Lots if it's
actually discontinued at other stores I
have a feeling it's not because of the
way this was packaged because you know
how a lot of times you'll go to Big Lots
and you'll see products that are still
you know at your favorite drugstore but
they're just packaged in like a gift
pack or something that is just not the
way we would the drugstore would
typically sell them so they did they go
to Big Lots and then they sell them
there but I'd like to first say that
with Sally Hansen lip products that's
what I have to talk about today just I'd
like to first say that a lot of them
have fun to be overly sticky and feel
like when I put them on but there's just
a lot on my lips they feel kind of heavy
sometimes and I know that they really do
have a lot of conditioning you know
qualities to them and it may be very
good for my lips but it's just something
about them generally a lot of them I
feel like that's kind of unpleasant you
know I don't like to really I like to
have stuff on my lips but I don't like
to always be consciously aware that it's
there and feel kind of funny about the
way it's the way it is on my lips but I
found a deal and it was two that were
packaged together for two dollars and it
was called the line smoothing the line
smoothing mineral lip treatment and so I
thought okay this you know I like the
colors a lot and I hope you can see what
they are
one is this color is called limited
edition shade one and that's like a
light pearly pink and then my favorite
shade of the two is it's called kunzite
or kunzite I'm not sure some kind of
mineral I guess and what this is this is
what I have on my lips right now and
it's kind of a nude with gorgeous golden
e undertones so I mean I that would work
really nicely if you want the sort of a
lighter colored lip
cuz those yellow undertones those golden
undertones work well for a lot of
people's skin so anyway these came
packaged together it was only two
dollars so think of like $1 apiece and
currently being sold in Big Lots and
they do have other shades I know they
have some quarterly shades and some
brighter shades but I just thought well
you know I'll try this I haven't had the
best of luck with Sally Hansen lip stuff
but I'll try these and I got them on and
I really like them I like the color I
like um I found this mint is I just
can't quite put I sometimes struggle
with describing sense but it's fruity
with a little bit of uh of a minty
undertone but it's not nothing stinging
about this this is not a lip plumper and
I wasn't really seeking it out for the
fact that it says it's lime smoothing
because I mean I don't find I have lots
of issues with lines on my lips but it
just does give a very I mean it's not
too sticky in my opinion now if you are
really really sensitive to a lip gloss
it has any amount of thickness I mean
it's all about what you can handle I
guess and I can handle a little bit of
stickiness but I don't like you know
super thick lip gloss but this I mean it
doesn't travel outside my lip area like
some of the really um watery lip glosses
seem to I mean it stays on there
it feels good my lips even feel good
after it wears off you know but it does
last quite a while simply because it
does have a little bit of tackiness to
it and I just like it a lot I like the
colors like I said I would recommend if
you stopped by your big big Lots next
I've given some recommendations recently
but check for this it's a duo and
different colors are available $2 and
also maybe check your drugstore and let
me know post a comment if you do see B
line smoothing mineral lip treatment at
your local drugstore that way folks can
know whether or not this is just a
discontinued product big lots of selling
which I have a feeling it's not just
because it's just
especially packaged I think that that's
the reason why but I just I I think it's
worth checking out I think it's it's
worth looking into I mean if you are you
know a more mature lady and you're
looking for something that is a line
smoothing effect on your lips then that
would be double the benefit for you a
nice gloss it smells nice it looks nice
and it would also deal with lines on
your lips and I can't I mean we all
obviously have little little uh you know
lines in our lips that I can't I mean as
far as whether or not that's masking
them I don't know they just look I feel
like it makes them look kind of full but
it's not a plumper by any means and it's
just you know everybody loves lip gloss
so I'd say check this one out and get a
good bargain and just enjoy enjoy the
good deal so I thank you guys for
watching and I hope you have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
