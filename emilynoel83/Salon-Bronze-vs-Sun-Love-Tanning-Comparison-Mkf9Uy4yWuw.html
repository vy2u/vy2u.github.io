tuning in for this video this is going
to be about sunless tanning primarily
the spray it's Hanning I've done a lot
of sunless tanning with the gradual
Tanner's and the lotions that you put on
that you don't really have to you know
try too hard with you just put them on
and you gradually build a tan well I've
done a lot with that and I've kind of
felt like you know over time well I what
about those times when I really want
that instant color and I want something
just a little deeper more of a bang for
my buck I guess you'd say and just a
little bit stronger color so that was
when I started noticing about products
like Sun love and other spray tanning
items that were on the market so I did
my research and I decided I was going to
try a couple of different ones over the
course of a couple months and see which
one I liked better so after a lot of
trial and error a lot of testing I
wanted to explain to you sort of my
double review and comparison video video
on salon bronze this is a product
available for about $12 a Sally Beauty
Supply and Sun Love which is a product
that's available online and you it's
kind of like a whole little system here
so I'm going to explain them both to you
why I like certain parts about each and
why I don't like them I'm gonna try to
keep this as concise as possible it can
be kind of hard cuz I have a lot of
thoughts floating through my head right
now but basically concept of these both
of these products is that you're going
to be able to basically spray yourself
and get that airbrushed in like you
might go to a professional and get
basically you're going to get that
you're gonna both of the products
promise to give you that initial instant
bronzing because both of these products
have bronzers in them so it's gonna show
up immediately you're gonna be able to
see where it's going but then you'll
take a shower that part will wash off
and you will still have the sunless
tanning effect you'll still have that
color leftover so with the salon bronze
um this is I like the thing I like about
this is how uncomplicated it is really
to set up its quick you know there's not
a whole lot of preparation you've got
this little
no trust me I didn't shoot anything out
there but it's got this little thing
there and basically you've got a can and
like an aerosol can and to make it work
you just pop it in here until you hear
it click just like that and then once
you pull this little trigger you can
spray yourself down
and it's so it's nice in that respect
that you've just got this to worry about
and it's also inexpensive I mean twelve
dollars for this you're getting quite a
bit of product in this can and then you
just have to repurchase this can of the
salon bronze so um the the problems I
sell with this first off I felt like it
was hard to control the product like you
were putting it on and you feel like
you're getting a fairly controlled
application but the spray seems to kind
of go in a lot of places I mean unless
you've got enclosed hair and outdoors
where no one's going to see you or I
guess if you were doing it nude or you
could do it with a swimsuit or something
like that but um basically you need
somebody's help for this to make it work
best I had to have Tyler like you know
kind of spray me from a distance because
the the key to this one is really
keeping it enough distance away from you
you get it too close you're just gonna
get a buildup of color it will you know
have a strange appearance to it
afterwards if you get a good application
of this I think it looks really nice but
just know that to get the best
application it really helps to have
somebody else and do this for you be a
far enough distance away from you like I
mean I think this recommends that you
are 12 inches away with this I feel 12
inches is not enough for this and I
think it needs to be even further away
and you can just kind of keep it in sort
of a continual motion but it's not
coming out like that fine mist either
that's another big thing with this it's
coming out more like a spray okay so the
little your little aerosol can is
actually spraying then get the top here
it's spraying right out the end you've
seen how typical you know aerosols
already pressed now on the top they're
spraying out this way this with the
pressure that supplies it goes through
there
spring out the top and its really is
like a spray I don't feel like the mist
is quite fine enough it's just not I
wouldn't call this foolproof at all if
you struggle with using other kinds of
tanners this is kind of an advanced
thing I feel like and you it will be a
good idea to have somebody's help even
then you can't guarantee that they're
going to they know exactly what they're
doing so just keep that in mind this is
not a bad concept it's it is I mean not
the worst Hanning product I've used but
it was a little bit difficult so moving
on to the Sun love stuff and what this
is basically you've got this little
receptacle here you're going to pour
some of these Sun love bronzer in here
it's just kind of a deep brown color
when you pour it in you're gonna pouring
about that much you know for an
application and you've got this canned
here which is basically compressed air
and when you hear that when you push
down on this button the air is coming
out it's feeding up the Tanner right in
here and it's actually doing sort of an
airbrush type system a very very it's
calling it a micro fine mister so you're
getting a really really fine mist with
this the initial problem I had with this
product was these two little little
knobs or nubby silver tips here they
have to be perfectly aligned and when I
first used this the this one was not
pushed down all the way and this one was
not pushed in all the way see that one
pushed down that one pushed in if it's
not like that I was getting like spray
coming straight off the top like I was
I'd be trying to spray like this
and it would be coming up it would get
on my ceiling it was just not good and
so it's like something's wrong with this
and so I read a read up about it got
some advice and these need to be pressed
down so that's the first thing make sure
that these are pushed in as far as they
can go in each direction once you've got
that excuse me this is fairly easy to
use I feel like I can do it on myself I
can even get the backs of my legs and
stuff one of the keys to it is you need
to keep it flat so your
going like this you need to find a way
to kind of move your body so you are
keeping it flat as you go but that's
something that is so valuable about this
is that you can stand right there in
your bathroom you don't feel like you
have to be you know close yourself in
the shower or go out to your garage or
somewhere like that you know you can
just stand there and this is going to be
fairly contained it's not going to get
all over everything
so that was a huge plus for me on this
also um something to keep in mind what
the Sun love is you want to think in
layers you don't want to put it put on a
ton saves your first time you your skin
is not very tan at all and you feel like
okay I want that really deep dark tan
well you'll want to do it in layers not
all at once like think of putting on a
ton of nail polish on one finger because
you want a nice thick appearance of it
but then it takes forever to dry and
it's probably gonna get smudged same
concept here you want to work in like a
thin layer do one and then you know
maybe in a little while once you feel
like it's dry and it doesn't take very
long to dry either you know do a little
bit more so um it's like I what I was
after was a nice deep tan and I feel
like this can give it to me but you do
want to kind of work in layers like that
um I feel like I can do this for myself
I don't need help from someone else to
put this on obviously if I wanted maybe
a really great application on my back I
might just have somebody else do that
but I can even get the back of my legs
with this just one of the challenges is
keeping it flat and another
recommendation is to do it in spurts
like this like I might do it on my arm
like that obviously I'm not doing it
right now but um that works but I find
that doing a continual miss and keeping
it at a nice distance away from your
skin really works works nicely as well
this does have as with both of these
products they have that built-in bronzer
so you're going to see the product
immediately and then the tan will start
to develop underneath that and you also
get a lot of product in here as well
I've done quite a few applications of
this and I still have a lot of this left
and you can use it you know you can pour
back your extra right here into
son into the bottle so you don't really
end up wasting it either so anyway
that's my thought on these two products
basically you've got this the salon
bronze which is cheaper however it's
more difficult to use and you're not
probably going to get the best result I
really love the result with son love as
with everything there's a bit of a
learning curve with it you know you are
going to maybe have some trial and error
you want to make sure that your device
is all you know functioning as it should
and if you have questions I would
definitely encourage you to ask the
people at son love if they can help you
out if something's not working but
ultimately when you get the hang of this
this will be you know a great great
asset to you I feel like also with the
face oh I just can't believe I forgot
that with this they recommend spraying
this onto a sponge like a makeup sponge
and then just sponging it on on your
face which was pretty easy I would just
put the sponge in my sink spray some of
this on it and then just blot it all
over and that was really nice I do like
this for the face within that method but
yet it would be more convenient if you
could just spray yourself like this but
I think maybe they know that it's it's
hard to get that nice quite as even
application with that this son love you
can do that you can just use it on your
face I kind of go like circular motion
all over works fine I have not had any
you know crazy streaking on my face
after using this I mean you will get
that even application just remember keep
it flat and keep it a good distance away
from you and you will be fine with that
so all right definitely as with any time
you use a sunless tanner you want to
exfoliate beforehand so get a night when
you're in the shower make sure you use a
scrub you know get it right down there
on from your arms to your legs to
everywhere if you have been sunless
tanning before using some of these
products it's also important to do that
so you're basically getting the sole
effect of one of these products and it's
not layering over you know residue of a
past sunless tan you know I mean so
anyway that's my thoughts on both of
them I really would recommend the Sun
loves
because it works fantastic once you get
the hang of it and it's once again it's
a healthy tan it's not spending time out
in the Sun and you're still getting the
look you want so thanks so much guys for
tuning in for this video and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
