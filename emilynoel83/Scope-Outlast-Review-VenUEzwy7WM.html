this video this is going to be a review
of some new cheap teeth the dental let's
get dental products that tyler and i
have been using lately and it's all kind
of from a certain line of products and
it's fairly new and if it's not in your
store yet it probably will be soon and
its products by scope / pressed and it's
outlast so you've heard of like
long-wearing lipstick and all that kind
of thing well these are um dental care
products that are supposed to really
last I guess the freshness of your mouth
is supposed to last a lot longer so we
have been trying them out and Tyler's
kind of but he has a lot of opinions
when it comes to these guys that things
like roomful yeah like I'll bring home a
certain kind of toothpaste or something
and he will have like several rooms you
know problems with it I didn't even
think about so that's why I wanted to
involve him in this process as well and
so I just thought to be funny how
something different from makeup for a
change and something everybody no matter
if you're a guy or girl tuning in you
might want to know about so how about we
start with it let's start with the
toothpaste maybe two please yeah okay so
this is bike and others love it this is
by Chris yeah but it is it's the scope
out last line it's called long-lasting
mint and it does say extra whitening
power plus plus Brett feels fresh longer
so Tyler what did you think about this I
really liked it that was my favorite of
the three I thought of the 3d map things
we're talking about I think it's best to
post I've used why because I really did
notice that it lasts longer like I've
we've been eatin after using it and
still felt minty afterwards really I
like the texture of it when you're
brushing your teeth too I also like the
texture I mean this isn't like a gel
it's kind of like a paste /
Jill which is kind of interesting you
probably won't be able to tell here with
the lighting I have but it is like a
creamy paste with gel kind of like
twisted in with it and I I would beg to
differ on whether or not this is the
item that we're going to be talking
about because we've got this a mouthwash
and some like flosser pics they were
going to be talking about and I thought
the mouthwash kind of gave a longer
lasting effect than this did and another
thing I didn't quite like about the
toothpaste was the whitening because
i've used crest vivid white regularly
usually before this and we'd run out so
this is what we started using and i
thought that this did not widen as much
so that was the big my biggest problem
so i would probably go back to using
crest vivid white but I I mean I do
agree it tastes great like it's it
doesn't have that kind of chemically you
know like baking soda type flavor to it
but yeah I just wasn't too impressed
with the whitening but I even noticed
that lasted longer before I knew it was
supposed to be long lasting I didn't
know who that was supposed to be that
wait until you just said it now yeah so
cool all right so overall you know I
guess we'll give it maybe if if we're
getting two thumbs up or one thumb up
maybe like one what are you gonna do I
give it give it one for that now the
mouthwash I really like this is probably
my favorite mouthwash that I'm used and
this is again in the long-lasting mint
there's a peppermint flavor to on this
stuff but it is the scope outlast and
it's supposed to basically it says scope
a lets out last with outlast technology
keeps your breath feeling fresh longer
to give you confidence and it says 37
uses in this container here and I really
like this like I like this better than
I've used listerine and I've used act
and several other kinds i think i did
use maybe add some sort of crest
mouthwash a while back but i like this
that's because i really could tell this
last
a long time after I used it see I didn't
notice anything special about that so
here's what you do you try both of them
because some people like the toothpaste
better and some people like mouthwash
but right so basically I mean I do I
think that's probably the best idea if
you're really self-conscious about your
breath and your and you like that kind
of cool fresh feeling in your mouth like
when you start the day or before you go
to bed I would use them both in
conjunction with one another it's just
like using your favorite body wash and
then putting lotion on and then putting
the body spray on it last longer for
your mouth I think it makes sense to use
the same toothpaste and this and it
would probably keep you keep your breath
fresher broke I would think so but I do
really like this and I did notice a
difference from some of the other ones
I've tried I've tried others that are
more like a fluoride type rinse and
while those are doing good things for
your teeth and I feel like this is as
well but um I guess I just feel like
this was less mild it definitely was a
real crisp minty taste now you take the
lead with these because the this is your
your ballgame here Tyler always uses
these philosophers I use them all the
time and leave them around the house and
varying they're always there everywhere
there's my mean I will I will take you
know between us and clean up one day and
then three days later I'm going around
straightening things up again I will
find like five of these things just
sitting around randomly like he's going
to go back and use it again or something
I don't know it but these are the scope
out outlast floss picks and these are
good to have I prefer I overall prefer
using these like pics instead of just a
roll of dental floss I'm Way better at
flossing once we got these like I used
to not floss regularly enough at all and
then once we started buying different
pics you just sit around and we just
sits around and flawless multiple times
a day it's good you know you just got
time yeah mike is a lot for salaries
velocity anyway these are excellent
especially I would say the floss part of
these are better Lee it has like it's
like flat yes I want something like a
plastic kind of we call it plastic the
it says it says texture slide technology
on the floss it's like a flat flat for
us really yeah Suzy to get it in between
your teeth my dad really feels break up
I noticed that too because my teeth are
really like my teeth are packed very
close together I've been told that by
many dentists and hygienists that have
floss my teeth before and this does you
can get all the way through your mouth
and this little guy isn't gonna like
start to wear and tear and as far as
this having the scope outlast in it that
you don't rely on these two like fresh
in your way doesn't minty taste to it
when you have your mom it's not not
anything that's gonna that's gonna why I
just ripped it yeah it's pretty Minji
but it does not compare to that Mouse
not a million yeah I've been 40 other
than clean your mouth i like it would
you repurchase these yeah I would okay
and all this stuff I mean a stuff here I
find in your drugstore you're not going
to pay any outlandish or different
amount for this stuff than you are
probably your typical toothpaste and
mouthwash and stuff like that but
basically it's a new concept it's going
to last longer it's going to keep your
breath fresh longer and if you really
want the full effect you know i would go
ahead and get the get the toothpaste in
the mouthwash and use them together
these you know if you're a fan of floss
picks might want to give them a try but
overall i really like this stuff yeah it
was really good although i probably will
end up using crest vivid white
toothpaste just for the whitening we
might have to purchase two different
kinds toothpaste then next time this
will be a big step for us stupid
knock-down drag-out in the drugstore yes
I can see that happen alright guys well
thank you so much for tuning in for this
video
hopefully learned a thing or two about
some mouth I thank you cuz my mouth
products teeth products what's the word
