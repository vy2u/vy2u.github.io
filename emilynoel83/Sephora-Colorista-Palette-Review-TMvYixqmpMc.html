makeup lovers out there if you really
love makeup I totally think this product
I'm going to talk about in this video is
right up your alley
it is a palette within a pal about
getting a whole library of colors lips
eyes cheeks everything and you just pick
out the shades you want on any given day
and you can totally rework your mini
palette within the larger palette it's a
really cool concept and I'm so glad that
the quality of the product seems to live
up to the creativity of this idea and so
it's the Sephora color ista palette this
is $36 I found it at Sephora I just kind
of walked past it and thought oh you
know it's another palette with a bunch
of colors in it I have some of those but
this was something that's a totally
different Cosmo
40 different eyeshadows a range of
neutrals highlights dark shades colorful
smoky you name it you're going to get
five different eyeliners 15 lip glosses
four blushes and two bronzers although I
think that it may vary in terms of skin
tone whether something turns out to be a
blush or like a highlight for you you
also get a little plastic tool that
you're going to be able to use to take
these individual colors out and then
you've got your little palette within a
palette here you've got this smaller guy
that is about the size of you know maybe
a powder palette or a blush or bronzer
or whatever it's just real small and in
here here it is empty there's a spot for
two blush or bronzer and six of the
other colors you could put in for
shadows and two lip colors or five
shadows and one liner you know however
you want to configure it you have that
comes with a mirror there's also a
mirror in the larger palette too now you
can absolutely just use the larger
palette as is don't have to move
anything don't have to take anything out
but right off the bat here I want to
show you how you can actually remove
these shades it's very simple you use
this tool you kind of stick it in what
are these
bitty holes that are next to each of the
shadows do you kind of see how there's a
little spot there where you can pry them
out there's hardly any prying to this
they are magnetized in there they easily
come out and you just pick whichever
ones you want and put them in your
little pallet
so I just taken some of my favorite
shades in this whole kit and put them
into my little pallet and I can take
that with me to work I can put it in my
bag it's great to have that kind of
portability I was actually really
impressed with the quality of the mat
colors both light and dark I feel like
sometimes whether they're small
drugstore pallets or larger pallets
brands seem to have a hard time nailing
the mat colors and making them really
rich and pigmented as they should be
so I was pleased with that I was
pleasantly surprised about that a lot of
these shimmery shades or slightly
metallic shades are really really nice
there are some have tiny flecks of
glitter and there are others that are
more like I said just metallic and the
metallic ones are really buttery and
just nice to use I feel like some of the
glittery ones are a little more hit and
miss just because when you put glitter
in you take away some of the true
pigmentation and color and saturation
that that that that products gonna have
is this the most richly colored palette
you'll ever use no there are other
colors that I've tried here and they're
from different brands that might top
some of these but then there are some
individual shades where I found myself
thinking I would love to have a
full-size in this you know the one
downfall these are about the size of
safe you have a Coastal Scents 88
palette this is the size of each one of
these individual pans and you know
you're just not getting a lot of each
it's great if you're trying to think
about you know maybe I want to branch
out and try some blues you just have you
know a row of Blues here to try you've
got some greens some Purple's Pink's
about three rows and neutrals and one
row of kind of black white charcoal
smoky shades as a whole
I enjoy the eye shadows and I think
they're a vast improvement from past
Sephora palettes
let's talk about the liners you're
getting a teal a bronze a plum a deep
metallic charcoal and a black these
remind me a lot in terms of their feel
of like the elf cream liners which I
like they glide on very easily they're
not as dense as say you know the wet and
wild black liner it's it's a little got
a little more thickness it's a little
more creamy a little more saturated
black color I don't get that same
feeling with these these would also more
easily double as an eyeshadow base
because of that because of the fact that
they're not so thick they're not so rich
you could put one of these on and have
an excellent cream base so I wouldn't
probably use these as my go-to eyeliner
because I feel like they're not as rich
and I felt like I did have a little bit
of fading with the you're also getting
15 lip glosses and I want to make it
clear that these are lip glosses
sometimes when you get these palettes
it's like a lipstick in a pan and you
have to kind of press hard if you want
to put your finger in there you know
black put some on with your finger I
learned the hard way that these are soft
if you look at one of these that I have
here you can see where I like I put my
finger in there and it's you know for
lack of a better word its goopy these
are lip glosses put in pans so I could
see a potential for this getting a
little bit messy as you transfer and
possibly if you get a little bit of you
know hey I'm going to dig so here you
put it on and and it gets to be a little
too much so use them carefully they are
really pretty I have one of them on
right now actually it's kind of this
raspberry shade right here some are
sheer some have a little shimmer most of
them are creamy and kind of a nice rich
color finally the last element to this
palette are the blushes and the bronzers
the top two on each side are mapped out
as being blushes and the bottom tor
bronzers this will probably change
depending on what your skin type is for
example that's not a blush for me that's
going to be more like a highlight for my
medium skin this is a beautiful matte
shade it's actually kind of like a deep
dusty
um liking this light pink I actually
have that on my cheeks right now odds
are definitely not quite dark enough to
do a lot of contouring with and they
both have shimmer so they're not going
to be your ideal contouring bronzers but
they are gonna be good for just kind of
sweeping over your face to give yourself
a little bit of glow so again you've got
your whole pallet everything is
magnetized you've got a little space
here where your baby palate fits right
in and you've also got this little tool
that helps you pop out the shadows they
pop out very easily there's nothing
difficult about it and when they
magnetized back in you don't feel like
they're gonna fall out so the mechanics
of this palette are really quite good
what I need to keep in mind is that not
everybody is a makeup addict like I am
so where this is seems like so much fun
to me I got to realise that there are
people out there they're much more
comfortable just buying a quad or a trio
or maybe just one or two individual
shadows and using those and not having
to make a decision every time you you
put together a palette you know what I
mean so if you are that person if you
don't really like getting something and
knowing I'm really only going to use a
couple of these shades this may not be
for you but if you do like the feeling
of having some control over what you
wear that day and what you take with you
and the thought that you can mix and
match put together your own palette and
take whatever you want with you that day
you're gonna enjoy this very easy it's
very personalized I love that aspect I
hope you guys enjoyed this review and
you learned a thing or two about this
palette don't forget for more makeup
