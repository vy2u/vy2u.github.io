little comparison video comparing a
couple of different kinds of shade
adjusting foundations and there are
several of these out on the market right
now and the basic concept behind them is
that when you may be a squirt them out
on your finger or it when you get them
right out of the container they appear
to be colorless basically they might be
like a creamy consistency or something
like that but there are little particles
in these foundations that claim to
magically adjust to your skin tone and
I've tried out a couple and I'm going to
just compare them for you and kind of
give you my take on what I like best the
first one is wet and wild intuitive
blend foundation and the other one is
the almay smart shade makeup okay so I'm
just to take you through the description
of the first the wet and wild this is
fairly new out in stores and by the way
packaging is extremely similar but
anyway this says breakthrough shade
adjusting technology starts out white
and adjust to match your exact shade
unique primer properties soothe and
perfect skin with a silky flawless
finish and the way this works this was
actually the first item of this type
that I had tried and so you've got you
just you know squirt it out on your
finger and it does appear to be white it
appears you know just like sort of a
lotion or a moisturizer and I don't know
if you can see the little like beads
that are in that and when you touch the
beads they basically break open to give
you sort of a I'm trying to best it show
this to you they break apart and you end
up getting like a creamy beige kind of
foundation shade okay so the little
beads break apart and you've got
foundation um it is a very very light
coverage like if there if anybody
created something instead of like a
tinted moisturizer but called it like a
tinted primer that would be probably
exactly what this is it's very very
light I don't get a lot of coverage with
it I've only worn it a few times because
I really didn't have a lot of times when
I only wanted to feel like I was wearing
primer with hardly any color on my skin
you do i mean the the little beads it's
like I almost think that it would be
better if there were maybe more beads or
the beads were a little bit um like
finer like not quite the size of like a
cake sprinkle like those were those
little ground balls you know and I think
if they were more of those you would get
more color and therefore more coverage
with it so really for me I didn't think
this was worth it for someone who is
going out thinking they're getting a
foundation and then they get this and
they don't get the coverage they want so
this was around five dollars which is I
mean if you're used to buying Wet'n'Wild
products that's sort of towards the more
expensive end of wet and wild so you
know you're not a lot of money but I
really feel like you know it had a nice
feel of a primer but um it felt kind of
slick like my face felt kind of slick
afterwards and I don't know I just
really didn't enjoy the coverage I got
it was not much at all so then I tried
the alum a smart shade makeup because I
kind of got into the slow like obsessive
feeling like we can one of these
foundations work are they all like this
I just had a hunch that they weren't so
I wanted to try the Elm a smart shade
and by the way the shade that I tried in
the wet and wild was light on the shade
that I got in this was light medium
there are generally only a few shades
that you have to choose from with these
okay and with the AL may I kept my
packaging this didn't really come in a
package but with the Elm a product here
it actually says on the prep on the
packaging magically transforms into your
ideal shade I really don't think there's
any magic to this guy's because if there
was then there would only be one oops
you wouldn't have to pick from light
medium or light or dark or whatever you
know it would just you know it would
truly be magic if you could just pick
one up and it would work for your skin
tones so basically you pick from a
general color family and it's only going
to get so light or so dark now you may
enjoy just only having to pick from like
two or three options i mean i'll admit
that made it a lot easier for me to just
pick light/medium rather than picking
from classic beige and true beige and
creamy beige and
bitch you know it really really
simplified I don't know why I can't hold
on to it but it simplified the process a
lot so even though you do have a choice
to make it's not a hard choice and so
anyway with this particular one excuse
me this is the Elm a smart shade and it
does have an SPF 15 what did the
wet'n'wild I don't think the wet'n'wild
had an SPF in it not that it doesn't say
it on the packaging anyway so with this
this is more along the lines of the
concept that I was um thinking would
work better this appears just a little
bit beige actually already on my fingers
and it has very very fine a little bitty
particles in there that look you know
tinier than grain of sand absolutely
just they just look like little bitty
particles and basically there's more of
them than there are those little bead
looking things that were in the wet and
wet and wild and basically you just rub
that and it goes from the creamy white
to actually a foundation shade there so
as i rub it on my fingers I don't know
how well that's showing up but it is
just like a nice base foundation shade
and really I mean I don't think it's
going to transform magically past that
shade I mean you put it on and it is not
a super full coverage foundation I would
call this like a medium coverage I would
call the wet and wild like light to no
coverage and I would call this more of a
medium coverage because it gives you
more color on your face but I mean they
really couldn't pull this off if if
there was you know if the there was tons
of color coming through on the
foundation you know I mean then it would
be a little more obvious if you were off
so I think they make it a little more of
that medium coverage so it can work for
multiple skin tones and appear to adjust
even though it's really only going to
get so light or so dark depending on
that color family that you get light
light medium dark whatever um but I I'm
wearing the AL mate today and I was
really happy with the coverage it gave
me and I thought you know if you have
generally fairly clear skin or you have
skin I mean you don't like the feeling
of a thick foundation I think you'll
like this a lot it's less coverage than
colorstay
or the Rimmel lasting finish but I think
you can really get by with that I mean
if you don't have problematic skin or
you don't have a lot of things you want
to cover up and it's also summertime in
that lighter feel is nice also if you
top that off with a loose powder I
really like the finish that that gives
and so I think you'll be happy with the
almay smart shade if this is something
you're looking for if you don't like
searching through the stores to try to
find the ideal shader you feel like
there's too much to choose from and you
just want it to be simplified I think
you will enjoy this type of foundation
but just be aware there's really not
that much magic going on here these are
set to that you know the little
particles basically burst as you blend
and it will turn into a shade that I
think will work for most skin tones
depending on which shade you pics so
anyway though almay was probably around
$12 this was about oops they're so slick
this was like five so more than double
the price but I think you're going to be
saving yourself and longer because I
think you're really going to use this
and you're probably gonna like this a
lot better this i will probably hardly
use it all from the wet and wild um so
anyway that's good a one other very
important point if you love to use like
a stippling brush for your foundation I
would not recommend using one of those
with this makeup simply because i think
these really act off of your hand
touching your face and really in a more
firm motion that a stippling a light
stippling brush is going to give you you
know really works it into your skin and
allows those little particles to you
know release the color so i would
recommend using your hands to apply
these foundations just because it lets
that happen and I think get the most
even coverage that way the stippling
brush was so light I wonder if it would
even cause the wet and wild stuff to
those little particles to burst now one
additional little bonus review here is
for the almay smart shade concealer that
they have so that's a little and it's
the SPF 15 I got it in light my
foundation was light medium but I
thought for
this it may be a good under eye product
so I went just a hair lighter than the
foundation and I'm wearing that today
but I did put my Kat Von D tattoo
concealer over some parts because I just
don't think this is quite good enough
coverage to be a concealer it's it's not
hardly any more coverage I couldn't
quite tell you for sure that this is
more coverage than this and that's a
problem you want your concealer to be a
little bit heavier coverage because I
mean it you want it to cover up things
that your foundation couldn't and I have
a little problem with this on that level
it's the same concept to I mean you
squirt it out of the tube and it's gonna
look you know sort of like that you put
it on and it turns into you know a
creamy just light kind of shade so I'm
not so sure that this is worth it if you
if you are looking to cover up some some
problems like the under eye circles I
even struggled I have some like kind of
broken capillaries right there around my
nose and I struggle to really cover
those up with this either so I wouldn't
necessarily recommend the concealer but
I do enjoy the foundation quite a bit
from Al mace so if you're willing to
spend you know more than double the
price of this $12 still isn't bad and I
do think you will you will get use out
of this and enjoy it so um thank you
guys so much for tuning in for this
video sorry if I got a little
long-winded on some of these but it is
sort of a hard concept to describe a che
digesting foundation but hopefully this
informs you the next time you go to the
drugstore and you'll find something you
like so thanks for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
