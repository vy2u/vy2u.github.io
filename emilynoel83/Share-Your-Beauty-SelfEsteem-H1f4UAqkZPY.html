doing so good I am so pleased to tell
you that you know that pole I've been
talking about the YouTube on the rise
pole well we won yay for beauty
broadcast thank you so much to everyone
who took the time to run over to that
website and place a vote because it was
amazing something like more than twenty
four thousand votes were cast for for my
channel and so I just think that's
incredible I'm not sure exactly like
what's gonna come of this but it's some
sort of feature on the front page of
YouTube so you can bet I will keep you
all posted on what ends up happening
there but I just can't thank you enough
like I think that was so sweet of people
to take the time and then not only do
that but shoot me like a nice tweet or a
nice Facebook message you know of
encouragement and I just love that and I
hope it means more and more great things
for this channel and for everyone who
watches so thank you so much for the
hooking off a new series I brought it up
on my you broadcast Facebook page not
too long ago and the page itself kind of
inspired me because um if you've ever
visited the beauty broadcast Facebook
page I know there are tons of fan pages
out there and like you go to somebody's
fan page and it's like you know maybe
it's just a bunch of random comments or
like you know praise for that one
particular person and there's so many
nice things on there but this is really
a helpful resource for people because
everybody is helping each other like if
one person posts a question like five or
six people get on there and post it you
know a suggestion or an answer have you
tried this product and then somebody
gives their insight and there is so much
knowledge and so many kind helpful
people here and I really want you to
come be part of it um but I thought you
know there's so much to offer what can I
do to start incorporating this into
videos
so I want to start a new series called
share your beauty and it's gonna be
different topics you know some are gonna
be you know out-and-out makeup related
you know what are your tips on this or
that you know I'll give you a specific
idea give you a few days to get on there
and respond to it and then I'll make a
video kind of actually sharing your that
you know the things that you have
written but I thought the first one I
wanted to start off with was actually
more of an abstract concept which is
self esteem I think that's something we
all struggle with at some points in our
life more than others I just thought
some of these responses were so helpful
and if you're not having a very good day
today or you know it's just not been a
good week or you know something's not
going your way I hope you read this and
even if you're having a great day I hope
you I mean I hope you listen to this and
remember these things and take them with
you because I'm just reading through
this now I feel like a little I'm seeing
things a little bit clearer first
comment is from Sarah and she says she
passed along a quote being happy doesn't
mean everything is perfect it just means
you've decided to see beyond the
imperfections she says this helps me
when I'm having a low day everybody's
got their issues even the quote perfect
ones and I think that's so true you know
we we have a lot of positives and a lot
of negatives and how many times have you
know a string of things happen to you in
a day and you like cling to the negative
ones you know those are the ones wearing
on your brain not the you know really
nice thing someone did or said for you
and it's it's a shame but I think we
need to hang on to those positive things
and just embrace them instead of the
things that made us not so happy me says
something my dad used to say to me
growing up rings true to me he said do
not set yourself to someone else's
standards because in the end we all put
our pants on the same way one leg at a
time ain't that the truth I love that
one I love that phrase because I mean no
matter if you it kind of goes back to
like putting different people you know
on a pedestal like celebrity or somebody
like that I kind of try to be what they
are when really you should just be
trying to be yourself had to pass along
this one
my sister got on there and shared a
couple comments and she is just very
wise and insightful and so I wanted to
share hers as well she says don't
compare yourself with the Photoshop
beyond belief images of women in
magazines and ads don't compare yourself
with the women whose faces can't move
due to Botox and surgery
learn to see beauty and laugh lines
freckles curves and anything else we're
not supposed to have also that is it on
your face nobody cares about it they're
all too busy worrying about their own
zits I love that because oh my gosh how
many times has there been something
wrong with your hair your outfit your
makeup like a zit on your face or
something like that and you yourself are
so you know crazy about it but yet how
many people really really care about
that you know and our whispering about
yours isn't like no you know everybody's
got their own issues and to kind of
think that you are so high on their list
or you you know like your your small
imperfection is that big a deal with
anybody else you know don't worry about
that's a great way to think about it
because everybody's got the same problem
Loreena says confidence it's like
diamonds if it's not real pretend it is
walk like it is and soon it will be
don't you love that I love that phrase
because sometimes just putting that
smile on your face and acting like you
got it all together even when you don't
you know it just makes you feel better
it just gets you in the right frame of
mind
sometimes that's especially important on
mondays like I didn't have the best
Monday this week I I don't know it just
Mondays tend to be not so much a bad day
but it's the day all the little bitty
problems stack up to just make you kind
of like frustrated at yourself and it's
like you know okay didn't turn on the
coffee pot ahead take pop to work
spilled the pop all over my desk you
know it was kind of like one of those
little chain reaction days and so I mean
sometimes if you just pretend it's all
going right and laugh it off and put a
smile on your face it all seems just a
little bit better if you can do that I
know some days it's very hard to do even
that next up we have a comment from
Emily not me but the another in
um she was talking about how she had
some some issues with self-confidence in
high school I had to kind of break down
the comment a little bit but she had
some self-esteem self-confidence issues
she says then one day I decided that
that was done trying to please others
and started doing stuff that made me
happy and by doing the things that I
love doing it brought my self-esteem and
confidence in myself so for the days
that I feel really low about myself I
start writing about everything that's
going on in my mind at the time which
helps me take the burden off my
shoulders after that she says I go to my
make up station and start playing with
my first love makeup I love that you
know some getting into you know she's
really got a point there kind of you
know you let it all out there you see I
mean writing can be so therapeutic at
times when you're stressed and you feel
like you can't you can hardly keep track
your thoughts you know you write all
down and then you completely set it
aside and move on to something different
and makeup for me and like probably many
of you watching it's one of those thing
you can kind of fall into and your
thoughts just kind of roll and it's like
it's kind of a de-stressor sometimes so
that's a great thing and I mean just
kind of the point she got at there was
done trying to please others there is a
book and that I have that really focuses
on the issue of being so concerned about
people liking you and it's just the
whole issue with self confidence and
loving yourself and I really recommend
this book to anybody that wants to kind
of delve into this topic further but
it's from robin meade she's actually a
warning news anchor on HLN morning
express and her book is called morning
sunshine and she kind of goes through
her career but and while this is a
newscaster you guys might think well
sure that's interesting for you Emily
but I mean it's seriously a great book
for anyone to read you're going to get a
lot of good insight on it and it's gonna
kind of change the way you set yourself
out there for people you are going to I
think approach the world after reading
this book with more confidence in
yourself and less concern over the
little things people might think about
you and the little judgments people may
make and I mean the book obviously goes
through how that all happens
but it's very interesting and I would
really really recommend that to anybody
that's maybe just anybody let's put it
out there anybody I would have guys
girls who a trance says my advice for
self-esteem is more of a daily habit to
make myself feel better by sharing a
smile with others before 10 a.m. each
day I try to say a variant of these
phrases good morning have a great day -
at least five people with a smile she
says it makes me feel better about
myself putting a bit of happiness into
the world at the start of my day it
really sets the tone so much of this is
coming into life them you know the
morning you know you're starting your
day it's all about how you start your
day and setting the tone for the day and
I love that she's making a point to say
this thing then you know those little
bumps in the road later don't seem quite
so bad because you sort of started on a
good note you've gotten that positivity
kind of rolling through you and I think
it's great passing it on to others and
that kind of rolls into my tip which is
sometimes when you're so overly
concerned with yourself you're having
issues with your self-confidence your
self-esteem is feeling low you're having
insecurities I think one of the best
releases for that can be passing along a
kind word to someone else because then
you're thinking about someone else
you're doing something good which is
putting good feelings back in you for
doing that it feels good it feels good
to tell you know to tell somebody man
you look great today or love that hairdo
you got going on or you know that that
story you did yesterday was really
awesome or whatever it may be in your
life passing that along to see somebody
else feel happy or feel a little bit
boosted by your comment that you gave is
a very contagious feeling so I just
think really don't overlook those
opportunities that you have and when
you're thinking something good about
someone say it don't just hold it in
like don't just think I mean I've done
it before you know whether it's about
the you know outfit someone had on the
way they did something
thing they just said that was so funny
right you know this or that why do we
not say certain things just let them out
you know try to say what you're thinking
when it's a good positive thought go
ahead and say it because maybe that
person really needed to hear it that day
and maybe you're that person so maybe it
comes back to you if everybody's
listening to this so anyway guys I hope
this was beneficial I feel like this was
therapeutic for me to talk about anyway
and I hope you enjoyed this look for
more of these share the beauty topics
posted on my Facebook page like I said
they may be more hands-on you makeup
related or more just life lesson type
things like this but everybody has such
good insight I couldn't even have time
to share all the awesome things that
were said there but you can definitely
look it up on the Facebook page if you
want to and read through them all
because they are all very good so thanks
a lot for watching guys have a wonderful
day and I will talk to you later
I'm sweetie
oh yeah that feels good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
