video as promised is all about shea
moisture and this is a brand that you
probably more commonly know for their
hair and body products but more recently
they've come out with a line of makeup
and I found it at Ulta I've also well
initially purchased it off the Voltas
website and I've heard some people have
found it in Target stores too I think
this is really exciting because I found
some key makeup items that I really
really like from this brand so I'm
excited to share those with you today
you can see some applications happening
that hopefully answer some questions
about these products for you I've got
foundation concealer blush a couple of
eyeshadow palettes several different lip
products so we're gonna jump in and
start off talking about this foundation
it's called the weightless Shea serum
foundation says natural finish and I
have this in the shade nude and you will
notice if you look on ulties website
there is a rather large shade range but
it can make like the lightest shade seem
like the only light shade and everything
else seems really deep I find it's very
hard to get an accurate feel for shades
off the Voltas website it's just they're
very awful lot of times so you might
look to targets website or and try to
see these products in person if you can
to get a good sense of what shade you
might be but my point here is there is a
large shade range and it appears to go
very very dark as well as light
packaging lights here we've got a
plastic bottle there is a pump for me I
don't feel like I even need a full pump
of this it's a thin foundation it's very
lightweight I was describing this in my
best in beauty video recently it has a
nice kind of slip across the skin and
the finish is not totally matte it
doesn't seem to be dewy and glowy it's
just kind of somewhere in the middle
maybe a semi matte finish or like a
satin finish might be the best way to
describe it it's really that perfect
middle ground of a foundation finish for
me but what surprises me above
everything that's going on great with
this foundation it also has incredible
coverage so I'm going to show you this
going on and by the way this particular
shade
a little bit dark for my skin but once
everything all blends out it seems to
look fine I pump out a little bit on my
hand
and I used my Sigma let's see it's the
f-84 brush any kind of dense brush I
think works really nicely with a thin
lightweight foundation like this I just
start dabbing it all over the skin and I
think you can just really see the
amazing level of coverage that this has
some of the key things that they tout
about this foundation are the key
ingredients which are shea butter and
vitamins C and E also it's free of
parabens Talent gluten sulfates Silicon
Valley it's mineral oil and synthetic
fragrance I've described it as a very
similar consistency to the Tarte
rainforest of the sea foundation only I
think this has a little more moisture to
it I just feel it more at right after
it's applied you know I just feel like
my skin's had a little bit more of a
drink of moisture through this
foundation that's not to say it couldn't
work for someone with a combo skin type
I think because it's so lightweight it
could still be workable for someone with
combo skin that's kind of what my skin
type gets into this time of year I tend
to be a little more oily around the
t-zone and I don't feel like it's too
much for me
but I think dry skin normal skin would
really enjoy this - it doesn't have like
a sticky finish on the skin but there is
that little bit of moisture I can feel
there I like to just top it off with a
light bit of powder doesn't take a lot
but I think just a little bit of powder
can really help the longevity on my skin
and speaking of staying power you know I
think about what if I put this through
you know just going through full days in
a fairly climate controlled environment
you know I haven't really noticed any
staying power issues with this I think
it still stays looking pretty fresh and
I think part of that comes from it not
being a drying looking foundation from
the start
but I haven't put this through a lot of
sweat a lot of you know intense outdoor
activity and stuff like that so I'll
have to continue using it and get back
to you on how well it lasts in more
intense conditions all in all I think
this is an awesome foundation really
really enjoying it and it probably is my
top favorite thing from the line next
thing is this perfecting face cream trio
it says conceal contour and highlight
and I have
this in the shade fair I got fair
because I thought the next shade seemed
too dark to conceal and highlight with
however this shade seems a little too
light to contour with because this is
the shade and there's a little guide
that comes with this and this would be
the shade that they say to contour with
this is the concealer and then like a
brightening highlight type shade in the
tone of this concealer type shade it's
just very yellowy I'm not really like
getting what is this doing for me like
it doesn't seem to correct very well on
my skintone it just seems a little bit
on the dark side and then this contour
color it doesn't really make an impact
at all on my skin and in the highlight
shade I can kind of get somewhere with
this product because it is definitely
brighter than my skin tone I can apply
it you know kind of on the under eye
area and feel like I've gotten a little
bit of a lift going on there another
small issue I have here that these two
shades seem to be like kind of a nice
consistency kind of creamy but not
greasy they do seem to like have some
coverage to them they're not too thin
and I don't know what it is but this
shade that's labeled the concealer it
seems to be thicker and more dry and
it's like a real effort has to be made
to get it off of here and onto your skin
and if I'm going to be using a concealer
around the under eye area which is kind
of my main place for it I kind of want
that concealer to offer a little extra
moisture to that area I don't want it to
start looking dry at the onset because
odds are it will only continue to look
more dry as the day goes on so one way I
could see kind of salvaging this product
and getting more use out of it might be
combining these two shades and turning
that into a bit of a corrector because
see how this shade has a bit more orange
in it and then I've got this light color
I wonder if you know the combination of
those two might turn into something
that's a little more workable like to
correct the under-eye the next thing
that I got that I had a pretty good
experience with and would you know try
more of these from their line is the
blush it's the mineral blush in sand and
I ordered this off the website I was
kind of surprised that it turned out to
be this dark but it really comes off as
a nice sort of rosy shade on the cheeks
and I want to show you a little
comparison
to the Cola pop shade of the Clinique
cheek blush which I love that color
and this is a lot like that probably a
little lower-cost alternative to that I
can see a little bit more red in the
Clinique shade this goes a little more
neutral and it doesn't quite have that
intense like practically staining
staying power that the Clinique blushes
do but this particular blush sheared out
I really do like the way it looks on my
cheeks like I said kind of just a soft
rosy flush if you want to apply it that
way and I don't even feel like I have to
be that careful with it but as you can
see just a swatch there shows you just
how dark it can go so I do think deeper
skin tones all the way to my skin tone
might really like this kind of a color
now let's talk eyes shadow I know they
have some single eyeshadows but I
thought I would be able to more easily
try a little bit more if I got a pallet
so I got the lavender fields palette
first and then more recently when I
found the line in my Ulta store I
thought this looked like a really
beautiful one as well this one's called
desert sand but these are six color
eyeshadow palettes it says on the back
you can use them wet or dry so far I've
only used them dry I've really been
pleased with the level of pigmentation
that they have dry so I don't think I
would feel the need to use them wet in
an effort to make them more bold because
I think they're plenty bold as is what
the adding wetness to them might do is
help out some of the shimmery shades
that can be a little bit dusty I noticed
that particularly with the lavender
lavender fields palette here which I
can't open like these three lightest
shades here they all have some shimmer
and I just find them to be a little bit
dusty kind of go everywhere when you
pack them on they still have a good
amount of color payoff you know but they
could just be a little while to work
with so maybe those could benefit from
being worn wet but in this color palette
you've got a couple of vivid and kind of
deep matte shades here with the purple
and the blue I like this sort of
in-between err dusty lavender color
right there you've got a lighter
kind of brighter lilac a pinky shade and
then kind of a light golden champagne
color so this was what I used today for
my eye look and I'll show you these
colors going on I used a primer first
and I used I guess I used like my trio
method yeah maybe you watch that video
from my easy.i week series and I use
this lightest shade on my lid then I
went to this really pretty kind of
shimmery dusty plum color and I padded
that on the outer part of my lids and
also wedge that up into the crease just
for a quick really quick easy look here
and then just blend that out with a bear
brush next I brought in this soft warm
pink shade and applied that with my elf
priests brush just over the border kind
of like a transition shade very easy I
really like that effect it just brings
together this whole kind of pastel look
we've got going on and then up under the
brow I use that lightest color as my
highlight so very simple look overall
I've got a light nude liner on the lower
inner rim really didn't do anything
shadow wise on the lower lash line I did
some black liner some demi whispies
lashes and a little bit of mascara on
the lower lashes if I can come up with
the picture I will show a look that I
did that was a little bit brighter
incorporating some of the deeper colors
in this palette so it's a nice eyeshadow
palette if you're into the purples and
blues I think you'll enjoy it for me I
was intrigued enough to want to pick up
another one and kind of explore some
more like classic neutral tones and this
is a really nice basic palette there are
a lot of great mattes in here that I
think people would really appreciate
these two shades are Matt this is Matt
and then you've got an even darker
Browns so for those of you who like your
matte classic Browns this is gray and
then you've got a couple shimmery pops
here one that's kind of peachy and one
that's kind of a deep greenish like it's
kind of like a dark emerald because it's
definitely not olive to me and I did do
a look with this palette the other day
keeping it very neutral on the top part
of the eye and then smudging some of
this dark teal emerald color on the
lower lash line it's hard to get a lot
of pop out of that shade because it is
so dark but I like this palette it's
very basic there's
or Matt in this palette then there is in
this one and I do really like how the
matte shades behave from this line
because they really seem to be nicely
pigmented not too dusty and just very
easy to work with I would say for a
bottom line on these I really like them
they're not the best eye shadows I've
ever tried but they're definitely not
like a dud I think if you find a color
scheme from this line that really
appeals to you particularly if you see
more matte in there it's not that the
shimmer shades are bad but I think the
mattes are even more impressive now
let's talk lipsticks and the lipsticks
would have to be like my very very close
second to the foundation I mean I don't
know these are probably like right on
par with one another because foundation
and lipstick kind of like comparing
apples and oranges but I love the
lipstick I love the foundation these are
the shea butter luscious lipsticks and I
think they feel so great on the lips
it's a really really nice formula that's
got that teeny bit of thickness to it no
grease enos at all it feels kind of bomb
like and nourishing on the lips I don't
know that I've ever said this before but
it almost feels like a bite lipstick you
know like a bite
luminous cream lipstick which why are
they getting rid of those well I mean I
know they're putting out new stuff but
I'm gonna miss those I adore the
packaging here I like being able to see
the lipstick color at the bottom it's
got this semi kind of rubberized feeling
to the outside but not so tacky that
it's picking up like all your little
particles of makeup that are floating
around and then the actual tube here
love that brownish metallic look isn't
that beautiful this particular shade
that I'm holding is called nectar now
I'm not wild about this shade I will
show you it going on if anybody wants to
convince me that I should be wearing
this shade go for it but I just I don't
know it's creamy it doesn't have shimmer
I like the texture I like everything
about the consistency it's just this
color flat out on my lips like maybe if
I put a little deeper lip liner on the
outsides I might go for it some more but
I'm just I'm not wild about that shade
this was one that I ordered online my
absolute favorite lip color that I've
tried so far is red rose
and this I think is a classic easy to
wear rosy red not too bright not too
dark just perfect red perfect perfect
red for all seasons I would say and this
is another one that's creamy no shimmer
but I did get one that does have a
little bit of shimmer in it and it's
called wild orchid it's a very very dark
shade but there is just a little bit I
don't even want to call it Frost because
I feel like once it's applied you don't
necessarily see it that much but it's
just that tiniest bit of teeny shimmery
particles in this and I don't like to
put rules out there on when you can wear
this shade or when you can wear this
other shade because if it looks good on
you and you love it wear it but for me I
think I'm gonna get even more use out of
this shade in the fall and winter months
it just makes me think of fall but those
are the only three lipsticks I have
right now I would highly suggest looking
into this line now when I ordered off
the website I got a little free gift and
it was this jumbo lip pencil it actually
just says lipstick on the bottom and the
shade is Sarah and this is this pretty
magenta that I've been wearing
throughout the video it's got this
interesting like little bit blue toned
metallic twist to it
again not to the point is looking frosty
on my lips I don't feel like my lips
look that way but it just gives them a
little bit of a globe texture wise this
feels a lot like the lipsticks do so I'm
guessing there's probably just not a
whole lot of difference in formula
between the Jumbo lip pencils and the
lipstick this feels super comfortable
it's not too thin and greasy it's not
too thick or sticky but it does have
just a little bit of thickness that
really makes your lips feel nice and
hydrated and I don't really notice any
scent coming from this or the lipsticks
either so if you're sensitive to that
that's probably a good thing so that's
it thank you for hanging with me I feel
like this is gonna be a really long
video but that's what I've tried from
Shea Moisture so far I think far more
hits than misses but I'm loving the
foundation I've been wearing it for
several weeks now really enjoying it and
absolutely loving the lipsticks to the
blush and the eyeshadow palettes I think
those are good as well there
not necessarily like blowing my mind to
the next level of you know awesome
makeup but they're good I like them the
only thing that I feel like really
didn't work for me was that concealer
contour duo just cuz I don't think
there's a shade available right now that
would make all three shades totally
workable for me you know so thank you
guys for your time I know this has been
a very review heavy week because I've
just had a lot of new products I've
wanted to update you guys on but thank
you for watching I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
