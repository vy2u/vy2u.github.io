have just had the weirdest morning so
far like just doing my makeup weird
stuff happening I was trying out a new
blush it was way more than I bargained
for it I had trouble correcting that use
some dark a lash glue and that created a
whole mess that I had to correct and
then I'm setting up my lights and I just
like took the end of my cord and the
plug came up and whipped me like right
in the forehead so it's just been kind
of a mess today but I bring you a video
from my top makeup drawer where I've
done some videos on this before where
I've shot my stash for different items
things I maybe haven't been using so
much or some new things that I just want
to make a point to use and I'll put them
in that top drawer because then I know
they have a place I know where to look
for them and they won't be overlooked
well this month I thought I would do it
all about palettes because I mean I'm
getting inundated with new palettes that
are coming out and the more I try new
ballets the more I feel bad for the
palettes that have been sitting around
and haven't ever really gotten enough
use maybe they've been reviewed once or
talked about here there and then just
kind of set aside so I pulled out some
palettes that I felt like using now both
for eyes and for face and what I'm gonna
do is throughout the rest of the month
I'm gonna make a point to use these this
probably won't be the only things that I
use because I do have other things that
I want to test and review but when I am
using them I will make a point to tell
you on like snapchat or Instagram I'll
just kind of make note of what I've used
so you can see those products back in
action so let's bust into the drawer and
see what I chose so here it is this is
the top makeup drawer and I want to tell
you real quickly about the organizer
that I stuck in here I used to have some
smaller organizers which I'll probably
go back to if I'm putting smaller
products in here but for the palettes
this really accommodates them nicely
this is from Ikea and it actually came
from their kitchen department so it was
extra cheap it was just a couple of
bucks for this nice big plastic
organizer it does slide back to the
corner of the drawer and it leaves you
about this much extra along the outside
so I've kind of
scooted forward so I can more easily
make use out of the back sections but I
just wanted to let you know that's how
that fits in there it just happens to
really work well for these Alex drawers
that are the longer or wider ones but
starting off with the face products I've
tried to pull on some different things
just various purposes and consistencies
and these are the makeup forever
contour kits and they've got blushes and
each of them as you can tell if you look
closely they've got different tones of
contour in there so I am planning to get
some more use out of those also for
makeup revolution this is called the
protection palette I have it in
light/medium and what this has is
several concealers a powder and then a
bronzer blush and highlight so a lot of
face stuff in one and I really did enjoy
this palette for the brief time that I
used it so I wanted to make sure I used
it again and then I've also got these
little cream palettes that I put
together from mascara mascara is a
blogger Belle Cara is the blogger and
she has this 3d foundation system I've
talked about this in the past and it's a
really cool selection of cream products
she got contours concealer type products
which I love and then a blush a more
illuminating product and I have bought
like an additional selection of those
shades because I enjoyed these so much
so I pulled both of those palettes out
then this is the Ulta on tour kit barely
barely got any use out of that's got
contour shades and highlight shades my
on estancia contour kit I'm sure you
guys have seen this many times over on
YouTube I've used it some but I can't
say I've really bonded with this product
a whole lot so I got that out again and
then for highlighting palettes this next
strobe of genius I thought this would be
so much fun to start using again and
elfs illuminating palette these seem to
be more soft and subtle highlights and I
loved it right when I got it but you
don't need me to tell you that they're
like a million-in-one highlights on the
market and stuff can go overlooked so I
don't want it to go overlooked any more
elf has some phenomenal blush palettes
but I haven't gotten as much use out of
my dark tone richer palettes that they
offer so I've got the powders here and
the creams here and I really want to
make a point to play with
shades i know i you i don't have dark
skin but i still think they're gonna be
very usable this is my makeup revolution
blush palette in hot spice so there's
kind of a cooler one that's got a little
more pinky tones things go a bit more
peach in this palette i love it it's got
highlights in there as well and then in
the barely used category I've got these
Ulta sculpting palettes so you can see
blush bronzer highlight can't wait to
use those now on the eye side I pulled a
lot of different palettes I just wanted
to give myself a lot of variety and I
was just running into so many things
that I wanted to use more of one of them
is this makeup revolution salvation
palette this is the unicorn's unite yes
definitely want to use it more I think
there's a fun little color variety
happening in here particularly if you
enjoy the purple tones now something
super subtle and natural is this lorac
nude necessities palette now I did
review this on this channel and I
remember thinking at the start like is
this world's most boring palette but it
truly is a great like natural mix of
matte and shimmer eye contour palette
almost you know it just gives that
really natural look and I do like that
on certain days now this palette is I
believe by makeup revolution you have to
get it on makeup revolution site but my
girl Erica hooked me up with this and
it's called the chocolate vice palette
and it's kind of makeup revolutions take
on the sweet peach palette from Too
Faced
and I just have not had a chance to bond
with this thing yet so I really really
want to make a point to use that and
then I saw a random Instagram post
referencing this Too Faced Love palette
it was a really gorgeous look and I
thought I have that palette and I really
want to use it some more it's definitely
got some of that two-faced sparkle going
on in here but I think there are some
potentially beautiful fall looks that I
can get out of this palette so I'm eager
to use this some more and with fall in
mind I pulled out my BH Cosmetics Carli
bybel palette this is an eyeshadow and
highlight palette and I think this is
just a really good collaboration that
happened here because the shadows are
great quality so are the highlights it's
really nice pigmentation it's great for
those of you who
like neutrals and mathtype colors it's
really beautiful and it's just a great
price as well this is very affordable I
think you can get it on ulties website
now so yay for that and on the less
affordable side this is my Mac warm
neutrals is that what it was called for
sure yeah it's the eye shadow times 15
warm neutral palette so this was a
premade palette and I did some looks
that I absolutely adored with this thing
and then it just kind of got moved to
the back of the class for whatever
reason but there's some gorgeous shades
that exist in Mac's regular line that
are in this palette so I am pumped to
use that some more okay see if you
remember this guy because I think this
palette had like the shortest lifespan
ever it's the Sephora Pantone universe
facets of marsala palette I believe it
was called and I did a look with this I
talked about it in a video
if this palette is not full I don't know
what is all of the gorgeous Reds the
different takes on that Marsala wine
type color and then you've got all of
greens Gold's great shades to compliment
those tones and the quality on this is
really really good but it just this
palette was not around very long so I
really wanted to pull that out again and
finally from Urban Decay this is the
vice 4 palette and I just have not
bonded with this one nearly enough I
know you've heard me say that phrase a
few times in this video but it's the
truth you know some palettes you just
use over and over again and you really
enjoy and then there are others that you
dip into a couple times and they just
don't really stick with you this one I
mean I really do see the potential here
for me to love this I just need to
really dig into it try some of the
different color combinations that green
is speaking to me I'm loving these
orange e tones right here and also
what's happening on this side of the
palette too I think some soft lavender
looks are definitely going to happen
with this palette and then I've got some
skinny palettes over here on the side my
city color harvest moon eyeshadow
palette
filled with gorgeous not just neutrals
but Sun peachy shades of really pretty
berry color in there I know I love this
palette when I first used it and
swatched it out so I wanted to use it
more this is one of Molly's city chick
palettes and it's the loving life color
selection here that's a based on the
side and then you've got this beautiful
color selection here with plums and
bronze and peach and even a random mint
green thrown in and I just love this
when it first came out also let's talk
about the balms nude palette for a
second
I had such love for the nude tude
palette and then this one came out and I
just know I didn't use it nearly as much
as I did that other one and it's
definitely got some great shadows in
here a lot of neutrals there are a lot
of neutral palettes that I pulled out
but a lot of those were things that
weren't getting used also I am testing
some of my brighter
Julia's Place palettes and those are
just kind of off the charts colorful so
it doesn't hurt to pull out some of
these neutral palettes and how hilarious
is the packaging I mean I love that last
few things here this is from L'Oreal I
had done a review on la palette nude 1 &amp;amp;
2 and I wasn't really over the moon for
these palettes but I did like the two
which went a little more plummy I liked
the two a little bit better than the one
just quality wise pigmentation wise I
thought it was better so I pulled that
out to use again and then from Kat Von D
much loved products here that her shade
+ light eye quads so she's got that
great fully neutral shade + light eye
palette and then she branched off and
did some different tones in the quads
and I love and probably use the most of
my smoky one and the plum one and this
one was probably the one in my review
you might recall that I liked the least
so I kind of wanted to challenge myself
to make that work and maybe pull in a
fun shimmery green and get some good
fall olive looks with that and this one
just screams fall to me as well and
lastly here I'm pulling out my buxom
eyeshadow palette this was the one where
I customized and put in whatever shades
that I wanted and I have been using this
on and off you know fairly recently but
I was considering getting a couple of
different shadows so I wanted to play
with this some more and consider you
know what kinds of other colors I might
want to throw into this kind of amazing
how so many of those palettes aren't
really old so to speak you know they
haven't all been around that long but
they're just things that have been
underused in my collection so I would
love to know in the comments section if
you are inspired to do this throughout
the red
of the month with me what kinds of
palates would you pull out of your stash
that you feel like would be a
rediscovered gem in your collection or
just something that hadn't been used a
lot before that you'd like to get back
to again let me know in the comments
section I would love to hear and thank
you so much for watching I'll see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
