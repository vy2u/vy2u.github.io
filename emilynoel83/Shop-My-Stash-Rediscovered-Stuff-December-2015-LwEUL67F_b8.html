this video I wanted to take you through
my drawer my top drawer of my makeup
storage where I have sort of reserved
that for a shot in my stash area I
talked about this in a previous video
the first time I did this and it was
really a great experience it was great
to go through my stash and figure out
what things maybe new or old that I
really wanted to make a point to use
throwing them in a bag or a basket is
always an option that's what I used to
do but I felt like it was easier to
ignore that when I really reserved my
top drawer storage for these products I
open it up all the time I see these
things every day they're just right in
front of me and I can make a point to
work them into my daily looks and I'm so
happy with the things that I've pulled
in the drawer this time around
especially I've done something different
for my single eyeshadows the ones in the
little pants those have been sorely
ignored I'm talking about the things
that are in Z palettes so I took a spare
empty Z palette and I filled it with
shot my stash single shadows so I'm
excited to show you those so let's begin
okay everybody here's the drawer I just
left the same organizers in there and I
just think I'll leave it that way every
time and then just take out the old
stuff and plug in some new stuff that
I've shot my stash for so the things I
have over here I'll start with like the
foundation II type stuff this is my
estee lauder double wear all day glow BB
and I have this in intensity 2.0 and
this is a great product if you want a
little bit more dewy look to the skin
and I do think it has good staying power
and I've had it awhile I just haven't
used it as much as I'd like now this
other thing that I have that I've really
been meaning to use is from mascara and
she is a beauty blogger she's super nice
but I think this is called the 3d
Foundation kit and I don't even know
where to begin with this I don't know
how to use it I've got to look up some
videos and some posts to see what to do
but it's kind of I think foundation
through a highlight and contour strategy
but I intend to figure that out this
month and show it to you I'm developing
a renewed obsession with liquid
highlights
this is one from Giorgio Armani this is
number three and it's like a really
pretty like bronzy glow and it looks
really pretty mixed in with foundation
or like up above the hairline or not
above the hairline you don't want to put
it in your hair you just want to put it
around your hair along those same lines
my Revlon skin lights which I have been
using a lot and I just want to keep
using I've got bare light and peach
lights so I love those these are new
these are from Rimmel and I have barely
tried these at all so I've got
Piccadilly glow Soho glow and this is
Notting Hill glow so they've got like
varying levels of shimmer so I'm gonna
try those out and probably do a review
I've got a couple of like illuminating
pin brightening wand type things from
Catrice those would be new products that
I want to make sure I use an old
rediscovered product here is my
Maybelline master conceal I really loved
that stuff and it's kind of like I tried
it I said it was good and then I set it
aside like okay it's been tested but it
really is good and it needs more use
I've got my I feel like half the things
in here aren't focusing this is the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector
spotlight in opal so that's under the
heading of liquid highlights they're a
concealer I want to use this is my Estee
Lauder Double Wear concealer it's just a
cream concealer in to see light medium
and then I've got this small size of the
bare minerals fair skin perfecting veil
I thought you know it might be a decent
under-eye type setting product I pulled
out a much-loved bronzer from Milani the
bronzer excel in fake tan it's got a
Matt kind cool bronzer on one side the
other side has a little bit of glow to
it if you have used the Sun bunny from
Too Faced and you want something a
little step down shimmer wise this would
be a good one to use also a blush that I
love this time of year on my skin it's
purely plum from covergirl it's one of
their instant cheekbones so it gives you
like couple shades of blush and then a
highlight color which i think looks
beautiful on I love this little trio
it's a hidden gem another Catrice
product and I actually have a little
basket of some Catrice things that a
lovely viewer sent my way that I want to
as well but and this was something that
I bought from Ulta it's the absolute
rose eye palette which needs to be used
I told you guys I wanted to compare the
new elf matte and illuminating setting
mists so I've got those in my drawer so
I won't forget about that it is very
much my instinct to use black liquid
liner at all times and I haven't been
using my creams and gels enough so I
pulled one from Inglot here this is a
gorgeous blue it has an 83
set the number 83 that's the shade I
guess and then this black one from Sigma
is called wicked so I thought I'd pulled
those out to use it's the holidays so I
wanted to get some really nice
glimmering stuff out if you have not
tried the 3d liquid lustre from lorac
you are missing out I love these these
are so great for a really potent but
thin and weightless level of sparkle
like on top of your eye look if you want
to put it there it is liquid but it
dries down completely so it's super
light and I have all these shades I
jumped on a little set that was being
sold on HauteLook it was maybe last year
or something so this is the regular 3d
liquid lustre which can actually look a
little bit golden e in the sheen which
it's beautiful I love it and then I have
topaz
what's the shade platinum and amethyst I
also pulled out a couple of big mints
these are whisper pink and tan this is a
new eyelash curler I wanted to try its
Sephora brand it was supposedly
something that would work well for round
eyes you can see how it's a little bit
more like it looks like a frowny face
they're like I've used it a time or two
I'm not sure what I think yet so to be
continued Sigma has released three new
mascaras that I want to try there's
high-calibre lash syn yuasa t lash and
monumental lash I think one is
especially supposed to be good for
curling or holding curls so I'm excited
to try those some more I've still got my
benefit in our Patrol primer in here
because it just I don't know it fell
under the radar even being in this
drawer since last month
I just didn't pick it up so I'm gonna
use it this time I got a couple of the
NYX tinted brow gels which I love
of love love love these I've got
espresso is this one and this is
actually called black but it's a very
dark brown I feel like I can wear both
also wet-and-wild came out with like
this wax stick brow shapers so it was
super cheap so I thought I might use
that alongside some brow powders been
meaning to play with these maybelline
color blurs some more so I've got a
reddish one and a deep plum and then
these I really want to use the LA girl
matte liquid lip colors I had purchased
a set that contained all the shades but
I pulled out secret Fleur and frisky I
ordered a laura geller TSV a while back
the main reason why it was like a huge
thing there's tons of products in it but
the main reason was because she has a
balance and but it's in an illuminating
version so I had to try it I got it in
medium and it's gonna be too dark I'm
normally the medium or regular or
whatever she calls it in her normal
variety but look at how much dark tone
there happens to be in this one so it
does work for me as a contour but not
really isn't all over the face
foundation but there were a bunch of
things in that kit there's this brow gel
pencil there's an eyeliner of lip liner
lipstick a lip gloss and also this baked
eyeshadow trio so I've been meaning to
use that stuff okay my buddy David
you're gonna be so proud of me
he has been encouraging me to try lower
false lashes false lashes on the lower
lash line and he said the Ardell babies
are best for that and I've had them and
I've just been scared to attempt this I
don't know why but I'm putting them in
the drawer so within the next month I
will do it here we are to the single
shadows that I pulled out of my
collection I have some for Mac makeup
geek motives and Coastal Scents as you
can see I kind of pulled them into
workable quads maybe I don't know I can
really jump around and use them however
I want but I just pulled four from Mac
here I have nylon wood winked Beauty
marked and cranberry from makeup geek I
have poison ivy Envy country girl and
Coco bear from motives I have vanilla
cappuccino bedroom eyes which this is
shade I'm wearing is like a one shadow
look today well technically it's a two
shadow look I've got this all over the
lid and crease and this under the brow
and this color is called plum frost the
Coastal Scents shades are all numbered
so I think I'll just list them in order
left to right down below in the infobox
but that is an amazing rose gold a
couple of pretty purpley shades that
really pop and then just three pretty
matte colors you know but I really
needed to do something like this because
these shadows these single shadows that
were in their individual pans just we're
not getting touched so this might be a
good strategy for some of you guys as
well if like me you've been ignoring
them and you can come up with an extra Z
palette or just some place to put them
let me see if you do this to show me
what kind of palette you put together
thank you so much for watching I also
love seeing your pictures and the videos
you guys have linked to where you've
tried this yourself I just think it's
really inspiring to see other people's
collections see the things that you're
putting in your rediscovered products
drawer because it kind of makes me think
oh yeah I have that too I want to use
that too so thanks for sharing thanks
for watching l see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
