sitting with me right now her paws she
actually got something called soft paws
she wants the camera but that's okay
because these soft paws actually they
trimmed her nails and the nice kind of
like have this sort of plastic e rubbery
I don't know kind of coating to them and
yeah basically they're just covering her
claws so she can get on the couch she
can actually run around and I think
she's allowed to get into a few more
things than usual because she has these
on and they're working well for her so
far she's still purring still happy and
playful and everything okay you need to
save for the camera too gooey she's
feeling playful she wants my finger you
I'll show you cupcakes favorite thing
it's actually this little laser on I
think it's a red dot and she will follow
that dot and I kind of pounce on it if
we have it going yeah see it's just just
a little laser beam and she likes that
it just become kind of her favorite
little plaything so I found mine at
Target all right guys now on to my
favorites for this month and the first
couple things I'm going to talk about
our hair things one of them I got
recently and it is from Herbal Essences
and it's called long-term relationship
leave-in split end protector for long
hair it's basically something that it
has red raspberry in it and it really
does smell good when you push it out of
this pump it actually is pink and so
once I get out of the shower and my hair
is damp I just get a little bit of this
on my hands and kind of run it through
basically the bottom half of my hair and
then I wrap my hair up in one of those
Turbie twist things and yeah I just feel
like already I can tell my hair is a lot
softer and it feels a little bit easier
to maintain like while I'm styling it I
don't know if that's just you know I
have fine hair and it tends to be a
little more fly away a little more
staticky so I think this might be
helping that a little bit but I do like
it as sort of elite nice leave-in
treatment
and smells great so that's always nice
for one of those you know post shower
steps so that's working well so far also
I'm trying out a couple of the products
from the got to be fantastic
instant collagen infusion I've got the
root lifter which I'm still kind of
deciding how well that works but I
definitely know that I like the
thickening non-aerosol hairspray and I
don't really use this probably like
maybe it's even designed to be used or
yeah I'm not really using it like it's
designed to be used because they say
spray this over styled hair which I'm
sure you know it might work fine but
what I like to do because this is kind
of a thickening product and it's not an
aerosol hairspray which I kind of like
to use the like the Tresemme aerosol
kind of all over my hair after I get
done styling but this I just kind of you
know once my hair is dry if I have to
blow-dry it that day I kind of just pick
up pieces of it chunks of it and kind of
give a spritz of this underneath and
then sort of shake my hair around to
really kind of get it in at the roots
and I feel like my hair has tons more
texture it responds better to the
curling iron and it just has more volume
altogether so yeah I'm liking this so
far the instant collagen infusion
non-aerosol hairspray just kind of as
sort of a thickening spray like I said
I'll continue to test out the root
lifter and see if maybe this could
really do the job as the root lifter
kind of how I'm using it now and sort of
a hair spray product it just gives my
hair more texture and I'm liking that so
there's that cupcake you're being a good
girl
yes she's watching very closely
everything I talked about she has not
fallen asleep yet
next thing is from Nivea and it's the
kiss of smoothness hydrating lip care
SPF 4 and this has been such a great lip
balm for me here lately and I still like
the EOS lip balms this along with that
I'm kind of like using them all
interchangeably but this is sort of a
new thing that I'm really enjoying and
basically it just twists up and this is
no
thing you know it's nothing tinted it's
nothing too colorful and it really it
doesn't have much of a scent or flavor
to it but the the great thing about this
product is how smooth it feels on the
lips and I mean a lot of lip balms you
can say you know they feel smooth but
this just has an especially silky feel
and no annoying scent to it and I just
feel like wow you know when I put it on
my lips feel so soft it's been the type
of thing I put on before bedtime and
then when I wake up I can kind of tell
like my lips don't feel greasy but man
they feel soft so no cupcake no no she's
feeling playful and is having trouble
just sitting here listening but anyway
really do you like that as a lip balm
and that's available you know most
drugstore this thing is another lip
product this one is from Mac and it's a
product that's been in my collection for
a little while and I enjoyed it from the
start
and basically I'm still liking it now
and I have it on my lips now actually
over that lip balm and it's my Mac Viva
Glam 5 lip lipstick and a real neutral
shade there you can see it's got some
shimmer to it but just a really nice
neutral lipstick if you're looking for
something just to maybe highlight your
eyes or another part of your face a
little bit more it makes your lips
understated without being washed out or
you know kind of that sort of ghostly
looks it still gives them a little color
while still being new another Mac
product here that I actually used the
other day and I kind of like had gotten
it thought it looked gorgeous and then I
don't know it just kind of got put away
and not used nearly enough and now I'm
using it a whole lot more and is my MAC
eyeshadow in beauty mark which is a
velvet shade and it's just a beautiful
color it really comes off as a nice dark
color great for you know your outer
corner your outer V use it as a liner it
kind of has just a plummy look with the
with the shimmer that's in it but if I
were to swatch it for you here it's just
going to come off very dark there on
that finger but you can still see the
sparkle so in a concentrated way you
know this is really
nice kind of a nice alternative to black
and really plays off of a plum look and
makes it look nice I do have another lip
product here it's from Maybelline and
this is actually what I reviewed in one
of my revved-up reviews here earlier
this week those are my new kind of
speedy reviews for people who don't have
a lot of time and just want you know
want me to get to the point you know in
my videos but this is tempting toffee
it's the shine sensational lip gloss and
there's much more on this in that video
but yeah just a nice creamy color I
think it's pretty it's not too dark not
too light just kind of a nice in-between
shade it smells delicious
and I've just been using it a whole lot
ever since I talked about it so liking
so enjoying this cream eyeliner with
which lots of people have been like have
you tried the maybelline cream eyeliner
yet have you tried it and I've been like
no no and then finally went out and got
it in blackest black and I do really
really like this got it on my upper lash
line think it makes wings very nicely
has not smudged on me or created any
problems in that way and it's just super
creamy super dark and it reminds me what
it reminds me a lot of is actually that
Jane be pure mineral eyeliner and it
works really well for me and then Jane
became unavailable at any store near me
and so this kind of gives me that same
feel just extremely creamy and smooth
and doesn't smudge however after a few
tries of using the brush that came with
that which is actually kind of like a
small really small narrow flat brush I
was like okay this isn't really working
for me but there is a brush and I'll
have more on the name and and where
exactly you can find it but I've been
enjoying this brush from Coastal Scents
it's a bent liner brush and it's got a
really really fine tip so I have one and
that's kind of like this from Smashbox
only it's more full and it's almost too
full to be able to use but you can see
that has a really precise tip and you
know maybe you can find these other
places
and you know if you want to avoid
ordering online you know go for it but
this one is from Coastal Scents and I
know it works well and it also this tip
here has a really nice stiffness to it
you can see it doesn't give a whole lot
and that's really good for control when
you're lining your eyes and you can see
why that Bend is so useful you don't
have to hold it just so you know you can
kind of hold it how it's comfortable and
still see your lash line and get the
product on there so this alongside with
the Maybelline great for a really nice
fine line well that's it everyone for my
favorite products my shopping list ideas
video if you will just some things to
maybe keep in mind next time you're out
in the stores and you're looking for
something new I feel like this time
around a lot of the products I picked
were really good like everyday use items
like there wasn't really anything too
crazy or out there or like you know oh
my gosh this is just a real special
thing I mean like the hairspray the
leave-in conditioner the liner lipstick
lip balm and stuff like that are just
kind of like standard like good daily
use products so if you're looking for
something that may become a new favorite
in your collection maybe test out one of
these things and see what you think and
let me know what you think so
thanks so much for watching guys and
have a great day bye Beauty broadcast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
