joining me for the last shopping list
ideas video before the emily awards
that's where I kind of round up all my
favorite products of the whole year and
that will probably be coming at some
point in mid-january so I want to take a
little time to try some of the new
things I got for Christmas and sort of
consider those along with some other
products for my total overall favorites
so need a little time for that little
time to further develop my decisions on
everything and that will be coming but
for now I just wanted to let you know
the things have been using a lot over
the past month some current favorite
product not only is it just products but
just some different ways i've been using
things that i want to kind of get the
word out about let you know about
because i'm pretty excited about them
also some people would ask me in my last
video if i got my hair cut and I did I
got quite a bit taken off my mom cuts my
hair but it's up to here now and before
it was like down to here or something so
I just find it a lot easier to manage I
feel like my hair was getting kind of
it's really fine to begin with but it
was just getting staticky kind of hard
to manage boy on to the shopping list
ideas for this month the first thing I
want to talk about is a foundation combo
that I've been using a lot and this is
Revlon Colorstay and Revlon Photoready
the initial reason why I combined the
two which you'll notice one is a little
dark for me right now and one is a
little light so combining the two gave
me the right color but also when you
combine these two formulas it manages to
give you staying power that doesn't look
too thick so colorstay can be really
really long wearing but sometimes some
people find it works best when it's
combined with another foundation that
maybe isn't so long wearing or is a
little more sheer and I find photo ready
to be that I even find it to be just
ahead to have a little luminosity to it
actually so what I'll do is I'll just
apply the color stay you know down my
nose sort of around my t-zone area and
because it's lighter i'll put it under
my eyes and then I'll dab Photoready
other places on my face and then use
like the Sigma f80
he brush which it looks like this and
just kind of buff it around everywhere
so the colors all get totally blended
and you can mix colors stay with a lot
of different foundations you have and I
think you'll find the staying power
improves a whole lot other little combo
product here that I have used a lot
especially over the holidays i think i
did day after day of kind of a glam red
lip old hollywood sort of holiday look
and i used two of the lip butters and i
know i actually tweeted a photo a few
weeks ago of a look using these two and
this one is red velvet and this one is
cherry tart so you'll notice red velvet
is kind of a little bit deeper brick red
and then cherry tart is a bit brighter
red so when I use these two together I
really love the effect i will sometimes
kind of go over you know my top lip and
kind of the sides of my bottom lip with
red velvet and then really pop the
center with cherry tars red velvet and
there's cherry tart you can see they
really catch the light and look
beautiful without any gloss applied over
the top other thing I've been doing
without fail with my eye makeup lately
is really making a point to highlight
the inner part of my eye I feel like as
you look at an eye and I don't know if
anybody really raises close of attention
but as you kind of look at an eye from
left to right it just has a much more
finished look to it when this tear duct
area has something going on there not
only does it brighten the whole face I
feel like when you brighten that
particular spot but I just feel like it
gives the whole I look a even you know
kind of finished off appearance and a
really really nice shadow to do that if
you like doing it with shadows I like
doing it with shadow sticks sometimes as
well but one of my favorite shadows
that's kind of emerged for doing this is
max shroom and this is the only high-end
item I'm mentioning with these favorites
but it's a very very frosty white shade
and you won't wear it with that amount
of opacity obviously that I showed you
in that swatch but i'll use my little
sigma e65 that came in the bunny set and
just go
little bit on there and it just works as
a nice little detail brush it's actually
an angled liner brush but I like using
it around that area and this just
happens to be a really saturated
highlight shade to use also for eyes I'm
loving these kiss false eyelashes the
style is 0-3 and I'm wearing them right
now and I've been wearing them a lot
lately actually and then what kind of
dramatic eyes maybe when you look at
them up close but they're really perfect
they're not too long they're not too
flared at the ends they really open up
the eyes and I like this little pack
that i got from excuse me walgreens
because you get to and i'm sorry i don't
have a pair to just show you here in the
container because i'm not sure where the
other one is and the other set is on my
eyes but they also come with a little
applicator i don't really use this but
if you're interested this kind of holds
the lashes so you can place them right
on your lashline other thing that I've
been trying to do is not necessarily sit
the lashes all the way to the edge of my
lashline I'm actually cheating them in
just a little bit and I think what that
does is keeps your eye from looking
droopy as it sometimes can with false
eyelashes just with with all those
lashes right on the corner unless you're
looking for a real bedroom eyes type
look or old Hollywood type look but I
kind of bring them in just a bit and
that way you wouldn't know really that
the lashes are placed in further but
they're just you know just a teeny bit
in and then you really get that I opened
effect also guy mentioned this product
from Bath and Body Works this is the
aromatherapy night time T body lotion it
says sleep on it and i have been using
this recently and i am just nuts about
this scent i would love to have like
everything i can get in this scent I
mean it's just it's got the slightest
hint of like a spicy note to it not like
hot and spicy but just you know how some
fragrances have that little bit deeper
note to them but it smells so wonderful
and even if I'm not going to be sleeping
i don't care i love the the kind of
thing aroma this heads I wish I could
describe it better for you I wouldn't
call it fruity I wouldn't say it
necessarily reminds me of anything
edible it's also not overly floral I
mean it's one of those sense that you
don't smell all the time and it just is
wonderful so I'm going to definitely be
on the lookout for more things in this
sleep night time T aromatherapy line
from Bath and Body Works another little
thing that I got here and this is a mini
body spray from body ecology which is
available at Walmart and it's in vanilla
cupcake I love this set because it they
really capture the scent of a sort of a
batter a cake batter baked type product
it smells so yummy all you know so I'm
going to spray it on before I go to bed
and Tyler always seems to pick up on how
good this smells so it's a lot of
vanilla but it's that little bit of
something baked something yummy out of
the oven kind of scent that I'm not sure
how they capture but it's so good and I
just got this super little size but I
know they sell this in larger sizes at
Walmart so this shopping list ideas
video things I would totally recommend
to you it came together so easily
because I just have been using these
products again and again and really
enjoying them so this was very easy for
me to put together but thank you so much
for watching and I hope you're having a
great day and I'll see you again soon
have a great new year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
