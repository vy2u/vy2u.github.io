ideas video I don't really have a set
schedule for these I just kind of feel
like it's time and then I do want and
basically what these are if you haven't
seen any of these from me yet they are a
sort of like current favorites video or
some people do like monthly favorites
and that's basically what this is just
things that I'm using and liking right
now and things that I hope you'll keep
an eye out for if maybe you're looking
for a similar product to what I'm
mentioning it's all things that I have
either been using a lot lately and maybe
their new items or something I've kind
of rediscovered and had in my collection
for a while and I'm just kind of
starting to use it again more often so
anyway let's get started the first thing
I want to mention is this Merlot night
cream and this is the facial moisturizer
that has the natural grape seed in it
it's called Merlot moonlight radiance
and this is the small size this is the
like 299 sighs I found at walgreens the
bigger size i think is around like maybe
like 12 or 13 dollars i'm not certain
but i just wanted to try it out and I
really like it I actually just mentioned
this in my blog that I did talking about
getting your skin kind of ready for the
colder months and and how to moisturize
whether it's your feet at your body your
face or whatever and I sort of recommend
this is like an overall good pick for
people regardless of skin type I think
it's a really nice night cream because
it hydrates but it doesn't make you feel
too greasy it also smells like a fruit
loops or fruity pebbles or something I
don't know it's going to really really
enjoy the smell but and this was a nice
kind of like size to try and I hope that
they continue to carry that at walgreens
I'm not positive if it was a limited
time offer or not they had a big tub of
these for like 2 99 at peace and so if
you are kind of thinking you know what's
a good night cream this might be
workable for you um it says that it and
it is water-based to water is the the
main ingredient
this I'm just kind of reading through
here but it says visibly reduced in
Reverse deep lines and wrinkles promotes
thicker skin and better skin tone helps
promote collagen formation and skin
elasticity I don't think that a lot of I
don't I think it takes more than a
moisturizer to reverse the lines and
wrinkles I've I mean after reading my
book they don't go to the cosmetics
counter without me book I've kind of
come to realize that some claims are you
know I'm going far beyond maybe what
they can actually do but still I do
think this is a good a good night cream
and if you're looking for something if
the skins starting to get a little dry
on you maybe check that out I found mine
at walgreens and they do have the full
size whether or not this is a permanent
thing these smaller sizes I I almost
always see the full size there so other
things here on another non makeup really
related thing is my little &amp;amp; Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works midnight pomegranate antibacterial
hand sanitizer it's called puckett back
and I actually got this for a dollar
fifty at an outlet a bath and Bodyworks
outlet so i'm not sure if maybe they
still sell these at regular bath and
body works but this scent is amazing
this midnight pomegranate like it smells
so good i will put it on more for the
scent on my hands than the fact that i
care that much about them being
sanitized i know that sounds wrong but
even the guys that i work with on my
shift like all like this scent and have
been as you can see borrowing it from me
so it's really really cute just a great
little size for your purse and so again
keep an eye out for this in your bath
and Bodyworks store or if you have
access to one of those bath and body
outlets they for sure have these little
guys there and they're so cute another
thing that i want to recommend is this
palladio herbal tinted lip balm that is
a brand that's available at sally beauty
supply this shade is bronze a pink and i
love it i've got it on right now it's a
gorgeous kind of neutral pinky gold
shade it looks great on your lips like
it feels it's exactly what I feel like a
tinted lip balm should be it gives off
color
it feels like the ideal texture on your
lips you know it's not too slick it's
not somehow sticky or or or you know
super super thick it's just just right
and uh I mean it's just your regular
kind of you know lip balm to but it's
got this gorgeous shimmer to it and I
just can't wait to try more shades of
these head over to Sally's and see what
else they have but um it you can just
put it on and I didn't feel the need to
put on a lip liner or anything else with
this it just feels so good on the lips
feels very moisturizing but a great
amount of color you're not getting
gypped on the color at all with this
even though this is kind of a lighter
shade I really like the sheen than it
gives off so that is the palladio herbal
tinted lip balm in bronzy pink that's a
sally beauty supply item there or you
could head to Sally's website too next
thing is a mascara it's the hip high
intensity pigments mascara and and this
is hiep just has one mascara and this is
it and I believe I have it in the
blackest black shade or whatever and
this is something I've recommend for a
recommended for a long long time had
been using pretty regularly then kind of
ran out started testing other things
came back to it and have been using it
pretty consistently so far this month
and a lot of last month to this is just
a great mascara guys this is a
traditional brush it is it's thickening
it's lengthening I feel like on a day
where I like don't have the time to put
on the false lashes but I do want that
kind of look this is the mascara that i
kind of consider to be the next best
thing so if you want something that's
going to really give you big lashes i
mean i would go for this give it a try
some people have sort of said that i've
recommended this to have said like to
wash it off it's like messy to wash off
I don't know really what they mean by
that because I mean it is very black and
very rich and that might be part of it I
always take all my makeup off with an
OLE a daily facials face wash cloth so I
mean it all comes off anyway so I don't
really have
issue with it but I do love this mascara
so much it's one of the better drugstore
mascaras that I would suggest to you
guys next thing is another I product
it's from the brand called em use a i
called it amused wrongly one since and i
was corrected but this is available at
cherry culture calm this brand a lot of
inexpensive things and i believe this
ultra fine eyeliner is what it's called
in white was maybe fifty cents this was
really really cheap and they have some
other liners like this they're very long
liners and this white eyeliner is what i
will use on my waterline and you you put
that on there and it basically makes the
whites of your eyes look bigger like
they've just extended a little bit
further it's great for days if you're
kind of tired and that water line looks
a little bit reddish which can only make
you look more tired and you kind of draw
this on just like that i've used this in
videos before and maybe mistakenly not
mentioned what brand it was and some
people have been asking so this is the
brand it's mu say it's available at
cherry culture calm it is soft and
creamy I like to just kind of scribble
it just a little bit on my hand first
just to kind of warm it up and get it a
little more creamy but overall it is
pretty creamy and when you first get it
it's going to have quite a point at the
end and then after you use it it gets
more of a normal point like that so just
be aware that you might have to kind of
dull that down just a little bit before
you want to we rub that on your
waterline but that is a pretty good
liner I think I mean it doesn't it's not
like you have to have the greatest thing
in the world to draw on your waterline
for a white liner because yeah it will
fade as the day goes on but overall I
mean if you're going to an event if
you're you know doing something special
and you just want to have that
appearance a little more wide awake eyes
this will do it for you so just wanted
to mention that here's another really
cool thing that I recently saw at target
and picked up and it's from the napoleon
perdis brand and you know how target
started carrying like the Gemma kid and
a few high
more traditionally high-end brands and
kind of made him I don't want to say way
more affordable because I think some of
the step is still pretty expensive but
at the end of one of the aisles they had
some gift sets set up and the napoleon
perdis brand had this really cute 10
color eyeshadow set and it's just called
eyeshadow palette and it costs ten
dollars kind of like a gift item and it
had these really great neutral shades in
there I don't want to cover up the color
of them but you can there you go you can
kind of see some of them have some
shimmer some of them have some sparkle
to them um this lower line here I don't
know how well it's coming off on camera
but these are kind of warm like moths
Purple's blacks and then you got your
more browns and golds up top so I've
been using this lately on a pretty much
daily basis for work for the past week
or so and I've created some a lot of
nice different looks and the
pigmentation is just really nice on
these um just very pleased with how
colorful they they are and how rich the
shades are and like I said this is a
more a more pricey brand traditionally
so I think for ten dollars for a nice
little palette what a great gift this
would make but also just to have in your
own collection kind of like I did just
to give yourself a nice sampling of
colors in one small portable palette is
pretty cool so that is from napoleon
perdis and it's just called the NP set
like that and the last thing I want to
mention is another thing that I know
I've mentioned in numerous other videos
but I have literally been using this
every single day and it's the elf
contouring blush and bronzing powder
this is a studio product you open it up
you got a nice big mirror and you've got
the blush and the bronzer and the blush
I mean the the number one reason why i
use this is the bronzer it is matt it's
deep I mean it's deeper and darker than
some other bronzers I have so it makes a
fantastic contour here here you know all
around the face and then this this blush
is a little sparkly it's kind of a light
peach with some gold
sparkle to it oh hey there's the video
camera um but anyway this is just an
excuse me a great little on compact to
keep with you and have the blush and the
bronzer and one is very convenient but
this is a wonderful bronzer and even
though i've been using it like non-stop
i still haven't hit pan on it so that's
kind of cool too but um anyway guys
those are my shopping list ideas for
this time around I hope you maybe can
pick up a few of those things if you're
out in the stores and are if you're
looking for a mascara or you're looking
for a blush and bronzer or whatever
maybe that will give you some ideas
thank you guys so much for watching and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
