for this shopping list ideas video this
is where I just kind of share a lot of
random products that I'm using a lot
right now you might know these as
current favorites videos or monthly
favorites but either way these may be
new products to me or just kind of a
rediscovered product something I've been
getting a lot of use of lately that I
would recommend to you guys so to start
off the first thing is actually
something I just recently reviewed and I
just wanted to give it a mention here
because in the past you know month or so
I've used it quite a bit and it is the
Remington T's studio pearl ceramic
styling wand so this gives you you know
those really kind of tight curls that
are just really long-lasting for me and
this works just super well and you can
find it for about 25 bucks at Target but
for more definitely check out my review
video on this I just really wanted to
give it a shout-out because I do enjoy
it so much so yeah that is a product
from Remington then I want to mention
something that is from Coastal Scents
it's one of their newer palettes that
I'm loving so much lately it is the 36
color smokey palette and this is really
cool for a couple of reasons one problem
I have with it which I may review this
further definitely some tutorials and
probably a blog post with some swatches
but this is kind of hard to open I'm not
quite sure why that is but this clamps
down harder than the head ones it's a
different shape as well you know this
this palette is different isn't shaped
like anything they already have but the
colors in it are really awesome and
actually they follow a pattern they map
this out on the website but they are in
groups of six so here you have six kind
of like full neutrals six greens six
Purple's six kind of pink shades blues
and then like a smokey eye grouping
there so I love the fact that I can I
mean this is going to be my go to like
travel palette because I don't instead
of taking you know a bunch of different
smaller palettes you have it all kind of
groups then you have it all right here
for you
I also like that you know they can get
away with calling it a smoky palette
because they give you some really nice
rich dark shapes that kind of anchor
each set of colors so I mean you're
getting a really rich black this one's
interesting because it has some sparkle
to it and the colors are just a cupcake
just jumped on this stool
there's her tail the colors are neat
because they're a mix of matte and
shimmer there's like just to show you
how bold these are barely you know
touching these but it's just really
great quality that size-wise these are a
little bit larger than what you get in
like the 88 palettes but they're not
quite as big as the hot pots so they're
kind of right in between that they're
maybe about the size of a nickel instead
of a dime and I just I'm loving this so
far it's kind of like you wish you had
more than more than two eyes so you
could like do all kinds of different
looks at once in one sitting but I'm
really really happy with this so far and
like I said I will be posting some
swatches of this on my blog so you can
check those out next a skin product that
I have actually been using since
probably about high school and this has
been my go-to kind of zit zapper and I
think I've mentioned this before in a
skincare video or maybe some other
favorites video a while back but I used
it just this past week and I was just
reminded how great this works how well
it dries up a blemish hi sweetie you can
sit here you can join but this is the
clean and clear Pursey gel and it is a
10% benzoyl peroxide acne medication and
I use it just kind of like a spot
treatment
you know I will put it on where I have
that blemish whether it's on my nose my
cheek wherever I will put it on maybe
before I go to bed or even under my
makeup as I you know under my
moisturizer and everything and I just
honestly feel like this is the fastest
ZipZap or than I've ever used and so my
sister had used it and she kind of
suggested it to me at one point and I
just loved it so much
and eye shadow that I want to talk about
this is remix and it's called rock and
you can see it's kind of like a black
with some sort of metallic shimmer but I
was just using this and I thought how
great this is in place of sometimes like
using matte carbon I understand
sometimes you want like a matte black
steam I want matte carbon but this
delivers such a rich deep dark black to
use this like a crease shade or as a
liner or something like that it's just
so cheap because sometimes I reach for
matte carbon or I had this sparkly black
shape from makeup forever that I like a
lot but I kind of just realized you know
this shade is so much cheaper and if I'm
really gonna use something like that
very often this is such a great value so
it's cool in that it has some sparkle to
it but it's not overly much I mean I
feel like it works fine as a contour
still that doesn't affect its ability to
you know to work well in your crease or
as a liner or something I just really
like that shade and I like the texture
of it a lot next I've gotta bring up a
product that I have been using so much
lately its treats my skin so well it
stays on so long and it's the Rimmel
lasting finish foundation I've
recommended this to so many people and I
kind of get in these phases where you
know I'm testing out a lot of different
foundations and it's like you know I
kind of switch around for a while but
then I end up coming back to something
again and again and Rimmel lasting
finish is one of those products comes in
a nice travel friendly plastic tube and
leave my only problem with this has been
that it doesn't come in a ton of
different shades but it's still I mean
200 soft beige is just perfect for me
and I'm just really crazy about this and
it's one of those products that keep
repurchasing and just lately here I've
been using a lot really consistently so
I wanted to bring that up again it's a
really great foundation option that
provides coverage it doesn't break me
out I mean it just is kind of like the
all-around foundation it lasts
of really long next I have actually four
lipsticks to talk about I've been
wearing a lot of lipstick lately not
really no
particular reason why I think I've just
found shades that I really really like
and so I want to share those with you um
what I'm actually wearing today is kind
of like a nude lipstick and it's from
Milani and I'm really excited about
these lipsticks really really enjoying
this it's the HD advanced lip color in
classy nude and it's kind of like a
longer skinny lipstick and the packaging
has that Milani in on it but it kind of
clicks the product up but that's what it
looks like and it is just a really
really pretty
not totally nude lip I mean this does
not erase your lips by any means but
it's just a really nice neutral and it
feels so good that's probably like 60%
of the reason why I don't like it is the
fact that when I put it on it feels so
moisturizing almost like a lip balm it
has a pleasant scent to it um and just
just watch it here on my hand for you
that's what it looks like so it's it's
definitely creamy there is no shimmer in
this but it is just able to catch the
light like that and have a really pretty
moisturized look to it so yes I would
totally recommend you check out those
Milani HD advanced lip colors I kind of
picked it up on a whim and now I'm
thinking I wish I would have thought
more about what other shades were
available there but I'll have to check
that out next time I'm at CVS next up is
a shade that no no sweetie stay with me
she was trying to climb I have my camera
sitting on a little stool here and she
desperately wants on that stool I think
okay she's calm down um next up though
is a lipstick that I had on in a recent
video I have a daily booth on it if you
want to see what this looks like on but
it's one of the revlon colorburst
lipsticks which as a whole i think are
really good lipsticks this shade is
called rosy nude and i was reading a
magazine where jennifer aniston was
pointed out I don't think he was
actually I don't know I guess if she was
really wearing this shade but in
suggested products they were like get
this look by you know wearing colorburst
and rosy nude and so I saw it and I
thought that really is a pretty shade
and I bought it and was kind of
surprised I hadn't picked it up sooner
there's a swatch of it right there you
can see how you know there's a more
neutral shade and there's rosy nude this
is another creamy no shimmer lipstick
and it just gives your lips this healthy
kind of full look I don't know quite
what it is about it's like if you have
some people might have really pigmented
lips that are sort of near that color I
don't know but it just seems so natural
but a great amount of color to kind of
brighten up the face and I just love
this shade love it love it and again if
you want to see what it looks like check
out my daily booth next I have a couple
of really light shades to tell you about
one is one I recently picked up from Mac
and it is a cream machine lipstick in
cream cup and so really light pink this
feels really good going on it just has a
different like I like the cream machine
consistency and I want to try more that
are like that there's a little swatch of
it there just a nice creamy light pinky
nude kind of shade I just think it I
love the look it gives my literally I
was wearing that not too long ago at
work and one of the guys I work with was
like your lips look really nice you said
it's kind of like okay I'm not sure that
this is you know that crazy of a product
but I think it just stands out in a
really pretty special way being pink but
not too pink you know and speaking of
that I've got another shade here that
has been very talked about but I haven't
tried it until now and it's the Rimmel
lasting finish lipstick and airy-fairy
this is the only one if the lipsticks
i've talked about so far that does have
it does have a little shimmer to it I
believe it's very subtle though and it
has a little more of you can see it
right there next to cream cup it's more
of like it has a little bit of a peachy
golden eight tone to it but it's still
kind of like a light pink shade and it
looks really really gorgeous so would
totally recommend those lipsticks and
finally to round out this video of
shopping list ideas I have a couple of
nail products the first one is what I'm
wearing now blogged about it
so check out the blog for more pics but
it's the hard candy just nails nail
color in beetle and it catches the light
and it looks like a zillion different
shades and right now on camera I don't
think the camera is necessarily picking
it up some pictures of this and this
goes from looking like purple to green
to pink to gold
half the time I feel like this I'm
wearing like a neutral color on my nails
because it just kind of it work a lot
for some reason I don't know if this
little it's the lights we have there but
it picks up the gold and then I went to
the bathroom and something about the
lights and the bathroom most like they
look straight-up purple now they don't
look anything but purple so it's just
interesting to kind of go about your day
and see how this looks differently but
it's really really a pretty polish it
went on nicely in two coats one coat
could have been enough but two coats
really gave it the full range of color
and I wish for some reason the camera I
don't think is shilling but right before
my eyes I'm looking at this and it's
green and then I tip them a different
way and they're like pinky Purple's so
really cool nail polish there and if you
like a nice nude nail on the totally
opposite end of the spectrum from that
one if you like a really kind of soft
nude goes with anything type nail Rimmel
lasting finished pro in bare naked I
wore this last week this was what I had
on if anybody saw me with kind of like a
nude nail last week and asked what color
it was this is it it's kind of like this
Beijing nude I mean wouldn't that be
like a pretty lipstick I'm just kind of
looking at it but this stayed on really
well and I was kind of complaining about
a different polish I had on before this
one about how it was chipping off and a
lot of people suggested this Rimmel
lasting finished pro so I'd like to
thank you to anybody who told me about
this because I was really impressed with
how this got me through I only changed
it because I like felt like changing the
color not because it totally chipped off
or anything like that so it says up to
ten days on the wear so really not a
complaint on this is that it doesn't
drive very fast but there are other
strategies and top coats and different
things you can do to sort of help that
issue if you want
but um I do enjoy that now well thank
you so much everybody for taking the
time to watch this video I hope you
enjoyed the shopping list ideas these
are really fun videos for me to do
because it's really just showing you
what I'm using at the moment so I'd love
to hear what some of your current
favorite products are so please share
them in the comments below
thanks again for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
