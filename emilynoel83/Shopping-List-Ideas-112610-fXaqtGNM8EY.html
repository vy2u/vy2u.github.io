for the shopping list ideas video on
this is where I just kind of share a lot
of random products that i'm using a lot
right now you might know these as
current favorites videos or monthly
favorites but either way these may be
new products to me or just kind of a
rediscovered product something I've been
getting a lot of use of lately that i
would recommend to you guys so to start
off the first thing is actually
something i just recently reviewed and i
just wanted to give it a mention here
because in the past you know month or so
I've used it quite a bit and it is the
Remington T studio pearl ceramic styling
wand so this gives you you know those
really kind of tight curls that are just
really long-lasting for me and this
works just super well and you can find
it for about 25 bucks at target but for
more definitely check out my review
video on this I just really wanted to
give it a shout out because i do enjoy
it so much so yeah that is a product
from remington then i want to mention
something that is from Coastal Scents
it's one of their newer pallets that I'm
loving so much lately it is the 36 color
smoky palette and this is really cool
for a couple of reasons one problem I
have with it which I'm a review this
further definitely some tutorials and
probably a blog post with some swatches
but this is kind of hard to open i'm not
quite sure why that is but this clamps
down harder than the head once it's a
different shape as well um you know this
this palette is different isn't shaped
like anything they already have but the
colors in it are really awesome and
actually they follow a pattern they map
this out on the website but they are in
groups of six so here you have six kind
of like full neutrals six green six
purples six kind of pink shades blues
and then like a smoky eye grouping there
so I love the fact that I can I mean
this is going to be my go-to like travel
palette because I don't instead of
taking you know a bunch of different
smaller palettes you have it all kind of
books that you have it all right here
for you
I also like that yet you know they can
get away with calling out a smoky
palette because they give you some
really nice rich dark shades that kind
of anchor each set of colors so I mean
you're getting a really rich black this
one's interesting because it has some
sparkle to it and the colors are just Oh
cupcake just jumped on this stool
there's her tail but the colors are neat
because they're a mix of matte and
shimmer um there's like just to show you
how bold these are barely you know
touching these but it's just really
great quality that size wise these are a
little bit larger than what you get in
like the 88 palettes but they're not
quite as big as the hot pots so they're
kind of right in between that there may
be about the size of a nickel instead of
a dime and i just am loving this so far
it's kind of like you wish you had more
than more than two eyes so you could
like do all kinds of different looks at
once in one sitting but i'm really
really happy with this so far and like i
said i will be posting some swatches of
this on my blog so you can check those
out next skin product that i have
actually been using since probably about
high school and this has been my go-to
kind of zit zapper and I think I've
mentioned this before in a skin care
video or maybe on some other favorites
video a while back but I used it just
this past week and I was just reminded
how great this works how well it dries
up a blemish hi sweetie you can sit here
you can join um but this is the clean
and clear person Jill and it is a ten
percent benzoyl peroxide acne medication
and I use it just kind of like a spot
treatment you know I will put it on
where I have that blemish whether it's
on my nose my cheek wherever I will put
it on maybe before I go to bed or even
under my makeup as a you know under my
moisturizer and everything and I just
honestly feel like this is the fastest
zit zapper than i've ever used and so um
my sister had used it and she kind of
suggested it to me at one point and i
just love it so much
and I shadow that I want to talk about
this is from mix and it's called rock
and you can see it's kind of like a
black with some sort of metallic shimmer
but I was just using this and I thought
how great this is in place of sometimes
like using matte carbon I understand
sometimes you want like a matte black
steam I want matte carbon but this
delivers such a rich deep dark black to
use this like a crease shade or as a
liner or something like that it's just
so cheap because sometimes I reach for
Matt carbon or had the sparkly black
shade from make up forever that I like a
lot but I kind of just realize you know
this shade is so much cheaper and if I'm
really going to use something like that
very often this is such a great value so
it's cool in that it has some sparkle to
it but it's not overly much I mean I
feel like it works fine as a contour
still that doesn't affect its ability to
you know work well in your crease or as
a liner or something I just really like
that shade and I like the texture of it
a lot next I've got to bring up a
product that i have been using so much
lately it's treats my skin so well it
stays on so long and it's the Rimmel
lasting finish foundation um recommended
this to so many people and I kind of get
in these phases where you know I'm
testing out a lot of different
foundations and it's like you know I
kind of switch around for a while but
then I end up coming back to something
again and again and Rimmel lasting
finish is one of those products comes in
a nice travel friendly plastic tube and
be my only problem with this has been
that it doesn't come in a ton of
different shades but it's still I mean
200 soft beige is just perfect for me
and I'm just really crazy about this and
it's one of those products that keep
repurchasing and just lightly here I've
been using a lot really consistently so
I wanted to bring that up again is a
really great foundation option that
provides coverage it doesn't break me
out I mean it just is kind of like the
all-around foundation in less of really
long next I have actually four lipsticks
to talk about I've been wearing a lot of
lipstick lately not really no
particular reason why i think i've just
found shades that i really really like
and so I want to share those with you um
what I'm actually wearing today is kind
of like a nude lipstick and it's from
Milani and I'm really excited about
these lipsticks really really enjoying
this it's the HD advanced lip color in
classy nude and it's kind of like a
longer skinny lipstick and the packaging
has that Milani in on it but it kind of
clicks the product up but that's what it
looks like and it is just a really
really pretty not totally nude lip I
mean this does not erase your lips by
any means but it's just a really nice
neutral and it feels so good that's
probably like sixty percent of the
reason why don't like it is the fact
that when I put it on I feel so
moisturizing almost like a lip balm it
has a pleasant scent to it and and just
just watch it here on my hand for you
that's what it looks like so it's
definitely creamy there is no shimmer in
this but it is just able to catch the
light like that and have a really pretty
moisturised look to it so yes I would
totally recommend you check out those
Milani HD advanced lip colors I kind of
picked it up on a whim and now i'm
thinking i wish i would have thought
more about what other shades were
available there but i'll have to check
that out next time i'm at CVS next up is
a shade that no no sweetie stay with me
she's trying to climb I had my camera
sitting on a little stool here and she
desperately wants on that stool I think
okay she's calm down um next up though
is a lipstick that I had on in a recent
video I have a dailybooth on it if you
want to see what this looks like on but
it's one of the revlon colorburst
lipsticks which as a whole i think are
really good lipsticks this shade is
called rosy nude and i was reading a
magazine where Jennifer Aniston was
pointed out I don't think he was
actually I don't know I guess if she was
really wearing this shade but in
suggested products they were like get
this look by you know wearing color
burst and rosy nude and so I saw it and
I thought that really is a pretty shade
and I bought it and was kind of
surprised I hadn't picked it up sooner
there's a swatch of it right there you
can see how you know there's a more
neutral shade and there's rosy nude this
is another creamy no shimmer lipstick
and it just gives your lips this healthy
kind of full look I don't know quite
what it is about it's like if you have
some people might have really pigmented
lips that are sort of near that color I
don't know but it just seems so natural
but a great amount of color to kind of
brighten up the face and I just love the
shade love it love it and again if you
want to see what it looks like check out
my dailybooth um next I have a couple of
really light shades to tell you about
one is one i recently picked up from mac
and it is a cream machine lipstick in
cream cup and so really light pink this
feels really good going on it just has a
different like i like the cream machine
consistency and I want to try more that
are like that there's a little swatch of
it there just a nice creamy light pinky
nude kind of shade I just think it I
love the look it gives my legs I was
wearing that not too long ago i'm at
work and one of the guys I work with was
like your lips look really nice you said
it's kind of like okay I'm not sure that
this is you know that crazy of a product
but I think it just stands out in a
really pretty special way being pink but
not too pink you know and speaking of
that I've got another shade here that
has been very talked about but I haven't
tried it until now and it's the Rimmel
lasting finish lipstick and airy fairy
this is the only one of the lipsticks
I've talked about so far that does have
it does have a little shimmer to it i
believe it's very subtle though and it
has a little more of you can see it
right there next to cream cup it's more
of like has a little bit of a peachy
golden a tone to it but it's still kind
of like a light pink shade and it looks
really really gorgeous so would totally
recommend those lipsticks and finally to
round out this video of shopping list
ideas I have a couple of nail products
the first one is what I'm wearing now
blogged about it
check out the blog for more pics but
it's the hard candy just nails nail
color in Beetle and it catches the light
and it looks like a zillion different
shades and right now on camera I don't
think the camera is necessarily picking
it up some pictures of this and this
goes from looking like purple to green
to pink to gold and half the time I feel
like this I'm wearing like a neutral
color on my nails because it just kind
of it work a lot for some reason I don't
know if this will it's the lights we
have there but it picks up the gold and
then I went to the bathroom and
something about the lights in the
bathroom I was like they look straight
up purple now they don't look anything
but purple so it's just interesting to
kind of go about your day and see how
this looks differently but it's really
really a pretty polish it went on nicely
in two coats one coat could have been
enough but two coats really give it the
full range of color and I wish for some
reason the camera I don't think is
showing but right before my eyes I'm
looking at this and it's green and then
I tip them a different way and they're
like pinky purple so really cool nail
polish there and if you like a nice nude
nail on the totally opposite end of the
spectrum from that one if you like a
really kind of soft nude goes with
anything type nail rimmel lasting finish
pro in bare naked I wore this last week
this was what I had on if anybody saw me
with kind of like a nude nail last week
and asked what color it was this is it
it's kind of like this Beijing nude I
mean wouldn't that be like a pretty
lipstick and just kind of looking at it
but this stayed on really well and I was
kind of complaining about a different
polish I had on before this one about
how it was chipping off and a lot of
people suggested this Rimmel lasting
finished pro so I'd like to thank you to
anybody who told me about this because I
was really impressed with how this got
me through I only changed it because I
like felt like changing the color not
because it totally chipped off or
anything like that so it says up to 10
days on the wear so really not a
complaint on this is that it doesn't
drive very fast but there are other
strategies and top coats and different
things you can do to sort of help that
issue if you want
and I do enjoy that now thank you so
much everybody for taking the time to
watch this video I hope you enjoyed the
shopping list ideas these are really fun
videos for me to do because it's really
just showing you what I'm using at the
moment so I'd love to hear what some of
your current favorite products are so
please share them in the comments below
thanks again for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
