ideas this month I'm really excited to
bring you some of my current favorite
products because these are a lot of
things that I really like but I would
also definitely recommend them to you if
you're needing something in a certain
category of product I've got a lot of
variety here everything from makeup to a
jewelry item hair body even a beverage
run into a lot of things over the past
couple of months really because the last
video I did that was sort of shopping
list oriented it was the unisex shopping
list ideas that I did with Tyler and so
that was kind of like a different
different realm of favorite items gonna
start off talking about a great
fragrance that I've been using a lot
lately it is philosophes inner grace and
I have the body spray here but this is
just a fantastic scent and I've had it
for several months now and I just find
that this is the scent that I'm you know
I have a little cabinet and I go in
before I leave for the day and I reach
for something and this is the one that I
just find myself really really going for
it just has such a kind of warm a little
more maybe complex scent than a lot of
the other philosophy grace fragrances
love it so much I haven't smelled
anything out there that's quite like
this I want to tell you also about a
great brush and if you've been keeping
up with my blog which I am blogging
every single day in November guys so
check it out there will be something new
all the time on there but this is a
brush from Ecotools and it is the
retractable kabuki brush and I wanted to
actually talk to you about it in this
video so you could see exactly how it
works and in case my blog didn't
demonstrate it but I love this brush I
love being able to throw this in the
makeup bag that I take to work because
it just comes up and it's down and it is
just the thickest softest brush and I
mean it's just great for powder this can
work for bronzer only a blush brush as
well for if you're traveling so it's
kind of like all-purpose space brush and
it's just so darn easy to use and take
with you and if you've ever been
frustrated by the quality of your
brushes diminishing by just throwing
them in a bag you know and not having
the right
protection around them this is just a
great little tool here so a hair product
that I want to talk about I've been
meaning to talk about this for a while
it came in one of the QVC beauty test
tubes where you get like kind of a
random variety of products and this one
was one that I got actually not in this
past one but the one before and it's a
great great conditioner it's from brand
called Leah Giorno and it's the Hydra
riche hydrating conditioner for all hair
types and I know the packaging is kind
of strange actually says more product
less packaging and this is just like I
guess you call it a deluxe travel-size
still feel like there's there was a ton
of product in here and I've still got
like this much left and I've been using
it fairly consistently but it's just
such a hydrating conditioner like with a
lot of hair products with a lot of
shampoos and conditioners I feel like I
struggle to tell whether it's made a
significant difference in my hair or not
but after I use this and the next day
one of my hair is dry and I'm styling it
I noticed that my ends which my hair has
gotten pretty long here lately and I
feel like my ends are more hydrated even
though you know I haven't had a cut in a
while I just feel like it has a scent as
well before I ever use it anytime before
I use it I like I have this ritual I've
developed where I get in my hands and I
just take a big whiff of it because it
smells so good it says it has French
plum oil and it's silk proteins and
sweet almond peptides and if you really
want a deep conditioned you know
treatment you just leave it in your hair
a little longer when you're in the
shower but it just works really well and
like i said for just kind of a sample
type size this is a lasting me forever
so if you have a chance to try even just
a size like this you're gonna have a lot
get a lot of use out of it and it may be
something that I look into repurchasing
again soon let's talk about a great lip
gloss that I have on right now this is a
Revlon Super Lustrous lip gloss in nude
luster and this is a shade that I have
loved for quite a while I really enjoy
the Revlon Super Lustrous lip gloss
formula and this shade I feel like if
you're gonna go for a nude gloss maybe
you're kind of medium skin tone I feel
like this is a really nice wearable
color and I mean it's pigmented it's
opaque I mean this is not
go on Scheer you can't expect to see
color and shine when you put it on so
really enjoying that also really
enjoying the lip butters but I haven't
really had them for that long and I am
sort of in the process of reviewing them
right now so well I could have thrown
them into this video I just kind of
thought I would wait until I do an
actual review on those to give you more
opinions on the lip butters sort of a
rediscovered favorite in my collection
as you can tell by the amount I have
used here this is a blush from covergirl
it's the cheekers blush in plum berry
glow and it actually kind of reminds me
a lot of a blush I like from Mally
called Mally's glow because it's a pink
that has just the slightest bit of
shimmer to it and I have that on today
it's very subtle you can wear it kind of
sheared out or you can build it up for a
little more of a pink color but this is
a great great blush and I've loved this
and repurchase this over time but I kind
of like got it stuck back in my stash a
little bit and recently pulled it out
and just realize just how much I really
love that blush know I have talked about
being forever on this hunt for a
drugstore concealer that has a salmony
undertone that can really tackle the
bluish tone under eye circles many of us
get or the bluish you know tones that
can kind of be right on the inside of
your nose right here and if you were
with me on blogtv a few weeks ago you
heard me mention this is like a possible
breakthrough here but this is the bright
eyed concealer from Coastal Scents in
light and I know that the price on this
is I think it might be right around $10
or under but this is what the packaging
looks like you get a lot of product and
the shade on this actually just has kind
of a peachy tone to it and I don't know
if the camera is picking that up but as
I look at it right here I'm thinking wow
you know this is like a a real peachy
tone concealer that has you know it's
it's done it's not super thick but it
does have coverage and it does have just
the right coloring to it so I've been
using this a lot for the under eye area
I think it's working fantastic so far so
I'm just happy to be able to tell you
about
something that's you know not benefit
erase paste and not Bobby Brown
corrector you know something that still
has what I feel like is sort of a unique
coloring to it and I hope other
drugstore brands pick up on the need
that we have for that kind of a
concealer getting to that time of year
where I feel like I'm noticing a
pronounced difference in my skin I am
noticing the dryness a lot more and so
I've been going back to a product that I
was using probably several months ago
and I've kind of just started diving
back into this routine of using the
Tarte pure maracuja oil and this is just
a small size and I actually have another
small size of this kind of waiting in
the wings because it's just come as a
little side product to a couple of kits
but I know you might think oil on your
face
but this is more like it has that sort
of a serum type feel and I feel like it
has not broken me out at all it has left
my skin very evenly hydrated it's the
type of thing that I put on before bed
and when I wake up in the morning to put
my makeup on I feel like everything is
smoother I just feel like it has a real
effect on your skin and what I'll do is
even instead of using a night an eye
cream at night what I've been doing is
putting this all over my face you kind
of rub it between your hands and then
put it all over and then I take a little
extra and I put it around my under eye
area kind of ride around in here and I
feel like it doubles as you know a
fantastic hydration like what an eye
cream could provide and I'm just really
enjoying this right now so it start it's
called maracuja oil and I believe you
could get this you know individually in
a larger size but like I said I'm just
kind of using what I have right now I
have a jewelry item that I painstakingly
put back on its little plastic thingy
here so I could tell you about it but
it's from forever 21 and it is a full
set of stud earrings that I got for less
than three dollars and I mean I'm sure
you can find this style of thing in a
lot of different accessories stores or
departments but I just think it is so
great to have a set of stud earrings and
you've got your gold your silver rose
gold and like a gun metal type shade and
I use the largest ones the mode
love having this and so I just thought
I'm gonna tell people about that because
this has been very valuable very quick
and easy for me to access when I'm
getting ready for work in the mornings
and just trying to pull some pull a look
to get out to a scent that I'm loving
around the house right now and this is
from Slatkin &amp;amp; Company and I get this at
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works it's marshmallow
fireside I don't know if you guys have
tried The Wallflowers in this scent but
they are fantastic this scent I mean it
is exactly what you would expect it is a
sweet warm even gives you that scent of
not just a marshmallow but that toasted
marshmallow type scent and I have one of
these you know plugged into you put a
Wallflower in an outlet if you're not
familiar with the way this works they
the component actually heats up and the
oil that's in here just kind of infuses
your house and you can put it in a room
and smell it throughout the room and
beyond a lot of times but so I have one
in there that's what that looks like in
terms of a refill but I just AM nuts
about that and finally a shout out to my
girl Cindy Swanson who is a fellow
broadcaster she's on the radio up in the
Rockford Illinois area so northern part
of the state I'm in the southern part
but she had tweeted about this tea it's
celestial Seasonings sugar cookie sleigh
ride and I had seen her tweet kind of
subconsciously filed it away and then
when I was in Walmart not too long after
I stumbled across this tea and she
mentioned how tasty it was with this tea
with a little bit of Splenda added to it
it's kind of like a dessert sort of tea
and of course no calories so you're
getting your sweet tooth fix without
eating a bunch of sugary spike did that
I tried it and it is absolutely
delicious so I mean I never thought of
myself as a big tea drinker and I love
using my Keurig coffee maker for cider
and tea and coffee and stuff like that
but this is really a delicious tea here
so I wanted to recommend that to you I
found this at Walmart it was in sort of
a center aisle with some different
baking things but you could probably
find it in with the rest of the teas as
well so thank you so much again for
joining me for my shop
most ideas video let me know if you've
tried any of these things and how
they've worked for you thank you so much
for always watching my videos and taking
the time to comment leave such kind
support and thank you again to all of
you who have been checking out my
non-stop November blog posts that just
reminds me that I need to get today
