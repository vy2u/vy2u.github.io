video
Wow is it cold where you are it's really
cold here so I've got my got my head
it's my shirt haunting him like I think
I did in my last video it's so warm it's
my Wi-Fi one so shout out to old Phi
Phi's that might be watching right now
but anyway um yeah really trying to stay
warm it seems like we've got a real dip
in the temperatures where I'm at we've
had a lot of school closings to deal
with on our morning newscast in case
you're just tuning in and don't know
what I do I incur the news for a morning
show where I live and it's just crazy on
days when it's like slick and icy and
school has to be called off get a lot of
phone calls to the station and but
anyway on with the purpose of this video
which is a shopping list ideas video and
um and then you guys like these a lot
you kind of like the current favorite
type of video that's really what this is
um just kind of some things that I know
I like and I kind of and bringing them
to you as a suggestion next time you're
out shopping and pretty much everything
that I'm suggesting here is available in
the drugstore or at a drugstore price
online so um if you got a few extra
bucks to spare amid your Christmas
shopping that's really all it will take
for some of these items if you're
interested so on with the show here um
the first thing I'd like to touch on is
the Wet n Wild mega glow powder which
I'm not sure if I've mentioned this
before in another video but I have it in
catwalk pink and it's what this is is
like an illuminating powder and you can
use it as like a blush or bronzer but
you can also use them like individually
for an eye look or something and catwalk
pink as like a light pink strip in there
and a couple of I'm trying to hold it so
it kind of doesn't catch so much light
here but I'm not sure if I can but
anyway this is kind of like a light
pinky with a little bit of bronze and so
I like that one it works more as a
highlighter on my skin but then I've
recently got another one that I like -
the mega glow powder and this one is in
star
bronze and this works is more of a
bronzer for me it's not quite it's not
super shimmery really but it does have
some shimmer I've actually seen someone
do a nice eye look using this um gosh
it's not coming to me who that was
eyebrows a lot of videos on YouTube I
love watching people do videos and
learning from them but um this could be
a cool I look an easy I look too so
those are the mega glow illuminating
powder pallets I think they might have
some other colors as well but I have and
I like both the catwalk pink maybe if
you're a fair skinned girl you still
want some shimmer and maybe a little bit
of color that would be good or the star
light bronze for a bronzer um the next
thing I want to talk about while we're
on wet and wild I guess I'll stick to
that brand and I've tried a couple of
their single eyeshadows that I really
like and there are a couple that can
work really easy easily together to do a
supernatural look if you want to I did
this a couple days ago this past weekend
one is called first they're in these
cute little little tubs and this one is
called fine wink and this is like a
gorgeous shimmery kind of gosh I feel
like the color is getting washed out by
my light here but it's kind of like a
shimmery light shade that could be used
as a highlight it's kind of like a sham
pinky champagne almost just a hint of
pink a little hint of gold maybe some
taupe or I mean it's just I really like
the color and the texture is very smooth
too it really is and these are like
$0.99 these guys that I was talking
about are probably around maybe two or
three dollars so you could use this on
your lid and your highlight and then in
your crease this color is called naked
and it's kind of a matte maybe it has
like a hint of shimmer in it it's a
little bit darker but not super dark so
you could have like a really natural
crease shade with this and it's like I
said mostly matte maybe just a slight
slight hint of shimmer but worn together
these
you really complement each other they're
very easy to use and I just like them a
lot
so I kind of thought you know at 99
cents apiece they could be worn easily
together the colors are fine wink that's
the that's the lighter of the two and
then naked is the line could you could
use Makris or I could use it all over
your lid or whatever you know the
options are pretty much as luminous
another thing that I want to mention
here is this NYX round lipstick in
harmonica I was wearing this in one of
my recent videos and a lot of people
asked what lip color I was wearing and
um it was this one and it's what it is
is I think a lot of people thought maybe
I was wearing in a nude shade but this
is actually like a really really light
pearly pink if you can see this swatch
on my hand here it's right there I'm not
sure it's so wide it might not show up
but basically what this is is just a
really light pinky nude shade it comes
off kind of nude it's got a little bit
of a shimmer to it it's very wearable
for a natural look and you can get these
for $0.99 on cherry culture calm and
should stay really like liked pretty
pink shade shade I have on right now
it's sort of a nude shade it's so
natural it's um called nicely nude and
it's one of the elf mineral lipsticks
and so these are available on elfs
website I think they're around either
between three and five dollars actually
I'm not it's not like in the typical one
dollar piece elf line but this is sort
of while this was more of a pinky nude
this is kind of a peachy nude and it
feels like a lip balm when I'm putting
it on like I wanted to put something on
my lips today that since it things are
so dry outside something that would
moisturize a little bit and this is like
that new book it almost feels like a lip
balm on like I really like these elf
mineral lipsticks they have like two
other colors and this one I really like
so that's called nicely nude and it's
from the elf mineral line it comes to
this night sleek black
packaging the next thing I like that I
would put on your shopping list if
you're in the market for a pink sort of
lipstick
I like the maybelline superstay lip
color this is one of those long wearing
lip colors and I actually like the
superstay lip color like this which
comes with a balm on the end that you
top off and then this is like just a
wand applicator here and that's a pretty
pink color that number is 740 it no
longer has the name on this but I buy I
believe the name was rose it had it on
the packaging that you had to tear off
but it's like the perfect pink shade not
over the top by any means it just looks
perfect on with my skin tone I feel like
but they also make super stay boss and I
like the gloss - they have up this balm
is pretty moisturizing it does stay on a
long time um so yeah I mean I haven't
gotten into a whole lot the long wearing
lip colors but this one's really
convenient and easy to use and it's
probably around I'd say between 6 &amp;amp; 7
dollars for this at the drugstore okay
so last couple things I want to get to
real quick are a set of false eyelashes
that I like a lot and I've actually used
these on some of my friends and they
have liked them very much too so it's
kind of a universally sort of natural
eyelash and natural this will make no
sense a natural looking fake lash and
that religious works on a lot of people
and that is um it's from Andrea it's the
Mod lash and it's in number 53 um by the
way I don't know if it's just the Sally
Beauty Supply where I live but they just
within the past couple weeks have really
expanded their selection of eyelashes
and I noticed that they happen to be
carrying these there now as well I can
always find these at one
all greens but I think now stylee's is
carrying them so check your salads maybe
they have a nice they've been if they
have a good selection of eyelashes they
may be selling the Maude lash there too
but the number is 53 and as you can see
they're really a nice natural lash and
then I would recommend the duo eyelash
adhesive I use it in the dark tone it
looks great when you squirt it out but
it dries black so it works great with
you know it kind of like makes its own
eyeliner really but I mean it doesn't
really end up showing up that much but
let's say you line your eyes in black
and then you put that on there
it really just blends right in so this
is waterproof also and it's from duo
available at Walgreens I would say 5
dollars or less and these are also
probably around 3 or 4 dollars so I'm
out of breath after that thank you guys
so much for watching and I hope this
gives you some good ideas and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
