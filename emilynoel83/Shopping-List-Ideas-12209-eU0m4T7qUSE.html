people I've been told rather I think
it's about time you did another shopping
list ideas videos so I figured maybe I
should go ahead and do that so this
one's just gonna be in case you haven't
seen several videos I've done like this
before
this would sort of be the equivalent to
a current favorites type of video that
some other people do and in my mind
these are just things that maybe if
you're shopping and keep an eye out for
just some things that I've tried
recently that I've really liked so I'll
try to give you a little information
about each thing without going too
in-depth because I do have one two three
four five six seven eight of nine
different products here so I'm gonna
have to get started but the first thing
I want to talk about is the Revlon
Colorstay mineral lip glaze I was
wearing this in a past video and I got
gotten asked what is that that you're
wearing and this color is in number five
hundred lasting shimmer it's like a
pretty sort of golden a nude shade I
love the color so much and this is
interesting because if I think it
advertises itself to be like an
eight-hour lip gloss and it's amazing
how long it really does last for being a
lip gloss a lip gloss that actually had
some shine to it and so I'll give you a
little swatch here on my hand if you can
see I mean and it it is a nude shade and
I think it's sometimes easier to tell
you know how long say a berry color
you know shade is lasting but this shade
lasts so well I love the color that is
kind of warm but you can see the light
hits it then it's just really gorgeous
and as far as the staying power goes I
kind of tested it this past weekend I
went out to lunch and I put it on like
gone shopping put it on before I left
and it lasted all through the morning
just fine then I ate lunch and it was
still actually there it wasn't quite so
shiny but I could tell that it was
actually still still there on my lip
and without being okay without being a
lip stain or one of those long wearing
lipsticks I think that's really
impressive
you know if I can get through the day
and reapply this maybe only two three
times that's awesome in my opinion so I
really like this color stain mineral lip
waves you know the scent it does have a
bit of a scent that I can't quite put my
finger on but I definitely smell do
smell it on my lips when I put it on and
it's not fruity I don't know maybe
there's like a old slight hint of a
moral to that I can honestly just cannot
describe it it's semi strong I mean I
don't feel like I noticed it once I put
it on I don't feel like I'm noticing a
whole lot but I do notice it like when I
get it out of the tube and put it on so
I don't know I don't find it to be
especially weird or anything like that
but overall I think this is just great I
wish I would have tried it sooner I want
to try it in more colors but so far this
one in lasting shimmer I like a lot and
that's the color stay mineral lip glaze
claims to be long wearing and another
lip product that I got recently that I
really like is the lasting finish
lipstick from Rimmel and I have this I'm
not sure if I've mentioned it before but
I have this in another shade I think I
might have it beg for work I may or may
not have mentioned this shade before but
it is in metallic seduction and it's
sort of a kind of just a little bit of a
metallic II red shade really pretty I
actually had it on today earlier and
then I put this gloss on but I'll go
ahead since it kind of works with this
shade I'll put this one on but this is
really good lipstick like that kind of I
like that sort of shade of red at time
so that's kind of a bold shape but the
one I specifically wanted to talk about
today I'd go and put on the other one
but is the color is vintage and it's
sort of a it's really interesting like
the reason
I wanted to describe this to you is
because this is I hope the camera picks
up on the pink tone this is really to
look at it in person it looks like a
light pink but it does have some peachy
I mean I'm sort of a nude feel to this
it's so unique for example let me just
grab out a random pink lipstick that I
have here you can tell the difference in
that this one is really pink this one is
also pink but it just I don't know it's
like the perfect pink you nude like the
reason why I wanted to use this one for
my shopping list ideas video is because
I think this could be so universally
flattering and this is the type of color
I know from doing a poll on this and is
it former at a previous question of the
week that a lot of people like this type
of shade pinky nude color and this is so
that the color is vintage it's number 26
Rimmel lasting finish lipstick you will
like it a lot I should probably do like
a little swatch here for you it's got
like an interesting shine to it I don't
know if you can see there but there's
definitely hints of pink when it kind of
shines and then nude shades it's just
all around right it's not super long
wearing but I mean it's me it feel you
get kind of a moisturizing feel to your
lips when you wear it and I love it a
lot so that is on my list also the one
that I talked about if you want more
information on this next product look
for my Rimmel lasting finish and stay
matte video I'm recommending with stay
matte now because I have recommended I
love the lasting finish I like these
both a lot but for those of you since
this is just a little bit newer I
thought I'd talk about it in this video
I like this a lot I'm wearing it today
actually and I actually blended it with
a little bit of my Bonnie Belle gel
bronzer just to sort of I don't know
give me a little more glow with it and I
like it a lot it works really great it
doesn't create shine I don't feel like
it all keeps your makeup looking fresh
throughout the day so that's another
Rimmel product there so if you get get
the chance to do a BOGO hey get the
vintage lipstick and then get to stay
matte good combo there
so anyway need to keep it moving
my next one is my NYX eyeshadow trio in
white pearl silver and charcoal and this
is just an all-around good palette to
have to get that sort of gray soft
smokey eye you're obviously you're not
getting like the matte black shade in
here to give you a super dramatic one
but if you just kind of like using grey
tones on your eyes for everyday this is
the perfect palette for that and it's
from Nick's or NYX or however you want
to say it but you get a basically a
white sort of basically matte shade this
silver color in the middle and then this
wonderful charcoal shade which is like
my favorite I've used that with
different looks we're actually used of
color and then what I just wanted a
little more depth in the crease I went
for that charcoal shade and it really
was like just what the doctor ordered
for that you know I mean it's like just
that perfect little shade to take your
color down a notch if you want to or you
want more contrast in your crease so
that is actually what the trio is called
white pearl silver charcoal from NYX
that would be available at cherry
culture calm and all these other
products I've mentioned prices vary by
Store but the lip glaze the Rimmel the
foundation I would say they're all gonna
be priced at probably seven dollars or
under next isn't every a minerals
product that I wanted to touch on here
briefly and this is the start to finish
in soft bronze and I say bronze because
that's what it's actually called but
look at it it's not very dark at all
it's like just a little more skin tones
than that then Meadowvale is no veil
kinda has that whitish sort of color
this is just a little more skin tone and
it's a finishing powder that actually if
I start to finish they mean like you
could put this on before you started
your mineral makeup and then use it as a
finishing powder I really only tend to
use it as a finishing powder but it's
supposed to cut down on shine and it
truly does I use this I've been using it
for the past couple weeks every day
after I finish my
in the morning for work and I think it
totally totally helps with the shine
issues so if you're thinking about
hitting like everyday mineral sample kit
or maybe just one of their makeup kits
think about making this to be part of it
it's with the finishing it'll be in with
the finishing powders and it's start to
finish soft bronze honestly I think it's
not about a color showing up on you it
really just kind of it's translucent but
it just has a great great ability to not
give you that shine I sometimes felt
like with Meryl they're like put it on
and I just felt like I had a little bit
too much of a luminous look to my skin
and this just totally takes it away
gives you that airbrushed feeling for
your makeup so I like that a lot that's
from everyday minerals and that is a
finishing powder all right I gotta get
through some other things really quick
now a body product dove energy glow
sunless tanner I use it in medium to
dark and I just like I mean I'm not like
super dark I've just been using this for
a while but this coat I feel like this
lighting is washing me out to begin with
but it really does work great at this
sunless tanner the scent is actually
pretty good it's kind of like sort of a
fruity kind of scent kind of fruity
floral and it's just one of those
gradual Tanner's and this is that time
of year where maybe you're looking for
that little pick-me-up you know the skin
is kind of getting dry and just not
quite as vibrant as you want it to be so
this is a great thing just as a
moisturizer and it's also great in terms
of the fact that it doesn't streak up
your skin you can use it gradually and
if you're a skin tone anywhere close to
mine and you get it in the medium to
dark you're probably going to notice a
good a good amount of attaining coming
from that so obviously I'm all for the
healthy way of tanning not tanning beds
for me anyway I mean everybody is
entitled to do what they want but if
you're really trying to fight the
premature aging get something like that
that's the Dove energy glow um a hair
product now these next three hair
products all come from Sally Beauty
Supply generally speaking I
great luck with their hair stuff and
this is from color s and so that is a
line that helps for any color treated
hair or any it could obviously work for
other types but it's gentle enough to
where it's not going to strip your hair
or have any impact on hair that may have
been colored and this is especially for
fine thin hair and it's called luster
cream it's in a little purple tube like
this and basically this will get rid of
your frizz it'll give your hair shine I
use it the an instance where I would use
this might be I get done blow-drying my
hair and I always feel like I have a
little bit of static and I just put a
little tiny bit of this like literally
that much okay just a little like tiny
drop and I just rub it between my hands
and I smooth it through my hair after I
blow-dry go ahead and put some on now
because it just helps with the shine the
scent is awesome by the way I love the
scent but it really cuts down the static
after I blow dry and I love that and
then another way you could use it as you
get done styling your hair and you've
straighten it or something and you just
want that extra kind la see look to it
and so just kind of you know run it
through your hair and it'll work well
for that and I think the fact that it's
made for fine or thin hair thick hair
you could use this too but I think what
they mean is this won't weigh down finer
thick hair I mean some people who do
have fine hair like myself are a little
bit wary of putting a cream product in
just for the fact that it can wait weigh
your hair down you can apply this to
damp or dry hair if you want to I just
do it when it's dry but I like this a
lot so that's from color s and that is
called luster cream available at Sally's
next couple of products I'm going to
sort of introduce to you as a set it's
so gorgeous
volumizing root mousse and volumizing
hairspray I think what this stuff is
like it's sort of a duplicate and a more
affordable duplicate of the big sexy
hair line I don't know if that's ringing
any bells for any of you but that's kind
of what this is like the root mousse
this would be something I use before I
blow dry and
if I know I'm going to use rollers that
day I find it gives a little more
texture in my hair to help really grip
like say the velcro rollers or whatever
so it's just a little spray pump just
pumps right out
that's for breathtaking volume it really
does help with my volume I like how it
looks like a little like megaphone or
something a little blow Horner's I don't
know I always whenever I use it I think
like I want to give some announcement
it's like oh so anyway I like that
mousse a lot I had a lot of mousse is I
can deal with lately and the volumizing
hairspray I thought okay I'm gonna get
this and I can really you know use a
volumizing hairspray but I don't really
plan on this dealing much in terms of
holding my style well this had told I
promise you the scent on it is kind of
semi strong and I can't I'm really
having a hard time putting my finger on
what I'm smelling here but it's not like
one of those super fruity if you're
familiar with like what Garnier products
know like and they're very fruity this
is not like that yes so it's maybe a
little more perfumey but for me I'm
really not a person to where the scent
is gonna make or break the product for
me it's more about what can it do and
this totally can hold a style and gives
you volume a good instance of one you
could use this gosh I'm going so long on
this video I'm sorry guy but an instance
where I hairspray like this can be great
as you've put in your velcro rollers all
over you spray after you put each one in
and so that is not only helping hold it
in but the volumizing agents in this are
once you take them out it's like your
hair is really voluminous afterwards so
anyway I'll try to find more on the
prices for these different things
specifically and put it in the
description box and also put where these
different things are all available at
for you thank you guys so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
