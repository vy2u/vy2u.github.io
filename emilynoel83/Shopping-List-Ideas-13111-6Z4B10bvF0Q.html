going to be my shopping list ideas video
this is kind of like current favorites
or monthly favorites and I have just
been messing with this top this is one
of those tops and say it's supposed to
like kind of come down over your
shoulders a little bit and have been
messing with it but like a good five
minutes before I decided to start
recording on this video and I wore this
today I was doing the news and I was
like I don't know it I felt like it
looked cute but I just kept kind of
messing with the way this whole thing
was like I mean kind of lean forward and
grab something but like oh my tops
messed up now so it's got it was a
Christmas present I'm not sure where it
came from but it's kind of like one of
those high-maintenance church you've
just got to keep your keep your eye on
what's going on with it or else it'll be
rolled up and around your neck getting
to my favorite makeup products lately I
have quite a few things to talk about
here and something that just kind of
occurred to me this morning when I was
thinking about different things I was
going to include it's a very like I
don't know I felt like I really didn't
have to think about what I put in this
video it all just kind of came to me and
I love it when it works out that way
like I typically don't want to have to
hunt through and think okay what can I
include for my shopping list ideas right
now because I think they should just
kind of jump out at you as things you've
been using so frequently that you that
really stand out in your mind as being
great products so that's really what I
feel like I have here I'm very
enthusiastic about what I've included
and the first thing is going to be an
awesome brush that I've stumbled upon
and I actually found it for a discounted
price so that makes me think go ahead
and get this while it's hot I found it
at Target you might find it in other
stores but it is this Ecotools
retractable is it retrying yeah
retractable
kabuki brush so you can see it's in some
very nice-looking packaging here I found
this at Target again you take the top
off and then you just pull that down and
it is such a nice dense soft brush oh my
goodness like you could use this for
your mineral foundation or today I use
this for my bronzer and like my powder
to set my foundation
and I just love how soft and just
perfect size this brush is and part of
my issue that prompted me to get this
was I've got my makeup bag which is
plenty big in size but I feel like I
have a really tall powder brush and I
worry that when the zipper comes over
the brush is gonna get stuck in there
and become a not so soft brush anymore
so this is just perfect for those of us
who have a reason to take you know a
powder brush with us in our makeup bag
but we want it to really stay in tip-top
condition and I got this for it was
$5.99 I got it for four dollars and 18
cents from targets so discounted price
always nice but and that rhymed and
another brush while I'm at it that's
available at Target but was part of my
swamp with my friend Abbi witch who I've
talked about this but I've talked about
this brush before and I seriously love
it so much and it's a smudger brush from
Sonia Kashuk and it is I will hold this
still for you here so it will eventually
focus in little flat brush that is just
great for doing a kind of less precise
eyeliner for setting a cream liner maybe
or what I like to do and I've noted this
in a couple different tutorials I've
done go side to side if you want you
know your fine line or this is this
works as a very nice lower line or
smudge if you go this way so instead of
flat turn it and smudge gives you a nice
smudge effect on your powder liner or
you know cream liner water next a
product from Mally beauty and I did my
all-day gorgeous review and tutorial not
too long ago and a lot of you who are
Mally beauty fans offered me some
suggestions in terms of products that
you like or you thought I should try
from the line because really that was
the first that I had tried any of that
stuff and many of you suggested the
cancellation concealer like that that is
your Holy Grail product and so I got it
here's how it comes this is like a
little pinky it kind
feels like suede almost and you unsnap
it and you've got your brush and then
these two compartments it's like a
two-step concealer process so let me
take those out in the brush and part of
the thing is like this is not this was
around I think $35 so you're obviously
paying for some of this packaging that
maybe you don't so much need but here's
what you've got these two sides and one
is your concealer so I am light - medium
or / anyways this is what it is here so
you got your nice creamy concealer I
love the consistency of this this is
very nice and creamy reminds me of Bobby
Brown so that's good but it's more like
it's not salmony it's just like skin
tone but that's working for me right now
and then the other side it looks like
just a white powder if you get it like a
swatch of it and then shear it out it's
just kind of a light almost it's not an
illuminating powder because there is no
shimmer or sparkle to it but it just
kind of I mean it goes off almost
translucent kind of sets the concealer
so those two steps and you have a brush
that you can use this side flat side for
the concealer but I like to use my
finger so I really take advantage of
this size this side which is like a kind
of like an eyeshadow blender brush and
that's what you use for the powder steps
so loving that really loving the
coverage I've been getting because I
feel like I've been getting less sleep
than I should be getting and that is
working very very well for me that I
mean it's kind of like you maybe not
don't really need that but having that
brush is a real plus and I like the two
steps for sure because I typically would
set my concealer with the powder so it's
nice to have two steps that are designed
to work together there face product that
I really like is from hard candy and
I've had this for a while probably have
mentioned it quite a few times but it's
these so baked bronzer in heatwave and
if you want some shimmer and maybe if
you like like the Mac mineralized
skinfinish powders this is a really
really pretty bronzer guys and I know I
talk I preach a lot about matte bronzers
but this is good if you're looking for a
deeper somewhat shimmery bronzer to use
as sparingly I mean don't layer upon
layer this all over your face but you
know kind of use it for getting that tan
glow back now that we are in winter and
we're all bracing for that storm that's
gonna come through and like Pelt so many
states with ice and snow and whatnot so
I really do like this this is a pretty
glow and it's not overly shimmery but
once again use with caution if you use
just a small amount you're going to get
a very nice effect a few I related
products right now um I love this stuff
we're taking off I makeup residue after
you've taken off your makeup or
sometimes you wake up in the morning and
you're like ah why you know didn't I get
all that off the first time it's the
expert sensitive gentle eye makeup
removal pads from boots this is another
Target brand and it looks like this this
line of stuff this expert sensitive
stuff is really inexpensive I actually
picked up a moisturizer and an eye cream
and stuff because I want to try them and
see if they're really good because if
they're really awesome they're like
really good prices you know seven
dollars or less so pretty good and here
you get 60 of these pads and they're
just great for in the morning when I'm
getting up you know like I said thought
I had a clean face but had a little bit
left to remove the pads are fairly small
and so I really want to be clear that I
have not used these to just take off all
my eye makeup I am recommending these
for the purpose that I like to use eye
makeup remover for because at mile a
daily facials cleansing cloths get rid
of you know everything else pretty much
so when you just have a little extra
these are so thin and you know they've
got the product on there wipe them off I
recommend you know wiping under your eye
with a q-tip or a Kleenex because they
will leave just a little bit of moisture
there and you obviously don't want to
have any sort of remover on when you go
to put I makeup on so kind
defeats the purpose there but I really
do like these and again it's for
sensitive areas I mean my eyes tend to
burn kind of easily with certain
products but these are very very good
and an eye shadow I'm loving right now
is from the Victoria's Secret beauty
rush line and it's a wet dry shadow in
bronzing err and I got this the other
day and I think it is such a pretty
shade the kind of shade that can look
great all over your eyelid but you could
because it picks up the light it's a
nice metallic but it could also go into
your crease so this is like the type of
shadow that can be one look you know you
might not have to pick up another shadow
you could put it all over the lid take
it right up to the crease and because it
has that reflective quality it picks up
the light where you want it to and it
can recede into the crease you know
where there's not a lot of light and can
work very very nicely and the girl that
was in the checkout she was like you
should try using this wet as well and I
haven't done that yet but she said it
really has a pretty effect what and
another eye product that was something I
tried early on and I tried this like
maybe a year or so ago and I really
wasn't using the proper brush I now like
to use small pointy brushes like this
one from Mac pointing tip it made all
the difference for the wet and wild
cream eyeliner here that I have I have
it in black I don't know if you saw this
is what it looks like with the cap on
cap just twists off and it's very creamy
I think I was just like maybe not
enjoying the product so much at first
because I was using the brush that came
with it which is like a larger angled
brush but it is so creamy and it's so
rich and man I mean lots of people have
said you got to try it and I was like
well I did try it didn't knock my socks
off and then since that time having
discovered you know smaller brushes like
this instead of always using angled ones
and then I was like oh man this is great
a very good long wearing liner upper
lash line lower lash
line doesn't matter works very well the
thing I have on right now is one of the
covergirl nature looks is it luxury
touched by Nature Oh floss ball I'm
reading the description they're not the
product um but it's in sandstone and so
these are kind of like a tinted bomb and
at first I kind of didn't love it
because I thought it had sort of a
texture to it it wasn't perfectly smooth
off the tube and that kind of was
off-putting at first but then I started
wearing this and I started using it with
semi natural I looks like I had today or
a smokey eye or barely there kind of
eyes and I thought this lipstick seems
to kind of play well with all of those
eye looks and so there it is it's um it
looks maybe a little more peachy in the
tube but it comes off kind of pink there
and here it is and its own kind of
swatch but there's a little shimmer to
it it's just so easy to wear and apply
and it really does make your lips feel
kind of hydrated one more beauty brush
product it's a lip gloss it is this ever
like bubblegum Barbie pink or what and
it is called taffy go lucky and I'm
gonna let you get a look at it up close
there well it focuses in you can see
it's pink but the shimmer in it is gold
so it's kind of unique I mean at first
glance you're like ah it's a bright pink
lip gloss but then it really is pretty
it has kind of that a bubblegum scent to
it as well but I was just impressed with
the the quality of the color of that it
is kind of a fun bright pink you can
sheer it out more and finally something
I had on in a recent tutorial video but
it's definitely a lip product I would
suggest to those of you who like a pale
pink lip but are looking for the right
thing to kind of set it off because a
lot of times you can take a deeper lip
color and top it off with you know just
about any gloss you want and that deeper
lip color is still going to come through
but when you're working with a light
pink lip only so many things can go on
top of that and still complement the
color without covering it up
so hopefully that makes sense but this
is the elf hyper shine lip gloss in
fairy one-dollar eyes lips face calm or
at Target you can see it's got a little
bit of an iridescent pinky pearly
quality they're not sure how many of you
are fans of this kind of applicator
where it comes out of the brush but that
can be kind of convenient
I'm just watching it there it's right
there so see how I know I got do many
things going on on this hand but yeah
right there and really you know you can
see once it picks up the light very very
nice on top of your light pink or nude
lipsticks well that about does it guys
for my shopping list ideas this month
around hope you enjoyed some of my
suggestions for watching again guys and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
