me for this video this is going to be a
shopping list ideas video and I know
it's been way too long since I've done
one of these so thank you for tuning in
I hope you enjoy this I've got a lot to
talk about I've got about ten different
items to mention here and this basically
is the same as like people's current
favorite videos or monthly favorites
that they do I just call them shopping
list ideas because I feel like maybe
next time you're out and about this may
be something to look at in person and
decide if you want to get it for
yourself so some of these things are
things that I have bought recently they
may be some sort of rediscovered
products within my own collection but
either way it's things that I'm using a
lot lately and I really want to tell you
about so it's gonna be like basically a
bunch of many reviews but they're all
pretty much positive since these are
definite recommendations so the first
thing I want to mention are the color
icon palettes from wet-and-wild if you
follow my blog which is beauty broadcast
net you will know that I have swatched
these both so if you wanted closer look
you can definitely go to my blog but as
you can see here I have this palette in
pride which is the blues and greens and
this one is in lust and this is some
pretty purple so I'll open it up so you
can see it better so I love both of
these and I do have a two in one
tutorial coming soon on the the blue
green palette basically a natural look
and a dramatic look and how you can
transition between the two but I really
like these palettes and if you got a
good look at them you can tell that
three of the shades are matte and three
of the shades are shimmery in both
palettes and there are also some other
options that they have - they have like
a brownish one and sort of a smokey
neutral palette but like these three or
shimmer these three are matte and I tell
you they are they are so vibrant so look
at those matte shades that's something
we're not used to seeing not only from
wet and wild but from drugstore brands
in general I feel like we don't usually
get the greatest selection of met
in the drugstores so take advantage of
this if you can find it I don't know if
it's out in all stores yet but it should
be coming out soon so keep your eye out
for the color icon palettes I can tell
you for sure that I love the one in lust
which is purples and pride which is
green and blue but there are two others
that I really want to try as well onto
another eye product that I'm really
liking it's from Palladio and I know I
used one of these I think I used it in
my Real Housewives of Orange County -
toriel in a different shade but I tried
this one in metallics and I'm like I
just fell in love with it I think I
might like it even more
yeah the shade is metallics it's the
baked eyeshadow trio from Palladio and
you can see this is a really really nice
neutral you know trio of colors and it
is so warm and great it's gonna make you
start thinking about summertime and how
much you want to you know be really you
know warming up your skin there's the
pretty gold that's your lightest shade
then you have this middle color which is
kind of a copper and then you've got
kind of a rich chocolate brown I feel
like they truly are nice metallic colors
they really look good as kind of you
know you can mix and match the way you
want to use it even that coppery shade
can be a pretty highlight if you use it
kind of light and diffuse so all three
colors look really nice together they
blend really flawlessly and they just
have a really nice appearance on the
skin next I have a couple of mascaras
that I want to talk about on the first
is the XXL Pro 24-hour bold mascara from
Maybelline the only complain about
Maybelline is like the names of their
products are way too long but anyway
it's one of these two in one mascara
products where you've got a first step
and then a second step that you'll do so
yeah basically it's it's pretty easy to
do the neat thing about this product is
that the first step instead of being
like a white primer coat it's actually a
dark coat so if you just wanted to go
with that one step you'd be good
truthfully the first step in this is
really my favorite it goes on so nicely
this is a look at the brush and this
would be more more or less your
thickening step and it's really kind of
a small brush it's sort of narrow but it
has a lot of bristles really close
together and it really thickens and
separates and gives you the the look of
a lot of volume on your lashes I have
that on my top lashes today and then you
apply the second step which you're gonna
notice is a brush with a little bit
longer bristles and this is really going
to give you some length so you just kind
of apply one then apply the other while
this is sort of that same kind of semi
wet formula from Maybelline I think I'm
gonna continue to like this even more as
I use it and I feel like they do a good
job of at least the way the tube is
constructed you don't pull out the brush
and have too much product on the brush
especially with that first step I think
it's very important if you're trying to
separate the lashes and you don't want
them to as I've said team up into like
five lashes all the lashes on your eye
just turned into you know spouting off
in like five different different
directions it's really important to
separate on that first step and I think
it really does that in terms of the
24-hour wear concept I think this is
great for it for an extended wear
product that's not necessarily
waterproof I don't see flaking and
smudging with this I've gone through a
whole day with this product on my eyes I
put it on put my makeup on at 1:30 a.m.
in case you're watching me for the first
time I enter a morning newscast so I
have not touched up my eyes at all I put
a little powder on my face before this
video and my lip gloss which I'll talk
about in a minute but in terms of my
eyes I have not touched up one bit and I
have not gotten any sort of smudging
flaking going on under the eye and part
of the reason for that transitions me
right into that my next product which is
a mascara that I've been using for quite
some time on my lower lash line I really
love it I just thought it would make
sense to mention it here for you as well
it's Maybelline lash discovery mascara
it's that tiny brush that's going to
find all of the lashes that you have
sometimes that's the issue with
with your lower lashline is really
detecting those small lashes and not
making them too terribly thick and
spidery whenever I do mascara on my
lower lashline at first I was really
leery of doing that because I thought I
don't want any smudging and I feel like
I can put this on there not get my
lashes looking too thick and unnatural
and I also don't get smudging with this
so like I said I've had this on all day
I've I do not have any issues under my
eye right now and there's a lot to be
said for that it's one thing if your
mascara on your upper lashes isn't going
anywhere but if you can put this on your
lower lashes and it's you know still not
getting getting messy on your on this
area right here under your eye there's a
lot to be said for that so if you are
looking for a great mascara and you
could use this on your upper lash line
too just for some really natural
definition but I will use this almost on
a daily basis on my lower lash line and
I'm really happy with the results I get
next I want to mention what's on my lips
today and this might be coming off a
little darker on my camera screen I
can't quite tell but this is a pretty
muff lip color the shade is plumped ma
then it's the infallible plumping six
hour lip gloss the color on this is
really beautiful you can see it's got
sort of that metallic kind of shimmery
tone to it I really like the packaging
but I also love the way this does stay
on my lips it's in terms of the plumping
aspect yes I can feel a little tingle
it's not over-the-top it's not you know
giving me a drastic change in the
fullness of my lips but I also just feel
like the appearance of this it's a nice
shine it really gives you that
full-bodied color and I feel like that
does help in making your lips look plump
as well not necessarily by the reaction
that's happening with your lips but just
the appearance of the for the way the
formulation makes them appear if that
makes sense it's got that nice little
shimmer to it so it really kind of
attracts the light and does make your
lips look fuller so I really like that
and this color is just amazing I was
looking
all the different shades and this one
just really caught my eye and it
apparently caught a bunch of other
people's eyes as well because there is
only one left it has this applicator
that is sort of that you know it's the
sponge tip applicator but yet it also
has that little hole in the center which
seems to carry a little bit of extra
product which is nice I also like that
it comes to a point which makes it very
easy to define this area and once you
get it on it's so unique in that it
really is a long-lasting gloss it stays
philosophy on your lips but it lasts a
really long time I mean so when you get
it on there it's not really going
anywhere it's not long wearing to the
point of being like covergirl outlast
where you might have to scrub that stuff
off when you want it off you could still
you know blot your lips and kind of get
this off of your lips if you wanted it
off but it is a relatively long wearing
lip gloss I mean I can put it on before
my newscast and it's still on there well
after the news even though I've been
talking a lot and it's you know it
doesn't necessarily need a touch-ups
so it's a really great thing use it with
a little liner and you're good to go a
couple of bronzers to mention here real
quick on the chocolate Soleil bronzer
from Too Faced which does contain real
cocoa just a little update on that I
included this in my haul video just I
don't know was it like last week or
something and I am loving this been
using it everyday using it kind of as a
contour and just lightly kind of all
over my face still has that fantastic
smell that hasn't worn off and it just
wears wonderfully looks really good on
the skin great if you feel like you've
been trying a lot of bronzers and
they're just not showing up enough on
your skin if you are a medium toned skin
tone that feels like you feel like
everything's too light and you want a
matte bronzer that's what this is no
shimmer check out that chocolate bronzer
from Too Faced gorgeous packaging - and
the other one I want to mention maybe
you do want a little shimmer but you
don't want it to be over-the-top on the
so baked bronzer in heatwave from hard
candy been using this a lot lately - and
it has that if
effect of say the mineralized skinfinish
from Mac and this is not too terribly
shimmery you can see it has kind of that
nice sheen of I've of course to apply it
there in a really concentrated way on my
fingers you would never apply it you
know that way on your cheeks you would
use a brush but it just goes on really
smooth gives you a nice glow definitely
a great thing if you wanted a color to
put all over maybe your decollete area
your shoulders and give you that nice
shimmer really pretty on the face as
well just use it lightly I mean any any
product like this with shimmer and any
bronzer really use it sparingly but
you're gonna find that those pretty
tones of gold that are kind of laced
through this bronzer come out very nice
on your skin next I want to tell you
about some false lashes that I
absolutely love and I didn't find them
for quite some time in my nearby Target
store but I found them over the weekend
and I'm really glad I saved them to show
you this in my shopping list ideas video
they're the Sonia Kashuk Demi lash set
and this is what they look like they
kind of look like the lashes are Criss
crossing over one another and that is
not a full lash that you're seeing there
that is really a lash that's going to
basically sit on the outer half of your
eye it's gonna sell in the upper outer
half and it's going to give you that
nice kind of slightly flared out look
for people who are asking about me like
is it too much to wear false lashes to
work no and this would probably be your
answer on that these just have the
perfect length they and they stay nice
for so long that's one of the biggest
reasons I'm so glad I didn't forget to
say that if you are maintaining these in
other words using an eyelash or an eye
makeup remover and like a cotton swab to
get the product off of these every time
you wear them and taking off you know
pulling off the little bits of glue that
are on there these will last you a
really long time like I'm talking a lot
of wears probably if you wore them you
know I don't know you could probably get
well
over a dozen wares if you just took care
of them in a basic basic way I have a
whole blog about maintaining and caring
for your false lashes so check that out
but if you also feel very intimidated by
wearing a full strip of lashes all
across your eyes half sets like this
Demi set are very easy to apply you
don't have to try quite as hard to get
them just right and laying right over
you know really pushing them down and
dealing with the inner corner that inner
corner is a very sketchy area to try to
get the false lashes down on so when you
just have that half of your eye to worry
about you can do this if you've never
tried them before try to find these or
at least some half strips of lashes that
are similar to these also I think I did
a video on this trimming your lashes if
you find a full set you can't come up
with the half set trim them snip them a
little bit give them that nice taper so
they're fuller on the outsides and these
look really really nice on finally the
last thing I want to mention here is a
new perfume I got that I love I just got
this not too long ago here and I was
with Tyler he was kind of helping me you
know figure out what smelled the best
and I ended up getting the Juicy Couture
fragrance here it looks like this really
liked it I love that it smells kind of
like lilac and Tyler picked up on that
right away and I thought he likes it a
lot I like it too I'm just gonna get it
and I was at my local Kohl's and I found
that they had a lot of sets leftover
sets that contained like this is the Eau
de Parfum and it also has a little like
extra concentrated parfum there and not
the oh and that's odo parfum as opposed
to the Eau de Toilette which is the
parfum is a little more concentrated in
terms of the scent you're going to get
off of it
but anyway it came with that that little
mini guy and also a body sorbet lotion
so getting him in that 3-pack it was
actually discounted quite a bit so
you're going to pay a whole lot less by
getting them all together
maybe finding those Christmas leftovers
in your store might not be a bad thing
to seek out just see if they have them
it was not down from about I think $45
in the set to maybe like $35 so $10 off
to get not only the perfume but also
those two little add-ons is a pretty
great deal so I wanted to just let you
know that you know just because
Christmas is long gone doesn't mean you
might not still find those deals in your
local Kohl's or maybe elsewhere so
thanks so much guys for tuning in for
the shopping list ideas video I'll try
not to wait as long between them I think
the last one I did was like stocking
stuffers so yeah I need to do them more
often but thank you for tuning in and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
