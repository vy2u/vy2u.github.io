I am really excited to share my current
favorites over pretty much the past
month with you now I've got some nails
I've got a body product or a hair
product shower product and some several
different makeup things so I'm going to
jump right in and actually talk about
nail polish because there is a
relatively new kind out that I am super
excited about and I it really solidified
this in my mind when i did my Valentines
nails and I had like each nail painted a
different shade of like red or pink and
I noticed out of all these I use
different brands different colors and I
noticed the one that went on like the
smoothest the most opaque and one coat
was also one that lasted the longest and
that was the wet and wild mega last and
I use this red shade I read a good book
re d haha and it's just really pretty
creamy read all the shades pretty much
that I have are like creamy shade
there's no shimmer in them and they go
on really nice and smooth so I love that
red that's a fantastic read and on my
toes right now I've got club havana on
which is a nice really creamy orange
also used bite the bullet which is a
nice lavender thrush is wider it reminds
me of these basically remind me of a
little cheaper alternative to Sally
Hansen complete salon manicure which was
really you know like a favorite nail
polish of mine but see how the brush is
nice and wide and I think that helps you
paint it on really evenly another thing
that I've been really coming back to a
lot this month partially because i think
it's just super quick to pick it up and
you can pretty much come up with a look
that's going to suit whatever you're
wearing I've been bad lately I feel like
when I've been getting up in the early
mornings for the news about not knowing
exactly what I'm going to wear like some
days I pick it out you know the night
before but then other days it's kind of
like I don't know and then I do my
makeup first and
I want something that's just going to go
with pretty much whatever I put on so
the Naked palette just the regular old
naked palette which this one I feel if
you watched my review this one versus
naked too I feel like this one can be
just a little more versatile in terms of
the smoky looks but what really got me
on to picking this backup was another
youtuber connait her name's Taylor and
her channel as bees for beauty and she's
really sweet she's beautiful and she has
come up with like these naked palette
quick looks I think she's calling him
and she's got several of them on there
where you can she just goes through him
real quick and she points out like
exactly what color she's using and just
puts together different looks different
color combos with this palette so that
kind of got me started and looking at it
in a little different way but I've
always loved this palette and I'm just
kind of back to it now another thing i'm
loving in terms of lips are these great
little Neutrogena revitalizing lip balms
see how they're different shaped they're
like oval shaped and I tell you these so
would have been in my video on favorite
hydrating lip sticks but I had only
tried one and it was the sheer shimmer
so it was just kind of like a light
pearl a color and I knew I'm like okay
this is alright but I don't know how
pigmented the rest of them are and so I
tried a few more and then I was super
you know on the bandwagon with I
remember when these used to be round
like neutrogena used to have round
shaped the rim kind of like a silvery
tube tinted lip balms and I really like
those so I'm glad I finally gave these a
shot but there's the sheer shimmer this
one is that brightest one there is sunny
berry and that's what I'm wearing right
now so you can see a lot of color and
they're really like hydrating the next
one is this is healthy blush so that's a
little bit lighter more traditional pink
shade and then petal glow is this one so
that's kind of a little more neutral
about that shape as well it just goes on
so easy in that oval shape so I'm loving
that they're cool new lip product is um
covergirl blast flip sticks and I have
this one in vixen two lipsticks in one
and it's the idea that you could layer
these or kind of use them you know one
or the ugh love this one because one end
is kind of a berry color and you know
how I like the berries so there's that
and then the other shade is more of a
shimmery pink and you guys know how I
love to kind of pop the the center of
the lower lip a little bit and so some
of these shades some of these different
blast flip sticks are really great for
that you could put the berry one all
over and then I like to you know take
the lighter shade and highlight the
center of the lower lip surprisingly
long wearing on these normally after I
get through an entire newscast we do we
do the little cut ins the little updates
during good morning america and i feel
like by that time i have to refresh
whatever's going on on my lips but these
actually last a nicely long time so i
was very impressed why have you been
asking about how that whole Sephora lash
stash went that i got for christmas and
i want to elaborate on that on my blog
with some pictures but for now I'll just
tell you what one I thought was the best
in my opinion and it was the tart gifted
Amazonian clay mascara I'm wearing it
now and I feel like you guys know I love
the lights camera lashes really great
mascara what am I probably my top
favorite mascaras I actually feel like
this is a little bit better than that
one the brush is really similar if you
see that it's it's our traditional
bristle brush something about the
formula it's a little more lengthening
so I feel like it has the same
thickening wonderful qualities that
lights camera lashes does but this one
seems to just add a little more length
so I'm really enjoying that and it's
very buildable to you put on a coat you
know you're like okay I like that that's
really great you put on another coat
you're like ooh it's nice without
getting clumpy on you so that's a really
cool mascara so I just had the little
one right now because that came in that
group of a whole bunch of Sephora
mascaras some falsies I have been
enjoying for a more dramatic look are
these red chair
number 43 and here's a look at them in
the packaging I do need to clean them
off but I was wearing these I was
wearing these last night I've worn them
a few times before so they're still
holding up nicely as you can see here
but I just felt like they gave just a
wonderful frame to the I you know
they're a little bit flared on the
outsides a little bit longer here than
they are here give a lot of fullness you
can do a relatively simple I look pop
these on and you are suddenly glammed
certain I shadow I've been gravitating
toward is by mac and it's called cork
and this is a satin finish I mean really
there's no there's no real shimmer to it
you could see it as practically a matte
type color but I really enjoy this shade
for using it with a blending brush like
this and i'm already i am already
wearing it right now so i just kind of
go over what i did but it's great for
getting kind of a warm um or natural
crease color see how this is just really
easy to pop on here without much work
right in this area where you know it's
slightly visible on top of your brow
bone such a light shade so it's kind of
odd how it gives you that depth but it
does and I like that it's not sparkly
because I've been getting people asking
me you know more and more about matte
eyeshadows in it for people who may be
noticing some wrinkling around their
eyes you know you don't want a whole lot
of shimmer and this is a nice color to
pop in the crease not be too heavy not
be too dark but just really give that
nice little amount of warmth around the
other awesome product that I had to
mention because I feel like I am lacking
a tan this time again you're just trying
to give myself some color in some way
because I really need it for being on
camera for work and something I've been
just going back to and I've had this for
a while is the Laura Geller baked body
frosting and Tahitian glow now this is
huge and it comes with a puff that you
can apply it with and it's basically a
big jumbo sized baked type bronzer
and you can just apply it with the puff
and what I'll do with this and also much
use it on my face but I use it on this
whole area here any visible skin
basically on the news because it's my
pet peeve and I see this all too often
news anchors that have one color on
their face and another color on their
chest so I or on their neck or anything
there men and women I see it all the
time and so I use this pretty much every
day I just swipe my little puff in there
and you can use it wet if you want
really intense color I usually just use
it dry and I will just go over you know
this whole area here and it can take
care of some tan lines for you most
often if you have that issue it's a ton
of product and I've been using this for
months and months and it's still going
strong on another thing though that you
might look into if you don't want to buy
the Laura Geller Milani makes a baked
bronzer that is very similar a big
kabuki brush to one of these and you
know use that all over and get a similar
effect so just an idea of Italy wrapping
up the the favorites with quite possibly
the best smelling shampoo I've ever
smelled and it is everlasting sunshine
by suave now Tyler uses this I mean I
kind of bounced around between a few
different shampoos but that he will
generally just pick up a suave one you
know when he's running out and this one
says infused with passion flower and
vanilla extracts but I gotta tell you I
smell banana it's so good it smells so
good um I just can't say enough about
how good this smells and it's just you
know it does have maybe that slight hint
of floral I can kind of sense the
vanilla a little bit but I can also
smell some banana in there and it's just
delightful and i would highly recommend
that if you want to use some suave I
mean it works fine for my hair I feel
like it removes all build-up or anything
because I use a lot of styling products
like hairspray and I feel like it gets
it 100% clean but the most fantastic
thing about this I'm not going to lie
it's the scent so just had to throw that
out there almost as soon as I smelled it
I thought I must tell people about this
it says new so it's MIT might just be
coming out in some stores so thank you
so much for watching my favorites this
month lots of great products that I feel
very strongly about so let me know what
your favorites are and thanks again for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
