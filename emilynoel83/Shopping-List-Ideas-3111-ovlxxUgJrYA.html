shopping list ideas video many of you
kind of reminded me hey it's getting
time to be do shopping list ideas and so
I'm like yes it is and I was kind of
thinking the other day about what I was
going to put in this video and honestly
over the past month I have tried a lot
of things that have just been kind of
so-so for me you know like different
drugstore products or even high-end
products I've tried and have been kind
of like a little disappointed by them
nothing to the point that I wouldn't
still may be continued to use it now and
then but you know it's got to be good to
make it into my shopping list ideas
video and I mean I know that you will
sometimes see things that I've
recommended and really take those
suggestions seriously and go out and try
the products yourself so I definitely
want them to be things that I love and
so I really kind of you know thought
about what I had in this video and at
the end of this video by the way I do
have a special offer for my beauty
broadcast viewers in Texas so I will
explain why you get a special offer
coming up at the end of this video but
first off I'm going to get started with
some favorite makeup products from the
month and one thing that I really turned
out to love is from Milani and you may
remember this from a haul video they had
these new baked blushes and as you look
at them you know they really kind of
remind you of either you know like a mac
mineralize skinfinish or a laura geller
baked blush this shade is number two and
it's called rose deorro and it is a
beautiful I'm it kind of like a peachy
apricot blush with laced with gold and
it has a really really nice subtle
shimmer to it now you could put on way
too much of this and be a little too
insanely shimmery but i have it on today
and I just kind of brushed it right here
and I just love the glow that it's
giving and I think it's almost like a
blush and highlight in one which is
really interesting but what what's also
nice about it is the amount i have it
right there on that ring finger there's
a nice amount of pigmentation to this as
well so sometimes you get all shimmer no
pigment and it's it's hard to find a
balance with shimmery blushes but this
one is
really really pretty another product
that i like and i am wearing today is my
lip gloss and it is from NYX and it's
the mega shine lipgloss in natural so to
kind of show you here this is just a
creamy neutral lip gloss and it has no
shimmer in it but it is that nice kind
of I would call it like a default lip
gloss if you've got maybe a certain I
look where it's gotten a little colorful
and you're thinking you know I want
something on my lips I don't feel like a
nude lip but I just want some nice shine
I love this shade for that because like
i went with sort of some plum tones on
my eye today and I just kind of wanted
the lips to be a little more neutral and
I just love how smooth creamy you know i
love the next mega shine lip glosses
they got like top honors in my emily
awards video for this past year but this
one is a really good one for just sling
for that perfect neutral gloss now on
the other end of the spectrum how about
a nice bright pink lipstick as we start
to kind of ease our way into spring
revlon colorburst lipstick incarnation
now I was actually I mean I've known
I've loved this since I first bought it
but it was so funny because the other
day on Twitter somebody asked me about a
great um pink for spring and this is the
one I recommended and I love it because
it's not a baby pink it's not an
out-of-this-world fuchsia it's kind of
just the perfect if you're wanting a
pink that does I mean it's I need to
swatch it for you because this is not
like you know barely-there pink it
definitely has some pop to it but it's
not like overly dark I think it's in the
 in their range of shades it runs
somewhere in the middle it's creamy no
shimmer it has that nice kind of
moisturizing Sheen that I like in these
colorburst lipsticks and lots of pigment
so I just I just love that one and I
kind of my recommendation on Twitter the
other day just sort of reminded me maybe
people are looking for something like
this right now and I do recommend
carnation now on either side of this if
you're thinking I want to go lighter
than that you have baby pink on the
lighter side and
you that is even brighter than this
so this kind of lets you know this is
sort of in the middle where the Pink's
are concerned with color burst next a
little eye shadow palette that I think
you're going to be excited about because
it is affordable and it is very
accessible right now and it is the wet
and wild trio its color icon trio in
silent treatment this was one that um
let's see I've had this for maybe I
don't know a couple months now and it's
so great because i love you get this
peachy shade excuse my i cannot get good
looking polished in these videos i swear
but you've got a nice peach you've got
sort of a shimmery taupe and then this
great shade that's kind of like a deep
deep rich brown with a little bit of
sparkle in it and i love that you only
need a tiny amount of that to make it
work but i'll just do a few quick little
swatches here for you of these shades so
you can see how pretty they are together
so this dark shade can be your crease it
can be your liner you've got to kind of
lighter to medium shades to work with
and i just think this is such a
no-brainer palette and it's nice to have
a shade that is so so dark and rich that
you could pull off the smokiest smokey
eye with this palette and also you could
view a really sweet light I with it as
well and now a brush that's been kind of
a standout for me over the past month
it's from sigma and it is the e25
blending brush so this is the brush that
is a little bit flat it looks like it's
kind of been pinched right here okay
where that Farrell is it's kind of you
know narrower they're wider their narrow
watch just a little bit flat instead of
being you know domed all the way around
so this has been a great brush for me
lately and I've had this but I just
don't think I've really fallen into a
good way to use it up until recently and
I like taking you know any kind of mid
colored crease shade today it was like
sort of this medium plum color I was
using and it's just a great size for
kind of wedging there in the crease and
then when you want to blend it out more
you can turn it more vertically and
really get that nice
soft blend that takes you up just a
little bit um this has just been a great
brush for me and what I like about what
Sigma is doing is you can get this you
know in the kit or you can buy it for
just I jotted it down here just nine
dollars if you say you know I have all
the other brushes i want this is kind of
a special brush that I haven't come
across in the drug store yet so I think
it's very special and I do enjoy it for
my crease to wrap up this video I have a
few haircare favorites and I was
introduced to these products by someone
who has been following beauty broadcasts
for years now and she I I've made
friends with her through facebook and
through the beauty broadcast facebook
page where many people have made
connections and I just she has been so
kind and following my channel and just
talking back and forth with halls and
this and that and she gave me some
products that she thought I would really
like and they're from redken and so I
thought okay you know I pretty much used
a lot of drugstore hair products but i
thought you know I'm gonna try these
things and see if I like them and so she
sent me some and there are a few that
have really stood out to me is things
that I will continue to buy because
they've done some great things for my
hair and one is the all soft shampoo and
now I think that I have been not doing
my hair a lot of favors by using and
always reaching for the volumizing
product in any line and I feel like
especially over the winter my hair has
gotten dry and especially I mean drier
than I remember it being ever at the
ends and just issues like that and so
and I've have had it recently cut so it
is a little shorter it's still all
layered up but is shorter but anyway I
felt the need to use something that gave
back a little bit more than my hair and
this all soft shampoo is for dry brittle
hair I wouldn't have thought of my hair
like that but I love what it's done for
shine for the texture for the ability to
manage my hair in the mornings when I'm
getting ready it's like I would have
like a static problem and dryness and
issues like that with my hair and this
has made it so manageable and easy to
work with so i love the all soft shampoo
i still need to try the conditioner
I love that for my shampoo before I blow
dry I've been using the body full volume
amplifier thickening lift spray and what
I like about this is that it's not a
heavy mousse because my hair while I
guess it is somewhat dry it still is
fine and so I don't want to put too much
in there to weigh it down or anything
like that so this is nice i will put it
on before I blow dry in the morning you
know I do I shower before bed and then I
will wake up and my hair maybe just a
little bit damp so I want to hit it with
the blow dryer just to to liven it up a
little bit more and something like this
before I blow dry works really well and
then a really kind of different product
that I like a lot and have been using on
a daily daily basis is the redken
nature's rescue radiant sea spray and
this is interesting it says it's a time
touch hair fragrance and so you what you
do is says it's the lightweight
texturizer with time touch fragrant cap
fragrance capsules that release a burst
of oceanic sent when hair is touched so
basically you shake it you can put it on
dry or damp hair I like to use it kind
of after I blow dry when my hair
sometimes does still get that static
going on just a little bit and I put a
little bit of this like spray it in my
hand and then spray you know kind of
work it through my hair and I love the
fact that it does keep my hair smelling
good but not only that I feel like it's
kind of a good a static tamer and be and
it says a texturizer so you can like tip
your hair over really get it in there it
works really well and I just think the
scent is amazingly fresh just the
perfect scent you know to kind of get
through your hair because your hair
carries a lot of sindh
the deal that Denis is offering which is
really nice of her to do this because I
was just like you know she sent me these
as a little gift and I got back to us
like there are a few these things that I
just love and so she was like she works
at the pro clips in Terrell Texas and if
you go there and you mentioned beauty
broadcast she will give you forty
percent off on products forty percent
off so that is pretty awesome pro clips
Terrell Texas that's where denied works
tell her hi from Emily and if she will
give you that forty percent off so that
is awesome if you're in Texas or you
know surrounding area you go to see her
that was really really sweet of her and
I love it because she has been following
beauty broadcast and has been a friend
of mine for quite a while on there so um
