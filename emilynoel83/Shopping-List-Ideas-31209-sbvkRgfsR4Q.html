list ideas video if you haven't seen one
of these that I've done before it's sort
of like a current favorites video but
just some of my suggestions on things
that I've either recently bought or have
just been using a lot lately things i
really like right now so um i'm going to
go ahead and get started with a new
lotion actually a new scent that's come
out at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I don't know if
you guys have seen it yet but it's
called butterfly flower and when I was
there not too long ago and they offered
me this for just a dollar when I was
checking out and it smells really good
it's got kind of a floral / slightly
fruity scent to it I like it a lot so I
just kind of wanted to give you a heads
up on that that's kind of something new
and and you know maybe try one of the
smaller sizes or obviously you can go to
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and smell like any
scent they have but I like the butterfly
flower scent another thing before I get
into makeup is a product from beer oil
products it's from be luscious and it's
there long I think that's how you
pronounce it I'm sure somebody will
correct me but it's 0 0 l 0 ng long T
and carrot oil eye cream this stuff is
so awesome you can get it on their
website and beer oil products com it has
the greatest scent and i've been using
it every night before I go to bed and i
will be posting some sort of skin care
video soon i've been getting questions
wanting an update on that but i just
can't get over the smell of it first
first of all but it's it's got such a
nice texture for me because i have used
heavier eye creams in the past and this
is just perfect because it's not so
heavy the heavy ones sometimes just can
irritate me so this is kind of like it's
supposed to decrease puffiness and also
decrease fine lines too so
I use it a lot like around here and
underneath and I'm just been pleased
with the way it's moisturised so far and
I like I said I used it before bed it's
it's a be luscious product I really
really like this stuff so great eye
cream I really kind of struggled finding
something i really liked where that's
concerned and i think i have now so that
is cool um another thing that I like
that I featured in a video not too long
ago is a product it's not a new product
but it's a new shade that's come out
it's the shimmer strips from physicians
formula basically this could be your
bronzer your blush your eyeshadow or
whatever and this shade is called
Waikiki strip and it's a peachy glow
bronzer so this is a new one that came
out and I just like this i think i could
use this for a really nice i tutorial
sometime but it's got this nice peachy
shade right here at the end and i've
just been enjoying this a lot so far
milani it's very similar to milan ease
product that is like shimmery strips
like this too that's another good option
I don't know sometimes one or the other
is on sale and they're both pretty
comparable but you can use those
individually for eyeshadow and I think
that's really cool i love multi-purpose
products another thing I like in kind of
an interesting fact this eyeshadow trio
I believe it was the first I shadow trio
I'd ever bought when I started using
makeup so obviously I've repurchased
since then but I love this so much it's
and I kind of forgot how much I liked it
because I got into makeup and just got
another things you know tried new colors
and hadn't come back to this recently
but it's the covergirl um what is it is
that look I I enhancers trio and
shimmering sands and what you get here
is three kind of shimmery shades one is
like sort of a pinky pearl it kind of
reminds me of um max Naked Lunch that I
have that in shade that's what it
reminds me of when I use it
this shade is a pretty kind of um you
know shimmery light taupe and then a
medium brown shimmer and they're just
really easy to work with I mean if you
want one of those really natural days
the country woods palette is a court is
a pretty high I've gonna call it a
quartet it's a quad and it's got um the
difference between that and say this is
not only that it has four shades but a
few of them are matte these are all
shimmery so it's kind of a fun I don't
know lighter look that you could go with
but I really like those and I'll usually
go back and you know use that middle one
is like a highlight shade or something
so works really well another shadow that
I've been liking a lot the past few days
and if you've checked out my blog I
incorporated this shadow into a look to
really give a warm coppery look to the
crease and outer V and it's Milani
single in flare and your look at this
now thinking it's orange but I mean it
it's really just a nice and shimmery
warm shade you use it with kind of a
light touch and its really I mean you
have to look at my picture or two that I
posted on there but I mean this is just
a pretty warm kind of rusty copper shade
it's supposedly according to my Mac
dupes forum that's on my blog people are
saying this is like a dupe of matt
copper ring so if you are looking for
something like that this runs you know
around three or four bucks so I think
you would like that and a good shade to
have in your collection that might not
typically come with a lot of different
like sets so just wanted to tell you
about that also if you're wondering
about this what I have on my lips now I
will tell you it is my lip liner my
Rimmel exaggerated lip liner in East End
snob I might mention this in a haul
video recently um it's just a nice light
pink lip liner
swatch it for you here it's just a
medium to light pink and I just what I
just did with this just because I really
wanted you to be able to see what the
color was I did it to line my lips and
then I filled in with it and if you know
what East End snob is in terms of their
lip gloss that's not really pinky that's
a really light nude but I went over the
top of this with another one of my
recommendations and it's the co bigelow
sentiment mentha lip shine and I saw all
that glitters talking about this and I
thought that sounds like something I'd
really like I love kind of sweet sort of
candy ish cents on stuff and so this
maintains that minty tingle but a sort
of sweet cinnamon scent and I really
like that so I put that over the top
just to give this a little shine I kind
of like that look so anyway guys thanks
for tuning it for this video I hope this
gives you a few ideas next time you're
out in the store if you're looking for a
good product to buy whether it's an
eyeshadow a shimmer or bronzer
highlighter whatever this is and just
stud it's just a few things to have on
your list so thank you guys so much for
tuning in and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
