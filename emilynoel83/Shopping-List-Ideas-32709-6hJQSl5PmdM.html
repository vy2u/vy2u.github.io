list ideas video here for you I have one
two three four five six seven items that
I want to share with you just some items
i've been using recently some of them
may be new some of them may be something
i've had for a long time and sort of
rediscovered so um just want to share
those with you today the first one I'm
going to talk about is my L'Oreal hip
mascara now I had I've had this and I
ran out and it had been a while since I
actually went back and repurchased and I
did and I was like you doofus why didn't
you go ahead and repurchase this sooner
because this is such a great mascara I
love it it gives you like a I mean as
close to a false lash effect as I have
achieved with mascara um it stays on
fine for me I don't I think I may have
heard some people say that it was hard
to get off or messy to get off I'm not
sure which but I mean as far as I'm
concerned any time I'm taking dark
makeup off of my eyes it may turn out to
be a little bit messy but you know once
you wash it off its off so anyway I just
really like this mascara and it's
available again with the L'Oreal hip
makeup and I just am nuts about it so
that's that one another thing is my
maybelline mineral power concealer I've
mentioned this before i know it is my
color as sand medium 0 dash 1 and the
reason why i wanted to mention this is
because i've had um i have three
breakouts on that cheek and they're
they're like I swear to you but I feel
like this did an a fantastic job of
concealing it for me this week when I've
been on the news I haven't been able to
detect this like I can see it a little
bit in my mirror here my camera's a
little bit more forgiving but I wasn't
able to see it on the newscast either
and so I was like woohoo you know this
really did a good job in it also i think
it's it's enriched with minerals you
know and i think that it might make it a
little more gentle so even though you
are concealing something that is a
pimple you know you aren't really adding
to the problem you know what I mean
aren't you this is this is
gentle I feel like so this is what i use
you know if i have redness or if i have
any sort of blemishes and I've just been
thrilled with the fact that is covered
those up and so I would recommend this
if anybody is looking for an inexpensive
concealer for redness and blemishes and
next a product that's grown on me a
little bit over time it's from be
luscious and it's the shadow magnet in
light and what this is I think I've
compared its texture kind of feeling
like butter but stickier what I the way
I do the way i would put this on so i
just kind of Pat my finger get a little
bit code on my finger and then Pat it on
my eye and I tell you this stuff sticks
to your shadow um works great in a
tutorial I did using my Coastal Scents
pallets and it's just it's just really
good you just have to make sure you
don't use too much but it's obviously if
you can get away with not using a lot of
a product and it's effective for you
that's a great thing because you're
saving money there so anyway that is the
shadow magnet from be luscious and i've
been using light and at first I thought
maybe that's too light but then I was
like no that's really actually pretty
great for a primer so would really
encourage you guys if you're looking for
something good like that that's kind of
like a cream shadow yet a base at the
same time this is this is some pretty
good stuff another thing that I wanted
to show you guys is um this little set
it's a five color palette from LA colors
this set is called tease and if you look
at these colors they are super vivid
okay i touch my finger to one and you're
gonna see here as I show them to you
like look at the colors they're on my
fingers it's really bright these are
like metallic did oh yeah it is a
metallic eyeshadow palette and you can
get this on cherry culture and you can
also some people find this at their
local drugstore or beauty supply store
sometimes I believe but they have a
great scene they remind me in terms of
that nice pigmentation
of like honestly like a color from from
the Coastal Scents palette only a little
like this so if you didn't want to get a
whole palette her you didn't feel like
you could afford that whole palette at
the moment but you want some really
pigmented and fun shadows this is a
really fun kit so I mean can you imagine
like I'm looking at this and I'm kind of
thinking prom you know think of all the
prom dresses that would kind of look
good with some colors like that for a
really colorful look so look for a look
from me coming up on this in the near
future but I just think this is really
fun like I said I mean very good quality
very great pigmentation as you can see
so that's from LA colors they'll wipe my
fingers I here now well that's good it
doesn't come off real quick alright next
product is another kind of colorful I
product it's the soft coal I pencil from
Rimmel and lovable lilac what a pretty
shade I'll do it see if I can do a
little swatch for you here have that
maybe you'll show up it's kind of a um
it's got it's like a pearly / light
purple with a little bit of a periwinkle
so it's like a cross between a nice
light blue with the with a touch of
lavender and I really like this I like
it for a lower liner I did a look not
too long ago and I went actually kind of
smoky up here and did a line of this on
the bottom lash line and set it with a
purpley like a medium purple shadow and
really really like that look so this is
again inexpensive drugstore product from
Rimmel so if you're in the drugstore
looking for something to switch up your
eye look definitely check out the soft
coal I pencil lovable lilac now I've got
to tell you about a brush that has kind
of turned turned my world around here
it's from Sonia Kashuk and this is
available at Target and this is her
medium eyeshadow brush I think this ran
I think it was right at five dollars or
less right at five dollars or less than
five Helders i'm not sure what
but as you can see it's a it's like a
it's a flat brush and if you've watched
any of my recent tutorials you probably
noticed i have been using it and what
I'll do with it is use it to kind of
pack a particular shade right into
directly right into my crease and kind
of press it in there and you can kind of
form your outer V with this and it's
good if you're not really comfortable
with um let me find an example like say
a crease brush like this you know if
you're not quite comfortable with that
technique of using crease brushes or
whatever if you have trouble this might
give you a little more control even if
you want to like you can like basically
Pat the shape directly on and then go
get you know you're a fluffy crease
brush and use that to blend out the
edges so I have enjoyed this so much I'm
kind of like kicking myself for not
having already got a brush like this in
my collection but lots of people love
this brand for for inexpensive but high
quality makeup brushes so that's from
Sonia Kashuk from target and the last
thing I wanted to mention is an everyday
minerals product it is um everyday
minerals blush in Game Show I think this
is yeah this is one of their matte
blushes and it's so pretty it's kind of
like I don't know if you can see what
the color is actually looking like but
it's kind of got some just like deep
reddish pinky tones its unique and I
really like blushes that you know aren't
the typical blush shade maybe you see
every day I'm going to put a little bit
of this on so you can see what it looks
like oh so warm so warm and just such a
pretty pretty shade that wakes up your
cheeks I love the everyday minerals
blushes and I love their pigmentation
and this one I like Sunday brunch and I
like this one to this one maybe doesn't
have quite the peachy or maybe orangish
sort of undertones that Sunday brunch
has this is game show and it
gotta think of like deep pinky mob with
a just sort of a reddish feel to it that
really gives you that natural flush to
your cheek so anyway guys I hope you
like this little compilation of shopping
list ideas sort of a current favorites
kind of like stuff i'm using a lot right
now or I really have kind of
rediscovered in my makeup collection so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
