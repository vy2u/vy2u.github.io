ideas before I get to that I want to say
that I did my makeup myself today Tyler
had no hand in this it was so fun to do
that video and everybody was so super
nice with their comments like most
people were like and makeup doesn't look
so good but thumbs up to Tyler for
trying it so that was so fun to do but I
did wash it off afterwards because we
were going grocery shopping I'm like not
even for the grocery store not even
under sunglasses can I do this look so
anyways thank you so much for watching
that video if you haven't seen it you
should check it out Tyler actually did
my full face of makeup and it was really
funny starting off with my favorites i'm
going to have everything in this video
from nail polish to a fragrance
eyeshadow some face stuff and some
moisturizers stop on my nail polish i
love this shade that i have on right now
and it is a gorgeous light blue it's
like a sky blue color and it's like the
blue of you know Tiffany's that kind of
thing and it's hard candy just nails
nail color in sky and it does come with
that cute little heart ring on there but
it's a blue and it has kind of like when
it picks up the light it has like a
little iridescent quality to it in the
bottle not so much on my nails it's just
kind of like a creamy blue shade but I
really really like that and I'm just
loving these like I call them easter egg
colors these light pastel shades because
I like that blue but I also love this
shape from se it's called nice is nice I
think it's one part of the new
collection just a gorgeous creamy lilac
shade and then this shade that I had on
in a video not too long ago um pink
chiffon from Revlon this has the 75
percent off sticker on it I got it from
CVS so I'm wondering if this is being
phased out or something but it's just
like the perfect pink you know it's it's
somewhere between you know that right
Barbie pink and a pastel pink like this
seems to be just perfect a body product
that I'm loving is from Bath and Body
Works and this is part of the new I
guess kind of summary springtime line
that they came out within its fiji
passion
fruit so it's in this fun green color
and it is the fragrance mist and it just
smells so good I mean it's just really
tropical I think maybe we're all just
kind of looking to get out of the winter
doldrums and we're looking for something
to kind of perk our senses up and this
is definitely one of those smells that
just get you in that mode I also have
several different like wall flowers
throughout my house and I have now
completely morphed from those winter
sins which I love to some of these fun
tropical since so it smells really good
in here for a face product that I like
it's from elf and it's the cream blush I
think I mentioned this in my hull and
now yes it is made it onto shopping list
ideas my shade is called seductress so
you can see the gigantic packaging so it
is a bit messy it doesn't have any real
sparkle to it and it looks like okay
well that's a cream product but it
actually it kind of reminds me of say
one of the maybelline dream mousse
blushes only a little more firm and
texture so if you can picture that you
know one of those blushes and being a
little more firm I've got it on today
you know it's just a great great color
for perking up the face this is not
going to be one of those blushes where
you can hardly see it when you put it on
you will want to have a very light hand
with this but I really like the little
bit of glow that it gives off and I just
I think I'm going to have this for a
long time because a little bit goes a
long way another really awesome face
product that has kind of become like a
rediscovered um product for me it was
something I had for a while in another
form in it like a mini and I really
liked it and then I got it as part of a
kit recently the Laura Geller baked
vanilla nudes kit came with a full-sized
balance and brighten and so what this is
it's it's not a mineral foundation but
it is a baked powder foundation and you
can see all these different shades kind
of swirled in here my shade is called
regular and what's really nice about
this they always say that you know this
product starts its life as a cream
they bake it and it becomes his powder
and i love the coverage this gives and I
you know I'm always testing a lot of
different foundations and tinted
moisturizers and stuff like that and
sometimes i'm testing them on like a day
that i'm on air you know for for for the
newscast and if i feel like i've put one
of those foundations on and it's given
me very minimal coverage this is kind of
like my foundation corrector i will go
over this with a kabuki brush you know
put it all over my face it just has this
great evening out quality and the yellow
undertones are really good for the face
so that's good for you know kind of
brightening evening and you know kind of
counteracting any redness stuff like
that so where other things fall short I
can always put this on top or I can wear
this alone and get actually really good
coverage with it so I am loving the
Laura Geller balance and brighten I
would really recommend it shave shade
wives they have introduced a porcelain
shade so if you're really really like
you do have an option there now and then
there are like maybe a total of four or
five shades another part of that vanilla
newts kit has been getting a lot of use
in my makeup bag and it's the baked
marble I shadow I rims so this can be
like an eyeshadow and or a liner and the
shades were vanilla toffee and black
cherry I know I showed this in my haul
video but these are just gorgeous and I
do use these um I generally use them
like I shadows so I'll use this lighter
shade all over my lid and then this
shade in the crease or as a liner
they're really really pretty I think
they're very multi-dimensional very nice
and shimmery um you know you can you can
use them in a lot of different
capacities and that you can wear them
very subtle or you can wear them as
you're totally dramatic smokey shade
with that one there this made it into my
emily awards and i have just been really
getting into this product especially
this past month and it's from lorac and
i have a mini here and this is this
product is called perfectly lit it's
like a highlight powder and the shade is
called spotlight this is a high
light powder and to look at it it
doesn't really seem like anything that
overboard it just kind of looks like
actually almost a regular face powder as
I hold it right there and it has the
most subtle pretty highlight what's so
great about this is that it's subtle
shimmer and it seems to give you a
totally like evened out kind of soft
focus look and I know a lot of products
claim that but this is actually I mean
probably one of my favorite highlights
I've ever used it's so good it's so good
at not going overboard on the shimmer
and actually doing something for your
skin in terms of making it look more
flawless so I love this to lip glosses
to talk about both are from NYX both are
mega shine lip glosses which you know I
love the one I have on right now is
called beige I know it doesn't look
beige it's like a typical standard
creamy pink but this is what it looks
like so it's called beige whatever and
to swatch it for you there you can see
just kind of a creamy like soft rose no
shimmer to it it's just a great standard
pink for anyone to have and then the
other one that I like is called Cosmo
and so here's a look at that it's got a
lot of nice shimmer it's kind of like
hard to describe it's sort of neutrally
it has hints of copper in this shade um
not overboard though it comes off really
being just kind of like a nice neutral
with that great amount of shimmer like
when you put this on your lips they pop
for eyes I have been reaching a lot for
my elf 32 palette I think the reason why
I've been using this a little bit more
than the 100 is that this can fit right
in my makeup bag that I take to work so
when I touch up I've got it all with me
this is the original one that I think is
being sold on the website now and was
the first one that they kind of came out
with and I've just used it in so many
ways I've used the colorful shades the
neutrals the smokies you name it I've
had a lot of fun with this palette and
not all the shades are equally good in
that palace so you kinda have to get it
to realize that there is some hit and
miss
but for the most part really great and I
do just want to note that this is very
new to me this other one so I don't want
to really call it my favorite yet but I
will be trying this one as well this
came out in target and this one is more
neutral you can see it's got mostly
neutral shades and then that bottom row
with sort of some cool purples and blues
but it's got some interesting different
shimmery shades and I think it's going
to be fun so I'm going to be trying that
one as well but I just find these very
nice to have that much selection and
it's that portable you can it'll fit you
know in most medium-sized makeup bags
finally want to wrap this up with a
moisturizer and a tinted moisturizer
that I'm loving so much right now aveeno
positively radiant tinted moisturizer
I've done a full review on this this has
SPF 30 this gives your skin that
beautiful luminous glow but not too much
if you have real oily skin I don't know
about this for you but it really does
give my skin kind of a real real perk up
when I put it on and um it has just a
little bit of coverage to it as well so
I noticed the skin evening you know you
put this on with some balance and
brighten I'm thinking that's going to be
a weekend routine for me for you know
weeks months to come probably however on
days that I don't want to use this so
this is more like you know I'm probably
not gonna wear this on air for news when
I want more maximum coverage on those
days i will use just the regular
positively radiant moisturizer still
love the ultra calming but this is
really nice too because it has some
extra what do they call it natural light
diffusers to naturally help even out
skins texture and appearance so this
gives you that little hint of glow I
think with this moisturizer and so I
mean it take your pick you know if you
want the tinted go with this if you want
you know not tinted but still something
that's going to sort of perk up your
skin SPF 15 so you're getting your SPF
in each one but there's just different
reasons why i will use
one or the other so anyway hope you like
the shopping list ideas video tell me
what your favorite things this month are
I would be happy to hear them and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
