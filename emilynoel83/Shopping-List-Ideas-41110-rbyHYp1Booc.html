for the shopping list ideas video sorry
i haven't had a video up in a few days
here i have been a little under the
weather lately but my voice is
recovering a little bit and i definitely
have some products that i really want to
talk to you about in this video and
mainly makeup products here current
favorite type items I kind of call it my
shopping list ideas video because maybe
the next time you're in the store these
are some things you might consider
picking up or just looking into a little
more closely but i do have a skincare
item at the end of this as well but yeah
let's go ahead and get started the first
thing i want to mention is this quad
from covergirl and this is part of their
um what are they called I brightening
shadow palettes and they have these four
blue green hazel and brown eyes and so
this is the kit for it's called majestic
hazel so this is for hazel eyes I have
brown eyes so that kind of goes to show
that you can really have any color eyes
and pull off one of these pallets but I
really like the colors in this one
especially I like this kind of deep
taupe shade and the dark brown those
work really nice together it's nice to
have this light color here as well and
then you've got an interesting light
green but as for that taupe shade I just
mentioned I mean these are are nicely
pigmented shadows and they blend very
easily and I'm really considering um due
to how many people have asked for a
shadow tutorials for different eye
colors I'm considering doing that might
possibly with these different palettes
so if you're interested in seeing
something like that let me know but this
one for Hazel's I especially like and I
going to be trying out the other colors
for different eye colors as well and see
how they work so yeah definitely
considering doing a tutorial for the
different eye colors so you can kind of
get an idea of what maybe works best to
bring out your own eyes next product is
a face item that I've been using a lot
lately for under-eye concealer sometimes
I'll use this product with my Bobby
Brown corrector and sometimes I'll just
use this
own and really lately this has been
enough it seems like coverage wise and
it's the dream mousse concealer I
believe I've mentioned this before in a
review video but this shade is cream my
color is light for dash five so it's
called cream and then it's light 425 you
can kind of coordinate in with them you
can coordinate that with like your
foundation I think in terms of that
number system but top just twists off
there and you've got kind of a glass
container here and then it's a very
somewhat light consistency mousse and
the difference between this concealer
and the foundation I know a lot of
people have tried the foundation you
might be wondering well how is the
concealer different I feel like it's a
little more richly pigmented and perhaps
a little less light and whipped it still
has that whipped mousse feeling but it's
just it seems to have just a little
better coverage and I feel like this
works really great around my eye area
gives good coverage and also I a very
matte coverage nothing ends up looking
do we or shiny there and so that can be
nice as we head into you know spring and
summer the warmer months you know really
want to attract attention to those areas
that are a little bit discolored around
your eyes and I know what my last
shopping list ideas video was kind of
spring fever edition but I feel like all
of these items i'm talking about today
are definitely appropriate for spring as
well including this blush which i have
on today it's from hard candy and it's
called living doll and it is a definite
pink blush here and it looks a little
shimmery and this is the blush crush
baked blush so as you can see it's kind
of domed there that's the quality a lot
of those baked items have and if you
look closely at it it's kind of swirled
with a little bit of gold and it is
slightly shimmery it will give you kind
of a glow on your cheeks but I don't
think it's overly um glowy I wouldn't
probably layer this on with a lot of
other do we you know glittery makeup but
you can see that swatch there on my
finger you know that's that's obviously
a very intense at me rubbing my finger
there but just a light application with
a with a brush is going to give you a
really
ready pink glow to your cheeks and you
might not consider picking up a brush
that a blush that looks this bright but
I think it is very complementary to
probably a variety of skin tones even if
you have lighter skin I think this might
look good and like i said if you've put
on kind of a you know your Scout your
skin kind of flawless looking with your
foundation and maybe a matte powder but
then you throw on something like this
and you give a little more life back to
your to your skin so that's from hard
candy the shade is living doll and
that's what the packaging looks like
they're it's got that pretty kind of
swirl design around and I really like
their packaging the next item if you
follow my blog closely you know this was
featured there it's the color stay a
brow enhancer from Revlon and this is a
to a double-ended product and basically
one end is called your tinted wax and my
shade in this in case you're wondering
is black and brown on this end and taupe
on the illuminator side but basically
what you have here is something that is
you know about the width of a typical
pencil maybe a little bit wider and you
know this will draw on over your brows
and in sort of a something that is maybe
just has a little more whack see or feel
than a typical liner and so I will use
that just a little bit you know to fill
on maybe a little bit on the inner part
of the brow and I do have a little
scarem like the outside of my brow I'll
fill it that in there as well but it's
very easy to get like you know natural
strokes with this and it does seem to
last all day so that is the tinted wax
side and then I was just kind of look
before i had this i was really just
using a random matt brown eyeshadow to
fill in and it was just kind of getting
to the point where i was i was just not
enjoying having to go through that
process and i think this is really
quicken and fun too and then this other
side is a more the equivalent of like a
jumbo pencil and the idea what that is
that you can just kind of draw a little
bit of that on just under say the arch
of your brow and then kind of blend that
out and you
adding a little added attention to your
nicely groomed brows so that is
definitely a brow tool I would recommend
for blondes out there I mean I'm sure
you can get a shade other than black and
brown which is mine but I think this
would work well for brunettes so maybe
look into that next time you're checking
out the Revlon section in terms of lips
I have two products on my lips both of
them are included in this video the
first is one of those moisture renew
lipsticks from Rimmel that I like so
much i think these work really well i've
used them a lot recently having a cold i
feel like my lips have gotten very
chapped and these really feel good going
on they do replenish the moisture quite
nicely in this shade is dreamy it's 140
and its really I feel like it's showing
up on camera just a little bit warmer a
little more rosy than it actually is in
reality I feel like this is just a light
kind of shimmery champagne with a hint
of pink thats watch shows it a little
more true to what it actually is right
there but it really picks up the light
nicely it does have you know a little
bit of shimmer to it it's not a straight
up you know cream a lipstick but it just
has a hint of shimmer and it's nothing
too chunky or glittery at you I know
some Rimmel lipsticks do actually
incorporate the decent amount of glitter
in them but this one is not over the top
and I think it's a really nice shade as
we head in this summer if you're trying
to lighten up your lips but not remove
all color from them and then over the
top of that another product i'm loving
from palladio i feel like every time I
kind of learn a little bit more about
this line I find something else that I
like and it's the plump and shine herbal
plumping lip gloss and the shade is
rustic that I have here and this reminds
me a little bit of that Jordana lip
gloss and lovely see it up close there
it's got sort of that you know kind of
Rosie coppery feel to it excuse me it
has a brush applicator and this is not a
lip plumper that's really going to sting
your
lips it really doesn't do that at all it
gives a nice finish and just the fact
that you know how it goes on it seems to
kind of fill the lines a little bit in
your lips and in that sense makes it
look more plump do a little swatch here
on my hands so you can see that you can
see compared to that lipstick i just
showed this has a little more pink to it
a little more almost Coralie tone as
well a little bit of shimmer but it
really feels nice on the lips and last
quite a long time so that's from
palladio it's the plump and shine herbal
plumping lip gloss and they have a lot
of other pretty colors in this too so if
this one's maybe not for you check out
the rest of the line and then another
lip gloss that I'm liking a lot right
now I also mentioned it on my blog I've
been blogging a little more lately since
it's been not always so easy to talk
with this cold but this is from Clinique
and it is the long last gloss wear SPF
15 and the shade is in fireberry and
this you're looking at let's say
compared to this one this one from
palladio is a little bit lighter does
incorporate a little more of a bronzy
coppery tone and this is kind of like a
berry gloss with a really pretty gold
undertone it's really unique when I saw
it there at the counter this is one of
the things i purchased to get a free
gift with purchase which again you can
visit my blog for more on that but as
ice watch this for you i love how it's
kind of a sheer berry but it has that
really pretty gold undertone perfect
kind of berry color i think to wear in
the summer time you know a great daytime
lip look and it really brightens up the
face this really does last a long time
for a lip gloss that was part of why i
wanted to get it and try it because I
kind of like to see if those supposedly
long wearing lip glosses really can last
a long time and this is one that really
does kind of reminds me a bit of the
revlon mineral lip glaze revlon
colorstay mineral lip glaze because
those lasted very a very long time as
well this is a little more expensive
however I do think it's a very unique
color I can't really quite do it justice
just holding it up here at
but it does have a really nice golden
subtle sparkle to it last thing I want
to talk about now is from be luscious
and it is a mask that I wore last week
and it really helped to perk me up and
perk my skin up as well and it is the
refining sea mud mask you see the color
it looks like here yeah it actually
shows up like a dark green on your face
I think I startled Tyler a little bit
when I came out with that hon because
it's just you know it's you've tried the
mint julep mask maybe from Queen Helen
what you can get at the drugstore and
that's kind of a light green well here
you really look like a swamp monster
with this on and it is for face and body
says a highly active formula rich and
purifying minerals from the sea and an
abundance of natural botanicals leaves a
tingling sensation that stimulates and
toads makes skin radiant and healthy
difference between biggest difference
between this and them in the mint julep
mask this has a much more intense tingle
I like the mint julep mask but this does
sort of a similar function except you
feel it a lot more on your face very
refreshing really I feel like cleans out
your pores makes you feel very refreshed
makes the skin very soft the kind of
skin where you really want someone to
come up and touch it and feel how smooth
it feels after you've rinsed it off so
thanks so much for tuning in for this
