ideas I'm some favorite products from
the past month in case you didn't hear
in my last video I've had pinkeye that's
why I'm wearing the glasses and check it
out it is improving so much the eye
drops that the doctor gave me to use I
mean they have just caused the shade of
my eye which was even more red than
really the on the first day it was much
more red than even the picture I showed
on my blog and every single day it has
just gotten better and better so that's
been kind of exciting to see you be like
oh it's getting back to normal now so it
really is looking a lot a lot more white
like this either products I've got to
quite a variety in terms of not just
make up in this one I've got a lot of
other things and the first thing I want
to mention because I've been traveling a
lot in the past month is a great travel
must have and i just realized i've got
like one of these in the purse i take
with me to work I've got one that kind
of stays in my suitcase at one more
floating around just in the house and it
is the Tresemme extra firm control tray
to hairspray it's the number four level
it's extra hold and this is my favorite
hairspray and I've got a couple big old
cans of it too but this little one is
friendly for air travel and just a
really nice size also for your bag and
it's nice that this is available i find
this at walmart target wherever you know
the small travel sized items are sold
and it's just a little aerosol hairspray
but this is my absolute favorite kind
and it has been for a while so it's
great to just have a little one floating
around wherever you need another hair
product that i've been using a lot is
from organics and they make a lot of
great kind of natural sulfate free hair
products shampoos and conditioners and
also some styling products and this is
the nourishing coconut milk
anti-breakage sarah serum and if you
have tried the shampoo and conditioner
in the coconut version it smells amazing
this smells just like that so it is
super yummy to put on your hair I
actually put
it looks just like a gel basically but
it's a little bit thinner than that so
it's a nice serum you can put it on your
hair after you get out of the shower so
i'll get out of the shower comb through
my hair kind of towel dry it a little
bit put some of this on and sort of comb
it through the bottom half of my hair I
feel like it's kept it really healthy
here I put that on I'll put my hair up
in my Turbie twist and I always feel
like when I put in some kind of leave in
product that helps lock it in for a
little while and i just have been really
impressed with the hell from the
strength of my hair i have fine hair but
this has just been so nice and shiny and
healthy product that's come in very
handy for travel is from dollar general
i love what i find a dollar general
favorite is the extra thick felt nail
polish remover pads let me tell you if
you're traveling somewhere you do not
want to have a bottle of nail polish
remover on you because you know that
that gets open you're just in a world of
hurt there in terms of getting on your
other products these are so great
because they are little pets like this
you can just throw in you know a couple
into your travel bag and what i like
about it is one of these is so saturated
with the nail polish remover it can go
over all your toes all your fingers just
one and you'll still feel like there's a
lot of juice in there but just very nice
to have if you're planning to switch up
your nail polish while you're traveling
there's six that come in one of these
boxes I believe this costs about a doll
along with that a definite favorite nail
polish of the month I don't know if I've
mentioned this before in a favorites
video or not but this has been on my
toes for I believe an entire month now I
mean I've changed it out and I've
freshened it up but I just kept coming
back to this pretty orange color called
club havana it's the mega last from
wet'n'wild and I just feel like it's
perfect for the season I love the way it
looks particularly on my toes although I
do have it on my nails right now too
what I like about it is it is a great
orange color that's not like bright
highlighter orange or you know super
super like you know you look at you're
like wow that's bright it's like a nice
soft creamy orange color a little bit
Coralie you know I just think it's very
pretty there's no sparkle in this
I like the way it goes on also the brush
with these mega last polishes don't know
if I've shown this before or not but
it's nice and wide it reminds me exactly
like the Sally Hansen complete salon
manicure it gets over a lot of surface
area in one swipe so love the color just
love the way it goes on you could get by
with one coat I like to do two coats
just because I like a nice thick layer
on there but um it had it on my toes all
the time and I just any time I catch a
glimpse of it I'm like I love that coast
favorite is not going to come as
anything new to you if you've been
keeping up with my videos I reviewed the
the balm nude tude palette which is just
probably my favorite version of one of
these nude naked eye palettes that's
come out I'm thrilled with the the
configuration of colors that have been
put in here a nice mix of matte and
shimmer a nice mix of light medium and
dark the colors are just phenomenal if
you want to learn more about this
definitely check out the review /
tutorial that I did might give you some
ideas on how to wear it but it's just
very user friendly I mean you can just
glance at it and see you know
immediately what combos you might use
but it's the the pigmentation is great
they're super soft super blendable
anyone I've really talked to about this
on Twitter or Facebook you know has also
been very impressed with this one has a
nice big mirror as well that you can use
so yeah it's from the bomb it's
available at the balm cosmetics calm so
definitely worth checking out at the
same time if I'm in a real hurry I feel
like I've been gravitating toward one
particular I shadow trio from wet and
wild and it's called silent treatment
I've talked about this before this has
been in the emily awards I've talked
about it a lot but I just love this trio
it comes in handy so much I've got one
standard way that I pretty much use it
because it is like I said kind of a
quick go to I'll use this pretty taupe
shade all over the lid use this kind of
on the outer part of the lid into the
crease and this peachy shade is great
for the brow bone just that easy very
quick blending is effortless it does not
take much product
you will have if you get a wet and wild
trio palette whatever you're going to
have it for a long time because it takes
so little product so i really really
love that one kind of a rediscovered
favorite in my collection in terms of my
mac lipsticks i really like the mac
lipsticks by the way i feel like and i
do have a dupes video on them if you're
wanting some low-cost alternatives but i
like the scent of them i like the way
they go on they're just very creamy feel
good on the lips and one that I've come
back to a lot this month has been cream
cup which is a cream sheen yes and
that's my favorite formula of the MAC
lipsticks just nice and creamy and it is
a little less pink than max angel which
I know is a very popular shade so this
kind of walks the line a little bit more
between a light pink and a nude almost
so nice color for this time of year it's
a nice base to if you're just wanting to
you know maybe put on a nice light pink
gloss or turn it a little more toward
the nude side with a golden e colored
gloss you can do that it's just a very
nice lipstick and I hadn't used it a
little bit for a while and then I kind
of came back to at this moment be
expecting a updated skin care video from
me very soon which will include the
clarisonic but one of the products that
it's been just a standout just stud
product this past month for me is from
this new skincare brand that I'm sure a
lot of us are seeing in drugstores
lately I believe it's from the UK so UK
viewers this is probably nothing new to
you but it's brand called simple and
this is it says sensitive skin experts
vital vitamin day cream SPF 15 I love
this as a moisturizer this this has just
been great for me to be using in the
mornings when i get up i feel like it
hydrates the skin wonderfully but it
doesn't go overboard i don't feel like
it impacts staying power of my
foundations and things like that you get
a big tub or one like me who has kind of
combination skin and you find it hard to
find an oyster Iser that can cater to
those spots that get a little dry this
is this is really good so yeah I have
combo skin
and that is not too much even for my
t-zone to handle wrapping this up with
an awesome awesome sent that I've found
it's from body ecology I think I got
this from either target or walmart and
the the scent is cloud nine I just got a
little spray of it this is the perfect
blend of I feel like fresh air clean
scent with a little bit of floral you'll
put it on you'll just think spring as
soon as you spray it it's just very nice
and clean not not an offensive overly
bold strong scent but it's just nice to
spritz on you know maybe after you get
out of the shower something like that
that's when I use this a lot so
wonderful scent to look out for they
have this in lotions as well that wraps
up my shopping list ideas for this month
again why is it shopping list ideas
their products that i love but also
things that i would totally recommend to
you as well i think they are great
products products that have been coming
back to time after time here lately and
I've also found that just makeup wise
over the past month I've been coming
back to a lot of just standard favorite
items a lot of items you heard me talk
about the emily awards back in january
you know those remain great products
that i love so thanks so much for
watching guys have a great day see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
