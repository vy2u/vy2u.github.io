list ideas this month and these products
are kind of like current favorite things
that I've been using a lot lately and
it's not just make up but I have a nail
product and a few body products in this
video so I'm going to start out with
those and the first one is a scent that
i'm really loving right now it's new at
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and it's called
country chic and I just have the body
spray because I have a lot of lotion to
use right now well I have a lot of body
sprays to use right now too but it
smells so good it's kind of like it's
sort of hard to put your finger on
exactly what you're smelling because
it's like a hint of floral scent but
it's not overly flowery it's maybe got a
little bit of I don't know if I'm
smelling just a slight hint of vanilla
or something just a little bit slightly
spicy in there as well but it's not
heavy it's just really I just love the
scent a lotion that I'm enjoying very
much and I started off with the mini
size of this and I had it in my purse
and I loved it so much I had to seek out
the large size and that's what i
recently picked up and it's johnson's
body care and it's the melt away stress
lotion lavender and chamomile and this
has such a soothing relaxing sent i mean
i never thought i was really a huge huge
fan of the scent of lavender i don't
know i mean it's not a bad sent by any
means but i just i don't think i ever
you know told myself oh man you I just
love lavender but this smells so most
the time i do just put this on my hands
it's very softening and you'll finally
just kind of catch a whiff of it
throughout the day and it just smells so
good I don't know how much it actually
really is stress we've gotten into this
before with the Physicians Formula happy
booster products do they make you happy
does this relieve stress if you're
really stressed out you're probably
going to be stressed out but this just
smells really good in my opinion so
that's from Johnsons kind of on the
topic of stress and maybe you enjoy a
good bath to relieve stress I found this
at target this big ol thing it's a
village naturals bath shop ultra
softening body soap and it's the white
tea
and jasmine I don't know if you ever
bring your significant other in the bath
aisle with you and have them help you
smell things and like oh does this smell
good does that smell good and Tyler pick
this up he's like this smells good and
it really does oh my gosh so fresh so oh
it's just it's clean and fresh that's
almost all i can think to describe this
and what it is is it's a bunch of like
it's like a bath salt type thing so as
your bath water is running you put you
know a small little I don't know palm
full of this in your bathtub and
supposed to soften up the water what I
do is I put this in and then I put
something else that's going to suds up
the water as well like four bubbles and
what have a actual bubble bath in this
scent that I'm going to pick up next but
this is really great you get a lot of
product in here I think that was around
maybe four dollars so it's pretty good
deal this is called Milani one coat
glitter and the shade is gold glitz they
have other glitter on glitter colors
like blue and purple and red and stuff
but this impressed me so much because it
said one coat glitter and I'm thinking
oh yeah right this is going to kiss
glitter you know to get a really
glittery nail it takes me like at least
say three coats to build up to you know
what you see in the in the packaging
this literally took one coat just one
and I was in shock I like immediately
went to the beauty broadcast facebook
page i posted a picture by nails I was
like this only took one goes so you will
love this if you pick this up if you
just want some fun gold nails you know
it's really honest guy took it off after
probably 6 days maybe but you can see
it's a really pretty glitter in there
and I just love that another Milani
product that I like are they're baked
blushes i also like they're baked eye
shadows which i'll be doing more on in a
future video but this baked blush i know
i've shown you rose deorro and that's a
little less bright than this one which
is called coralina and this is gorgeous
this is what I have on my cheeks today I
love it first off to see that blush
swear
world in that in that packaging I mean
it's just gorgeous to look at but to put
it on your skin I mean it gives you a
pretty glow it's not overly shimmery but
keep in mind this is not mad either so
this will give you a little bit of some
shimmer going on on your cheeks but I
love it so much and this baked stuff
coming out now from Milani it reminds me
a lot of some of the things I like from
laura geller who does a lot of baked
products as well so keep in mind this is
a great great blush real quick shout out
to the gloss I'm wearing now which is a
great gloss alone which this is all I
have on or it's nice layered on top of
any pink lipstick you have and it's from
NYX it's the mega shine lip glosses
chandelier do I always have a mega shine
lip gloss and my shopping list of it is
i love these glosses i think i may have
talked about this one at some point
before but it's a shimmery pink this is
what it looks like just alone and now my
lips aren't super pigmented and like
pink or red looking lips on their own so
if you have naturally pinky reddish
looking lips this will look a little
different on you but because it is kind
of sheer but this is how it looks on my
lips and I really like it another couple
lip products have been reaching for a
lot are my l'oreal colour riche lipstick
in Ferris nude if you watched my video
on Mac dupes this was the dupe for mac
viva glam too and I've just been coming
back to this more and more because I'm
like I won't use my mac one up as fast
if I keep using this and I really like
this this may be just a little bit
smoother and give you a little more
shine on your lips then the Mac one does
but it's a great great nude with just
the slide a slightest hint of pink it's
creamy it's nice and I love using with
that just to deepen it up a hair my NYX
lip liner in mahogany which is like a
deep neutral so they work great together
I've always loved this lip liner just
blogged about these recently so check my
blog for squatches in a more detailed
review but it's the Rimmel glam eyes
mono I shadows so I was never a big fan
of Rimmel eyeshadows I never thought
they gave off much color
but these this is a new formulation the
glam eyes are really really nice like I
said see my blog for swatches but this
one's called backstage I love that I
also especially love this one in dusk
which as you can see it looks like a
dark brown it comes off as a very dark
brown it's lovely and then the other one
i have is jet black i would actually
call this more of a let's see a deep
charcoal shade it's not totally black
but these are great very blendable just
a total reformulations for the old
Rimmel I shadow so if you were like me
and you kind of swore off of the old
Rimmel shadows these are great that's
backstage right there so really
impressed with those and wanted to give
them a shout out in this video as well a
favorite item that is from laura geller
and this is the baked body frosting in
Tahitian glow this is an all-over face
and body glow this is an interesting I
guess you would call it a delivery
aspect with this because you're using
this pad if this gorgeous once again
baked Laura Geller stuff and if you are
looking for something to give you that
glow along your decollete area your neck
your shoulders anywhere I had a big
event last night where you know I use my
sunless tanner but then I used this to
get a really nice glow all over you can
use this with a brush on your face you
can use the pad on your face whatever
you want to do but it's a really nice
tan glow you use this wet and you will
get even more of a shimmery Dewey effect
with this but I just love it because
sometimes I will a lot of times actually
i'll take a bronzer that i'm using on my
face and I'll grab I have another big
kabuki brush that I use and I'll bronze
up this area as well but this is nice to
have a big this is a big size product
like lemon this is a standard size
powder this is the Laura Geller so
you're getting a lot of stuff here so
basically what that means is I feel like
I can use it over larger portions of my
body and not feel like I'm using up all
of the bronzer I use on my face and
stuff like that that's what caused me to
run out of like my too faced chocolate
soleil bronzer so quickly was because i
was using it everywhere here you can
reserve this for other parts of your
body get that deeper
below that you want and like I said you
can use it with the puff you can use it
with a brush whatever you love ailable
on qvc.com and i think they also have
another version that is split one side
is like this bronzer and the other side
is like a really light highlight shade
alright guys that wraps up this month
shopping list ideas hope I gave you some
good ideas I think a lot of this stuff
is great for summer if you're looking
for the bronze glow and things like that
these products will help you and also
some good products for the relaxation
and the stress relief so thanks for
watching have a great day and I'll see
you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
