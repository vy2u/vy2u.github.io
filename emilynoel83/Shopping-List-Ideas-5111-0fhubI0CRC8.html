list ideas this month and these products
are kind of like current favorite things
that I've been using a lot lately and
it's not just makeup but I have a nail
product and a few body products in this
video so I'm going to start out with
those and the first one is a scent that
I'm really loving right now it's new at
Bath and Body Works and it's called
country chic and I just have the body
spray because I have a lot of lotion to
use right now well I have a lot of
bodies for you guys right now too but it
smells so good it's kind of like it's
sort of hard to put your finger on
exactly what you're smelling because
it's like a hint of floral scent but
it's not overly flowery it's maybe got a
little bit of I don't know if I'm
smelling just a slight hint of vanilla
or something just a little bit slightly
spicy in there as well but it's not
heavy it's just really I just love the
scent a lotion that I'm enjoying very
much and I started off with the mini
size of this and I had it in my purse
and I loved it so much I had to seek out
the large size and that's what I
recently picked up and it's Johnson's
body care and it's the melt away stress
lotion lavender and chamomile and this
has such a soothing relaxing scent I
mean I never thought I was really a huge
huge fan of the scent of lavender I
don't know I mean it's not a bad set by
any means but I just I don't think I
ever you know told myself oh man I just
love lavender but this smells so most of
the time I do just put this on my hands
it's very softening and you'll finally
just kind of catch a whiff of it
throughout the day and it just smells so
good I don't know how much it actually
really is stress
we've gotten into this before with the
Physicians Formula happy booster
products do they make you happy does
this relieve stress if you're really
stressed out you're probably going to be
stressed out but this just smells really
good in my opinion so that's from
Johnston's kind of on the topic of
stress and maybe you enjoy a good bath
to relieve stress I found this at Target
this big old thing it's a village
Naturals bath shop ultra softening body
soap and it's the white tea
and jasmine I don't know if you ever
bring your significant other in the back
aisle with you and have them help you
smell things like Oh does this smell
good does that smell good and Tyler pick
this up it's like this smells good and
it really does oh my gosh so fresh so oh
it's just it's clean and fresh that's
almost all I can think to describe this
and what it is is it's a bunch of like
it's like a bath salt type thing so as
your bath waters running you put you
know a small little I don't know palm
full of this in your bathtub and
supposed to soften up the water what I
do is I put this in and then I put
something else that's going to suds up
the water as well like for bubbles and
what have a actual bubble bath in this
scent that I'm going to pick up next but
this is really great you get a lot of
product in here I think that was around
maybe four dollars so it's a pretty good
deal this is called Milani one coat
glitter and the shade is gold glitz they
have other glitter glitter colors like
blue and purple and red and stuff but
this impressed me so much because it
said one coat glitter and I'm thinking
oh yeah right this is gonna cause
glitter you know to get a really
glittery nail it takes me like at least
say three coats to build up to you know
what you see in the in the packaging
this literally took one coat just one
and I was in shock I like immediately
went to the beauty broadcast Facebook
page you're posted a picture by nails I
was like this only took one goes so you
will love this if you pick this up if
you just want some fun gold nails you
know it's really honest guy took it off
after probably six days maybe but you
can see it's a really pretty glitter in
there and I just love that another
Milani product that I like are their
baked blushes I also like their baked
eyeshadows which I'll be doing more on
in a future video but this baked blush I
know I've shown you Rose Dior oh and
that's a little less bright than this
one which is called coralina and this is
gorgeous this is what I have on my
cheeks today I love it first off to see
that blush
world in that in that packaging I mean
it's just gorgeous to look at but to put
it on your skin I mean it gives you a
pretty glow it's not overly shimmery but
keep in mind this is not matte either so
this will give you a little bit of some
shimmer going on on your cheeks but I
love it so much
and this baked stuff coming out now from
Milani it reminds me a lot of some of
the things I like from Laura Geller who
does a lot of baked products as well so
keep in mind this is a great great blush
real quick shout out to the gloss I'm
wearing now which is a great gloss alone
which this is all I have on or it's nice
layered on top of any pink lipstick you
have and it's from NYX it's the mega
shine lip gloss at chandelier do I
always have a mega shine lip gloss in my
shopping list that it is I love these
glosses I think I may have talked about
this one at some point before but it's a
shimmery pink this is what it looks like
just alone and now my lips aren't super
pigmented and like pink or red looking
lips on their own so if you have
naturally pinky reddish looking lips
this will look a little different on you
but because it is kind of sheer but this
is how it looks on my lips and I really
like it another couple lip products have
been reaching for a lot are my L'Oreal
color riche lipstick and fairest nude if
you watched my video on Mac dupes this
was the dupe for Mac Viva Glam 2 and
I've just been coming back to this more
and more because I'm like I won't use my
Mac one up as fast if I keep using this
and I really like this this may be just
a little bit smoother and it give you a
little more shine on your lips than the
Mac one does but it's a great great nude
with just the slightest slightest hint
of pink it's creamy it's nice and I love
using with that just to deepen it up a
hair my NYX lip liner in mahogany which
is like a deep neutral so they work
great together I've always loved this
lip liner just blogged about these
recently so check my blog for swatches
and a more detailed review but it's the
Rimmel glam eyes mono eyeshadows so I
was never a big fan of Rimmel eyeshadows
I never thought they gave off much color
but
these this is a new formulation the glam
eyes are really really nice like I said
see my blog for swatches but this one's
called backstage I love that I also
especially love this one in dusk which
as you can see it looks like a dark
brown it comes off as a very dark brown
it's lovely and then the other one I
have is jet black I would actually call
this more of a let's see a deep charcoal
shade it's not totally black but they
these are great very blendable just a
total reformulations for the old Rimmel
eyeshadows so if you were like me and
you kind of swore off of the old Rimmel
shadows these are great that's backstage
right there so really impressed with us
and wanted to give them a shout-out in
this video as well a favorite item that
is from laura geller and this is the
baked body frosting and Tahitian glow
this is an all-over face and body glow
this is an interesting I guess you would
call it a delivery aspect with this
because you're using this pad is this
gorgeous once again baked Laura Geller
stuff and if you are looking for
something to give you that glow along
your decollete area your neck your
shoulders anywhere I had a big event
last night where you know I used my
sunless tanner but then I used this to
get a really nice glow all over you can
use this with a brush on your face you
can use the pad on your face whatever
you want to do but it's a really nice
tan glow you use this wet and you will
get even more of a shimmery dewy effect
with this but I just love it because
sometimes I will a lot of times actually
I'll take a bronzer that I'm using on my
face and I'll grab I have another big
kabuki brush that I use and I'll bronze
up this area as well but this is nice to
have a big this is a big sized product
like lemon this is a standard size
powder this is the laura geller so
you're getting a lot of stuff here so
basically what that means is I feel like
I can use it over larger portions in my
body and not feel like I'm using up all
of the bronzer I use on my face and
stuff like that that's what caused me to
run out of like my Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer so quickly because I was
using it
everywhere here you can reserve this for
other parts of your body get that deeper
glow that you want and like I said you
can use it with the puffs you can use it
with a brush whatever you love ailable
on QVC comm and I think they also have
another version that is split one side
is like this bronzer and the other side
is like a really light highlight shade
alright guys that wraps up this month's
shopping list ideas hope I gave you some
good ideas I think a lot of this stuff
is great for summer if you're looking
for the bronze glow and things like that
these products will help you and also
some good products for the relaxation
and the stress relief so thanks for
watching have a great day and I'll see
you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
