for my shopping list ideas for this
month these are some products that I've
personally been loving and I think you
really enjoy them too some of them are
some things that are sort of Newton and
there are some of them that are kind of
like rediscovered favorites and I'm
going to kick this off actually with a
couple of mascara favorites that I've
been coming back to time and time again
when i get a question about like what's
your favorite drugstore mascara these
usually come into play in some way and
so the first one is almaz get up and
grow mascara something i love so much
about this is number one the formula is
not too terribly wet and if you don't
have a lot of lashes like I don't feel
like I have a whole big forest lashes on
there I feel like this more easily kind
of grabs everyone and makes them stand
out the brush is super thick this was an
Emily Award winner mascara but something
that kind of brought it back to my
attention was lately if I try a new
mascara and it feels like a little too
wet or it didn't really you know do for
my lashes what I thought it would I'll
top it off with some of this and it will
kind of like correct that not so good or
too wet mascara because this is just the
perfect consistency then for lower
lashes i just want to remind everybody
lash discovery it's going to be that
season where maybe you're even more
concerned about what you do on your
lower lash line if you know you're
outdoors a lot or whatever this does not
smudge on me at all it's a teeny-tiny
great little brush there so it's great
for getting you know some definition on
your lower lashes but not too much
product another I think that it's
something that I actually did a video on
a tutorial with about a year or so ago
and it's the knicks bronze smoky look
it's a little palette here it's
absolutely perfect for travel because I
mean the shadows aren't too big and
there's a close look at what they are
like you've got some matte and some
shimmer and then there's a little
trapdoor in the bottom where you've got
some bosses too but this is kind of a
rediscovered thing for me because i love
these bronzy colors i'm wearing them
today i just think they're very
flattering for all kinds of eye colors
and these shades are just really
saturated great neutrals here there's a
look at those those are the ones I'm
wearing today I've got this lightest
shade like in the inner corner I've got
this shade right here on my lid and this
shade in the crease so I just love the
look of that created and it's something
that i use day to day for just a basic
look too I cannot say enough about this
brush this is such a cool brush it's
from coastal scents and it's the BRC s
060 kind of a crazy name there but um
this is what the brush looks like and
you might instantly be seeing it and
comparing that to another brush you
might have in your collection its kind
of pinched right here at the top so it's
making it kind of you know skinny from
the side but it's a little bit why I
compare it to this one that I have from
Sigma and you can see they're like a
similar shape here the way they're
pinched in but if you look at him
sideways the single one is a little bit
fuller it's just a bigger brush and this
one being just a little bit smaller but
in that same kind of concept I love this
brush for to reason if I want to apply a
shade to my crease I hold it so it's
kind of going long ways here and I can
apply it and then I can also just turn
it up sideways and that can blend it out
and it's not too big you know what I
mean sometimes I think people struggle
was blending their eyeshadows or they
feel like you know this shouldn't be so
difficult well sometimes the issue is
that the brush you have is like too big
for your eye shape or whatever and it
just isn't fitting and it's it's giving
you not enough control this gives you so
much control to just get the shadow
right where you want it but in at the
same time you can blend it out and I
used it for this look for the crazy shed
a bit it's extremely soft even after
cleanings and everything it's still held
up very well in terms of just the
construction of the brush but it's
different than anything I have and it's
just kind of that unique kind of pinched
in shape so it's just a little bit flat
but still extremely good for blending I
get a lot of questions about great
concealer for the under eye area and
i've been using one a lot lately that I
just really can't say enough about it's
from it cosmetics and it's called bye
bye under eye now this is the same brand
that makes that
great contouring palette the my sculpted
face palette that I love and my shade is
medium in case you're wondering and this
has phenomenal coverage for the under
eye area I know I talked about Lori
Geller's real deal concealer as being
really good coverage this has that
coverage level only it's not quite as
dry just want to be able to show you
what the texture is like here you can
see it's extremely creamy a little bit
goes a long way it just does not take a
lot to do the jobs is marketed like on
QVC is something you could do like all
over your face if you needed a whole lot
of coverage you know you could use in
big parts of your face not just the
under eye area I use not under I I've
used it on a couple of spots here and
there and the one fault of this is that
I have used it around my nose and I did
get a little bit of some breakouts
happening there so I'm going to steer
clear of using it around my nose anymore
but the under eye area this is just
absolutely great love the coverage level
love how it doesn't you don't put it on
and then it doesn't get dry and kind of
accentuate fine lines and things like
that it's just very very good texture
and very good cover this face product is
very affordable very easily accessible
in the drugstore and it's from
Maybelline and it's the shine free
pressed powder and my shade here is
golden and what I've been using this for
is to kind of help out my t-zone during
a time of year where I feel like I start
to get a little bit oily I have like
seasonal skin I feel like it's pretty
normal throughout the winter but then
the t-zone kind of comes back to life
around this time of year and so I will
just like after I've got my foundation
my concealer on I'll kind of just Pat
this like around my t-zone and then
maybe even use a different kind of
powder just all over my face this is
just a little bit light and it actually
works rather well in the center of the
face you know if you're thinking about
highlighting a little bit it's
practically like that mattifying powder
and the highlight and one and it serves
me very well I mean I've had my makeup
on for quite a while already today
probably for a good I don't know five or
six hours and I feel like it's still
held up very well staying power wise and
so this has been something I've just
been going to this I first do my makeup
in the morning
and it really extends the where of what
I have on this blush from Nixon cinnamon
it looks origionally like a matte sheer
blush like I've got it on today and i
love the peachy glow it gives it's not
as intense as it looks here but it just
is a great kind of coral peach look to
the cheeks and reaching for this blush a
whole lot lately I want to talk about
sort of a body bronzer thing and I know
I've mentioned this one before but this
is from Laura Geller it's the baked body
frosting and Tahitian glow and I
realized just how cool this was when I
was doing a wedding recently not just
the bride but all the bridesmaids and I
kind of handed this off to them and said
you know if you want to get a little
more of a glow around your shoulders
your arms and you know you can use this
comes with a puff you can use it wet or
dry if using it dry you can just use a
big kabuki brush to swirl it around and
it gives not only like a deeper tan but
also a little bit of the shimmer and if
you use it wet it's going to be a little
more long wearing the shimmer is going
to be a little more intense so just be
aware of a season where you know your
shoulders may be exposed a little more
you can even put this on your legs and
they will just totally glow and look
really great even if you want to correct
like a sunless tan gone wrong you can
almost blur the edges of something you
know done wrong with self tanning when
you use something like the great thing
about this is that Laura Geller's
products these baked products last
forever I've had small size products
like her mini size baked stuff and that
lasts a long time of course the regular
does too but this is a very large large
thing and I've had this for it was once
domed up a little bit more but I've had
this for a good long time and I've got
plenty of it left so that's the baked
body frosting from Laura Geller I almost
forgot I have one more thing to mention
here and it's kind of a series of pink
lipsticks that I wanted to tell you
about first I was just going to tell you
about one and then I thought well maybe
you know I should do a little range here
because I like several of these and
they're all for mac and they are just
some fantastic pink lipsticks one is
called speed dial and I'll swatch it
here for you it's kind of like a classic
wonderful carnation pink just like
straight up great great
to have you know it's it's a cream
machine so there's no shimmer in it it's
just really nice and creamy the other
one is also a cream machine and it is
called hot gossip and it looks very
different from speed dial if you were to
hold the two up side by side but when I
swatch it together you can see it's just
maybe a little more of Ted's just maybe
a hint of a lilac tone to it a little
bit of mauve maybe slightly deeper but
still you know just a really nice fresh
pink so I love both of those but if you
want something even deeper more of a
berry craving which is an amplified
lipstick is phenomenal and that's right
there so there's craving there's hot
gossip and their speed dial they're just
a great range of pinks I love the
texture of these the way they last on my
lips they feel good they smell good they
have that light kind of vanilla scent
that MAC lipsticks has initially just
going to mention hot gossip because I
warned that one a lot lately but then I
thought you know if somebody wants to go
a little lighter than that they can go
for speed dial or a little more berry
they can get craving so I hope that was
informative there for you on the pink
lip sticks but thank you so much for
