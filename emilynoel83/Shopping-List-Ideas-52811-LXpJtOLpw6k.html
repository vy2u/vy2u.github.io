says thanks for all the nice messages
well that didn't last very well like you
guys so much for joining me this is
going to be my shopping list ideas video
and yeah I've got a lot of just makeup
related things that I'm loving a lot
right now so I'm going to start off with
a nail item actually now my nails right
now yeah I got a little crazy I want
every other color and I did shrimp Lee
divine from selling Hansen complete
salon manicure and then the light pink
shade is Revlon pink chiffon so but and
I love those shades but my favorite for
this month has got to be a Revlon top
speed in peachy this is such a nice
little coral peach color I think it's so
so pretty on it takes a couple of code i
used it i actually used a nail stencil
to take a different color and put it
over it and this is from Claire's and
this is going to be a favorite this
month as well because these are so easy
to use these are just little stickers so
after you put on your first coat of
whatever polish you want you let that
dry and then these just peel off you
stick on you paint right over them with
another color and you've got a cute
little um you know stencil on your nail
you could repeat it or whatever but I
just think those are really really cool
and just a fun way to put a design on
your nail if you're not very good with
like free handing stuff I'm not over the
past month or so I've been doing more
sunless tanning and I am going to have
the video all about my favorite sunless
tanners that is coming I promise and I
could have you put them in my favorites
video but I just thought I'm going to
make a separate video all about it has
resulted in me trying to look in my
collection for a foundation that's a
little bit darker to match up with you
know my darker snack prolongwear NC 35
what I was matched matched with not too
long ago but it annoys I always felt
like hands a little dark but it's
perfect right now I have it on right now
and I've been wearing this a lot
throughout the past month and initially
I wasn't too like over-the-top about
this foundation and I still don't think
it's the best foundation out there I
still you know if I had my
happen to have rimmel lasting finish
maybe in a darker shade your revlon
colorstay right now in a darker shade i
really like those but this has been
working better than I thought it served
a purpose for me just because I happen
to have it in a shade that was deeper so
it's been nice this month I feel like it
has provided better coverage and it
hasn't been like breaking down like I
guess I encountered the first few times
I wore it i don't know if i was putting
too much on or what but I noticed it
breaking down a little more around my
t-zone and lately I mean I think maybe I
have been putting on this the thinnest
layer possible and I think it's helped
the staying power actually that's a good
lesson for any foundation really don't
put on too much especially in the
summertime but this has been working
well for me so I do think that's a good
foundation if you like Mac foundations
but I just want to make sure you know I
don't think it's like above and beyond
um rimmel and Revlon and stuff like that
that you guys know I love I love the
Milani baked eye shadows these are so
good these are what you can wear wet and
dry and I've done a video on them i have
multiple colors right now I'm wearing
this purple shade and I think it's so
gorgeous and I've worn it I kind of used
it wet right in the inner part for more
intensity and then I just use this one
shadow and kind of buffed it out a
little bit I actually I put in one more
shape which I am going to talk about in
a second but mainly I use this color
like all over my eyelid crease area and
i love this purple this purple is called
a perfect purple like a cat double and i
love that color and i just i like so
many of those because you know they can
do different things if you wearing wet
or you where I'm dry it's really awesome
and another eyeshadow that i love that i
stumbled upon is the l'oreal hip studio
secrets professionals metallic shadow
and electrified this is so pretty this
is a really super shimmery like I would
say silver but it's kind of like got a
little more grayish taupe color to it so
and then this purple this plum is really
pretty as well I actually put a little
bit of that just a tiny bit in the outer
part of my career
but i love these shades and i've been
using that a lot more like a smoky plum
I or just you know to deepen up your
crease in gesso from a recent tutorial
you guys know how much I'm loving the
bronze shades on the lids lately think
it's great for summer and I wanted to
throw in a cream product that I'm liking
to do some layering with some somewhat
and it's from NYX and it's the jumbo
pencil and iced mocha I've had this for
a while this is not really a new
favorite product of mine but this is
really a great kind of you know brownish
little bit bronzy a little bit taupe and
that's a really nice shade to put on
your lid then you want to kind of Pat it
a little bit make sure not too much
product got on there and then you layer
on your other bronze stuff and it gives
it a nice little metallic if you lip
products to talk about the first two I
am wearing now and I don't know if I've
mentioned this in a video before or not
I may have because I've had it for a
while i've been using it a lot lately
because it's a good one step lip product
and it's Milani HD advanced lip color I
have some other shades of this that I
think are fantastic too but I also
really love this one in classy nude and
I've been using it tons because you just
put it on and it has this great lip balm
field it reminds me in texture and feel
almost of the palladio herbal tinted lip
balms that I love so much only you've
got a wide range of colors to choose
from and this nude is really nice it's a
really really good you know not not
erase your lips type nude not like matte
crème de nude or myth or anything like
that but it's got a little bit of just a
little deeper maybe a little bit of a
honey tone to it and I think it really
it looks and feels good on your lips and
then for lots of different lip looks
i've been using I've been kind of
highlighting the center part of my lower
lip with a little bit of gloss just to
add some fullness at a little pout to it
and this NYC liquid lip shine I think
they've reformulated these and it's also
got new packaging as well and this shade
is Brighton Beach
peach yes catches the light see how it
really is reflective so it's a perfect
kind of product just to dab right here
on the center of your lower lip if you
want a more full look to your lip and
another shade that I've tossed in just
occasionally into my makeup routine this
month but I love it so much because it
has a nice impact it is the NYX round
lipstick in physically like orange coral
color a little bit of red I mean it's
just I would say it's more on the orange
side though and I had this on in my
recent blog TV and everybody was asking
about it and I'm like yeah it really
started to grow on me you know but this
is a very pretty color really gives nice
pigmentation and it's just a nice
variation from classic red lips or
bright pink lips I'm really liking that
and I wore it with a a top that has like
a sort of a reddish orange e stripe
through it and it just set it off really
nicely that pretty much wraps up my
shopping list ideas for this month again
sometimes it's new things that I stumble
upon and sometimes it's just stuff that
I find in my collection and I just start
using it using it this month just
repeatedly so I wanted to tell you all
about it I hope you enjoy these and have
a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
