good week so far I actually woke up this
morning and I had that feeling where I
just thought it was Friday and then I
realized it was not not yet Friday and
so that's just one of those bad feelings
when you wake up to your early early
alarm clock but I am excited to share
with you some of my favorite products
that I've been using a lot of lately
I call it my shopping list ideas because
they're all things I'd really recommend
to you if you see little bits of my
shirt popping in here I'm just going to
show it to you it is my save the earth
it's the only planet with cupcakes
t-shirt I believe I got that from
Walmart but anyway just want to let you
know that's what it is I want to talk
about velcro rollers have been using a
lot of like hot hair roller sets you
know where you heat them up and you take
them out and put them in but sometimes I
want a little different look with my
hair that's not totally like you know
uniform curls all over I might actually
want because my hair is down too I've
got it in a ponytail today but my hair
is down to about like here so sometimes
I want a little more body and smoothness
towards the top and maybe more curl on
the bottom and so that's when I bring in
the velcro rollers
so you'll put your hair around the
curling iron to get it hot and then you
immediately put it on the road these big
sizes that I get from Sally's you know I
might do too right up here just going
straight back and then two on each side
and then I've got lift and smoothness in
the crown and the top part of my head
you can just go around while those are
up there in that part of your hair you
can just go around the rest of your hair
with your curling iron I have like I
think it's a one-inch curling iron and
then you know you've got that bit more
curl but the body on top and it all
really works especially if you like a
bang you know going across kind of like
that that's more smooth and not as
tightly curled velcro rollers are great
for that so just keep in mind you don't
have to use them like all over your head
you can just use them like I do
sometimes in key areas and get that
different look also before we get into
the makeup I want to talk about the lazy
self-tanners product here this is from
Victoria's Secret and you might have
seen this on my blog recently it's it's
the beach sexy tinted body lotion with
shimmer and it's kind of like just a
bronzy shimmery product and I'll show
you a few pictures that I posted on my
blog so you can see exactly how it looks
sometimes you know I'll forget to do my
sunless tanning or I'll just you know
not feel like it the night before and so
but I get up in the morning and maybe I
wearing a skirt or I'm wearing something
that's showing my arms a lot and so I do
want to have maybe a little more color
and this is really good for that it does
have shimmer the scent is nothing
objectionable to me I don't even really
notice it that much it might blur the
lines a little bit if you had a little
unevenness with your tan but the main
thing is that this creates a really
shimmery glowy look and a little bit of
bronze tint to your skin where makeup is
concerned I've got a lot so I'm gonna
have to get through this somewhat
quickly but I get asked a lot about my
favorite way for applying foundation and
I bounce around a lot I try a lot of
different kinds of foundations for
example I've just recently picked up
that new Revlon whipped Colorstay
foundation so that's like you know
different from your traditional liquid
and then you've got the moon
the foam and all these different kind
times I use my fingers sometimes use a
stippling brush or a flat foundation
brush but really the kind of brush that
I keep coming back to almost despite any
different texture is this one from Sigma
it's the f80
it's a flat top Sigma it's from their
sigmax collection it's a synthetic brush
it's extremely dense and soft it forgive
me my 9 use this morning it's not
perfectly clean but this is just great
for buffing in the foundation I feel
like it's just the perfect like length
of the brush hairs here to really be
able see how I'm moving on my hand and
the bristles kind of are able to shift
and move it's really able to get a good
blend because it's got so many dense
super soft little fibers on there so
this has been great for me regardless of
what foundation I use this is usually
the strategy that's going to work best
for getting it on there and getting it
even and flawless looking so that is my
go-to foundation brush before foundation
usually comes primer and one that I've
been really seeing as a stand out primer
lately is the Too Faced primed and
poreless SPF 20 bronze tint again look
the Bronston but it is summer we know
that so why is this cool well I've tried
several different bronzers that claim to
have a bronze tint specifically Smashbox
photo-finish
and laura geller they both have that
bronze version and I've put them on my
face and while they feel good and they
feel nice and smooth they don't really
have a tint like it appears to be that
way but once you blend it out on your
skin you don't even see it anymore
this one from Too Faced actually does
have a little bronze tint and plus it
feels so super smooth that if you just
wanted to you know kind of wear this
alone I feel like you could like it
blends in and it gives you just a really
great canvas either for your foundation
says start with a little more color or
you know just on its own it's kind of
like pore minimizer plus a little bit of
color you guys wouldn't be mad at me if
I talked about one more bronze bra this
is like the bronzer themed shopping list
ideas I don't know
but I've got to mention this there's not
a ton of matte bronzers in the drugstore
and there aren't any that I've found
that I would classify as being like a
darker matte bronze or something closer
to my you know lovely too faced
chocolate soleil that I think is so
great but um Revlon Photoready has come
out with this version and it's it's
bronzed and chic it's number 100 and
what you've got here are quadrants of
color that are matte four different
shades and this bottom part here is
actually quite dark like that's that's a
really good contour right there and the
way I use this I've got this on a day
and I took a fluffy brush and I swirled
it all in there and then I just lightly
dusted that all over my face just to
give me that little skin tone boost and
then I took an angled brush just over
the bottom part and use that as my cheek
contour it's wonderful it's really
really good so while I love my NYC sunny
and my Rimmel natural bronzer in
sunlight as good kind of light colored
bronzers matte options you could still
contour with those if you have fair skin
this is something that I feel like
people with medium to even deeper skin
tones can get something out of if they
want that nice deeper shade that they
can contour with 2mm on Revlon Revlon
feel like has really hit things out of
the park lately where lip products are
concerned I love the lip butters I love
these new just bitten kissable balm
stains I think these are awesome I
seriously like I had two I think the
last time I talked to you and did my
haul and now I've gotten quite a few
more so if you want to see like a full
review swatches things like that tell me
in the comments section but for now I'm
going to talk about the two that I've
really been reaching for a lot one is
the one I'm wearing now which I consider
to be just a great pink color and this
shade is called cherish and they look
like this you actually twist the bottom
and that's how you can get more or less
product basically out of the top so it's
not something you sharpen but it's like
a jumbo pencil and it gives your lips
that color and moisture when you first
put them on and then that shine a little
bit might wear
throughout the day but you still have
some color especially where the brighter
more pigmented ones are concerned and a
red if I if I've needed red lately
this is minute for me and this color is
romantic love it
I will swatch that for you since you
can't see that on looks like that a lot
of us think is red is being a little bit
more of a high-maintenance lip you got
to keep looking at it touching it up but
with this it stays on so much better and
then you have that kind of cherry
stained lip look even after like I said
the feel of the product wears off so
very impressed with these and if you
want if you want to see a more in depth
review just let me know and one other
lip thing from Revlon this is more of an
old-school rediscovered thing I've
talked about a whole lot over you know
maybe the past couple of years and the
Super Lustrous lip gloss that's my
favorite kind of gloss that they have
and the one in foiled is a super great
neutral to have in your collection and
you can use this all over your lips just
for kind of a shimmery almost metallic
kind of peachy nude see that swatch
there it's kind of hitting the light or
in this situation what I did was I just
dabbed a little bit of that on the lower
center part of my lower lip and it gives
that little bit of shine and instant
instantly a look of fullness there so
it's kind of like lip plumper without
any kind of plump and going on because
it's just the illusion that that little
bit of shine gives this catches the
light so much it's so reflective it
really does the job well and the texture
is nice staying power is really pretty
good for a gloss so I would highly
recommend Revlon Super Lustrous I'm
using my new Milani shadow singles a
whole lot lately these are their new
reformulated single powder shadows you
can get them at CVS stores and get them
online at the Lani's website or cherry
culture but you get a lot of product in
here again a full review on this stuff
is already out there but a couple of the
shades that I feel like I've been going
back to a lot because they are kind of
multi-purpose
is a tickled pink and this is that
beautiful shade that is pink with a
golden sort of pearl enos to it so
watch that there on my hand when it hits
the light just a little bit of gold
comes through it's very unique and very
pretty and I'll find I can use that on
the lid but it can also be a beautiful
highlight then a shade that can either
be my crease color or just you know lid
to the crease if you just wanted to use
one shade and be able to get the benefit
of kind of a little glow on the lid but
a little depth in the crease a great
great option is caramel Brown and so
this shade as you can see it also has
shimmer but it's kind of like a taupe
brown and it's very pretty on its it I
mean it really is flattering so there
you can see it really catches the light
and those are the types of shades
mid-tone colors that have that little
bit of shimmer can be great as sort of a
one-step look but I actually like these
two together quite a bit I think they're
very pretty a liner pick that is sort of
a rediscovered thing I think I kind of
put it away started using some other
products and recently sort of remember
just how great this is
it's the Maybelline master drama
eyeliner in midnight master this is
gonna be one of those liners that you
don't have to sharpen which is always a
plus for me and this is black and all
sometimes use this on the outer part of
my lower lash line and maybe smudge it
out a little bit but once that sets I
mean this is a truly long wearing liner
this is going to stand up to like your
Urban Decay 24/7 liner pencils in terms
of staying power color is extremely just
rich and saturated so I think if you're
looking for that great eyeliner and you
like pencil this can be your upper lash
line as well I often use liquid there
but I mean don't get me wrong you can
use this in any way you want there's my
