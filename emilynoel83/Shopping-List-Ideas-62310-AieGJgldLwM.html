list ideas video I know some of you had
been requesting this for a while don't
know why I haven't gotten around to
doing another one until now but
basically these are like some current
favorite products I have quite a few to
talk about today a lot of lip products
and this one as well and also I have a
question for you guys who use what's it
called iMovie on Macs I had recently
been editing my videos on my old laptop
and ever since I started doing them on
iMovie I feel like the quality has been
just a little bit grainy or just
slightly blurry like I haven't changed
my camera at all or anything like that
it's just that and and there's no
settings on my camera that have changed
so it's something with using this
different editing software so when you
export it is there something different I
need to do if you have any advice on
this and that can kind of improve the
quality when I export or output the
video that would be greatly appreciated
so that would help me out a lot anyway
getting to the products been asked a lot
lately especially on my Facebook page
about products from Nick's or NYX and so
um I have gotten a few new things
recently that I've really enjoyed so you
can find Nick's products at certain
drugstores cherry culture calm always
carries it too so I just thought I'd
tell you what some things are that I'm
really liking one thing that I love is
the for your eyes only smokey eye
palette this has ten different shades in
it and it's just fantastic for a smokey
eye on the go a palette you can fit in
your makeup bag these are all the shades
I've used this in a lot of different
ways sometimes taking like the light
shade and using it on your lid and
pairing it with a darker shade or a look
that I really like the other day I took
like a medium color like this one put it
all over the lid and then paired it with
like one or two of the darker shades
it's really easy to blend product to
blend the shades together you get a nice
big mirror to work with so I would
really recommend this I think it has
shades that are silver-gray sort of like
dark dark taupe and then some great
black shades as well some with and
without sparkle a mix of matte and
shimmery finishes so I think you get a
lot of good out of this if you're
looking for some good smoky colors there
another good just single shadow is this
one in called a rock and this if I'm
just kneading like one black shade
lately I've been using this one a lot
and as you can see it's got a little
sparkle to it so it's a little softer
you might find it a little easier to
blend say than Mac's carbon which is
just a matte black which is good you
know at times but I like this one
especially for blending so that one is
called rock and a third product from NYX
is a really light frosty lip gloss that
I love for like a nude lip or with along
with any lip color just to highlight
like the center of your bottom lip and
it's called beige pearl and it's one of
the mega shine lip glosses if you get a
close-up look at that you can see she's
a really pretty kind of champagne nude
maybe just a hint of like really light
like peach and that but it's very pretty
has a very reflective quality on the
lips so I love that
well next a couple of face products this
is something that I did post in a review
just individually on this product not
too long ago but I really really love it
as the Palladio herbal foundation primer
this is available at Sally Beauty Supply
stores this line specializes in the
herbal makeup and this is the first
primer I found that really makes me
reminds me of Smashbox photo-finish
which I love so this isn't a much
cheaper price I think you're going to
find it for like six or seven dollars
there so I love this I would suggest
giving this a try if you you know maybe
don't want to fork over the cash it
takes to get that smashbox that this is
saving me a lot of money I know right
now so that is from Palladio
next is something that I've talked about
a lot used in a lot of reviews but I
just have been relying on it lately and
I've been using the blood
in this more it's the elf contouring
blush and bronzing powders from the
studio line if your target is selling
elf chances are they're selling this
product as well but it's not the blush
and the bronzer in there I just bought a
new one actually because I didn't know
how much longer this bronzer was gonna
last me but it's kind of like dupes for
NARS orgasm blush and Laguna bronzer I
used the bronzer all the time as a
contour and lately I just started
realizing how good the blush actually is
I don't know why I really wasn't using
it that much before it has a little
sparkle to it but like I have that on
today paired with my Milani my Thai
blush which is like a matte peach so I
put on the matte peach purse and this
over it Thank You rose on my facebook
page on the beauty broadcast Facebook
page for mentioning that it's a great
combo because you've got something kind
of matte that stuff that gives you good
color and then something a little bit
more luminous to put on top of it it
gives you a really good summary glow
there so great ideas love exchanging
them on the Facebook page um few lip
products here a new lip product it's
actually what I have on right now so
it's a gloss it is the NYC New York
color extreme lip glider lip gloss in
Plaza punch looks like this they're
these long skinny but yet there's still
a squeeze tube sort of format here so
it's gonna squeeze out that top you can
if you get a close look at this in the
package it's kind of like a plum berry
shade goes on somewhat sheer but it as
you can see it still my lips aren't
super like pigmented on their own so I
feel like this gives a decent amount of
color this shade I'm actually trying a
lot of new things from NYC so I'm going
to keep you posted on how well they work
but this one is a for sure favorite
thing that I'm going to be using a lot
it's kind of cool how like long and
skinny it is kind of like that as far as
the lipstick that I'm using a lot I
think I had this in a haul video
recently perhaps did I or didn't I I
don't remember it's it's from Mac and
it's the amplified lipstick in
craving and it's so creamy and it's like
a perfect just berry color on the lips
it's not red it's not like magenta
bright hot pink but it's just a
beautiful berry color where if you're
wanting to give color to your lips and
really brighten up your face as a result
this is great I've used this countless
times lately on the news and it just
worked so well it has that nice kind of
vanilla sweet scent that the MAC
lipsticks had goes on really smooth and
it's not drying at all so I would
suggest that if you're looking for a
lipstick in that color range next lip
product I want to talk about is from
Coastal Scents it is their new lip quad
and sunkissed and I do have some
swatches of this up on my blog if you
want to check out this and the other
ones but really really I'm liking this
one and basically you get four colors
you get a generous amount of each color
and what you get is a light nude kind of
a medium nude with maybe a little I
don't know it's a little bit warmer you
get a metallic shade that is sort of
coppery and then a deeper like brownish
shade and they were really well you get
great pigmentation with these even with
the lightest shade it totally covers
your lips I mean not sheer you're going
to get that nude color take that one and
then blend in the darkest shade kind of
around the outer parts leave the center
of your lip a little bit lighter it's a
really pretty look I think this is great
for summer these are affordable palettes
you can check out more swatches on
beauty broadcast net the last thing I
want to talk about has been so helpful
to me in this heat and humidity I
actually had to go do a story today
after the news at a landfill so I was
outside it was hot my face is red I
don't know how my makeup is holding
together as it is now because my face
was sweating and I don't know how my
hair is keeping any volume but I've got
to give some credit to the Tresemme tres
two hairspray here this is my mini one
that I keep in my makeup bag that I take
to work with me so this fits in there
really nicely sometimes if you go to
Target you'll find like a big one and
and this isn't like tiny either but it's
a decent size but the big ones like big
and if you can find those to package
together and like get one of them for
free but yeah this is the on-the-go side
as you can see there and it's just
really seriously I've been using this
hairspray consistently for a while and I
think it's fantastic so great way to
finish off your do even though my hair
isn't like really curly today so I
didn't have a lot of curl to hold I
still kind of like teased it up at the
roots a little bit and this is giving me
a lot of volume so thank you so much for
watching this video and hanging with me
through all of my potential rambles soon
as it may have been on some of these
products but I love talking about makeup
I love communicating and interacting
with you guys about it as well so if you
have favorite products that you want to
post down below things you've been using
a lot in the past month or past week
it's always fun to talk about so thanks
again for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
