in for this shopping list ideas video
and this is sort of my version of like a
current favorites video it's some
products that i am really liking right
now some of them may be items that have
just come out other things maybe have
been in my collection for a while that
I've kind of rediscovered and want to
tell you about him because I think
you'll like them too so I have a real
variety in terms of products for hair
nails body makeup so you'll definitely
want to see what's on this one and I'll
try to get through it as quickly as I
can the first product I want to tell you
about is the redken quick dry hairspray
and it's called quick dry 18 it's an
instant finishing spray so it's gonna
you're gonna put it on it's gonna kind
of lock things in I got this little
version oh hello snot down a few lip
glosses there I got this little version
for four dollars from the beauty first
store in the st. Louis area and this is
really small and I was wanting like a
small one that would be kind of like
purse size or something i could take
with me to work and stuff and what's so
great about this is this really is good
for travel because this instead of
having like a cap that could come off
and then it could spray all over this
just twists like that so when it twists
you can you know you can spray or
whatever and it just you know is a real
nice kind of fine mist and then when
you're done you just turn it and it's
not going to spray it all so it's got a
decent scent and its really good for if
you're teasing your hair whatsoever you
want to get a little spritz of that on
there before you go ahead and you know
run a comb through and it works really
well for that it's nice for volume 2 and
just being light and stuff and not
making your hair feel weighed down so
that's a really good thing it's redken
quick dry 18 the other thing i want to
tell you about is this nail polish that
i have on it's like a really pretty like
orange eat coral shade and it's from
l'oreal and it is number 4 10
mango get him and I really hadn't tried
any of these L'Oreal polishes they're
just right down there with all the
regular L'Oreal nail stuff and I just
this shade really caught my eye and I
was kind of wanting like a bright orange
coral for the summer and I just saw this
and had to go for it so I put it on my
nails and so far I mean well I'm pretty
smooth this is two coats here so um it's
I mean comparing it to like china glaze
I mean it's pretty pretty good it may
not go on quite as thick as that does
but for this color I mean two coats I
think it's fantastic so anyway that's
from Lori Allen it's the mango get'em
shade and speaking of mango I have to
tell you about my new body wash that
I've gotten it's from tone and it's the
moisturizing body wash with cocoa butter
in mango splash and so it's got vitamin
e in it and it really does feel
moisturizing and when you get out of the
shower you're still going to be able to
smell it so I kind of like that I kind
of like you know actually feeling like
the scent isn't just completely washed
away and it's not like super strong it's
subtle but oh my gosh it smells so good
if you just love those juicy fruity
scents man this smells fantastic you get
a nice big bottle this is 18 ounces
right here and um I really like like the
tone hand soaps and stuff like that like
that foam up when you use them and this
is just delicious like if this could be
you know some kind of free drink and I
could drink this that would be great
because it smells incredible so
definitely if you're running low on your
body wash and you're going to get a new
one soon check out the tone moisturizing
body wash with cocoa butter um it's in
mango splash and I got this at Walmart
all right guys on to the makeup products
first I need to tell you about my Mac
bronzing powder in golden I think I
mentioned this i'm not sure if it was on
my blog or my facebook or whatever but
um i'd recently picked this up this
bronzer and it is fantastic i've been
using it on pretty much a daily basis
for work and stuff and you can see
it's not super dark i mean i have
bronzers and I have had browsers that
are a little darker and this has sort of
a slight slight shimmer it's not a major
shimmer it's just a little bit pearly I
have it on right now I kind of used it
as a little bit of a contour and just
kind of on you know where the Sun would
naturally hit my face and I just totally
been enjoying this product I just I like
how it comes off I love the how natural
the shade is and something about the
shade just is really working with my
skin tones so if you're looking for good
bronzer and maybe you are a fan of Matt
products and you don't mind paying Mac
prices every now and then this is
definitely one of those products you
know you might want to look into from
max so that's the mac bronzing powder in
golden a couple other products couple of
lip products here the one that I have on
is this Neutrogena moisture shine
lipgloss and the color is spritz okay so
this is kind of a it's got a little bit
of a pinky rosy hue to it but overall
it's kind of a bronzy golden shade and
it looks great for summertime because it
really plays off of the bronze tones in
your skin and it gives you that healthy
kind of shine without looking too
over-the-top and I mean if you don't
really go for big colorful lip looks
you're just kind of like a neutral gloss
I've always liked the moisture shine lip
glosses and I think this is probably one
of my favorite ones that I've tried so
you can kind of see that color yeah it's
got some nice shimmer to it really does
feel moisturizing on your lips it's
probably along with Revlon super
lustrous this is right up there from me
in terms of drugstore lip gloss another
drug store tinted lip balm this one's
from soft lips and I have this in I
think a pink shade to its they're tinted
lip balm this one is bronze yeah tempted
lip conditioner it also has the SPF 15
so if you're going out to the beach or
the pool or something you do want to
have a little something on your lips and
maybe give yourself a little bit of
color you can see that this has that
little bronze shimmery tint to it and it
really does show up on your lips that
way and they also have like kind of a
pearl a pink shade too and if yours
soft lips and I know this has like a
major following out there and i love
these two i love the size i love how
they glide on and the scent is kind of
like a little bit of a fruity scent to
it so it's really really pleasant and if
yeah if you're a soft lips fan and you
haven't discovered these tinted ones yet
you definitely want to look into that
and the last makeup item that I have to
tell you about is from L'Oreal and it is
their new mascara it's the extra volume
with collagen mascara here and it's a
nice like really non flashy I mean after
lash blast and and define a lash and the
colossal and all those different kinds
of drugstore mascaras that have cannot
really flashy this one kind of wet the
opposite route and it's just says
L'Oreal on the side and otherwise it's
really really super sleek and I'm a big
big fan of this brush and the brush
claims to really be able to build up
your lashes quickly and I believe it
does that and I've like this more and
more the more I've used it and I find it
just it does a great job of getting
those inner lashes to really kind of
come alive and it doesn't make him feel
real brittle and hard after you've used
it I haven't had a lot of trouble with
flaking I haven't used it in real heavy
sense in terms of being out and like
working out in the Sun with this but I
have worn it for work on the air and
I've been very happy with the end result
it's nice in terms of length but it is
thickening too and once again I'm just a
big fan of this brush as opposed to a
lot of the rubber brushes that are out
there right now I think this is really
really nice it's kind of like it's got a
little maybe a little bit of like as
really subtle hourglass shape because it
goes in just a little bit in the middle
and then it tapers again at the end
which I enjoy about it as well helping
get to those inner lashes it's nice to
build on itself it builds on itself a
little more easily if you do not let it
dry between coats but overall you know
if you're in the market for a new
drugstore mascara I would give this a go
if you're if you do want that nice
volume in terms I would say maybe it's
more volumizing than lengthening and
hopefully that kind of stares you in the
right direction there but yeah not a bad
mascara at all I'm actually really
impressed with that night kind of have a
hard time warming up to certain mascaras
after I try them but I've used this for
a few weeks now and I really like it and
the last product and what to tell you
about is from everyday minerals and it's
their cosmetic wet wipes okay so they
come in a nice big a little package like
this and you get how many wipes do you
get it says here I just can't see you
get 80 wipes in this I remembered it
being some really high number and these
are not expensive at all if you're
placing an everyday minerals order get
these wet wipes they come they are with
you know super natural ingredients yeah
all natural and organic ingredients
all-purpose refreshing flushable
biodegradable and I believe if I can
find anything more about use let me see
yeah they're made from a blend of
essential oils to leave skin clean and
fresh ideal for removing makeup and
cleansing your face and body also for
sensitive skin baby bottoms and perfect
for kids on the go so these are great if
you are having one of those you know so
you have been outdoors you've been real
active or you go to the pool and you
want to get all your makeup off real
quickly before you get in these are so
nice for that it get a nice they package
80 of these and they are so inexpensive
i will definitely post the price and how
you can get these on the everyday
minerals website but I was like men
that's a lot you know 80 wipes and
they're good for two if you like to
likes watch your eye shadows like on
your hand or anything and you just want
to like rub those off when you're done I
sometimes do that when I'm playing
around with shadows trying to figure out
a new looks and stuff like that so
definitely a great great item to get
here I know some people just do use the
baby wipes and stuff like that but i
really trust everyday minerals products
i think they're awesome products and so
yeah we're a pretty you know inexpensive
price to go on there and get that
alongside maybe your sample kit or a new
blush or whatever you know definitely
something to look into so that is my
shopping list ideas those are my
shopping list ideas for this time around

me know what things are you liking right

ideas and share their tips with everyone
