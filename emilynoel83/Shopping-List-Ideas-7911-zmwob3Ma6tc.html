ideas I love these videos because i love
sort of running you through some of my
current favorite products that i've been
using so much throughout the past month
or so and i love all the little subtle
reminders i was getting i would get like
a tweet or facebook message like um you
haven't done a shopping list ideas video
in a while so it's about time for that
so i love that you guys keep me on track
i think that's great but i have a lot of
products to talk about and right off the
bat i want to let you know that
everything I'm wearing on my face i I
couldn't help but try it today because
usually all like work in some of my
shopping list ideas that I'm going to be
talking about and actually be wearing
them in the video but I just got this
new kit from Tarte hold on a second it's
called the glow your weighted gorgeous
kit and i ordered this off QVC and it
like just came and so you guys know i
had to try it so everything I'm wearing
today there's some more goodies in that
side pocket too but from concealer to
blush to lips to mascara to I stuff i
mean cream eye shadow jumbo pencil it's
all from that kit i'm just going to post
a link below and you can go to that link
and check it out because a full review
and all that is i'm sure coming soon for
me on this kit but i just want to direct
you to that so that'll answer any
questions about what's on my face and my
nails this is from revlon and this is a
top speed nail polish in a shade called
cloud i love it don't you love that
pastel kind of periwinkle bills get
started with the shopping list ideas and
the first one is a biggie it is my
favorite shampoo and conditioner because
i know when you find the right one or
you find one that you feel like is
really working for you it's a very
important and exciting thing my hair
really soft even though you know I'm
heat styling my hair all the time and
the ends can get dry and typically do
get much drier than they have been so I
am loving the Pantene Beautiful Lengths
i'm using the shampoo and the
conditioner i chose the shine enhance
versions of each not only do these smell
awesome like they have a beautiful kind
of sweetness about the the smell i just
i really love it but I feel like
been using them and my hair has just
been so nice and soft and touchable and
just I mean I've been very very pleased
with the condition of another hair
related thing that I'm loving so much
right now I'm so excited I tried these
um gosh I've like I'm really excited
about all my favorites in this video um
okay rollers velcro rollers not just any
velcro rollers so let me show you yeah
if the rollers got the clip built right
into it there see that so you roll your
hair up you're not fishing around for a
clip or whatever you have this that can
fam right on there it's secure because I
know a lot of velcro rollers will say
you know self stick or they'll stay in
your hair and oak cliff needed that's
baloney not all of them do you know that
you you might get through half your head
and it's and it's working for you and
then you get to a few and it's like it's
coming out and when they start to come
out of your hair you're losing the lift
from the route that a velcro roller can
give you when it's sagging down when
it's pulling your hair back from Vidal
Sassoon and these are called the okay
I'm trying to find the language okay
it's a different it's different language
on the back and I don't know what it is
sure grip rollers with secure hold clip
sure grip rollers okay so this was like
in the packaging then I took it out and
it's got this nice little like um
closure here so you could travel with
that or whatever but it comes in a lot
of different sizes so you've got like
those big ones like I just showed you a
really large one medium sizes and small
sizes love that variety and I've been
using them and not necessarily all over
my head like for this style for example
I've got a lot of body going on up here
so I put some larger ones you know right
up through here couple of kind of up on
the side and then I may just take my
curling iron and just turn my ends under
it's a really quick way to do things
it's helped me so much in the morning I
love the fact that those clips are built
in so you don't even have to worry about
it don't have to worry about getting a
dent in your hair like you could
sometimes get with different hot rollers
and that kind of thing so
and if i do have a velcro roller
tutorial but i think i'm going to have
to update it now with these and the way
i like to use these best you know you
put your hair on a curling iron first
when that's hot you put it on the velcro
roller and then it you leave it on for a
while and it really holds that curl and
body so love those a body product to
tell you about right now this is from
Vaseline and it is the cocoa butter
vitalizing gel body oil this is really
really cool because when you put it on I
like to put it on after a shower and or
you can put it on like before you're
going out because you will have just a
gorgeous dewy glow to your skin instant
glow whether you're tan or maybe you're
not tan I mean you put this on and
instantly I feel like the skin looks
healthy it looks hydrated it doesn't
look greasy I mean you only need a
little bit like I will put like a small
like you know maybe the size of a large
pearl or something like that amount on
there and then you know use that kind of
all over my arms my collarbone area it
gives you do II just like back from the
tropics kind of glow and it's so
inexpensive it's obviously easy to be
using this a lot this month but as you
can see I haven't used up much so far so
it doesn't take a lot um but it really
will make your skin just looks so young
makeup wise I have been reaching for my
Mally more perfect palette over and over
in the mornings when I'm getting ready
for work I mean it just I love the
shades in it I've been using different
combinations so it's not like I've been
totally uncreated you know what I mean
but this has your blushes and I saw
shadows it has an eyeshadow base which
I'm not particularly fond of and it has
a cream highlight and it comes with a
big big mirror too and I have reviewed
this on beauty broadcast net and I'd
like to say for a second that I don't
know I feel like sometimes people get
misunderstood they know that maybe
beauty video makers might just tend to
use their blog to just release their
video and on another site you know it's
just a regurgitation of the same
information from YouTube but and
we'll do that if I have a series i'll
repost you know my videos all in a
stream so you can see them there but
what I want my blog to be is new reviews
different stuff Steph I haven't talked
about on YouTube you know so you're
getting new information not wasting your
time reading over the same stuff I've
already told you in my videos so this is
one of those things that i've swatched
on my blog i have fully reviewed on my
blog but i've just been using it so much
lately and it's been a real convenient
thing to use it pop it in my bag and I
always touch up before the morning
newscast and so it's just very nice to
have it all together I am nuts about
these two blushes i will use sometimes
both of them I'll layer one on top of
the other or I'll use you know this pink
is just lovely this is a really nice
kind of apricot so they look great
layered or they look great alone and
then these shades these couldn't be more
rich and smokey a lovely Navy and a
black these mid-tone shades I'm really
really loving that bronze you if you use
nothing else just put the bronze all
over and you're good this is kind of a
topi grey that I like and then these to
kind of highlight kind of sometimes you
know can be on your lids if you want
them to pop a little bit more but what's
also neat about this is that and I
bought this i purchased this not off of
QVC com where i get a lot of my Mally
stuff but this is available on mally
beauty calm and anyway I got that and it
comes in this little thing so this
actually also comes with a lip gloss
which I do enjoy very much as well a
blush brush and two shadow brushes there
once like a fluffy crease brush this
one's a smudger brush so I mean talk
about a gift idea as well who wouldn't
love to get that and get this palette of
wonderful shades that work on all skin
tones and everything but the palette can
slip right in there to nail polishes
I've been wearing this month and been
getting asked about them in different
videos what is that polish and actually
I've been very pleased with how long
they wear how fast they dry and how
pretty the colors are and so these are
both from NYC and it's in a New York in
a New York minute color okay
got it these are the two that i'm
talking about horn them both like i said
in videos this is Lincoln Square
lavender really pretty it's creamy and
it doesn't have any real Sparkle in
there so it's just like a pretty creamy
purpley lavender and then this one has
just a little bit of a pearly finish and
this is called Prospect Park pink and
it's just the perfect pink I love them
love you both so I would recommend those
nail polishes if you're also if you get
frustrated with drying time and
everything sets faster I it's not really
fast dry those do dry fast and finally I
have a tool to pass along and it's from
ELF and it's always great when the brush
costs only one dollar and I'm was
surprised I hadn't tried this brush yet
from ELF but it's the elf professional
eye crease brush and i want to tell you
i mean i have sung the praises of the
elf eyeshadow brush just the one that I
used to like pack on color I think this
is fantastic I don't think you can
really top this I mean I'm a huge fan of
Sigma brushes and all that but I mean
come on this is a dollar and this is
great so i totally recommend that one
and this is kind of like it's little
buddy sidekick awesome crease brush and
you'll notice this isn't going to be one
of those fluffy crease freshers like
this okay this is kind of going to be
your all-around smudger this is going to
be one that can get your outer V going
for you it fits so nicely right in the
crease not giving you any more brush
than you need not giving you any less
brush than you need it's going to get
your color so naturally right there in
the crease and you can also you have
enough control to get the outer V it's
not so big you can't focus on the area
you want and then it's other purpose
that I think is great is its small
enough to smudge just right under the
eye so yeah this is the professional eye
crease brush from ELF it is one dollar
and it is just a great little brush nice
and soft I like that it's tapered as
well this has not been cut blunt
straight across but you can see shorter
bristles on the sides longer bread
tools at the top there so can't beat it
love it love that breath ank you so much
for sticking with me through this
shopping list ideas video I get so
excited as I discover these different
products and I'm like the people must
know about this you know this is great
so I'm extra enthused about what I've
talked about in this video I hope if you
pick it up I hope it works for you like
it did for me and be sure to again visit
my blog its beauty broadcast antonette
