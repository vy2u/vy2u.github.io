having a great day i wanted to take this
opportunity to do a shopping list ideas
video because i haven't done one of
those in a while and I know how much you
like you know the product
recommendations and stuff like that so
that's basically what i'm doing here is
talking through some of my current
favorite products whether some of them
i've gotten recently or have had for a
while and they're things that i'm using
a lot right now and i'm really liking so
i want to pass it along to you and then
maybe you can pick them up next time
you're at the store as well but i'm
going to start off with a hair product
um it's a hairspray and lately i'm gonna
been kind of frustrated with hair sprays
because oftentimes you'll go back to the
drugstore you'll have been using
something for a while you go to the
drugstore and it's like it's
discontinued you know these I feel like
hair sprays are continually getting
discontinued and its really frustrating
when you finally find something that
really really is working for your hair
type and then go to the store and it's
gone and so I went out with the
intention last time I was shopping well
a few times ago and I decided that I was
going to find one that I thought I
always saw there that I did not think
was going to get discontinued because
it's been there for so long and it is
this from tresemme it's the tray to a
hairspray here it's extra hold says
professional formula and it has a little
thing says climate control on here all
day control humidity resistant to a
certain extent I kind of believe that my
hair is you know really wants to be
stick straightened which it kind of is
today I just a little side ponytail here
but yeah I mean more often than not
though like I will curl my hair and it
really wants to go straight in the
humidity and I put this on and I would
have been pleasantly surprised with how
well it's held up but and this is nice
just to set your whole look or to put it
on rollers as you're using it it's
really inexpensive and it is readily
available you know whether it's at your
dollar general store or walmart store
any drugstore this is there and I just
wanted to let you guys know that I enjoy
this as a hairspray I've also talked
about one that I think is a little
heavier hole than this and it has
as it sits white flint step up from this
it has a purple label down here and I
can't quite remember what it was exactly
called but I really like that too so
that one or this one a really good hair
sprays if you're looking for something
like that right now so just wanted to
pass the word along on that probably
going to have to speed up here and not
talked so long about everything my next
product is a brush it's the elf
professional brush it's the defining I
brush and this is not one of their
studio brushes this is actually one of
several that they are selling it dollar
general right now so far I'm two for two
on dollar general products but yeah in
case you haven't meant to your DG in a
while and they are carrying several elf
brushes the false lashes and maybe a few
other things but this is an angled brush
and I wanted I like angle brush as I've
tried I have one from coastal scents
that I like I have a sigma one I believe
that I like and and you know they're
great but I thought this is just so
readily available and inexpensive this
is just a dollar and it's this is
actually a really nice brush for one
dollar it's soft it's got that nice
angled brush its tapered not like
completely blunt like right across here
so it's very easy to blend and I didn't
pretty much except for my highlight i
think i went up and used a fluffier
brush for my highlight but i did my
entire i look with this brush today and
I've gone and done that in the past I
think way back i did a video where it
was like I challenged myself to do the
entire look with this because you can
you can get this you know all over your
lid you can work it in the crease get
right in here I mean it's so easy to use
so I just kind of wanted to share that
little tidbit with you because that's a
really great brush um next let's see
some eyeshadow this is one that I
recently did in a tutorial it is from be
luscious and it's their five color
palette and plum crazy and I love these
colors I love how several of them are
matte which makes them I think all a
more vibrant I just I really enjoyed the
way that look came together um I just
was so pleased with it I think Purple's
are
really flattering on a lot of people so
I love that and then you also get a nice
little brush there were some questions
like where I had gotten this brush from
but this comes with the palette and you
get a little end here that actually it's
just like a little flat brush which this
ends a little bit small I mean I don't
I'm it's like a mini concealer precious
what it looks like to me but I don't
really use that in so much as I use this
one which is just like a mini eyeshadow
brush if you look at it like I mean it's
great for packing the shadow on your lid
and stuff like that so you get that in
here you have a nice mirror back here to
use so that's wonderful and yeah just
five great colors to give yourself a
pinky you can go more on the pinky side
or more on the purple side like you say
these two colors for more of a pink look
and these two are more purpley and then
you've got this kind of wild card sort
of more neutral shade on the end so it's
great it's very versatile and I really
really would recommend that product if
you're willing to shell out a little
extra money for those shadows but they
are great quality shadows so moving
right along another a more inexpensive
shadow that you can find at Victoria's
Secret i said i was going to pass along
what i thought of these because i did a
blog um a few blogs ago about the beauty
rush wet dry eye shadows i got and a few
other things that i got as well this
shade is espresso lane and if you look
at it kind of reminds you of like the
baked collection from like physicians
formula or something like that it does
have some sparkle to it but it's not
overly glittery I don't think it's a
really rich brown shade with some kind
of warm gold undertones and I really
have liked this lately I use this a
little bit like just lightly in my
crease and kind of outer corner kind of
thing it's nice for lining around your
eyes as well um and I've just thoroughly
impressed with this I wasn't expecting
necessarily all that much out of these
shadows just because I thought okay
Victoria's Secret beauty rush is selling
you know I shadows you know for me it
was worth a try but I wasn't necessarily
thinking it was going to be the best
ever I'm not saying it's the best ever
but
is really good and I think it's gorgeous
I think it's just very very pigmented as
you can see they're just one swipe my
finger and I pulled off a lot of color
so I love that next product is a face
product and it for it is from wet and
wild and it's their mega glow
illuminating powder I have a couple of
these already and this one is in a spot
light peach okay this one's a little
different from some of the others
because it's not a shimmery it has like
one strip that has a little bit of a
slight bit of shimmer to it but the rest
is somewhat mad and so but they're
really pretty colors just pre tones of
peach and deep apricot I have that on on
right now and it's just great as a blush
so if you're looking for a pretty peach
blush but also something that you can
take you know each of these individual
shades and you know put together like
kind of a nice natural kind of mavi
peach I look I mean that would be great
too so that's very inexpensive it's from
wet and wild and again it's called
spotlight peach it's the mega globe
illuminating powder and another I
product I wanted to talk about and this
is a mascara that I have avoided for
years because I thought there is no way
I'm gonna like this I just assumed right
off the bat that I wasn't gonna like
Maybelline lash discovery because it was
a tiny brush it's a mini brush mascara
it says on there and I just thought you
know this this isn't going to work for
me I'm not going to be happy with you
know something that's only going to you
know darken my lashes but it really does
lengthen it's buildable and the brush
really makes it easy to get to each and
every lash and it's also nice down here
I can say you know honestly that it does
not smudge very mean I haven't had
smudging issues some people who may have
a lot of oil or something you know under
their eyes they I can't say for sure
you're not going to have an issue but I
have yet to have a problem with it when
I put it on my lower lash line but the
brush is teensy tiny and I don't know it
just it's been working really great for
me i love how i can get right in there
to them you know the further center
corner to the outer corners and down
below and it just highlights everything
it's much much better than great lash in
my opinion and um even if you just maybe
you got a mascara that you love for for
you know volume on your upper lash line
there have been ones that I've tried the
bin more volumizing I'm not saying this
is the most like the most volume I've
ever seen but it does a good job and if
you're looking for something that you
could exclusively lose use on your lower
lash line just to really you know not
make them look too chunky I am really
kind of paranoid about making my lower
lashes look chunky and obvious but I
don't mind darkening them up a bit and
just making them show up a little more
and this is really great for that too so
maybelline lash discovery mini brush
mascara um to lip products now i'm
wearing both of them the first is a
liner from wet and wild and it is um
brandywine number 666 this has been
recommended for years and you know the
editors choice or makeup artist choice
portion of a beauty magazine or whatever
this is a really great color I was just
looking for a liner that was sort of fun
you know maybe a little pinky could go
neutral could really go in any direction
but just would give my lips some
definition and this is really really
pretty i'm gonna draw some there on my
hand um you know you're getting kind of
just that it's like a little bit Rosie a
little bit bronzy very interesting color
and so I put that all over my lips and
I've been using it with Reds to Pink's
to whatever and it's really just kind of
worked for me there and one thing that
you should know I mean you get a really
long pencil but you do have to sharpen
it fairly often and then what I have
over the top of that is a lip gloss I'm
really liking it's the maybelline
shining lyst shiny licious lip gloss in
Caramella and it's just a really pretty
golden a nude gloss and it's very shiny
I think it it pairs wonderfully well
with this just for a look that you know
kind of brightens your face by getting a
little color but you kind of tone
back down with this loss so anyway um
guys those are my eight shopping list
ideas for this weaker until next time
and I hope you enjoyed it let me know
your feedback on those products I know
just because they work wonderfully well
for me doesn't mean they'll work good
for you and sometimes what works great
for you doesn't work for me either so
just to take it with a grain of salt i
guess but this is the stuff I'm liking
right now so I hope you enjoyed the
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
