ideas so this is gonna be kind of a
run-through of some current favorite
items that I've really been enjoying a
lot lately and I'm actually just gonna
start off by talking about what's on my
nails cuz I know I'll be gesturing a lot
with my hands and you may wonder what's
on there so this shade I love so much
and it's from wet and wild it's the wild
shine in dreamy poppy and I've had a few
of these wild shine nail polishes over
time and I think they actually wear
really well this is two coats that I
have on here so I think that's a you
know a good opacity I guess for the
color for two coats and this really
reminds me of a shade from Sally Hansen
complete salon manicure called shrimp
Lee divine and I've worn that a lot and
gotten so many comments on that color
and this is like that only you know you
can save a few dollars by getting it
from wet and wild for lips I'm actually
wearing this whole little lip routine
that I've been enjoying I'm wearing it
today for it starts off with the lip
balm so a current favorite lip balm is
from ballistics now I'm still enjoying
all the EOS stuff don't get me wrong got
those all over still but I wanted to try
this five star lip protection from
blistex there's a look at it right there
this has an SPF 30 in it and it's also
supposed to just be really good for your
lips in you know cold weather when they
might get chapped and also hot weather
where they might get sunburned and still
really dried out so it's very
moisturizing it has a really nice scent
that kind of has a vanilla it kind of
reminds me of vanilla another really
cool thing that I recently tried from
the elf studio line is this matte lip
color and the one I really like is
called T rose and so just to show you
this is kind of like a jumbo lip pencil
only instead of being a pencil it's more
so in that twist up automatic just kind
of a dusty pink you know it's a softer
more on the neutral side of pink which I
enjoyed and so that's what I have on my
lips right now I put on that balm first
because it kind of moisturized then I
put on this for the color and then
there's a third step to my little lip
cocktail I got going on here and it's a
gloss that is
great it's from rimmel and it is the
stay glossy and this says up to six
hours last and shine lip gloss and this
shade I'm gonna have to look up the
shade because I took off the little
label and so it's not on the packaging
exactly what shade this is neutral pink
with some metallic not overly pink but
it just really coordinates with that umm
matte lip color really well so um this
does stay on very nicely and one thing I
noticed is I'll put my lip stuff on and
then I'll go to work and all sit in
front of my computer and I'm reading
over scripts for the newscast and I'll
have a cup of coffee there it's kind of
like a travel mug and I always notice my
lip stuff coming off on that I don't
know why I don't just wait till right
before the newscast to do my lips but I
just it's just a thing I just have to
see you know how the whole blood comes
together when I'm getting ready and I
found that this oddly enough did not
transfer very much on to my cup I mean
it did a little bit there's a little bit
of it there but not nearly like some
other things I've tried and I find this
actually starts to feel better on your
lips the longer you wear it it's very
weird it's the opposite really of what a
lot of lip colors are where they look
great when you first put them on and
they start kind of just getting pili and
just weird on your lips this really you
kind of feel like it's got it's very
smooth it's not sticky at all and it
creates almost like this barrier feeling
I mean you feel like it's kind of
holding in that moisture to your lips
but it's not gooping outside your lip
line and gooping like that term and it's
just I mean it the more you press your
lips together the more it just feels
like it's becoming one with your lips
and it's not one of those super long
wearers where it's like you know
covergirl outlast where it's on there
and it's on there till you take it off
this will come off I mean it's not it's
not the longest of the long wearing but
I'm just saying for a gloss this wears
surprisingly well and is so comfortable
on the lips next thing I'd like to talk
about is bronzers and I've been getting
so much good out of my laura geller
bronson brighten and earlier this month
i actually finally hit pan on this
product and the pan
is actually a terracotta tile that these
are literally baked on and you can kind
of see it there through that you know
that's kind of the outer edge of it but
I just had one of these little guys that
came with the what was it baked
beginnings or baked basics something
like that it came in a little kit you
got this balance and brighten and a
blush and brighten and that's when I
really fell in love with you know the
these particular products from laura
geller and I've used the bronze and
brightens so much it's such a pretty
shape when these colors there's tons of
pink medium bronze and dark bronze and
you get a really nice you know bronzer
she's not maybe 100 percent matte but I
definitely wouldn't call it a highly
shimmery bronzer so I went I repurchase
this in the full-size which I'm sure is
gonna take me ages to get through but
I've loved this so much and I've just
been using it as kind of that first
bronzer step and then I may go in and
contour with some other products but
that is just a great way to perk up your
skin toning I know I've mentioned a
product that I think I talked about this
in a hall the my sculpted face kit this
is from it cosmetics and it's a palette
basically of contouring colors and I
will be reviewing this soon so I wanted
to leave that for a separate video since
I'm going to do kind of a demonstration
of it but a brush through using this
palette some more a brush in my
collection has emerged as being really
good for contouring and it's from Sigma
and it's from the premium kit and it's
labeled as the SS 165 I don't have the
new labeling on this but it looks kind
of like a smallish sort of egg-shaped
brush and this worked really well with
this palette in terms of because they
talked about contouring the nose a
little bit and so this is very easy to
do with that or if you're just looking
to get powder in any sort of precise
area you know if you want a little more
brightness right over here even for
highlighting I found this was great for
just getting those small areas that you
know are a little more defined or you
want a little more control than you
might have even with a blush brush now
an extra little highlighting step that I
think has been really fun is this elf
radiance enhancer and this is like a pin
so it's gonna come out it's bigger than
the hyper shine lip glosses it's more
the size of like a Stila lip glaze but
anyway it's called radiance enhancer the
shade I have is called spotlight and
this comes off as being kind of like
almost oh just a light highlight shade
with a border line maybe a little bit of
a pink tone to it you know it's giving
my hand it's there's no detectable
sparkle in this but it's just the
softest cloth you can use this on the
Cupid's bow down the nose right up in
here anywhere you want a little
highlight corner of the eye area and I
just love the fact that they didn't pack
this with a bunch of shimmer but they've
just created it so you get the softest
pearly effect like the softest highlight
possible and using this cream product
it's really easy you know you can just
press it into the skin and you can just
get a nice little finishing step there
to your makeup
shout out to Dollar General brand eye
cream oh yeah this is meant to actually
be sort of a dupe I guess of a Annaleigh
brand I cream I think it was Regenerist
I'm not sure which but it was much more
expensive than this which I bought for
probably six or seven dollars for the
Dollar General brand and this is called
revive eye serum says hydrating
moisturizing rejuvenating and so you
know how sometimes you'll go to the
dollar store and it'll have this and
it'll be like on the packaging it'll say
compared to whatever the brand name is
and it's usually sitting right next door
so I picked this up because I was sort
of wanting to get into using an eye
cream before I put my makeup on I had
eye creams that I use in the evening
time and I've just always thought oh
this is too rich this is too amoliant
this is just too much to be wearing
under my makeup I don't want it to cause
my eye makeup to get you know greasy or
mess watching a lot of makeup artists on
YouTube that recommend really you know
starting things off with that to get
that that area really hydrated this is
what I've been using and I found that
it's just the perfect level of moisture
it absorbs fairly quickly into the skin
you can tell the skin is hydrated but it
has no sort of a tacky residue or
anything like that so it's a great
daytime eye cream if that's what you're
looking for I'm not sure if you can tell
here that this has come
off it actually has a little bit of a
golden look to it which is odd I mean
there's no sparkle involved but you can
tell that there's just maybe a little
bit of a radiance to this to this
product and I just feel like it rubs
right and I kind of just Pat it in kind
of right in here around the eye area not
too close to the I feel like it has
moisturized that area kept it more
hydrated and it hasn't interfered with
my eye makeup whatsoever so Dollar
General Baby last thing is a shout out
to make up artist malli who has I watch
her videos here on YouTube I'll have to
link to her channel below because she's
got some great ideas from just what
she's picked up being a celebrity makeup
artist and one thing she talked about
these are from a brand called gum and
they're called go-betweens and they're
so neat because they are like an itty
bitty mascara wand really and as you can
see the way these these work come like
that you just take the cap off and then
you've got a longer handle and so you
can you know go through your teeth with
these and get them nice and clean but if
you can get really up close and you're
gonna see some mascara residue on this
one from when I used it focus focus
it's a teeny tiny little wand their
tiniest mascara wand ever like I always
was baffled at how small the wand was
let me find it for you on my Maybelline
lash discovery well this little guy
makes lash discovery look like a monster
look that's how small it is and it can
really help you totally comb through
like I feel like sometimes you know I
have one of those spoolie wands for
example for mascara it looks like this
it's just like a typical mascara wand
but if you really want to get through
your lashes and get total separation and
definition you've got to go smaller than
the size of a typical mascara wand and
that would be something like this pack
of like eight when you buy them and so I
just think this has been nice to sort of
separate the lashes get a better mascara
application so thank you very much
Malley for that idea so there you go
guys that's my shopping list ideas for
this month thank you so much for
watching and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
