ideas video so excited to share this
with you today I've got some really
great things to talk about not only for
makeup but for skincare - so um I'm
going to just go ahead and start with
the skin stuff first off a couple of
skincare products that I've been using a
lot lately and by the way this is just
kind of like if you're not familiar with
these videos I do these are kind of like
current favorites or the monthly
favorites it's just everyone calls and
the same thing so I thought I'd call
mine something different so I've been
doing these for a while but yeah just
stuff I've been using a lot lately some
would have had around for a while and
I've just kind of rediscovered and then
other things that I bought new lately a
couple of things that I've been using on
my face a lot lately I know I have been
using a lot of the Olay anti-aging stuff
which I really liked a lot but then I
once I began having sort of an eczema
issue around this I which is not
currently an issue now but I've used I
just really started thinking you know at
least during this period of time I want
to use some stuff that's a really good
for sensitive skin just so I don't
further irritate the problem and I don't
think I did so I think I made the right
choice but I've been using the ultra
calming line from Aveeno I've been using
the moisturizing cream cleanser which is
this right here and I've been using the
ultra calming daily moisturizer with SPF
15 I really have had great success with
all of the Aveeno stuff that I've tried
I think this is a great cleanser I used
I'll use this in the morning like for
example to take off this face of makeup
I'll use my Olay daily facial cleansing
cloths because that just wipes off
everything I get asked a lot about
taking off makeup and what's the best
makeup removal procedure and honestly
those things they come for combo to oily
normal to dry and sensitive skin there's
three different variations there and
they don't irritate my eyes they take
off everything including the eyeliner
and the mascara so that's what I used to
take off makeup but when I wake up in
the morning before I start getting ready
and everything and I do use this ultra
calming it's like a cream cleanser but I
think if you had really oily skin they
also have something that's like a
foaming cleanser
with a pump so that would be a little
bit lighter but I felt like my skin was
having dryness issues so I wanted things
that could be a little more rich and
moisturizing but still be really good
for sensitive skin so a really nice
combination here and this is fragrance
free it's just really gentle and nice so
I like that as a cleanser and then
before I put my makeup on lately pretty
much every time I do my makeup I've been
using this ultra calming daily
moisturizer with SPF 15 so you do get
your sunscreen in there this is oil-free
says hypoallergenic non-comedogenic and
it says clinically proven to visibly
reduce redness and soothe irritated or
sensitive skin
so really really enjoying these products
from Aveeno I think they're fantastic
and I've also got a lip balm that I've
been liking a lot Aveeno has a great lip
balm I hadn't really found it anywhere
but Target lately but it's the Aveeno
essential moisture lip conditioner with
SPF 15 and by the way Tyler does like
tease me about it I'm like well I want
to get some more video stuff because I
just think it's great and a lot of
people had recommended this to me too
like with my video on eczema I did a
while back and a lot of people were like
you need to check that stuff out and I
really hadn't until now so anyway this
is a great lip balm and you know what it
smells just like it reminds me so much
of the way MAC lipsticks smell which is
sort of a semi like it's like a kind of
sweet / Manila ish scent it's just very
like yummy smelling and you wouldn't
expect it but this is so smooth and so
moisturizing and if you're if you got
you know just dry lips or maybe
sunburned lips this has an SPF in it and
it has natural oatmeal and shea butter
in it and it just is very smooth and
very lovely on the lips so I got to
recommend that as a lip balm for your
legs this is something that I have
walked past in the store so much it
wasn't until I started seeing reviews
for this on YouTube that I thought I
needed to try it as well and it's the
Sally Hansen salon airbrush legs it's a
water resistant spray-on
perfect legs it says and it says deep
glows so it's kind of a darker tan color
and this works so well I need to
probably demonstrate this for you
exactly how this works basically this is
a spray and you can spray this right on
your legs and rub it in or spray it in
your hand and then rub it on and it is
honestly like putting on a foundation
almost like a light to medium coverage
foundation on your legs and it's kind of
amazing like if you have some Nicks or
if you have some areas on your legs that
you know you would rather just have like
nice smooth even color or if you've been
using a sunless tanner and it's like
maybe you forgot to exfoliate before you
used it so now it's wearing off kind of
patchy like like ahead in a day where it
was like that and I wanted to wear a
skirt and so I just put this on I was
like wow it looks perfect it's so it
goes on really well it's really easy to
blend in like easier than you would
think and then I managed to go through
the day there was a day when it was
raining and I remember it like getting
this panic to like kind of like I forgot
my purse somewhere so I'm thinking I'm
like oh my gosh it's gonna rain and it's
gonna get all over my legs and ruin this
stuff but it really didn't once you get
in the shower and you you know get some
soap and you kind of start rubbing it
off it will wash away but I don't think
a light amount of rain is gonna really
hurt it I mean I haven't like gone
swimming with this so I can't tell you
how it holds up like if for an afternoon
in the pool I just know that it comes
off on a shower but I like this a lot
and I think this is a great little
safety net to have on days when you
haven't been tanning but maybe you you
want to perk up your legs and they don't
just have deep glow they have other
kinds as well that are lighter than this
so check it out I mean it's worth a try
it's like it's not like dirt cheap
though I mean it's a little more than 10
bucks maybe around 11 or 12 depending on
where you buy it but I think it's pretty
neat I'm pretty impressed with that
actually so good stuff there next up and
this is not for the the timid this
lipstick I'm gonna recommend so don't go
crazy on me don't flip out here but it
is the revlon colorburst lipstick in
fuchsia
it is so bright it is I mean it's really
bright I have it on right now I put my
Aveeno lip balm on which is a great kind
of like lip base and then I put this on
and it is
I mean it's bright and but I really like
it I like it's like a it's got that
those tones of pink but it's it's
vibrant there was a day that I wore this
like I actually didn't have this on
today I wore more of a neutrally colored
lip but then for this video I knew I
wanted to talk about this so I put it on
but the color the pigmentation is so
rich and you do not have to go more than
just a little swipe over your lips and
it's there the garbage man is here I'm
just like they're kind of loud out there
with the truck it's kind of strange to
watch how that all happens okay
anyway focus this lipstick very bright
very good I like the color burst
lipsticks in general and one day I just
thought I'm gonna try this bright lip
and I thought it looked really nice with
a somewhat simple eye but with like a a
winged liner maybe a thicker liner and
then you put this on your lips and just
makes your face pop and so if you do
want to do experiment with the bright
lips I mean I don't feel like it's
overboard right now but I enjoy this
very much
so that's color burst lipstick and
fuchsia that's what the packaging looks
like so you recognize that in the store
so what I lined my lips with it kind of
coordinated with that and that I've been
using quite a bit even if I do lighter
lip looks i kind of blend this out I
like this Coastal Scents lip liner in
pinky it's the bright pink of the whole
bunch there's a lot of neutrals a lot of
dark shades but this is the bright pink
and to do a swatch for you I have the
Sun now and it's just a nice bright pink
and you can put this on alone kind of
blot around on it and lighten it up so
it looks almost like a stain or you
could put a gloss over it and it just
looks like you got pretty pink lip gloss
on but it's nice I mean
don't run into a lot of like really
great pinks in the store like of that
kind of intensity that I enjoy um in the
center of my lip she might noticed a
little bit of a highlight there I've got
a gloss that I'm loving and I like it
alone and on lipstick so that's when you
know it's good but it's the NYX mega
shine lip gloss in beige pearl I got
this not too long ago at my first Ulta
visit and yeah there's not an ulcer
really close to me which really sucks
but you can see what this is it's just a
really pretty light nude shimmer and it
looks awesome
alone I mean if you want that nude lip
with a really reflective kind of quality
to it it can hold up on its own I mean
this isn't like it looks sheer because
it's like basically my skintone there
but it's not like gonna go on your lips
totally clear it's gonna have that nude
color to it and then it's it's
absolutely perfect just for highlighting
the center of your lower lip to really
make your lips look fuller so would
totally recommend that I feel like I'm
this video is running along I feel like
I'm rambling and talking a lot but
that's okay
powder that I'm liking a lot now is
something I tried from Lancome and I
know and it's dual finish powder and my
shade is matte buff too and I've been
wearing this sort of sparingly and it
looks like this it's kind of a square
compact and then you've got your powder
right there kind of boring typical
powder huh but um I'll put on my
foundation and then I kind of like I
feel like this is a really good like
matte powder you could wear it wet I
think but I just blot it over my t-zone
area after I put my foundation on and I
feel like it's good about making the
areas I want to be matte matte and then
I can kind of leave the other parts of
my face open to be a little more glowy
like my cheeks so I'm enjoying this I
think it is especially good for you know
when I'm doing the news and I don't want
any shine whatsoever there are other
powders like I like that Maybelline
powder the
powder pressed powder that they have I
think that's good trying to kind of
mentally compare that to this I mean I
think this lasts a little longer looking
fresh still and so good powder I mean
I'm sure Lots you've already know about
that that's probably been this has been
on the market for a while I'm sure so
I'm not really telling me anything to
new there but another thing I like is
the lip color I had on in my last video
which is the yes to carrots lip tint in
chocolate kiss if you're into neutral
and you like kind of shimmery bronzy
brown this is nice
it looks maybe a little dark there but
if I swatch it for you
it's pretty it's just got a very nice
shimmery quality to it so it's got sort
of a minty scent so it's going to give
you that minty tingle on your lips and I
found mine at Target and finally a set
of eyeliners that I really like from the
drugstore it seems like lately people
have been kind of complaining about how
their L'Oreal hip gel liners are getting
pretty dry and you guys are totally
right I mean mine did the same thing it
just did not hold up a long time it was
great when you started using it and
honestly I got to be honest this is a
product that I've just started using so
I'm not sure how long this is gonna stay
fantastic for me but I love it right now
and it really does seem like a little
different texture than what the L'Oreal
was and it goes on so smooth and it's
from Physicians Formula and I've got the
box still it's the in the shimmer strips
line but these are not like shimmery but
as the custom eye enhancing gel sorry
gel cream eyeliner so it's gel Anna
cream okay but this one's for brown eyes
so they give you a brown a plum and a
black and they're neat because they kind
of detach just like that oh do I have to
drop something once in every video I
just picked it up with my foot that's
great but anyway you know they just kind
of come apart so if your kid is bored in
your car and they don't have blocks to
play with and of your eyeliner and make
them like build something
it's a great idea but anyway these just
twist off then and you can use them what
I was kind of ticked off about was when
I first opened mine this top one was
loose yeah it was loose and so this one
looks a little drier than the rest up on
top the brown does but it's still like
the heart of it right in them you know
in the center it's it's still fine I
mean it all seems nice and creamy but
there's the purple really pretty plum
and what I have on today is the black
and I was able to do a like a cat eye
with it just using the brush they give
you which is like that and I just kind
of use it you know like so and the black
is really rich they're all creamy they
honestly remind me a lot of the Jane be
pure mineral gel eyeliners and I thought
those were great and then up none of my
stores carry Jane anymore so these are
really they really remind me of that
consistency and that was compared a lot
to the Mac fluidline
none is it whatever the cream liner is
from Mac I'm sure somebody's got that on
lockdown out there but anyway really
like these liners from Physicians
Formula check them out see what they
have in your eye color because I pretty
much just picked up these because I knew
I wanted purple and I wanted the black
and the brown was just kind of like oh
there's brown so anyways those are my
shopping list ideas for this video hope
you liked them tell me what you're
enjoying right now I always like to get
new ideas and then something else that I
need to go home dry and pick up but
thanks a lot for watching everyone today

anniversary with Tyler so thank you to
