it's a new shopping list ideas videos so
when you see the monthly favorite
somebody was asking me why don't you do
monthly favorites well they were my
shopping list ideas I've just been
calling them that for quite a long time
now so I'm just sticking with it it's
kind of my thing so yeah I'm going to
basically be taking you through some of
my current favorite makeup products not
everything is something like brand new
that I've bought in the past month to go
try but some of the things are things
that I've had in my collection that I am
just like using religiously here
recently so I'm going to take you
through those also quick announcement I
do have a review coming soon on the
Aveeno positively radiant tinted
moisturizer and I just threw it but hey
mini review it can withstand a fall but
it's a really good moisturizer but I'm
going to get there are some important
things like that I need to put out there
about it so I'm going to be doing that
as soon as I can find the time to
actually get video of myself applying it
because I want to show you the kind of
coverage it gives so that will be coming
soon because I have been getting lots of
questions about that ever since I
mentioned it in a recent video you can
kind of get a feel for what the coverage
is like what the appearance of that is
like if you look back at my most recent
gameday tutorial the Tennessee video
that's all in there also when you're
done watching this video if you want to
know anything about the makeup I'm
wearing right now I will have a link
down below directing you to my
dailybooth page that's where I kind of
just map out all the makeup I've used on
a given day post a picture so you can
kind of see what sort of look those
things give so anyway time to get into
my favorite products for this time
period ever since my last video I did
like this I guess number one is the lip
product I have on right now and it is
the NYX jumbo lip pencil in chestnut
and I think I have one of these other
jumbo lip pencils and it wasn't in a
color I really liked
however this color I love so much it's
kind of like a bronzing nude this is
what it looks like there and to swatch
it you can see it's just yeah just a
great little bronzing nude shade a
little bit metallic but it really even
for being a pencil like this it's super
creamy it more or less feels like a
lipstick but you have a lot more control
because it is in this pencil form and I
wouldn't get a lot more of these like we
all love the Jumbo eye pencils but these
jumbo lip pencils need to be getting
some love too because they are just so
easy to pull out and put on and you feel
like you're getting a little more
definition because it is like I said you
know smaller tip than a tube of lipstick
but you put it on feels good it's not
overly sticky or anything like that
feels really nice and creamy on so love
that another lip product that I'm liking
lately is from Revlon it's the Super
Lustrous
lipstick ingest enough buff and this is
a cream formula meaning it doesn't have
any shimmer in it and it's kind of like
a peachy yellowy under toned nude
lipstick and it's somewhat sheer and
it's relatively creamy it's not the most
like super long wearing thing ever but
it's right there and it's really pretty
umm I have a lot of nude lipsticks and
this is probably one of my favorite on
my lips because it takes my lips natural
color which is sort of BAE
I don't know sort of a mom's tone I
don't really have like bright pink lips
without product on them you know they're
just kind of dull looking I guess you'd
say and this just seems to work with the
natural color of my lips to bring them
out a little bit kind of sheer very
creamy but it looks kind of like that
and like I said there's no shimmer in
this so if you're kind of anti shimmer
don't like a whole lot of that on your
lips you might like that lipstick and
the Super Lustrous lipsticks are not
pricey the tube looks like that so good
deal there also
this is something
that's kind of temporary if you're you
know down the road you're watching this
video this may not still be available
but right now I hope you will check your
Target store and check kind of like the
ends of the aisles where sometimes they
have some discounted stuff because all
that elf back-to-school stuff
not too long ago I did a video about
okay yeah they're selling specially
packaged limited-edition elf
back-to-school items
well now I'm finding a lot of that stuff
turning up in the discount aisle and
this went from a dollar to 70 cents and
I actually love this color it is
paradise pink even though it looks like
kind of a light like golden peachy color
this is a really gorgeous lip gloss and
I wanted to let you know about that but
also just kind of in general like I said
keep an eye out in your Target stores
for some of that stuff that's gotten
marked down because there are kits you
know there are different sets of lip
glosses like three lip glosses and those
will be marked down from you know three
dollars to quite a bit less so there's
that pretty gloss right there it's it's
really pretty it's peachy its golden and
shimmery and like I said this is a
limited edition back-to-school color but
I think there's a shape called candle
light that is somewhat similar to this
maybe not quite as light as this is but
still I mean just check your stores for
that see what's available
next up a exciting development on the
EOS evolution of smooth lip balm front I
have all the other flavors I have summer
fruit the melon the lemon and I really
like those lemon right now is my
favorite but guess what it's getting
some competition and this is the sweet
mint that I finally found not too long
ago at my Ulta store and so this is kind
of like in a light bluish green
container and once again in case you
haven't seen these yet you twist off the
top and you've got your product here you
just like put it right on you don't even
have to like do anything special with
your lips just like alright and you're
good it smells just like if you've ever
had the Orbitz sweet mint gum I really
like that flavor it's just like that I
mean
minty it is sweet it is absolutely the
the name fits this product to a tee so
if you want to know where that is I mean
you can also go to the website I believe
it's evolution of smooth calm pretty
sure I'll have to confirm that and put
it down below um but this is great and
you can look it up there or like I said
I found it randomly just sold singularly
by the checkout at my nearest Ulta okay
time for a high-end product a lip gloss
that I heard kind of talked up here and
there on YouTube and I just thought I
think I can use this in a lot of
different ways so I want to try it out
and it is the dazzle blast in sugar rim
this is so pretty
I mean you're looking at it up close and
it's like it looks just kind of frosty
and light and a little bit pinky a
little bit peachy maybe but this really
has a lot of dimension to it and I can
honestly say with all the lip glosses i
have this is unlike any other gloss that
i have because as i swatch it for you
here you can see that the sparkle in it
it's not just gold it's not just like
silver it is like a multi-faceted look
there you can see it alongside these
other glosses and it's like okay normal
normal normal hello you have it like you
could top off any lipstick and put this
on it and you know it just looks really
dazzling and worn alone even though you
might think oh that's not gonna look
like anything alone on my lips no it
really has a gorgeous shine just like
you're seeing there so I really like
that lip it's a dazzle glass for a Mac
so one of the few Mac lip glosses that I
have stuff want to mention a product
from a store that is really not known as
your typical makeup store have you been
to a store called the icing it's kind of
like a another version of a Claire's
store and Claire's and I have this too
but I was most recently at in icing so
that's where I found it but it is the
shimmering bronzing powder and I am
actually quite quite pleased with this
look at this beautiful array of shades
here to make up this one
bronzor now you flip this top up and
it's kind of packaged like a lot of
Physicians Formula stuff there's a brush
under there a brush that really I don't
like but it's there nonetheless but what
I like about this powder is sometimes
with a lot of these you know cheaper
products and this was maybe like a four
or five dollar product it's really
shimmery and sometimes I fear that I'm
gonna stick a brush into it BAM and then
it's like the powder just goes
everywhere it's like it's really loosely
you know packed in but this is really
nice because as you can see with my
brush here you can get some on your
brush you've clearly got product on your
brush but you're not getting it all over
and this is just a really pretty bronzy
highlight and it's just nice because
some highlights you have come off with
this really like stark kind of frankly
white silver appearance and this has a
nice bronzy tone to it so I thought what
a nice kind of product as we head into
fall you still want to glow you still
want to have a nice highlight there and
like I put it right here on top of my
cheekbones it really gives you a glow
but it's not over-the-top glitter as you
can see there's just some nice shimmer
there if I were to run my finger all
over it you get kind of this pretty
golden a bronze look so definitely like
this if you're browsing through your
icing and you're thinking and none of
this stuff looks worthwhile this is
actually pretty good and a lot of the
eyeshadows that I've tried I can't speak
to everything but there have been some
like Claire's eyeshadows I've tried that
have been really good so just something
to think about you
I just ran my fingers accidentally all
over all that you've lost my head of my
time to wipe that off um I'm gonna talk
about some I products here in a second
um an eyebrow product okay
I've gone through a few eyebrows things
I know people want a video at least a
few of you have asked for something kind
of going through what I do with my
eyebrows first off I don't do a lot I
guess I will do that video but for now a
product that I am so so glad I
it's the maybelline define a brow brow
liner type thing here my shade is dark
brown and just to try to keep this in a
nutshell on this product I love this
love it absolutely wonderful um what is
the issue that we run into sometimes
with these mechanical liners by
mechanical I mean like let me pull one
out here I'm not talking about the kind
of pencils we sharpen with the pencil
sharpener but more like one of and I
can't put my hands on it but I'm talking
about like these types of liners see the
twists up they come straight out of
plastic and whatever look at for example
this tip look how rounded that is when I
first bought this okay when you first
buy these kind of liners the tip has
been formed into this wonderful point
that you will never get back you know
what I'm talking about the way those
tips they don't look like that when you
first buy them they are whittled down to
a nice little point and after a few uses
it's great and then eventually it gets
to a wider point if you want a wider
point that's fine I don't want that
though on my eyebrows I want the finest
point possible so I can actually get
those thin thin hair light strokes in
areas where I fill in just a little bit
on the inner part here and I fill in for
a little scar that I have right over
there now
where this product is different is can
you see how it like gets narrower and
narrower as you get to the part where
the liner actually comes out this is
tiny guys to compare it to just an
average liner that I just pulled out
here look at these two you look at the
width and the size of the tip there this
maintains a very very small size and
therefore when you're going through and
doing your little hairlike strokes that
you know every magazine says make it
thin and like hair like strokes you get
a very fine fine
I just do it so I can see it you know
you're getting really really superfine
strokes and so if I'm gonna go in here
and start filling in my brow I feel like
I can do that so easily this dark brown
is great for brunettes I'm sure there's
a blonde shade too though and it's just
I'm so glad that I've come up with
something that is a fine pencil that is
just so darn skinny and it also comes
with this little Brook comb here too so
say after you put some gel on and you're
kind of trying to get them set for the
day you know you can comb through them
so this is great this is a really really
good brow product one of the finest
pencils that I've found and it's always
gonna be that way because it's always
gonna come out of that one little area
staying as skinny and thin as it is when
you buy it so I love that great uhm a
mascara I love which I mention a lot but
I just have been really really grateful
for it lately and I'm not sure why
because I always use it I guess I ran
out recently and somewhat recently
purchased it but it's the Maybelline
lash discovery the mini brush mascara
the brush is tiny teensy tiny and it's
just perfect for lower lashes I use it
exclusively for my lower lashes and it
defines them all it doesn't give them
clumpy and it's just a wonderful way to
get you know a little bit of darkness
there if you're a blonde and you just
want your lashes darkened on the lowers
and you don't want them to be thick and
spidery what a great way to do that so
loving that mascara on my top lashes I'm
coming back to the original voluminous
mascara and loving that so much this and
the L'Oreal double extend on top of it
that's a great combo I'm not saying you
have to go out and buy both obviously
you don't have to go out and buy
anything I'm talking about here but just
something I've been doing lately it's
putting this on getting tons of
thickness and then topping it off with
the black coat of the regular L'Oreal
double ups tan looks really great I say
double extend by the way I'm talking
about this one I want to make sure you
know
using that with the beauty tubes which
I'm not so much a fan of just just this
regular one very lengthening very nice
next up I shadow quad that I'm loving
lately I've been using The Naked palette
a lot that's actually what I use to get
this look today but as far as a great
neutral palette that I'm surprised I
haven't tried until just a couple weeks
ago and by the way I have all of the
Maybelline stylish smoke squads tried
them all and this is my favorite
although I do have some reviews or some
tutorials coming on those natural smokes
is pretty outstanding in terms of how
pigmented each of these colors really
are I like that your darkest shade is a
matte shade there's a black sparkly
shade and a couple of those that's just
not doing it for me but this that's a a
creamy Brown that is fantastic the white
very creamy those two together could be
great but then you come in with these
couple of shades that are somewhat like
metallic the shade and this shade is
really gorgeous so yeah these colors are
very good quality and they do kind of
carry over kind of remind me of some of
the Naked palette shades but this is a
great kind of daily palette it can give
you a very smoky look or a very natural
look all depends on what you want to do
with it but for only four colors in a
palette that's pretty versatile so
wanted to mention that and that is it
guys that's up my favorites I went
through like one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven or so
products there so hopefully that gives
you something to think about pretty much
all of them but I think one were
drugstore type items so let me know what
things you're enjoying if you like or
don't like any of the things that I've
mentioned please mention that down below
so people can kind of get a second third
and fourth and whatever opinion of it
because honestly you know that's what I
think becomes really beneficial for
people is you know okay I'm gonna bring
up this product but if you guys want to
weigh in on it too and chime in on how
it works for you so you have
the skin type or you've had this or that
experience that's great so thank you so
much for watching
so enjoy doing these videos for you guys
and really love getting your feedback so
thanks a lot and have a great day I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
