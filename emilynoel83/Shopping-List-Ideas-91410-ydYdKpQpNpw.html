it's a new shopping list ideas videos so
when you see the monthly favorites
somebody was asking me why don't you do
monthly favorites well they were my
shopping list ideas I've just been
calling them that for quite a long time
now so I'm just sticking with it it's
kind of my thing so yeah I'm going to
basically be taking you through some of
my current favorite makeup products not
everything is something like brand new
that I've bought in the past month to go
try but some of the things are things
that I've had in my collection that I am
just like using religiously he recently
so i'm going to take you through those
also quick announcement I do have a
review coming soon on the aveeno
positively radiant tinted moisturizer
and I just threw it but hey mini review
it can withstand a fall but it's a
really good moisturizer but I'm going to
get there are some important things like
that i need to put out there about it so
i'm going to be doing that as soon as I
can find the time to actually get video
of myself applying it because I want to
show you the kind of coverage it gives
so that will be coming soon because I
have been getting lots of questions
about that ever since I mentioned it in
a recent video you can kind of get a
feel for what the coverage is like what
the appearance of that is like if you
look back at my most recent gameday
tutorial the tennessee video that's all
in there also when you're done watching
this video if you want to know anything
about the makeup i'm wearing right now I
will have a link down below directing
you to my dailybooth page that's where I
kind of just map out all the makeup I've
used on a given day post a picture so
you can kind of see what sort of look
those things give so anyway time to get
into my favorite products for this time
period ever since my last video I did
like this I guess number one is the lip
product i have on right now and it is
the NYX jumbo
lip pencil in chestnut and I think I
have one of these other jumbo lip
pencils and it wasn't a color i really
liked however this color I love so much
it's kind of like a bronzing nude this
is what it looks like there and to
swatch it you can see it's just yeah
just a great little bronty nude shade a
little bit metallic but it really even
for being a pencil like this it's super
creamy it more or less feels like a
lipstick but you have a lot more control
because it is in this pencil form and
I'm going to get a lot more of these
like we all love the jimbo I pencils but
these jumbo lip pencils need to be
getting some love too because they are
just so easy to pull out and put on and
you feel like you're getting a little
more definition because it is like I
said you know smaller tip than a tube of
lipstick but you put it on feels good
it's not overly sticky or anything like
that feels really nice and creamy on so
love that another lip product that I'm
liking lately is from Revlon it's the
super lustrous lipstick in just enough
buff and this is a cream formula meaning
it doesn't have any shimmer in it and
it's kind of like a peachy yellowy
undertone nude lipstick and it's
somewhat sheer and it's relatively
creamy it's not the most like super long
wearing thing ever but it's right there
and it's really pretty um I have a lot
of nude lipsticks and this is probably
one of my favorite on my lips because it
takes my lips natural color which is
sort of Bay I don't know sort of a mob
stone I don't really have like bright
pink lips without product on them you
know they're just kind of dull looking I
guess you'd say and this just seems to
work with the natural color my lips to
bring them out a little bit kind of
sheer very creamy but it looks kind of
like that and like I said there's no
shimmer in this so if you're kind of
anti shimmer don't like a whole lot of
that on your lips you might like that
lipstick and the super lustrous
lipsticks are not pricey the tube looks
like that so good deal there also on
this is
something that's kind of temporary if
you're you know down the road you're
watching this video this may not still
be available but right now I hope you
will check your target store and check
kind of like the ends of the aisles
where sometimes they have some
discounted stuff because all that elf
back to school stuff not too long ago I
did a video about okay yeah they're
selling specially packaged limited
edition elf back-to-school items well
now I'm finding a lot of that stuff
turning up in the discount aisle and
this went from a dollar to 70 cents and
I actually love this color it is
paradise pink even though it looks like
kind of a light light golden peachy
color this is a really gorgeous lip
gloss and I wanted to let you know about
that but also just kind of in general
like I said keep an eye out in your
target stores for some of that stuff
that's gotten marked down because there
are kits you know there are different
sets of lip glosses like three lip
glosses and those will be marked down
from you know three dollars to quite a
bit less so there's that pretty gloss
right there it's it's really pretty it's
peachy it's golden and shimmery and like
I said this is a limited edition back to
school color but I think there's a shade
called candle light that is somewhat
similar to this maybe not quite as light
as this is but still I mean just check
your stores for that see what's
available next up a exciting development
on the EOS evolution of smooth lip balm
front I have all the other flavors I
have summer fruit the melon the lemon
and I really like the lemon right now is
my favorite but guess what it's getting
some competition and this is the sweet
mint that i finally found not too long
ago at my Ulta store and so this is kind
of like in a light bluish green
container and once again if case you
haven't seen these yet you twist off the
top and you've got your product here you
just like put it right on you don't even
have to like do anything special with
your lips just like aren't and you're
good and it smells just like if you've
ever had the orbit sweet mint gum I
really like that flavor it's just like
that
it is minty it is sweet it is absolutely
the the name fits this product to a tee
so if you want to know where that is I
mean you can also go to the website i
believe its evolution of smooth calm
pretty sure i'll have to confirm that
and put it down below um but this is
great and you can look it up there or
like I said I found it randomly just
sold singularly by the checkout at my
nearest ulta okay time for a high-end
product a lip gloss that I heard kind of
topped up here and there on YouTube and
I just thought I think I can use this in
a lot of different ways so I want to try
it out and it is the dazzle s in sugar
rimmed this is so pretty I mean you're
looking at it up close and it's like it
looks just kind of frosty and light and
a little bit pinky a little bit peachy
maybe but um this really has a lot of
dimension to it and I can honestly say
with all the lip glosses I have this is
unlike any other gloss that I have
because as ice watch it for you here you
can see that the sparkle in it it's not
just gold it's not just like silver it
is like a multi-faceted look there you
can see it alongside these other glosses
and it's like okay normal normal normal
hello you have it like you could top off
any lipstick and put this on it and you
know it just looks really dazzling and
worn alone even though you might think
oh that's not gonna look like anything
alone on my lips no it really has a
gorgeous shine just like you're seeing
there so um I really like that lip it's
a dazzleglass for amex so one of the few
Mac lip glosses that I hacked up want to
mention a product from a store that is
really not known as your typical makeup
store have you been to a store called
the icing it's kind of like a another
version of a Claire's store and Claire's
may have this too but I was most
recently at an icing so that's where I
found it but it is the shimmering
bronzing powder and I am actually quite
quite pleased with this look at this
beautiful array of shades here to make
up this one
answer now you flip this top up and it's
kind of packaged like a lot of
physicians formula stuff there's a brush
under there a brush that really I don't
like but it's there nonetheless but what
I like about this powder is sometimes
with a lot of these you know cheaper
products and this was maybe like a four
or five dollar products um it's really
shimmery and sometimes I fear that I'm
going to stick a brush into it BAM and
then it's like the powder just goes
everywhere it's like it's really loosely
you know packed in but this is really
nice because as you can see with my
brush here you can get some on your
brush you've clearly got product on your
brush but you're not getting it all over
and this is just a really pretty bronzy
highlight and it's just nice because
some highlights you have come off with
this really like stark kind of prank Lee
white silver appearance and this has a
nice bronzy tone to it so I thought what
a nice kind of product as we head into
fall you still want to glow you still
want to have a nice highlight there and
like I put it right here on top of my
cheekbones it really gives you a glow
but it's not over-the-top glitter as you
can see there's just some nice shimmer
there if I were to run my finger all
over it you get kind of this pretty
golden e bronze look so um definitely
like this if you're browsing through
your icing and you're thinking and none
of this stuff looks worthwhile this is
actually pretty good and a lot of the
eyeshadows that I've tried I can't speak
to everything but there have been some
like Claire's I shadows I've tried that
have been really good so just something
think about you I just ran my fingers
accidentally all over all that you lost
I head of my hand time to wipe that off
um I'm going to talk about some I
products here in a second um an eyebrow
product okay I've gone through a few
eyebrows things and I know people want a
video at least a few of you have asked
for something kind of going through what
I do with my eyebrows first off I don't
do a lot i guess i will do that video
but for now a product that i am so so
glad I
it's the maybelline define a brow brow
liner type thing here my shade is dark
brown and just to try to keep this in a
nutshell on this product I love this
love it absolutely wonderful um what is
the issue that we run into some times
with these mechanical liners by
mechanical I mean like let me pull one
out here I'm not talking about the kind
of pencils we sharpen with the pencil
sharpener but more like one of and I
can't put my hands on it but I'm talking
about like these types of liners see the
twist up they come straight out of
plastic and whatever look at for example
this tip look how rounded that is when i
first bought this okay when you first
buy these kind of liners the tip has
been formed into this wonderful point
that you will never get back you know
what i'm talking about the way those
tips they don't look like that when you
first buy them they are whittled down to
a nice little point and after a few uses
it's great and then eventually it gets
to a wider point if you want a wider
point that's fine i don't want that
though on my eyebrows i want the finest
point possible so i can actually get
those thin thin hairlike strokes in
areas where i fill in just a little bit
on the inner part here and i fill in for
a little scar that I have right over
there now where this product is
different is can you see how it like
gets narrower and narrower as you get to
the part where the liner actually comes
out this is tiny guys to compare it to
just an average liner that I just pulled
out here look at these two you look at
the width and the size of the tip there
this maintains a very very small size
and therefore when you're going through
and doing your little hairlike strokes
that you know every magazine says make
it thin and like hairlike strokes you
get a very fine fine I'm going to try to
do it so I can see it
you know you're getting really really
super fine strokes and so if I'm going
to go in here and start filling in my
brow I feel like I can do that so easily
this dark brown is great for brunettes
I'm sure there's a blonde shade too
though and it's just I'm so glad that
I've come up with something that is a
fine pencil that is just so darn skinny
and it also comes with this little Brook
comb here too so say after you put some
gel on and you're kind of trying to get
them set for the day you know you can
comb through them so this is great this
is a really really good brow product one
of the finest pencils that I've found
and it's always going to be that way
because it's going to come out of that
one little area staying as skinny and
thin as it is when you buy it so I love
that great um a mascara I love which I
mentioned a lot but I just have been
really really grateful for it lately and
i'm not sure why because i always use it
i guess i ran out recently and and
somewhat recently repurchased it but
it's the maybelline lash discovery the
mini brush mascara the brush is tiny
teensy tiny and it's just perfect for
lower lashes I use it exclusively for my
lower lashes and it defines them all it
doesn't get them clumpy and it's just a
wonderful way to get you know a little
bit of darkness there if you're a blonde
and you just want your lashes darkened
on the lowers and you don't want them to
be thick and spidery what a great way to
do that so loving that mascara on my top
lashes I'm coming back to the original
voluminous mascara and loving that so
much this and the l'oreal double extent
on top of it that's a great combo i'm
not saying you have to go out and buy
both obviously you don't have to go out
buy anything i'm talking about here but
just something i've been doing lately is
putting this on getting tons of
thickness and then topping it off with
the black coat of the regular l'oreal
that will extend looks really great i
say double extend by the way i'm talking
about this one I want to make sure
you're not
using that with the beauty tubes which
I'm not so much a fan of just just this
regular one very lengthening very nice
next up eyeshadow quad that I'm loving
lately I've been using the Naked palette
a lot that's actually what I use to get
this look today but as far as a great
neutral palette that I'm surprised I
haven't tried until just a couple weeks
ago and by the way I have all of the
Maybelline stylish smoke squads tried
them all and this is my favorite
although I do have some reviews are some
tutorials coming on those natural smokes
is pretty outstanding in terms of how
pigmented each of these colors really
are I like that your darkest shade is a
matte shade there's a black sparkly
shade and a couple of those that's just
not doing it for me but this that's a a
creamy brown that is fantastic the white
very creamy those two together could be
great but then you come in with these
couple of shades that are somewhat like
metallic the shade and the shade and
it's really gorgeous so yeah these
colors are very good quality and they do
kind of carryover kind of remind me of
some of the Naked palette shades but
this is a great kind of daily palette it
can give you a very smokey look or a
very natural look all depends on what
you want to do with it but for only four
colors in a palette that's pretty
versatile so wanted to mention that and
that is it guys that's up my favorites I
went through like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
11 or so products there so hopefully
that gives you something to think about
pretty much all of them but I think one
were drug store type items so and let me
know what things you're enjoying if you
like or don't like any of the things
that I've mentioned please mention that
down below so people can kind of get a
second third and fourth and whatever
opinion of it because honestly you know
that's what I think becomes really
beneficial for people is you know okay
I'm going to bring up this product but
if you guys want to weigh in on it too
and chime in on how it works for you so
you have a
skin type or you've had this or that
experience that's great so thank you so
much for watching um so enjoy doing
these videos for you guys and really
love getting your feedback so thanks a
lot and have a great day I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
