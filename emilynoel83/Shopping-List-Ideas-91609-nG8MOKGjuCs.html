list ideas video this is sort of like my
current favorite products I think I say
this every time but sometimes they're
new things that I've recently discovered
and sometimes it's just stuff that I've
had in my collection for a while that I
really like her just really been using a
lot lately I mentioned I don't know if
it was on my Twitter or Facebook or
where but I had gotten my hair cut a
little bit and colored this is just a
little shade darker actually than what
my hair was before it's just like one
shade down this is I was dark brown and
now I am brown black so it's really
practically black it's so I love the
shade it's from clairol natural
instincts and it's called ebony mocha
and I really really like it I mean oh my
hair I feel so shiny and healthy when I
get done with that and it's a
semi-permanent color too and mainly eye
color very close to what my natural hair
color is because I'm kind of doing it
for the benefit of giving my hair a
little more texture so I really like it
and it is just a little bit shorter than
it was before my mom cuts my hair she
used to do that for a living them you
know cosmetology related stuff so my
hair is right down here figures i wear a
black shirt you know under what I'm
trying to show my dark hair but it's
just a little bit shorter it's more
layered up so I can get a little more
body you know at the roots but i'm
really liking it so far my style has
kind of gone downhill as the day has
gone on but I'm liking it and I'll have
to show you some more pictures of it
when it's kind of done different ways
and stuff you can do a lot with it I
like the options that this kind of
length gives so anyway let's move on to
the shopping list ideas shall we on the
first thing I'm going to tell you about
is nail polish that I really really like
and I got a lot of questions from my
last couple of review videos i did on
the lash discovery and what else the
smashbox photo finish I primer and the
polish i had on i had a lot of questions
about that and it was from finger paints
and this shade is called shall i
illustrate and this is a really really
soft light pearly pink if you could see
it up close you would see that it has
the it just looks kind of flat there but
it has the slightest kind of pearly tone
to it it's really really pretty and I
like the way these go on two coats is
really good for this kind of nail polish
it's available at sally beauty supply my
only concern this was Martin town when I
got it and so my concern is that it
might have been discontinued so i know
i'm not sure but this is not like the
some crazy sort of shade that you can't
come up with elsewhere but it's just did
a light pearly pink and yeah i really
like it right now i have on its kind of
chipping a little bit already it's from
um gosh i think it's revlon no cranberry
something i don't even know i'll have to
look it up for you but i'm not add too
wild about this as I am this really
really pretty pink shade so that's one
of my ideas just because a lot of you
were giving me good feedback on it and I
like it a lot to another product I want
to tell you about this was mentioned
back in my Smashbox glamorize tutorial
and it's the Smashbox Jet Set waterproof
eyeliner this shade happens to be
midnight blue it's so creamy it's a a
really really long wearing liner this
you can put on your waterline and it
really won't go anywhere like when they
say waterproof it's probably the closest
thing I found like a true waterproof eye
product I like to apply it with my smash
Mont I can't talk I did all my talking
this morning on the news might smash box
number 21 brush has that little bend in
it that makes it really really easy to
use but any kind of small liner brush
would do for this and like i said i love
this shade midnight blue it's really
creamy and when you get that blue shade
if you do use it on your waterline it
really makes the whites of your eyes
look really bright so this is just
really pretty great great quality very
long wearing
and so I would encourage you if you are
getting some smashbox stuff to check out
the jet-set waterproof eye liners
another I product to tell you about it
is the Avon super correlation mascara
this reminds me a lot of covergirl
LashBlast if you watched my avon
tutorial i tutorial you kind of heard me
talk about it and I feel like the
formula is a little bit drier it really
builds upon itself well um I do notice a
real curl to the laughs isn't a really
nice you know the kind of like fan out I
just really like how it works it works
nice alongside false lashes as well
because false lashes of course have that
wonderful you know curve to them and so
the more your regular lashes are curving
right like that you know the better
they're going to mesh so I really like
using this anytime using false eyelashes
just in general even alone this is a
really nice mascara builds you know nice
body to the lashes and length but it
also i do see that curling effect which
i don't see in a lot of mascaras that do
promise curls so yeah really happy with
this Avon super correlation mascara I
have a couple of covergirl eyeshadow
singles to tell you about the first one
is mink it's it's a little bit deeper
than say covergirl champagne that one
has a little more of a whitish look to
it and this has a few more like golden a
tones and I love using this as an
all-over lid shade I have that on right
now and up in the highlight too it's
just really pretty has a nice natural
look if you're looking for something
that it's like ok I want a nice light
shade for my litter my tear duct area
but I want to be able to double that in
some other way you can use it as a
highlight to it's really nice so that is
in mink and it's available yeah it's not
like a discontinued or older shade it's
available now and I just really like
that and it works really great with the
other shade i have on which is forever
fig and this is kind of like it looks a
little feel like it's coming off kind of
purply here it does have a definite
purple tone to it but it also has
kind of a deep um sort of maroon
undertone to it as well it's got little
little bit of sparkle like this is kind
of pearly a little bit of shimmer and
this one has very fine sparkle as well
but it's not like major metallic or
anything like that I used it just kind
of in the crease and I actually blended
a black shade in the extreme corner of
my eye and then I kind of blended this
all over my crease thought it came out
really nice so I'm very happy with this
shade as well so forever fig and mink
from covergirl now a face product and
this is something I've mentioned before
quite a bit but I've been getting
questions hmmm somewhat regularly
recently about bronzers and a good
drugstore bronzer and one that is not
going to make people's faces look like
an oil slick because so many bronzers
seem to have a lot of shimmer with them
as well I can't really stress this
enough that a matte bronzer is great to
have in your collection to just
naturally deepen your skin tone you can
use it as a contour and it's not going
to look like you just coated yourself
with you know glitter and you know it
made your poor stand out more and all
that so that's why i recommend NYC hmmm
excuse me smooth skin bronzing face
powder in 720 a sunny this I believe
Sonny is the only shade that they
actually have in this so um it's I mean
the packaging is kind of plastic II you
know sort of cheap packaging but you're
not paying a lot for this either this is
only a couple of dollars but it's a
really great kind of universal bronze
shade for people and it's not too dark
and it works well I will use this kind
of all over my face with like a big
kabuki brush just to kick my skin tone
up a little bit no shimmer in this this
is not going to add to you know shine on
your face so if you want to continue
your bronze look from summer into fall I
would really suggest a matte bronzer
like this one so that's NYC matte
bronzer in sunny last product I want to
tell you about is from wet and wild and
it is the mega slicks lip gloss and
sinless and this is a prate pink gloss
and you're looking at it now you know
that's kind of a
Barbie pink lickin lip gloss I have it
on right now and I think this is just
I'm really enjoying this as a pink lip
gloss but I do have a definite strategy
for putting it on because you can put it
on thick and I feel like it's almost too
opaque and I mean this is pigmented kind
of thick and you know I don't think you
want to like just liberally put it on
like you might put on some other kinds
of lip glosses so I wanted to show you
take that off what I had on there and
show you how I do it just to get what I
feel like is just the right amount so I
get it on here I take it and instead of
using the side that has the more more of
the product on it I use the back side I
applied on my lower lip just like that
blend it with the upper lip and then
just kind of continue to spread it
around on the upper lip and that I feel
like is a great amount for this to give
you a nice light sheer pink look with a
little more shimmer I feel like this it
does have some really nice shimmery
frosty kind of qualities to it and
sometimes when you use just a light pink
lip gloss it can just feel like it
didn't change your lips very much but
this has enough shimmer to really kind
of make your I don't know it just it
just stands out just the right amount I
feel like so once again use self-control
with us don't put too much on it once
but I really do like that product as
well another really really cheap items
so a lot of good value with what I think
I put in my shopping list ideas today I
believe the Smashbox Jet Set waterproof
liner is what may cost you the most out
of this but again everything I feel is
great quality and I would love to hear
your opinions on it as well so thanks so
much for watching guys have a great day
but it's a lot like the lash lash lash
blast brush only it is curved um this is
a pretty kind of I don't know good I
really really like this um duh why do I
start out my singing man of course I
like these products okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
