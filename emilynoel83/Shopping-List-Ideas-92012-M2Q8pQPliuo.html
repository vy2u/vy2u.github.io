this is gonna be a shopping list ideas
video so all kinds of great current
favorite products things I'm loving
right now I don't know how you guys like
figure out if you're a blogger or a
beauty video maker I don't know how you
decide like what you're gonna put in
your favorites type videos but I have
kind of like a running list sitting by
my desk and I just kind of keep adding
to it as I come up with something new
and this list just got so long I thought
you know should I take something off of
it should i pare it down and then I
thought nope let's just keep it on there
and get it all out start off talking
about something that has absolutely
never been in a favorites video that
I've done I don't think and that is hand
soap and I swear this is a really really
amazing scent this is from Bath and Body
Works and this is that great foaming
soap so you press it down it comes out
as a wonderful thick foam and it is
black cherry Merlot and I think this was
in like a special fall display but the
scent is just amazing it's such a rich
kind of cherry scent I mean you just
want to like keep pumping it out and
keep washing your hands because it
smells so good at least give it a sniff
if you're in the store next time and see
what you think of it next thing is
another product I was kind of lured in
by the scent and this was actually
something Tyler just picked up when he
ran out of his last face wash and it's
the oil-free acne wash in the pink
grapefruit scent from Neutrogena he
might have had it for a couple of weeks
and then one day I kind of like he sat
down beside me and I could smell his
face and I'm like your face smells so
good it's like yeah it's that face wash
and it does smell just juicy and amazing
and the next time I wash my face I went
over and use some and I just loved not
only the scent of course but also the
way it just kind of foamed up but yet it
rinsed off really easily and so this has
become the thing that I'm using now as
well every morning when I go in and wash
my face to kind of start the day I
shower the night before and so when I
get ready for my dad just wash my face
at the sink and I just feel like my skin
has been great since I've been using
this so I figure why not previously been
using the L'Oreal
youth code cleanser which I still have
some of it's in kind of like a it looks
pink and I actually prefer that it's
like this doesn't make my skin feel as
dried out after I you know rinse it off
dry my face I mean it still feels good
so I'm a fan I got a say and it was just
kind of a haphazard thing you know drawn
in by the scent of my husband's face
we're on a roll here with great smell
and stuff let's get to this lip gloss I
instagrammed a picture of this please
follow me on Instagram and Twitter too
to get just random pictures I actually
showed a photo the other day of some
brand new products I'm trying out but
anyway this is from philosophy and this
is the pink frosted animal cracker lip
gloss and I've talked about loving these
lip glosses before I love philosophy and
how accurate they are with their sense
whether it's the shower gels or these
lip glosses I so often am just tickled
over the fact that they smell just like
you know the real thing and I picked
this one up and it's just crazy it's
like it's got the sweetness covered you
know for sure but then it's like I don't
know if there's a little bit of like the
saltiness of the cracker earth or what
it is and I don't think of an animal
crackers being really salty but there's
another tone to this scent that totally
makes you think of food and it's just
absolutely perfect for that frosted
animal cracker scent I hope you guys
know what I'm talking about with those
you know they're like pink and white and
they've got sprinkles on them it's
really kind of a sheer gloss it has just
the lightest pink tone to it for me it
might make my lips a little more pinky
but not by much this is kind of a
layering thing for me that I'll put over
the top of whatever lipstick I'm using
and I'm like oh I can smell that pink
frosted animal cry out my hands smelling
like black cherry Merlot my face
smelling like pink grapefruit and my
lips smell like frosted animal crackers
I don't know if that's a good thing or
not it's probably just gonna make me
hungry all the time to be honest but
anyways umm another lip product that I'm
loving is what I'm wearing right now
it's from Revlon and it is that color
burst lip gloss in rose pearl I always
what I call it rose gold for some reason
it's not really gold at all but
um I showed this and my video on my
favorite Revlon lip products and ever
since that day I have had a lot of
people telling me there oh yeah that's a
favorite of mine too or I went and tried
it because of your video and I love that
color so this is what it is you're
mainly wearing pinks and nudes and now
that it's kind of getting into fall you
want something deeper but not too dark
that's kind of what this is it's got a
gorgeous shine I just love it the
texture is not sticky at all some
brushes to talk about here kind of a
line of brushes that comes from Sigma
that I have been just super impressed
with I've been finding more and more
uses for them and it's the performance
collection and this is actually a
collection of eye brushes that are all
like really precise like as you look at
these you can see these are not big
monstrous eye brushes let's compare to
you know about the size of you know one
of their blending brushes these are all
real tiny so they've got some real
specific uses and one of the things I
remember when I first started trying
Sigma brushes and I had like my first
set the one thing I wanted was something
that was just a little bit smaller in
size like often times I'll use my Sigma
brushes but then I was always going back
to my like little essence of beauty
crease brush something really small and
precise because sometimes and I've said
this before when people complain about
their eyeshadow always looking muddy or
it never looks good or it doesn't turn
out how I hope it will sometimes I think
people are using brushes that are too
big and they're getting out of control
they're not placing the shadow exactly
where they want to put it on their eye
and it's just not looking good so that's
where you know specific maybe smaller
eye brushes can come in and so the ones
you get here you get a smudge brush
which is one of my favorites in the kit
and it reminds me a little bit of the
Sonia Kashuk one only it comes to a kind
of a subtle not quite a point but it
comes to more of a tapered it's one of
my other favorites here oh the liner
brush this is a pointed liner brush I
keep this little cap on it just because
I'm paranoid about anything happening to
this little baby here look how little it
is
it's so small at first I thought too
small
that's too small it's gonna make too
fine of a line I'm just gonna keep going
over it but this is actually perfect
just find it's so easy to maneuver so
that's that's probably my favorite brush
for the gel or you know cream type
liners a couple others that are probably
the ones I go for a lot now are the
shader brush for the lid and the crease
brush these two are just kind of
smallish sized brush and it's a little
bit smaller this is the one that can
kind of be used really easily in your
crease if you want to you know really
work on an outer V let's say and get
that color that deepest color exactly
where you want it you don't have fallout
everywhere and you want it to look
really precise you know you can get that
there and then take your big brush and
blend it out I mean I feel like there's
a place for big brushes but sometimes
people struggle with it and then the
shader brush for the lid is nice as you
can see it's kind of pinched there right
in here so it's a little bit flatter and
this can be really great for just you
know maybe you just want to highlight
the inner part or just get shadow in a
certain place you get a blending brush
which I have not found many uses for I
just feel like when I go do go for a
blending brush that is when I go big
this one's just really small and then
you have one for the it says waterline
lines just a very small kind of stiff
liner brush you could use these in other
ways as well don't feel confined to just
using them how they say and then a tight
line liner brush which is kind of nice
kind of longer bristles about the same
shape as the one I just showed you but
this one you know can go in and if you
really want to get then in between your
lashes and make it easy on yourself I've
got probably four out of these seven
brushes that I have come to use on a
regular basis I really like this set a
lot and I think it's extremely unique I
haven't seen a set come out like this
from any other brands so definitely
loving this discovered blush alert this
is from covergirl and I remember using
this years and years ago and I bought it
again recently and just loved it it's
the instant cheekbones contouring blush
in
purely plumb so it has several shades
I'm wearing it today what's neat about
it is you've got kind of a light
shimmery shade almost like a highlight
your main color of the blush and then
something that's a little bit deeper and
I think it's cool because this caters to
then a lot of different skin tones you
can mix you know if you've got really
fair skin maybe you use you kind of mix
these two shades or if you've got deeper
skin you want more pigment more pop to
the blush you go for the darker too but
I think it's really nice I love the
shade it's got just a little bit of
Sheen and this is just kind of the main
color but kind of a pretty pinky tone
and I've used sort of all three colors
in my blush today and I just like it a
lot I think it's a great color also
quite enjoying my Mally perfect prep
primer this is one of those things that
I kind of got in my collection used it
when I first got it it came in one of
those like today's special value kits
that I think it's kind of like a whipped
cream texture but you put it on your
skin and it just feels so smooth not
greasy at all really gives a nice you
know a texture to the skin and so I
remember enjoying it at first and then
you know in my mode of going around and
then trying a bunch of different things
that kind of got set aside for a Y just
this past weekend finished out this one
as you can see there's very little if
any moment left in the jar now and I've
placed my order for another one a couple
of the reasons why this kind of light
came back to me like why it became sort
of a rediscovered product when I was
doing some weddings earlier in the
spring I used this I have another thing
of it that I was using on all the
peoples makeup I was doing and everybody
commented on just how like wow what is
that you know is that moisturizer what
are you putting on my face and they
commented on how great it felt and then
I noticed on myself using it you can
really take this up under your eye area
and I notice less like if you're dealing
with any sort of fine lines or you just
noticing maybe the early signs of aging
or anything like that I really feel a
difference in that area like putting
makeup over that I feel like the area
just looks a lot smoother
not quite sure I feel like it's the
primer because I mean that's kind of one
factor that you know I somewhat recently
changed texture wise it's very luxurious
feeling it's a really nice pre-announced
the time i repurchased got big size so
hopefully that comes in soon because I
am rediscovered foundation that I'm
liking is the dream smooth mousse from
Maybelline I was just kind of going
through my stuff not too long ago and
thought wow I haven't used that one in
some time and this is basically you know
dream matte mousse is has that kind of
fluffy light texture very matte on the
skin if you have really dry skin it
might get a little patchy on you
sticking to some of those dry areas this
one however is more like a straight-up
cream you know it's got a little more
moisture content I have posted a full
review on this thing a long time ago and
but what kind of gave it a new life for
me was I was using my Sigma f80 with it
which is this flat top foundation brush
just kind of going right into the
product putting it on my face really
thrilled with the finish of it being
something that does not look the least
bit mask alike or too heavy or too much
on the skin yet there's no shimmer or
sparkle or anything on the you know the
other end of the spectrum part of the
GameChanger may have also been the brush
for me I feel like this brush really
delivers even coverage with any
foundation I use when I first got this I
was using it a lot with liquids and I
don't know if I just had a mental thing
like oh you don't use that with anything
but liquids but oh my gosh it's great
with this and this has been great also
with my Revlon Colorstay mousse so if
this brush definitely handles different
textures nicely but it works especially
well with this so that's the foundation
I'm wearing today on the rediscovered
products another thing that I just
really have been getting into lately are
my NYX 10 color eyeshadow palette you
like neutrals I tell you there's a
couple here and I know I've talked about
them before but this is caviar and
bubbles or sometimes in some it's called
caviar champagne and this is just a
great neutral kit great variety of some
light shades and
shades nice deep and dark shades these
Knicks shadows are fantastic
pigmentation too and then there's a
smoky eyes one which I've gotten a lot
of use out as a neutral palette with
lots of gray so this is your classic
smoky eye kit plenty of shades to give
you the exact look you're going for and
then this one I'm really excited to get
some more use out of for fall and this
one's called hope model and it's just
got fantastic shimmery colors and really
deep rich saturated quality of these NYX
shadows is great in some cases you do
get a mix of matte and shimmer except
for that last one I showed you easy to
use but yet enough variety to where you
can go very easily day-to-night make it
natural make it dramatic do it however
you please right guys
was that enough I feel like I just
talked and talked and talked but I've
got a lot of things I feel very
passionately about this time around so
thank you for watching my shopping list
idea if you're all having a great day
and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
