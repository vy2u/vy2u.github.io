good I'm really really tired today I
just did not get enough as much sleep as
I should have I just really sometimes
why I have to go to bed at like 5
o'clock at night so I can get up and go
to work and get ready and everything at
1:30 in the morning it's like oh it can
be hard to fall asleep then you're like
you know your mind's going it's hard to
just make yourself fall asleep and so I
just could not sleep last night and then
of course you wake up and you are just
tired as ever so um feeling a little
groggy today but I really wanted to go
ahead and shoot this video now because
I'm not sure how much time I'm going to
have tomorrow so basically what I'm
going to do is sort of describe some
things some current favorite items that
I have because I feel like you know like
I did the video like certain things you
have for eyes and lips and face and all
that and those are like some standby
products that I really like and enjoy
but um you know I'm always we're always
discovering new things and so I don't
want to feel like I'm leaving people out
of the loop with some things that I'm
really liking because I think you should
know so I better go ahead and start
talking about because I got quite a few
to tell you about so they're just random
things some of them are things that I've
recently bought other things have been
like in my collection for a while I felt
like rediscovered them so the first
thing is my Rimmel exaggerate lipliner
and the color is 57 and it's called
ravish and it's a gorgeous red shade
this is the best red lipliner ever I
love it I have it on right now actually
all I have on is the lip liner and some
just like clear gloss over so this is
it's very true to the color what you see
right now in my lips but it it just
glides on so easy
and I had this on earlier today and you
can tell I mean it hasn't feathered you
know outside the line at all it's really
easy to fill in your whole mouth with
because I know like people who say Oh
take a lip liner and fill in your entire
mouth we'll sell them really pull and
don't glide on you you see in this I
mean all to like you get a little bit of
moisture in it so it's just a really
good lip liner it's from Rimmel and I'm
using that quite a bit right now so I
really like that second thing I really
like is my blistex raspberry lemonade
blast lip balm now this is a new thing I
thought at Walgreens like two weeks ago
and I just thought oh this looks cute I
really got it because I thought the
packaging look so cute
and then um got it back to the car over
and up oh my goodness the smell is so
good and it's like a really strong like
it's really lemony and res I mean they
are right on the money with what this
smells like it is totally raspberry
lemonade and it's just you know there's
no color to it like I mean Tyler put
this on actually I was like you've got
to use this because it's smells good and
it tastes good it has like love flavor
to it and it's just amazing and he's
like oh my god that is really good and
it's got an SPF 15 but I mean let's face
it we're using this for the scent yeah
so it's just really good it's like a
couple bucks so if you see this at
Walgreens and you're thinking you need
another lip balm or you like me and you
absolutely need know what balm you just
are obsessed with it I would go ahead
and get this this is a really really
good find I love that um I made myself a
little list here so I'm going off of it
um look see the Elfa
I can't even my hand track elf mineral
lipstick it's um this is really good I
was pleasantly surprised by this because
I ordered three so I was obviously
hoping it would be good and it turned
out to be good it son comes in this nice
sleek little black tube this shade is
nicely nude so it's a nice you can see
that like blending right in with my skin
as I hold it in front of my face but
it's just a nice nude color I've got a
reddish shade um unless we'll just see
I'll tell you what they are here just a
second okay
here we are okay the other ones I have a
royal red I'll shoot down because I like
all these I would recommend all these
shades here's coming up so um that is
royal red and it's kind of sheer it's
they're very clean e their moisturizing
um like I'm a lot this one is barely
bitten and it's just like a real natural
shade it's like got some Coralie tones
to it but it's also it's like a Corley
red and it's not too intense it's really
natural if you're one of those people
that just wants some color to your lips
but don't want to be like you know why
don't win what stick that would be a
good one the nude one is nice for those
times we do the real dramatic smoky eye
and you want the lips nude it's good for
that that's just moisturizing it feels
good on it feels kind of lip balm ish
scent is not especially a factor with
this if I remember correct I'd win this
for a few days and it's fairly new I
just recently got these but those elf
mineral lipsticks are good if you're
placing your not next elf order I would
suggest checking those out because
they're really good um and they just
feel good on and I like that the color
isn't too overwhelming that
gives you on your lips so check that out
um let's see what else do I have
oh the elf mineral eye shadow this stuff
is great too
oh my gosh it's you know comes in a size
like this um I have the shade is for
example glamorous and it's sort of a
actually let's go ahead and just feel it
like that you could probably get no I
thought it would come the color calm
this is like a gorgeous shimmery pinky
um mauve shade oh man
it's pretty and then it looks great with
socialite which is like a deep grey
purple
oh wow these are these are that have
some sparkle to them some shimmer some
are more sparkly than others but they
blend well they don't have a lot of fall
although you'd have to be careful as
with all loose powder shadows I just I
like them I have like four I mean there
have gotten one at first just to try it
and loved it and so I decided I needed
to order a few more the less time I
ordered elf so that is good stuff and by
the way the lipsticks I want to say
between three and five dollars on the
lipsticks and the eyeshadows from elf
the mineral stuff one last elf mineral
thing is the blush okay this is good
this is really good the ultimate wash in
rose this could not be a prettier blush
shade this is it's kind of intense um
gosh I just kind of want to put some on
real quick just to show you I can find a
decent blush brush here we go
it is so radiant I mean I I think this
would be good on fair skin tones medium
skin tones it's just unique I mean you
get you get great color for what you put
on there and I would just totally
totally recommend that blush and I'm
gonna have to speed this step up now so
if I want to get through my whole list
my other thing oh this was something I
reviewed or I recommended and now that
I've used it a little bit I really do
like it it's the essential tools
double-ended brush I recommended
everybody go to Big Lots and check it
out it's got the brush on this end to
set your concealer put on your creamy
concealer and then set it great great
stuff there and speaking of concealer um
in my video where does it know the video
I did on the anniversary gift and Tyler
got me the Bobbi Brown stuff the
corrector and then the creamy concealer
kit with the concealer on top and the
powder on the bottom oh my god was that
not meant for this brush put the
concealer on with this brush but the
powder on with this brush I'm loving
this I use these like every day again
this is like kind of a salmony color
that you use in the heavy duty parts of
your eye that you really need some
concealing then and then I kind of use
the other part like down around here and
I love it I love that product I'm so
glad you got that for me and then the
last couple things I just wanted to
touch on real quick notice my nails um I
didn't get myself a French manicure
and if you are interested in the colors
I use this has been holding up going
strong for a week now and the colors I
used are from Orly okay and one is the
it's called Beverly Hills French
manicure this is like the the tone on
the you know natural color of your nail
and it's called Beverly Hills plum got
it at CVS and then just their their Orly
French tip again available at CVS around
five dollars apiece and it's a really
good a really good nail polish put a
clear coat over it every day or so if

french tips also check out Julie gee she
