ideas today cyclists current favorite
products that I like and have been using
a lot say the past month or just
somewhat recently thinks that I would
recommend to you and usually I work in
you know sometimes some skincare or some
body products or hair product i didn't
have much besides makeup that stood out
to me as like a real favorite for this
month so i'll be going through all of
that and i'm going to start off by
talking about a primer that i really
like right now and it is the Rimmel
fixin perfect pro primer I know I made a
little note on my beauty broadcast
Facebook page when I found this at
walmart recently and tried it out and I
really do like it I actually like it
better than the original fixin perfect
that one came out in a peachy color this
comes out kind of a creamy white color
and it claims to be a five and one says
smooth resurfaces brightens mattifies
and protects so a lot of claims there it
goes on like that and then as you can
see it gets kind of colorless as you
blend it in texture wise if you're
familiar with laura geller spackle which
is a really popular primer this feels a
lot like spackle to me well it doesn't
feel as tacky as the original fixin
perfect that had that peachy look to it
it is smoother than that but not as
smooth and silky Isaiah Smashbox photo
finish I do feel like it mattifies
somewhat as the claims say here on the
packaging and it does smooth things out
it gives a nice even texture to the skin
wanted to talk about a brush that I'm
really liking right now it's from
coastal scents and it's the 518 brush
she can see I've been using it a lot it
needs to be cleaned but I just really
had to show it to you here um this has
the appearance of like a stippling brush
you know it's kind of got that dual
fiber look to it you know it's it's
thicker down here and then you know the
the bristles are a little more spread
out or not quite as packed as at the top
and you know this is what a normal
stippling brush looks like and you might
apply your foundation just going like
this all over your skin I
like this one because it's um it's
thicker it's more dense and it's shorter
so I feel like I could stipple on
foundation with this or what I've like
doing is just blending it in in kind of
circular motions and I feel like it
gives a really really flawless blend and
it's a nice size I feel like it can get
around the eye area I love this blush
from ritas the Rimmel blush in autumn
catwalk and it says blendable powder
blush and highlighter and so it's like
three colors on this shade the shade on
the far end reminds me a lot of the
Milani mineral shade in my tie it's I
mean if you've been looking for that and
maybe you don't have access to Milani
this is really similar because it's kind
of a matte shade and it's super rich and
pigmented middle shade is kind of like a
little buffer shade you know there's not
much to that shade it's just kind of
peachy a little more closer to skin tone
there and then the end one has just a
little shimmer to it so that could be
like a highlight what I'll usually do is
just if I want to apply this as blush I
just kind of swirl my brush a little
more towards this end and if I want to
use some highlight I use you know the
other it is a beautiful blush i have it
on today I think it's just fantastic on
my lips I've got a really cool product
and I blogged about these not too long
ago but I've really kind of been
gravitating toward one particular jumbo
pencil this is from Milani it's called
lip flash and the shade is called hot
flash and so as you can see on my lips
and I'll swatch it on my hand for you
it's like a red with um gorgeous shimmer
so like I put it on I don't have a gloss
on with this this is a jumbo pencil and
I feel like my lips look just a little
bit shiny so I love that I mean he's so
rich with color like so super dense and
colorful you do not have to try hard at
all this was like one swipe you're not
going over and over your lips I imagine
you know this pencil is gonna last me a
really long time because these we're
really well and you don't have to keep
going over and over something to get
color rediscovered product here
something I used I believe I use this
quite a bit in college I
ma just a mascara Trier you know I tried
all different kinds of new thing comes
out I got to try that one but recently I
went back to L'Oreal double extent which
really is a great lengthening mascara
I'm not talking the beauty tubes I'm
talking classic double extend this one
is the carbon black one end is a
traditional mascara it reminds me a lot
of the l'oreal voluminous brush and
before you put that on you're going to
use the primer and so think about this
as being like l'oreal voluminous carbon
black but longer if you thought
voluminous wasn't lengthening enough for
you try this because this primer helps
lengthen lashes and you top it off with
the black coat and you're all good if
you just watch my last tutorial which
was all tart products and i'm going to
be doing a lot more of those one brand
tutorials for you because it's kind of
it turns into a big review basically but
you saw this tart I couture palette
isn't the packaging awesome this is kind
of like quilted like a little bit
squishy there it snaps and has two four
six eight ten beautiful shadows I have
been using this so much used it today
used it yesterday day before that I know
I might be falling into a rut here but I
can get a lot of looks out of this
palette and it comes with like I said
all the shadows also a double ended
brush which is fantastic you get kind of
a thick crease brush there and this
brush that's good for blending and
packing on the color liner in here to be
honest it's a double-ended liner it has
kind of a bronzy brown and a black and
it's not really my favorite I mean it's
not awful but I'm not in love with this
eyeliner because I think tart has come
out with some better things and they're
definitely better things from some other
brands but they give you that anyway in
with this palette and also a primer that
i've been using more and more and it's
the lifted natural eye primer with
furniture all great neutrals here with
like bronze and topi colors this black i
mean the black transforms the palette if
they didn't have the black i would not
love this near as much because black
instantly gives you versatility it lets
you make the look smokey you know you
can just
do look at these they're just lovely so
there's my shopping list ideas for the
month of August gosh can't believe we're
already through August we're getting
into the fall now I'm excitable you guys
have a great day and thank you so much
for watching I'll talk to you soon hey
