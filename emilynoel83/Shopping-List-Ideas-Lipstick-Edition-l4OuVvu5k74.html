this video I've been asked to do a
another shopping list ideas video and I
was trying to kind of compiled some
things I've been using a lot and one of
them has been lipstick I've just been
using a lot of lipsticks lately and so I
thought why not do a shopping list ideas
video lipstick editions so in case you
happen to be looking for some good
lipsticks in all ranges of color you can
watch this video and maybe get some good
ideas and guess what they're all almost
all of them are really affordable I have
a couple higher end items in this one
but basically you're gonna be able to
get I think what you're looking for at a
price that's gonna work for you as well
so the lipstick I have on today is
called metallic seduction and it's one
of the Rimmel lasting color lipsticks
and this is or is it lasting finish yeah
lasting finish and this is a really
pretty shade because although it might
be coming off a little bit more red than
it really is on my lips here it's
actually kind of a deep shade that has a
little bit of a like a deeper almost
bluish undertone to it so it's not gonna
be like your orange e reddish shade it's
gonna be a little bit deeper with some
burgundy almost plum tones and that's
definitely the word I was looking
looking for through all that but as you
can see I've used this a lot I use this
a lot on the news because I think it
really gives some brightness to the face
and the fact that this not only it's a
deep color but it also has some nice
shimmer and Sheen to it so it doesn't
make your lips look super flat another
one that I use a lot on the news it's a
little bit deeper shade is amber suede
from Mary Kay I've been talking about
this ever since some of my earliest
videos and yeah I think this speaks for
itself how much is used up if you
compare this one to this shade this is
more just your classic a little bit
deeper red it does have a nice little
bit of I won't call it sparkle by any
means but it has just a slight bit of a
I don't I would say maybe pearlescent
finish it's not completely flat I guess
and that's what that shade looks like
it's just gonna be a nice deeper read
which I think makes it a very wearable
read just the fact that it's not super
bright but I
really love that shade if you like Reds
but you don't necessarily want to go the
SuperDuper bright route this is a great
everyday lipstick and sometimes these
darker colors really just make your look
seem a little more polished and just
kind of brighten up your entire face now
if you do want to go more the
traditional red route but you still want
something that's going to be you know a
decent choice for every day if you do
decide to wear red one I've recommended
before is the NYC lipstick in sheer red
and this is the ultra moist lip where I
believe this is a little bit the cheaper
of the two lipstick options that you get
there and you can see this is you know a
pretty pretty nice red another one that
I like this is this is sheer red butt
retro red is even more of a bright red
so just be aware they're both great
colors but retro red is going to be a
little more vibrant than sheer red is
and if I swatch that for you here you
can see how it's a nice nice creamy
finish and it's just a nice wearable red
this would be a little bit brighter than
the Mary Kay Sam persuade that I just
showed you but again it is more along
the lines of a classic red so I'm going
to move into a couple of pink shades
really light sheer pink shades that I
like a lot and one of them is from Mac
and it is an angel and I really like
this pink lipstick I also use this a lot
on Kaylee when she came down and this
was just gorgeous on her but it also
worked on me as well and she kind of has
more of that you know bronzy blonde
highlighted kind of hair and I have the
darker hair but this really is nice for
that nude lip that borders on pink and
these MAC lipsticks smell fantastic I
just love how they kind of smell like
cupcakes or something something kind of
sweet and this shade is just really nice
it's a it's a frost shade and I love the
coverage it gives it's not like you just
put lipstick on and it's so sheer you
can't even tell you know it gives a nice
amount of coverage on the lips if I were
to swatch it for you here you can see
here on my hand hopefully how creamy
that is and how it does have a little
Sheen to it and just the right amount of
pink to keep it looking you know really
fresh and wearable doesn't totally erase
your lips but just gives your lips a
lighter feel great with a smokey eye now
if you just heard all that and said I
don't have access to Mac or I don't like
spending a lot of money on Mac you are
in luck because I found kind of what I
think is a pretty good do for that shade
and it's the Maybelline Color
sensational lipstick in born with it
yeah that shade is pretty similar there
if I were to swatch that for you now
these are great great lipsticks because
they're so nice and moisturizing so you
put them on and your lips are gonna feel
really creamy and very hydrated but
there's that shade there
let me Reese watch the Mac next door to
it so you can kind of see how they stack
up there they are they're so light this
is probably kind of hard to do but you
can see them both right there this is
this is the Maybelline on this side and
this is the Mac on this side so overall
they're extremely similar I don't think
that to the naked eye you can really
tell a difference if there is any
difference in the two of these I believe
it's that the Maybelline might have a
hint more of a peach tone to it than the
Mac does this is more straight up pink a
little bit of peach to it but they're
really very very close okay kind of a
middle-of-the-road shade now sort of a
correlation if you don't like going pink
don't like red but you are hinging more
on neutral tones and maybe you like to
wear a lot of Browns or earthy colors on
your lid a nice peachy coral can be a
nice shade for your lips and this is the
hard candy Painted Lady lipstick in
Krush and you can see how cute these are
packaged it's got the little like ribbon
tail on it really cute design on the
lipstick itself and then you look at the
lip stick there and it's its pinky it's
peachy it's got a nice nice golden
undertone
and that's the shade we're working with
there you can see it has a lot of
reflective qualities to it but
definitely a warm color it's not gonna
go overboard on your lips in terms of
you can see how it catches the light and
it's looking more pink or more gold so
those really really give you a more
radiant complexion overall I think when
you use them now - more nude colors I
really really like this Maybelline its
volume XL seduction plumping lip color
so it's their plumping lipsticks that
they have and this shade is in the nude
okay
so it's kind of a I mean it's it's a
nude shade it's it's got a little bit of
a peachy undertone a little bit of
golden e undertone going on there but
it's still gonna give you some color you
can see that shade right there it's not
it's not going to be so like a like a
concealer you know it's gonna give a
little bit of a deeper tone to your lips
but basically nude lip concept there and
the thing about this is you can really
feel it plumping your lips I know that
sounds strange especially if you've been
one to stay away from lip plumpers
because you didn't like the tingle or
something be aware this will tingle a
little bit so if you don't like that
this might not be for you but if you are
interested in that quality that can sort
of give your lips a little bit of a
plumped up appearance check that one out
from Maybelline they're another good one
from Maybelline and the next last one I
have to share the eighth lipstick I
guess one two three four yep
the eighth one is from L'Oreal and it is
their color riche lipstick in fairest
nude so let's take a look at this one
this is going to be a really really
natural nude shade with a little less I
think if I compare it to this other one
they're actually pretty close this one
seems to have a little more of a glossy
finish to it the Maybelline does and the
L'Oreal is going to be a little bit
lighter it's gonna be it's just a really
seriously a really pretty shade
for a nude lip you can see that there it
has a little bit of a hint of pink in
the in the tone to it once it gets on
your lips it's a type of shade you don't
really have to worry about what you
might be wearing with that or what the
rest of your makeup looks like because
it's just I think a really flattering
nude shade and again that's called
fairest nude from L'Oreal so hopefully
this get got you thinking about
different kind of lipsticks you might be
interested in I tried to keep my price
range kind of varied on these depending
on what you're looking for but I do
think for the most part this stuff is
readily available so if you are in the
market for a new lipstick hope you got
some good ideas thanks for watching guys
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
