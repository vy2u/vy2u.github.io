for this month these are some of my
favorite products that I would totally
recommend to you it's kind of like if
you open up your favorite magazine and
you go to the editors picks you know
favorite products these are some of my
favorites of the month and I didn't
really realize it before shooting this
video but I looked at everything I
pulled together and I thought these are
all a lot of really great basic elements
of a makeup routine you know it's not a
ton of like trendy colors or things like
that but there are a lot of just
standard awesome products that I think
you know anybody could throw into their
routine and really kind of be game
changers for them so that's what I have
to pass along in this video I'm going to
start off talking about a moisturizer
that has been great for me especially
this time of year and I want to say I
think as seasons change you really need
to reassess your moisturizer I think a
lot of people blame foundations for you
know issues with the staying power of
their face makeup and stuff like that
but you also need to look at your
moisturizer because I think that plays a
big role and one that I've been loving
so far this season is the Olay complete
all day moisturizer with sunscreen it's
SPF 15 for combination oily skin I may
have mentioned this a time or two before
but this has just been great for me it's
it provides enough moisture to balance
out the the drier spots on my skin and
the more oily t-zone but yet it never
feels you know overly greasy or anything
like that it's just right like I can
give this product a lot of credit for
having pretty good staying power with
whatever foundation I might choose
summer of course better than others but
I feel like this moisturizer for combo
skin has been wonderful for me and for
the longest time I don't know if this
it's somewhat new that they came up with
an OLE a complete for combo to oily skin
but now that they have what I'm using it
and I really really like it and on the
topic of long wearing foundation Revlon
Colorstay whipped cream makeup I've been
loving this so much I have a full review
on this if you want to check it out my
shade that I wearing this is true beige
and just time and time again I have put
this on in the morning checked out my
makeup you know later in the day maybe I
had to do something later it's really
held up beautifully I'm really thankful
for that
I love the regular color stay this is a
different texture entirely though I feel
like this blends into the skin a little
bit easier it's just got a little bit
more of a softer feel maybe a little bit
more natural looking finish on the skin
like I said check the review for more
information on this but I just really
have been gravitating toward this
especially with the hot weather and I
know it's gonna be hot on a certain day
so I kind of think okay what what
foundation is going to be best to use
today and this is usually the one I go
to when I think it's going to be a real
chore for staying power and it just it's
a beast it can it can take it I love
that one a powder that I've been
reaching for a lot is the Neutrogena
healthy skin pressed powder this is an
SPF 20 product of my shade is light to
medium and it's described as a silky
lightweight formula to minimize shine
and even out skin tone
it says exclusive blend of antioxidants
conditions and smooth skins texture what
I like about this is the amount of
coverage that it does have for being a
powder by the way you do get and the
little top part flips up and there's a
sponge under there but I have been
testing out a lot of the drugstore BB
creams so I can do kind of a
comprehensive BB cream drugstore video
and when I use those I really don't like
to go alone with those especially if
it's a work day and you know you're on
camera you really do want the coverage
so I if I put one of those on I like
pairing it with this those are very
sheer I want a little more coverage I
want to not have shine so I've been
liking this even though I think it's
being sold as a pressed powder the
coverage is really quite nice and I
think it can be a good like powder
foundation product so good for
counteracting shine good for coverage
just a nice solid all-around powder plus
it has an SPF 20 in it okay this thing
is really cool I am like so freaking
excited about this
I've been testing out a lot of different
it cosmetics things lately this is the
bye-bye pores airbrush bronzer so you
might be familiar maybe with the makeup
forever or the elf like HD finishing
powders and they're like a really finely
milled powder the makeup just kind of
that airbrushed even poreless type
finish well this is a bronzer of that
very same kind of texture like it
cosmetics has the bye-bye pores powder
which i think is great and I like using
that too but something about having it
in a bronzer form you can just use this
you could use it as a finishing powder
or use this as a substitute for whatever
normal bronzer you wear it's so
lightweight I just tap a little bit into
the cap I don't know if I can really
demonstrate to you here how it goes on
but it's just I mean it's never patchy
it's never streaky in any way it's just
like a totally even finish but it's a
great bronzer and I think that so many
skin tones could use this because you
can build it up for a little more color
or you can just you know do that really
light dusting I'm wearing this as my
bronzer today and I just love this the
time bronzer is bronzer you know it will
deepen up your skintone maybe you can
contour with it but it's not usually
super multi-purpose I love the fact that
this is something that can be your
bronzer but it also really makes the
skin have a flawless appearance and you
can use it kind of all over dusting or
just in certain areas but I am thrilled
with the this product I just haven't
seen anything like it before
is a real basic here and this is
something I'm ahead in my collection for
a while I was trying to use up something
else that I had and then I recently came
to this this is the Tarte multiply
clinically proven lash enhancing primer
so basically this is going to be a white
product that you put on your lashes
before you put on mascara what I'll
usually do is put this on and to let it
dry like I'll put it on each I do my
brows and then go back and get ready to
put my mascara on this provides so much
extra length to your lashes and I love
the fact that it does not have to be
paired with a Tarte mascara or a
high-end
mascara put on your lash blast put on
your Maybelline falsies or whatever you
know one you happen to like paired with
this it's so much more length it's
really cool you could put on like two
coats of this for even more like this
that's what your ass I don't feel like
this weighs down my lashes I definitely
do curl my lashes first before I put
this on but it just adds so much great
length and I feel like a primer is kind
of cool I know this is high-end and so
it's gonna be a little more expensive
but I also don't feel like I use near as
much of this as I would a mascara
because basically I'm just looking to
give them a quick coating okay I can see
that all my lashes have that white on
them that's the nice thing you can see
that you've got it on every lash because
it is white and then you know you throw
on your mascara and it's like hey
there's the length you know and so it
really really helps I recently posted an
eye tutorial that was pretty deep and
dark and I loved it especially for
certain occasions and a lot of you do
too but then I got a lot of people
saying you know can you do something
really light and natural and I can and I
will and I have but one just quick
product recommendation shout out
something I've been loving always loving
standard great product basic product and
something for especially those of you
who want a light natural eye look is
just the walking on eggshells palette
from Wet n Wild just use this you know I
did pair this with some deeper stuff in
that tutorial I was talking about my
date night eyes but these are all three
excellent colors I will swatch them here
and show you I mean they're wonderful
pigmentation Brown is just right for a
crease shade that's not too terribly
dark you could just use the brown on the
lid and up through the crease and make
it really simple one-step thing but I
like combining it with this kind of
pearly pink and you got a white shade
that can be great around your inner
corner but this Brown is really what
pulls the whole thing together and keeps
it you know a light wearable everyday
easy look all ages kind of things so I
do want to pass that along as my
recommendation this is a go-to many
times for me and then you know you put
on your liner and you got a really
finish pulled together look so love love
love that or my
liquid eyeliners have been concerned
I've been in this mode of just trying to
use up what I have I really haven't
purchased anything new with those in a
while I know I love my Revlon Colorstay
liner in blackest black but I had a
little guy waiting in the wings at the
Wet n Wild mega liner this is the liquid
eye liner the shade is 861 it's just
black and I've been using this and I
really like this too and this is so
inexpensive I think this might have been
like a dollar ninety-nine somewhere in
that ballpark it's a very fine brush and
I mean I've just been using this pretty
much all the time I like using liquid
liner on my upper lash line it's a great
base if you're ever wearing false lashes
it's nice to have a liquid black line
there because then your false lash band
kind of falls right into that and you
don't even see it anymore so this has
been great for that purpose then I might
use a pencil a little bit on the bottom
but I mean well this is not waterproof
it doesn't claim to be water but it's
just good for day to day wear for me I
have no issues with the never looks like
watered down or like the black isn't
truly black it's very rich it's a great
basic and that's why it fits right into
this favorites video with all the other
basic products but it was just
interesting because I didn't really find
myself seeking this out I was just kind
of using it because I have it at first
and now I'm using it because it's a
great quality product things out with a
good basic lipstick from a line of
lipsticks that I really love I think
Revlon first off has the lip product
market on lock now and I love so many
Revlon lip products from the lip butters
to the balm stains to the Super Lustrous
lip glosses and also the color burst
lipsticks I think are really great and
this shade called petal is beautiful
I find it to be a kind of a peach with
just a little bit of shimmer I'm wearing
it today I actually added a little bit
of a pink lip liner but you can
transform this any way you want you can
put more of a gold any gloss over it
it's going to look more like a golden
nude you can pink it up a little bit you
can just you know wear it as is
I think it's great for people who like
wearing that lighter lip but are kind of
feeling like the straight-up nude lip
colors do nothing for your face like if
you're going for pure nude it's got to
be just right for your skin tone to work
and this shade is a little more
Universal I feel like with this peachy
warmth that it has he can work on a lot
of people and it's just beautiful I love
it I love this line of lipsticks I mean
if you want to sort of experiment with
different lipstick shades check out the
revlon colorburst line because they've
got a lot of great great colors but this
is just one for the past month that I've
been using a lot so that's it guys
that's my shopping list ideas with some
great basic products the things we all
really need you know when you think
about it it's fun to let the trendy
colors drift in and out of our makeup
routine but then there are some things
that I think we all know are there to
stay so I would love to hear what those
favorites are of yours and thanks so
much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
