this video um there's no real reason why
he's here he was just sitting on the
couch watching TV when I decided I
needed to do this video's so anyway I'm
sure he'll provide some insight on this
it's a shopping list ideas video but I'm
doing it with a Mother's Day gift idea
theme Tyler have you gotten anything for
your mother yet no one's that is that
coming up that's coming up so this will
be of use to you and others I'm sure as
well so someone had requested you know
why don't you do do something and give
us some some tips so the first thing I
have in this pretty even for a guy I
mean it's solid blue it's actually a bag
from Sephora and this is the Calypso
soul which is a new collection that's
come out this is the blue travel bag
it's the smo it's a small hanging bag is
actually what it is and what it undoes
like this and it has a little hook so
you've got one two three compartments in
it in that neat it's cool and so I mean
that's just a really handy thing for if
you're gonna have summer vacations maybe
coming up or or you know maybe mom is
traveling to your house and then she
gets this it's all nice for her there
there's three pretty good-sized
compartments and what's really neat
about it is that they're clear yes so
you can see in them and it has these
cute little um charms on the like a sea
horse and a starfish on the zipper so
that's a cute little detail there so
anyway pretty neat plus you can put cool
stuff and soon I know and I've stopped
each of these with some of my actual
ideas so I have this and this is another
cool new Sephora thing this is the
Calypso soul on eyeshadow palette and so
it's got adorable little packaging there
Ahmet I mean I just that's what makes
something a nice gift like when it has
really cute packaging and it opens up
and it's this really nice shade of 5 I
shadows
I did this um I use this palette to do a
look on Tyler's sister when she was down
recently and it looks really good didn't
it and because it's got like the reason
why I think it would be a neat mother's
day gift is because you've got like
you're a couple of neutral shades kind
of light of shades in a dark gray you
know kind of standard but then you got a
couple of neat colorful colors of blue
it's sort of a a jade green you can play
around with to it it's just so cute I
think the print is so adorable so that
one with would you consider Tyler just
pocketed it so um another idea if you're
thinking like maybe of getting a makeup
palette for your mom is those coastal
scents hot pots that are so fun you can
get a little container from the coastal
set sense website or of course the elf
ones that are a dollar but this one is
kind of nice and sleek and black and it
holds for so you could pick out any four
of them and then it makes it a little
more personalized right right what
colors you're actually picking out you
know rather than buy something pre-made
you maybe maybe your mom has favorite
colors or colors that she always
complains about like oh I never liked
wearing this color that's in a palette
so you can get your own they're like
around 495 I think a piece and this is
around for four or five bucks so you
know not a bad price to actually make it
customized to what she likes so put that
back in here next is something from
everyday minerals and what isn't it
great when you can find something for
free always great loan telling us free
right I guess one thing if this is a
great so important to me here is so
important to me I found this for free
for you well you know what my mom would
appreciate that my mom likes you know
likes bargains and if I told her I got
her something and got a really good deal
on it I think she'd be happy at least
that's what she tells me to my face
bones all right yeah I mean if
give it as a gift I think it'd be an
awesome thing if you're already buying
something off of the everyday minerals
website keep in mind you could get their
free sample kit of 5 free samples which
that means you have to pick three
foundations you see those how cute their
um three foundations up blush and a
concealer I think you can get there and
so those are all free so if you're
already buying something go ahead and
sign up for the five free samples and
wouldn't that be fun to give to your mom
along with something you'll see in it as
a suggestion i have here in a minute
where these would go alongside really
nicely and plus the fact that she's
getting three foundation shades you
don't have to be right on you can kind
of guess a little bit and and you know
she could blend them or figure out which
one she likes and you couldn't be
opening her up to a great new brand new
makeup so anyways if you do get that I
suggest you you spring for the extra
couple dollars and get this thing it's
an empty container it's like a blending
and it actually has this thing you can
pop off if you wanted to travel with a
mixture you've made but it's nice to
have this big lid these are so tiny can
you imagine fitting a brush in one of
those little let's dream move it well so
you can put it in here and this is just
a nice empty like couple dollar
container and like I said you could mix
your colors put them in there shake them
up and you got him to take with you or
you could just use it like I do I kind
of just use it for the lid so there's
nykeya there um remember this mask I had
on a couple days ago yes I was going on
about how good it smelled and I was
trying to get Tyler to put it on but he
hasn't done it yet imagine that it's
from be luscious and it's a peel-off
mask with lavender and fruit extracts so
it's I think peel-off masks are really
fun because once they Harden I don't
really get hard but they solidify a
little bit for like 10 or 15 minutes you
get to actually peel it off and you
could feel how smooth your skin feels
after you take it off what makes this so
nice and sort of one of those gift ideas
it's how could it smells smell that and
it's right there on your face I mean you
can smell it while you got it on you
don't want something that's totally you
don't unpleasant and and so this is this
is really cool and you can kind of see
some of it that's dried here it's kind
of like this little rubbery clear sorta
that's what it is gonna be like when you
pull it off your face and it's just so
satisfied to pull it off I don't know I
like it and then while you're on that
website I mentioned this in my shopping
list idea video before but it just
screams mother's day to me so I had to
bring it up again and it's the be
luscious blush bouquet in pretty in pink
and it's this really beautiful molded
rose design with multiple shades in
there in that pretty wouldn't you like
to give that to your mom would love to
give that to my mom so nice I just the
color turns out really pretty on your
cheeks too and it's just one of those
things that you open up and you're just
kind of like you know she's probably
thinking oh it's just I'm just gonna see
makeup but then it's like wow it's a
rose okay last little bit of things um
this this last thing I've gotten the end
of my pouch okay I just dump everything
out cuz I didn't zip it note too so okay
the last grouping of things is something
you could give together and it's
different some different stuff um what
am I trying to say no it's a little
grouping of things that you can get to
get a grab bag grab that was exactly the
word I was looking for um these brushes
have the brush guards on them the brush
guards are so inexpensive you can get a
little bunch of them this is one that
gives you the larger sizes you get
multiple sizes because if your mom has
makeup brushes and she's going to travel
with them these are the way to go
especially if you don't have one of
those makeup bags where you can you know
easily store them so Tyler to show how
easy they are to use okay you're going
to slip it down there into it okay see
if he can pull it off pull it up just a
little above perfect see and so you know
just a really neat way that you can you
know give her something that she may be
hasn't seen before chances are she maybe
doesn't know about those and then in
these brush guards I have two brushes i
would like to highly recommend it is the
they're both from everyday minerals they
have just a look in a feel that makes
you think well that's sturdy that's kind
of expensive these are ten dollars a
piece which is not bad for a really nice
high quality brush this one is the flat
top brush so soft thanks i love how soft
it is and then this one is the up the
name of its kind of its like the skunk
lyst optic brush ought to put the name
which is that oh look it up i'll put it
in the sidebar but it's like it's one of
those like stippling brushes but i like
to use it for my blush because it's a
little smaller it's really nice so a
couple really neat brush options so you
could give her the brush guards okay you
give her the two brushes notice maybe
you'll find another brush you like on
there better and this is a really like
from the heart kind of thing some brush
cleaner you can put it like you can make
up a big batch i use on course recipe i
believe i have his recipe in my it's the
brush cleanser you do it yourself it's
in my favorites on my channel page
listen I don't know what's in there but
it's it's really really inexpensive you
can buy or you may have just around the
house all the things you need to make it
you stir it up you get quite a bit out
of it and so like I have some of those
travel bottles and I just put it in
different ones and I'll use
whenever it becomes you know ready for
me but good this is a neat idea to you
get a little spray bottle I put a little
label on there you could put mom or
happy mother's day or something and
basically you can spritz this right on
the brush if you wanted to for a quick
cleaning this isn't a deep clean unless
you wanted to pour this in a little jar
and kind of like switch it around you
could get it even more even more so but
for a quick clean you can also spray it
on at issue and you've got your own
brush wipe that you made so instead of
paying for a big packet of pre-moistened
brush wipes you can make your own brush
cleanser in this nice little travel
friendly bottle and spritz it on huh
Kleenex or whatever and just clean your
brushes off after each use they never
get gum p you know keeps the build-up
off of them and stuff like that so
anyway that would make such a nice
little gift the brush guard the brushes
in the cleaner right that's cool okay
those are the only ideas I have I mean I
could probably come up with more but
those are my best ideas ty would you
have any Mother's Day ideas I do know
that flowers are always good little
flowers and if they live far away you
can just order them deliver I'm ready
that's what we did last time that those
went over pretty pretty huge it was the
faked enthusiasm what's with this
thinking that people maybe aren't as
excited as we think they are I don't
know a cards cards and cards with a nice
message you know don't just go with the
message that comes in the card but write
something yeah um maybe if you live near
your mom you could make her dinner or
take her out to dinner or something like
that no hopefully this gets you thinking
and if you guys have any ideas any great
ideas to I know a lot of mine were
beauty related but leave a comment below
and people could browse that and get
some thoughts so I hope you guys have a
great Mother's Day coming up and a great
week end of the week so thanks so much
for watching have a great day guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
