great day I've got a lap full of
products here because i am going to be
telling you about my favorites or my
shopping list ideas but everything i
have is actually a rediscovered product
so it's nothing brand-new it's nothing
i've recently bought from the store
because i have been over the past month
or so I've been sort of trying to cut
back on new makeup purchases if you can
believe it haha but I I really have and
so I've been trying to kind of look
through my collection and really look at
what I've got and sort of rediscover
some things that I've used a lot in the
past and maybe just kind of set them
aside and need to keep trying and trying
to get though I've been blogging for
like the entire past month on a daily
basis we've called it non-stop November
where every day is new blog post and so
that's also really prompted me to come
up with new blog ideas and look at
everything I have and really just dig in
and by the way my blog it's a really
great like supplement to the YouTube
channel do whole new reviews or more
information or something that goes
beyond what the video does so if you get
a chance its beauty broadcast net and I
would really appreciate it if you
checked it out so let's get started with
these rediscovered products by the way
if you're wondering what's going on with
my shirt here it's it's really funky and
I swear I've been going like this all
day it kind of like it comes down over
your shoulders like that so it's real
like it almost feels like you're wearing
like a blanket over your shoulders
thinks I'm going to talk about
rediscovered products had these for a
long time and I'm so glad I kind of
dough back in and started using them
they are the elf mineral eye shadows and
guys these things are so good a couple
of the shades that I have right now that
i'm loving are called social life which
is kind of like a dark greyish type
really dark and as you can see they're
loose to that i'm going to tell you
about have kind of a little metallic
edge to them and the other one is called
glamorous and it's kind of like a deep
mob eros and I've got them both swatched
right here on my hands so that this one
is the taupe one again is socialite
right
there you can see how reflective it is
it's gorgeous on the lids and then that
one's glamorous and I actually used some
other eyeshadows I'm gonna tell you
about in a minute but I use glamorous to
kind of blend out this area right here I
think it just really warms up and I look
really nicely it's not hard to use loose
shadows and you can use them wet too
which would really give you that foil
the fat got a few others as well but
those are probably like my two most
favorite and other eye shadow things
that is literally one of the first
eyeshadow kits I ever had actually not
this one I've repurchase since then but
like in my early early makeup days
covergirl shimmering sands okay basic
totally basic collection great for the
beginner makeup user or the young makeup
user it's got three really great basic
shades one is sort of like a light light
pearly pink the other is a medium kind
of taupe and then the other is a brown
and even the deepest shade isn't super
dark and I've been like inadvertently
rubbing my hands so I think the swatches
might have come off just a bit but
that's the lightest shade the medium
shade and the deep shade they all have a
little shimmer to them and I am wearing
some of the light shade today a little
bit and some of the deep shade as well
and then I have like a totally different
darker like kind of black color in my
crease for this smokey sort of dramatic
look but um those are just great
especially I mean that light shade is a
phenomenal highlight I've got that on
it's my highlight as well and it just
has so much nice pigmentation and
shimmer to it and I think like if you're
looking to get going with your makeup
collection I think this is a great
standard thing to have in it before you
put your eyeshadow on I know a lot of us
like to use may be some sort of color
base or jumbo pencil actually the way my
routine goes is I will put on some sort
of primer maybe it's NYX HD eyeshadow
base or Urban Decay primer potion or
something and they'll take like a jumbo
pencil or some sort of creamy product
that I think can kind of coordinate with
the colors I'm using and really make
them pop and something I've had in my
collection for a while and I do have a
full blog that I did months and months
ago on these but they're the
double-ended pencil
from Coastal Scents and they come in a
great range of colors you saw me use
these in my last tutorial and I love
them because of a the range of color and
be you know if you put these on you got
your primer on and then maybe you top
them off with a little bit of powder
your look stays really nice throughout
the day I mean I wouldn't probably wear
these on their own but topped with a
shadow you know they're great and they
just really help bring out your shadows
as well for example today I use the sort
of lavender end of this pastel pencil
and that's really highlighting my tear
duct here and then I took a deeper one
and I used it smudged it kind of under
the lower lash line I just watched the
ones i'm holding here for example I've
got this kind of pastel one this one's
great like black and white state also
want to talk about a really cool lip
liner product here and this is a has
been known as like a makeup artist
essential and it is the if your makeup
artist and you think that let me know
but it's wet and wilds lip liner in
brandywine it's number 666 so hope no
demons kind of after me but anyway this
is like a really great neutral lip liner
and you might look at it and think well
maybe that's a little darker you know I
don't worry lipsticks that look like
that wearing it today just as a little
base for the lip color I have on now and
it's just a really fantastic lip liner
to wear with your red looks or to wear
with you know a neutral look if you feel
like gosh I put on nude lipstick
sometimes and they make my lips look
dead will go around your lips with this
and kind of you know fill in on the
sides and maybe leave a little bit there
in the center of your lip your lips are
going to look fuller but it's also going
to sort of bring out your face just a
little bit more if you know what I mean
instead of sucking the life out of your
faces some lip colors do I feel like
this puts life back and I use that a lot
quite a while ago and then I just kind
of got right back into it here lately
using some deeper full lip colors so
love that while I'm on lips another
great thing are the philosophy lip
shines I was all about these like
I don't know couple years ago Mamie and
I was getting then I got gifted some I
have melon daiquiri I have caramel apple
which I'm wearing right now you can see
it's much more sheer but gorgeous smells
amazing cinnamon buns is another great
one and I don't know what happened I
kind of put these in a drawer where I've
got clear glasses which I don't reach
for very often these have just a little
tint to them so they're not even totally
clear but anyway I got back into that
and realize just how much I love them
and I'm definitely asking for more this
Christmas because they're so shiny they
kind of um you feel like even though
they're shiny they do have a little
stickiness to them but that helps them
last you got to sacrifice a little
something I still think they feel good
on the lips and I'm sorry but I think
that looks good I like that look a lot
so I love those philosophy lips shines
and they remind you of their body washes
in that the scents are very realistic to
the name and it's usually like some kind
of great food or baked item you or adult
beverage felon daiquiri I'm sure some of
you've discovered these and might like
them too but they're the maybelline
dream mousse blushes when i have here is
called peach satin and i have a pinky ER
one as well but the texture of these is
so wonderful i mean this has kind of
become the standard that i compare any
mousse cream type blush too because i
think this is just perfect and a lot of
things even high-end things that I've
tried haven't quite measured up but
peach satin is really pretty because it
almost has like a lighter look to it
kind of a highlight feel and you can put
it on already have it on so I don't know
how much this is going to show up but it
gives the skin just a really nice little
glow and it's just effortless to blend
in if you sometimes feel like cream
blushes are too sticky or you feel
really weird putting them on top of a
powder you applied or a bronzer or
something like that this just I mean
it's just light as their they come in
not as wide for ranges I would like but
still you know pick one try it out I
think you'll like him I had a few
compliments thank you on my skin on my
tutorial that I did
the other day and I tried something new
with that and it totally was a
rediscovered product moment when i did
this i used a foundation it was I
believe Neutrogena Healthy Skin and then
I decided that I would see what it
looked like to take that and top it off
with some of my bare minerals foundation
which I haven't used in a long time and
my bare mineral stuff besides my summer
bisque which you guys know I use that to
top my concealer to get you know
flawless under I coverage but as far as
the foundations I really haven't messed
with these in a long time and so I
thought why don't that it look like just
really lightly lightly dusted on top of
the foundation the result was a very
natural looking finish because the
original bare minerals I don't have the
mat haven't tried the mat but the
original is not what I would call a
totally matte matte finish I mean it
just leaves the skin with just that
little bit of glow I've got it on today
same thing same foundation top it with a
little of it like I look maybe a little
more glowing than I do when I might top
a foundation with a super matte powder
so anyway that's just kind of the way
I've rediscovered my bare minerals
foundation I really am NOT a huge fan of
using it all on its own just because I
feel like sometimes coverage wise it's
just not enough for news which is you
know the reason why I'm doing my makeup
five days out of the week is to be in
front of HD cameras so but I do love it
for in this way and I think I'm going to
definitely be doing that a whole lot
more so that pretty much wraps up my
rediscovered products guys this is so
fun I want to do more videos maybe I
just need to have a regular video coming
out every so often with a rediscovered
product this keep a little basket you
know by my makeup area here and i'll
throw in a few things like as i look
through my collection and i'll see a few
things i think man i haven't used that
in a while and i'll put it in this
little basket or some other container
that i have here and then it just
reminds me to pick it up and use it and
that's sometimes all it takes so thank
you so much for watching you have a
wonderful day and I'll see you again
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
