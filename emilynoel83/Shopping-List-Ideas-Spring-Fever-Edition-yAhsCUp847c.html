for this video I was recently asked to
put together a haul video and I thought
well I don't necessarily have enough
stuff to really talk about for a halt
but I thought it would be fun to do a
shopping list ideas video sort of themed
around spring and products that I think
will be really good as we head into the
next season maybe it already kind of
feels like spring where you are maybe
you just hope it's it will move along a
little bit faster but like I said as we
change seasons sometimes that's a fun
opportunity to think about different
makeup products or how you can kind of
transition your look so every item
except for one that I'm going to talk
about in this segment is from the
drugstore and I've got seven yeah I
believe seven things to talk about
first thing I want to mention is a great
coral lip product I've noticed through a
lot of just messages and emails and
comments and stuff you guys are
interested in what a nice coral lip
color being a gloss or lipstick what is
a really good shade for coral lips and
I've got a really affordable option it's
actually the one I have on right now I
love these Jordana pretty shine lip
glosses that you can find at walgreens
um i also got somebody I think tweeted
me the other day and told me that these
are now being sold on cherry culture com
Jordana stuff is so that may be worth a
check there as well this shade is called
delightful and these pretty shine
glosses are really good I think they
have a fantastic texture on the lips and
they're not those like super super sheer
glosses where you put them on it's like
okay my lips are shiny but where's the
color this really does carry a nice
amount of color with it it's got a
little bit of shimmer to it but it's not
over at the top like glittery sparkly
stuff but I have someone now and it's
just a really nice coral tone so if that
is what you're looking for this may be
something to check out usually these
products are sold in the drugstore like
two for three dollars so it's very very
affordable grab yourself a liner or
another gloss or something like that and
I think you'll be really happy with it
another gloss I wanted to mention this
is one that I blogged about it's the
vinyl bronze collection from Rimmel and
you may have noticed these in your
drugstore they have these bronze lids
and I just noticed him like they weren't
even in a special section at my walmart
at all they were just down by the rest
of the vinyl lip gloss which I loved
like I wore them all the time in college
there was a shade called snog I think it
was it was just like kind of a ma vie
pink and I wore it all the time is
coming in college but I just kind of
browsing around the rim old brand not
too long ago I noticed they had three
shades one is a as a light gold one is
sort of a deeper bronze and this is
probably my favorite shade of the three
although I love them all and I've been
wearing them all a lot lately but this J
is called summer nude and this has a
little more of a pinky tone you'll
really be able to get a feel for the
colors if you check my blog I took some
nice pictures of them and the way they
look on my lips each one but yeah I
really like the way these feel on the
lips they have somewhat of a similar
texture to the pretty shine glosses they
have a little bit of a scent that is
it's not bothersome to me at all it's
just sort of a fresh may be borderline
fruity scent but they all kind of smell
the same to me and there's a little bit
of shimmer to them but they are just
really nice if as we head into spring
maybe you're getting a little more of a
tan or you're using more sunless tanning
products or using more bronzers and you
kind of want some lighter lip glosses
that will sort of play off of that look
so any of those three I would totally
recommend again it's the vinyl bronze
mirror shine lipgloss from Rimmel
last lip product I wanted to pass along
I don't know if you guys have noticed
this yet in your drugstore but it's the
Wonder and one hundred percent natural
lip smackers so yeah they've got the
brown tube you know stuff in brown then
you know it's uh it's natural seems like
they always do that they put it in like
beige or brown it's like a natural item
but and these are made with olive oil
beeswax with pure fruit essence aloe and
vitamin E they are gluten free paraben
free and die free and I have I think I
have one in guava and this one is
honeydew melon I think it's my favorite
but it's got a really fresh scent but as
you can see just you know it's not been
colored to look bright green or you know
bright pink or anything like that so um
more of a natural product for those who
are really concerned with that I like
the feel of it i don't know that i
noticed a huge difference in the way
this feels compared with regular lip
smackers but it does feel maybe a little
more moisturizing and maybe a little
more grown-up seeming i don't know it
really doesn't bother me at all to just
use the regular lip smackers but if you
want a more natural product and just to
try something new i think they had
vanilla as a flavor and maybe blackberry
i can't quite remember them all but if
these aren't in your drug store yet they
probably will be soon
now for an eye product and this is
something i reviewed recently did a
whole video on it and there are a couple
more things I wanted to address about
this since I've gotten more questions
and I just totally wanted to throw this
into the mix of products I think would
be great for spring and that is an
eyeliner that you can really count on
not to smudge you may be getting
outdoors more maybe you're sweating a
little bit more you're just kind of
exerting yourself a little bit more in
the outdoors and you want that liner
that's really going to last maybe in the
winter time you have it has as much of
an issue with that but I know as the
weather heats up just but even just a
little bit can affect the staying power
of our makeup so Milania liquify
metallic eyeliner pencil in black these
don't come in a whole lot of shades in
your drugstore but black is I mean it's
not like a metallic black either they
call it metallic eyeliner pencil but
just look straight up black in case you
haven't seen my video on it before it
glides on just so super easily today I
used it just on the like I used liquid
liner on top although this glides on
your upper lashline really well but I
just kind of blended this up right in
here I took I had about 30 30 second
window there where I could smudge it out
but then it gets to where it's kind of
locked in and it's going to stay there
and it even stayed fantastic on my
waterline a couple days ago I was like
wow that really is impressive but it's
so soft goes on really smooth I put it
on here smudged it out and then use like
a powder shadow the rest of the way in
and it's just really really nice but the
question I have been getting is and I
don't know if people have used liners
similar to this and are confused about
sharpening and whether you can sharpen
them this is what i use this little
sharpener i got from the drugstore two
sizes put it in the smaller size of the
two and you just kind of sharpen it
there it doesn't create any problem for
the pencil as you can see there you know
i'm just still able to use that just
like when i bought it so really seems to
work fine I don't notice any kind of
issue there with being able to sharpen
it but I would really recommend it
because as you can see now that it's had
some time to kind of set there on my
hand you rub it it is not going anywhere
great great eyeliner would really really
recommend that to all of you and if you
find some liners tug a little bit on
your eye eye pencils when you use them
this one doesn't really tug at all
gotta give another shout-out to the
blushes i just recently put on my blog
they are gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
blush this one is called on this is the
one of the baked mineral blushes from be
luscious this is the one non drugstore
on item on my shopping list ideas video
but this shade is very swirl i also have
apricot swirl which is more of a light
shimmer that I would use as a highlight
but this blush I tell you what used as a
blush this is really really nice to put
a little on right now I already kind of
have had my makeup done from when I was
at work today a little bit but I mean I
just feel like it gives you the best
blow it's it's it's a pretty pretty deep
mavi pink berry tone laced with
beautiful gold swirls which actually
contain a little bit of sparkle but you
put on your face it's not too much I
wouldn't advise you to like this world
is all over your face keep it on your
cheeks and you're not going to be
overwhelmed with shimmer but these are
nice little compacts too nice maybe gift
idea for someone special in your life
because these are really special
products this is so nice to use I feel
like my face is just very radiant after
I put it on and I don't know I really
feel like I know what I like and I know
what I don't like when it comes to
blushes and I guess all makeup really I
wouldn't probably be doing this channel
but this is a really nice blush and kind
of unique in that I don't see a lot of
of shades out there like this that are
just a little bit you know not your
light pink in your light peach you know
go with something just as a hair deeper
use a really light application only
touch your brush to the product and you
will have enough and then you'll get a
just a tone on your cheeks that's feel
so healthy and so alive I really like it
last makeup product I have to tell you
about is from ELF translucent mattifying
powder from the studio line three
dollars on the website three dollars in
some target stores because elf is at
target at least at my target a lot of
people's hopefully it's coming to your
soon if it's not there yet but comes
with a little sponge it's a translucent
powder helps to really keep the skin mat
then heavily trying this out for them
not like I've been really trying this
out for the best few days here ever
since I got it and I've just been happy
with the finish I don't feel like it
alters the coloring of my makeup but I
do feel like it helps avoid shine and if
shine does come about it kind of
counteracts it's so nice big mirror nice
to keep in your you know your makeup bag
and you know you've got that product
with a nice big mirror to take with you
just a real quick easy no-brainer
product that you can put on without
really thinking about it
finally something I'm so excited about
it is the l'oreal sublime bronze one day
tinted gel it says for a natural
sunkissed look instant tan this is not a
self tanner okay this is something it
lasts one day washes off with soap and
and it's for face and body so you put
all over your body put on your face
before you put your makeup on even
before you put your moisturizer on it's
still going to work for you now I went
light on my moisturizer when I put it on
my face the other day but still works
now you might say well why do I want to
even waste my time with something if I'm
going to put you know put something all
over my body and it's not a sunless
tanner why do I waste my time well
sometimes sunless Tanner's take a little
while to work and if you're like me
sometimes you're not always the most
diligent about using those gradual
Tanner's every single day or maybe you
know you you just don't want to risk it
maybe you got an event going on you
don't really want to risk it with the
all-out sunless tanner on that day you
just want the tan look you want to know
how you're going to look don't want to
wait for any results you will see this
instantly how you look is how you're
going to look you don't have to wait for
any color to develop it is a I'm going
to have to wash my hands after I do this
but I'm going to open it up here and
squirt some out okay it looks pretty
dark here as I've just squirted it out
try to thin it out so you can see more
the consistency this is what it looks
like I blogged about like some stila son
gel but that is pretty much for the face
it's a small tube this is a big
container as i rub it into my hand and
rub it into this hand which i have way
too much product on there right now but
nonetheless i can still rub it in it's
really easy to blend out I feel like I'm
on QVC you know i'm rubbing things into
my hand but you get a nice wash of color
it really is noticeable to like it's a
good noticeable tan it washes right off
you i love the idea that this is face
friendly and it dries fast big big plus
for those of us who like i said you get
in that situation you're rushing around
you're wearing something that's showing
your arms
your legs and you don't have a lot of
time you want to look you know a little
more tan than you are and this has that
sort of transparent gel lyte quality to
where you feel like you can put it over
any skin tone and it's going to just
give you that little boost you need it
dries so fast what I just put on my hand
is now dry completely it'll be on there
till I take my shower you know it's so
great I just really really like this I
really enjoyed a product from do up
called revolution but that was much more
expensive than this and I couldn't even
find it at the Sephora that I go to like
they didn't sell the doo-wop stuff but I
mean this is a product that you're going
to be finding in your drugstore if you
can't fight it in your drugstore check
online you know Google this check
drugstore.com see what you can find but
it is a new product sublime bronze one
day tinted gel it washes off at the end
of the day but you put it on you've got
a nice nice glow so hope you enjoyed
this shopping list ideas video spring
fever edition products it'll take you

seasons and like I said spring is not
