for this special shopping list ideas
video this is all about stocking
stuffers so I believe that makeup is a
really great gift to give people around
the holidays the only problem is unlike
times when you're shopping for yourself
and you know exactly what shade you want
to go toward or what your skin tone is
you know it can be a little more
difficult to shop for makeup related
items for someone else but yet these
small little things that are relatively
inexpensive do make really great gifts
so I'm going to run you through some
different things that you can't feel
totally safe giving to someone else and
they're all kind of makeup beauty
related products and keep in mind that
you could kind of put together a little
basket of these things and make it a
substantial gift in itself down the road
a little bit i am going to talk about
makeup gift ideas that would be like you
know a in itself you know self-contained
gift you can give to someone but these
are just some smaller things that i
really like that yeah you could either
lump together as a big gift or just kind
of give them and develop individually
whether you've got friends um daughters
sisters mothers you name it these would
be some really really nice little things
that they would find in their stockings
but yet really good quality these are
all things that i really recommend so
first thing that i think is a great
stocking stuffer gift is actually these
nails that i have on these are from
nailin and these are probably some of my
favorite natural fake nails that you can
put on yourself they go on with glue and
they are called the nailin so natural
with chip proof technology and the kind
that i'm using is actually it's the
short length square shape and they have
a little bit of different tones to them
these actually have a little bit of a
pinkish tone to them probably isn't
coming through in the package but you
they come in this package you get a
little file and the glue the everything
you would need for this is all contained
in the little kit you can pick it up at
walmart for less than five dollars and
you get a really nice looking manicure
out of it and people will ask you know
did you get those professionally done
and the answer is no
and part of what makes you so great is
that a they're short and I find that
it's very easy to just go ahead and type
or text or do my everyday tasks with
these on but also they come in a variety
of sizes so that's not just what you see
in this little tray there's a whole
separate section up here that has a
bunch of different sizes so you can
definitely find the fit that works the
best and really fit each nail correctly
and when then the fake nail fits your
natural nail right you'll find that they
last a lot longer and they're a lot less
likely to pop off prematurely you know
so that's one great gift that I think
you could give to anyone and it's the
holiday season you know people are
dressing up they're going to parties and
and stuff like that so how fun would
that be to you know getting your
stocking and have a little manicure in a
box basically so that is available at
Walmart and probably most drugstores
another walmart gift um is from hard
candy and I've recommended this before
but it's their little lipsticks that
look so festive because they've got this
little ribbon attached to it and you
might think is just a lipstick but it's
so cute the fact that it has that little
you know really detailed packaging
they're all packaged a little bit
different with the design thats painted
on but yeah I mean it just seems like so
much fun and kind of makes me think of
the holidays when I look at this and you
might be thinking well it's a little
tricky to pick out a shade of lip color
for someone but I think I mean overall
think about like who you're buying for
and what color do they usually wear on
their lips you know you can do a little
research on this kind of you know look
back at pictures of them or maybe just
in talking to them you know they're
opening up their makeup bag oh what's
that shade you're using and then find
something that's a little bit similar in
that family these are really nice
lipsticks to begin with in a great
neutral um kind of pinky gold shade that
I really like is called a crush and it's
the Painted Lady lip color and it's
really moisturizing and just feels
really smooth on your lips but the
packaging is adorable and I think that's
something you can have fun with around
the holidays is cute packaging so think
about that another great gift idea is
from everyday minerals and if you go to
their website they've sort of chain
used how they're doing their little
samples now now they come free with
another purchase and they're already
grouped into little sets that you can
buy like there will be three or maybe
four different like foundation shades in
one general color family or you could
pick three I shadows or three blushes or
face colors or whatever and so it's
really easy to just kind of pick one you
don't have to it's not set up like it
was before where you have the entire
spectrum of things to choose from
because you can can feel a little lost
especially if you're buying for someone
else so if you can get the general color
family or just pick like I said a set of
blushes that would probably work for
anyone or eyeshadows they're so cute and
if you're getting them free with your
order I mean if you are already getting
a foundation for yourself or maybe
buying for another person you know like
the regular full-sized everyday minerals
products don't forget that you can get
it's a five dollar value you know
several of these little little sizes to
give as well so that would be a fun way
you could split them up among different
people or give them all as a set but
just be aware that when you're going to
the website if you place an order you
can get some really great free samples
that are you know a nice amount to be
able to use like if you got a concealer
in this size it I mean I've used these
some of these daily that sunlight
concealer shade is really nice and um
you know it's less to be a really long
time still going on that so another
online product if you're shopping online
on coastal scents and you're thinking
what would be a good gift idea of course
they have great brush sets that would
make a good substantial gift in itself
and this one I'm going to talk about
here really would too but it also kind
of strikes me as a stocking stuffer as
well and it's the hot pots on that come
individually like this they're
individually packaged and they're given
a number like s whatever the number is a
shimmer or M is Matt and you can pick
out whatever shade you want and then you
could also pick up one of these empty
pallets here with the mirror and you
could place those shades in there or
give this what would be really fun for
me if someone were giving this to me I
want them to give me this empty and give
me the shade
and then maybe a few extra shades and I
could pick how I wanted to lay them out
on the palate I think that would be a
really fun gift idea you know pick some
shades that you think go together really
well and you know give them given that
and then need to pick up a few extra fun
colors and let them kind of play with
those or possibly mix them in or swap
them out that's a really kind of
foolproof way to give the gift because
you're kind of putting it in their hands
you know what shades work best and they
can swap them out they can continually
pop these out their magnetic they fit
right into this palette that they give
you it's really nice with the whole
mirror that comes with it too and these
are also really great quality shades you
can pick from that shimmer you know go
with some neutral shades throw in a few
colored options and that would make a
really great gift okay from now until
the end of this video everything I'm
going to mention is available at sally
beauty supply I was actually there today
doing a little bit of christmas shopping
and I picked up some things that I love
myself but I know would be great little
stocking stuffer ideas they're not
necessarily packaged to be like you know
little Christmas sets but you know these
are really great items that you could
feel like wow I'm giving a great gift
one of them that I've mentioned before
but i really love i did a whole blog i
mentioned these and shopping list ideas
before but it's the palladio herbal
tinted lip balms these are so good
they're available for 299 there are so
many great shades so what I'm wearing
right now is cotton candy it's a really
really sheer kind of light pink shade
but a couple of other really foolproof
colors are golden pink and bronzy pink
or there's a shade called Rosie if
you're buying for someone that likes
kind of deeper done Rosie pinkish Reds
on their lips those would be nice but
these are absolutely fantastic quality
if anybody has tried these you know give
a little testimonial down below because
these really are great some of the best
tinted lip pumps I have ever tried for
sure great price and you know if
somebody might find that in their
styling be like oh I got some lip ball
but then you know a couple days down the
road they unwrap it they try it they're
going to be thanking you i guarantee
another great thing around the holidays
to give would be some false
lashes be that person that gives the
false eyelashes in the stocking because
these are going to be really fun to play
with just like the nails I was talking
about around the holidays you want to
kind of perk up your look look extra
festive some false eyelashes would be
really fun you know pick out maybe and
you know sort of a natural set it
depends on who you're buying for if you
know you're buying for somebody that's
used to wearing false eyelashes and
likes to be a little more dramatic by
one of the more dramatic sets you can
even find the ones that have a little
like rhinestones along the lash line or
you know numbers some of the ones that I
think are really natural good for every
day but great to just glam it up a
little bit for a party would be the
number 53 and number 21 there's 21 it's
kind of like covers your full lash line
but they're a little bit shorter they
add a lot of thickness you can see that
there's varying lengths in there really
helps to give you a thicker look and
then 53s are a little more Flair down at
the outer edge so giving you a little
bit more of that cat I'd look almost not
made sure though these are not drastic
if you want to give false lashes to
someone and not worry about them being
too over-the-top these are two numbers
that would be good there the Andrea mod
lash our dell makes wonderful false
lashes as well but that's a great little
thing to pop in and it's pretty frequent
that you'll see Sally's doing like a buy
one get one or buy one get one half off
for some kind of deal on the on the
false lashes so keep that in mind
another buy one get one deal that you'll
find from time to time at Sally's which
I actually found was on the china glaze
nail polishes um these are so my
favorite kinds of nail polish I think
they wear really well I think the colors
are fantastic and unique and the ones
I'm holding up here happened to be
exceptionally gifted pretty kind of
pearly pink and innocence which is a
super super pale pink and anyway you
know pick whatever colors you like but
nail polish is one of those easy things
to give someone because it you know you
did that they can go whatever you think
looks pretty whatever you think you
would enjoy give to someone else because
it doesn't it's not like you have to
match their you know right concealer
shade or anything like that you just
pick what you want and another shade
regardless of color I mean not shade but
another product that would make a really
nice gift that I have come to really
like using every time I do my nails is
by seche vite it's the fast dry top coat
and also the crystal clear base coat I
got these on like a buy one get one half
off and these are so good I used to
really recommend the Sally Hansen mega
shine which I do like but the only
downfall of that is after you use it for
a while it starts to get a little thick
like goopy almost in the container I
haven't noticed that at all with the
Seche vite and the sesh clear and these
are semi expensive for a nail polish
we're talking like six to seven dollars
for one of these but give them together
as a set as a nice little gift and this
is another great high quality beauty
gift product the topcoat really strives
super fast and so does the base coat and
base coats are nice because it keeps
your nails from getting um nails can
actually get discolored by a really bold
colored polish you might put on them if
you left it on there for a long time you
know how like if you left a bold red on
your nails didn't use a base coat your
nails might look a little yellowish
after you took it off so base coats are
important and then the top coat for a
high shine and just a really kind of
hardened finish that you don't have to
worry about chipping quite so much these
are great quality sally beauty supply
and another couple of things Salas has a
lot of products that they sell in
smaller sizes like a hair sprays or this
is the turn up the heat Flatiron
protection you know this this these are
beyond the zone products and the
packaging is really cute and fun and
colorful but you know you might just
introduce somebody to their next you
know must have hair product a lot of
people like this flat iron spray I enjoy
it a lot too this is the frozen stiff
24-7 freeze and hold so that's a nice
kind of like um hi hold hairspray that
you could finish off your your hair do
with it smells really awesome as well
but they have a
lot of products in smaller sizes that
you can buy for like you know one or two
bucks and would be a nice little add-on
for your Christmas gift so thank you
guys so much for taking the time to
watch this video here my suggestions but
I do know that it can be a little tricky
you know you love beauty products and
you would like to give that gift to
someone else but how exactly do you do
it hopefully you got some ideas from
this video and hopefully you'll be able
to pick up some great stocking stuffers
for this holiday season thanks for
watching guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
