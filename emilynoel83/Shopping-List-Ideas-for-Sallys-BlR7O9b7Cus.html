several request one from a while back
and one that kind of reminded me oh yeah
I need to try to do this video and it
was asking about what are some products
that are good at sally beauty supply and
i thought well i have tried pretty much
from nails to hair to make up i've tried
pretty much everything that they offer
there so I thought this would be a good
idea to do this it's one of my shopping
list ideas videos some of you say oh I
don't need any more ideas but this will
give you some in case you're not very
familiar with Sally so first we'll just
start with some of the tools that I've
tried there that I like and the first
one is their face secrets brush their
powder buff brush and face secrets is
the brand of brushes that they sell and
you can see that this brush is like flat
across and it's pretty dense and kind of
stiff and that means it's really good
for applying your mineral makeup and
getting better coverage with a brush
like this so this is pretty much the
brush I use whenever I apply mineral
foundation and you just kind of Pat it
on your skin and then kind of swirl it
around and you get much more full
coverage with the brush like this so
that's the face secrets powder buff
brush another brush I like and this is
the only real I foundation brush I
believe that i have this is my face
secrets foundation brush just your
standard foundation brush that you can
use with a liquid foundation however I
use it with my stick foundation and just
like rub it right off the top of the
stick you haven't seen my tutorial on
that that will help you better
understand how to use a brush like this
these brushes are much more common I
think find out in stores like this than
this so just keep that in mind you may
find these this at a lower price i wish
i could give you prices some of these
things i've had for a while so i'm not
sure how accurate any sort of Christ
estimation maybe but i can tell you
these are less than ten dollars i
believe from Sally's but I think you may
may also be able to check their
website and see on costs a third brush
that I really like is called their
smudge brush and this is from face
secrets once again I don't know if you
can get a good look at this little tip
on the brush but it's kind of like um I
don't know it's very dense and small and
it's kind of like flat if you turn it
that way and then a little bit more of a
tapered point and it's called a smudge I
think because you can you know do your
eyeliner and go back and like smudge it
out with more of a brush if you're not
such a big fan of like the sponge tips
or what you could do is actually which
I've done in the past is just dip into
like say a powder liner or any sort of
cream liner and you can actually use
this to apply and not get ads thin of a
line or is intense of a line so that's
an idea it's kind of a unique brush you
don't really see it out that much and
I've had this one for quite a while so
it's a pretty good quality if it's still
holding up well being such a tiny brush
like that so that's another brush I'd
recommend also um I know Sally's isn't
the only place you can buy these but the
tweezer Minh tweezers that's known to be
a pretty good brand and I have like
these little pink ones I just thought
they're cute because Sally sells them in
a lot of different colors and they just
had that nice planted tip to them and
they're very just easy to use and are
supposed to hold up really well and I
just like the light pink color so that's
an idea if you're looking for some
tweezers you can pick them up there
again that's a affordable option i
believe less than ten dollars again on
that now i'm going to talk about some
haired items that salads heads i have
been asked about hair tutorials and as
soon as I figure out a good place to put
my camera in my bathroom where I can
actually be able to look in my own
mirror and see what I'm doing that I
will do them but anyway some hair
products Sally's does a really neat
thing with their bobby pins they have
this little slider case think it's cute
it says sally beauty supply on top and
then slides open
you have a great place there to store
your bobby pins and so it's just kind of
nice it's all in one place you know you
don't have them flying all over your
bathroom and you can easily travel with
this it's just very small you could pop
it in your purse if you wanted to keep
it in your drawer without taking up too
much space another thing that I really
like there are the rollers that they
sell as far as the velcro rollers I have
very fine hair so when I put my rollers
in like this and sometimes they don't
always hold in your hair what I mean by
that is like you would need to put a
clip on them and you always want to put
a clip because then you'll get a crease
from the glyph so it's nice when you can
put them in and they will actually hold
in your hair without a clip and these
rollers you can find them either for
sally has been for fine hair or for
thick hair if you get the ones for fine
hair I don't you probably can't tell but
these little a little velcro nebi things
that they have on their those are a
little bit longer so that is actually
cling into fine hair better and you can
put them in put it right on top of your
head or even down low you can put more
hair in them and they will stay actually
and stay right up next to your head as
opposed to you know like sagging down
and not actually giving you the curl you
wanted and all that so those are some
good rollers that they have there and
these are just kind of like a light teal
color I don't I threw away the package
so I'm not sure of the brand but I think
they're just one brand that they sell
and you will be labeled as either for
fine hair or thick hair another thing
Sally's has a great selection of its
brushes and combs and you can just look
through and find just about anything you
would want and this brush that I have it
just a round brush from brush strokes
and got this nice rubber handle but I
kind of just recently discovered how
good a round brush can be after you take
out your rollers and then you brush
through your hair do you ever feel like
oh I took out the rollers and I don't
want to brush my hair now because I feel
like it's going to straighten my hair
out my hair is
that sometimes like you take a brush to
it and go all the way through it and
it's like okay where's the curl well if
you go brush through it with a round
brush you are going to really be
surprised as you brush through it and
brush through it in kind of an
underneath motion like this once you
take your roller out just kind of you
know run right through it after you take
your roller out you're going to find
that you have quite a nice curl going
there so just a heads up on round
brushes just look at their selection
also their combs this is good if you
tease your hair at all this comb has
some itty-bitty I don't even know if you
can see but on the sides of the teeth
there are more little tiny teeth and
that really helps with it and then
there's this where you can kind of boost
the hair up a little bit after you've
done that so just check out the combs
this one says it's from calm air they've
got a lot of different versions and of
those to choose from for very affordable
prices i mean we're talking for combs
between one and two dollars for brushes
maybe more like three dollars now to
nail products I really need to speed
this up a little bit but from beauty
secrets they have a nail polish
corrector pen you may have seen these
other places I just really like this one
because the cap gets on so tight that it
doesn't dry out and what that is is just
a little tip it looks like a marker but
what comes out is a nail polish remover
and you can correct any mistakes that
you have another great thing for 99
cents and I've had so many questions you
know sometimes I get questions what what
nail polish is that oftentimes is one of
the Sally girl nail polish is like this
one is cutie i think i've been asked at
one point when i did a video what my
nail polish was and it was this color
but i have probably i don't know maybe
ten of these little one dollar nail
polishes they have fantastic staying
power you can get them in like French
manicure shades and use them for a
French manicure get a really
long-lasting one and you know they just
it's nice to travel with their small
they last long they're great so those
are their $1 Sally girl nail polishes as
far as makeup real quickly they have the
sally girl individual i shadow
that like come apart you can you know
make a little set of them or you can
bought you buy them individually for 99
cents and then you can put them together
very pigmented colors if you look up
stuff about these you will find people
have given them very good reviews also
the femme Couture mineral effects
mineral shadows I did a whole video on
how to apply loose shadows and you can
find more on these in that video but
these are very nice mineral shadows the
boutique lip crayon things or another
like 99-cent type product I haven't been
copper and shimmering racing beware
these are a little bit dry when you put
them on your lips but the color is good
and if you put a gloss over them they're
fantastic and finally the colegio rice
paper you hear about blotting tissues a
lot well these are gliding tissues and
if you buy them in like the warm beige
color they actually have a teeny bit of
powder on them so you get the nice
effect of blotting the oil off who face
also replacing it with some nice clean
powder so those are my suggestions
guides hope you guys can check them out
next time you're Sally right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
