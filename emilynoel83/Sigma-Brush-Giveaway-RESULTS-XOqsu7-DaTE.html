tuning in for this video and thank you
so much to everyone who took the time to
participate in this contest well over
2,000 people ended up giving entering
the contest which was the task was to
tell me what's your favorite beauty
broadcast video and part of the reason
why I wanted to do that was because I
wanted to really get a feel for what
videos you guys like to watch and
that'll kind of help me decide what
types of videos and I do in the future
so I really really appreciated that
there is some really really kind
comments in there about the videos that
I've done and that means the world to me
so thank you very much for taking the
time to do that now in terms of figuring
out who the winners for this contest are
I didn't do you know I didn't pick
according to who had the best comment or
comment that I agreed with or you know
who wrote it the best or who had the
best grammar you know I did not do
anything like that there were too many
good ones if I were doing it that way it
would be impossible so I just completely
picked at random out of everybody that
was it you know had entered the contest
and I know I had said that I was going
to give out one full sigma brush set I'm
actually not going to be able to do that
that's because I am giving out three
sigma brush that yeah thank you so much
to Sigma who made this possible for me
to expand my contest a little bit so
happy to get to share a product that I
really like and share it with
subscribers you know people who
regularly watch my videos and enjoy them

opportunity so Thank You Sigma thank you
