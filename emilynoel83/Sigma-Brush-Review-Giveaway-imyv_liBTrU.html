tuning in for this video I am so excited
because I know as I had mentioned not
too long ago I recently hit the twenty
thousand subscriber mark and I am so
pumped about that and I was going to
have Tyler like kind of shoot a fun
crazy like celebration video with me but
he has been so busy taking the bar exam
that's the hugest test of his life
probably that he has to take to become
certified to be a lawyer and so he's
been really busy with that the past
couple weeks and right now he's actually
gone gonna be taking the test this week
so anyway I wanted to do a little
celebration of my own so I just wanted
to tell you at the start of my video -
stay tuned for the end because if you
think you're gonna enjoy what I'm
talking about and what I'm basically
recommending to you in this video
stick around till the end because there
will be an opportunity for you to get
your hands on yourself for free so keep
on watching for that anyway back to the
actual subject of the video it is Sigma
makeup brushes okay I am a huge makeup
brush fan I think brushes can add a lot
or detract a lot from the appearance of
your makeup and I have been using now
for quite a while I've been using these
brushes and I haven't put them in a
video yet because I sort of wanted to
wait and do my initial video on them so
then when I am just picking one up and
using it you'll know more what the brush
does and what I'm talking about anyway
you've got this fantastic little brush
roll that actually if it has sort of a
leathery feel to it
flip the top up twelve brushes for face
and eye and this is a fantastic
selection of them and I've talked about
other kinds of brushes I've talked about
you know the miscellaneous you know
random brushes that I use I talked about
brushes from Coastal Scents
and I think Coastal Scents makes some
really great brushes the price tag is
pretty low compared to say the Sigma
brushes however there is a difference in
overall quality I just want to put it
out there that you can get a great look
with the Coastal Scents brushes I mean
you can look fantastic
stick with them but if you are looking
for that added that added touch of
softness and just some very very
sophisticated brushes here that are that
may compare to Mac and I'm not gonna go
through comparing each one of these to a
Mac brush because guess what I don't own
any Mac brushes so I'm not gonna pretend
like I know but these I will tell you
that anytime I've seen these review they
have been compared to Mac but comparing
them to some of the less expensive
brushes that I have tried they are above
and beyond in terms of softness and the
way they are built just the way they're
made I mean I there I can't say enough
about the way these brushes are
constructed and the way they really
really flawlessly apply the makeup to
your face so this is sort of a makeup
investment even though it's considerably
less expensive than that brushes they're
kind of that middle ground you know what
I mean but between the you know very
very inexpensive brushes and then you've
got Mac over here and these are kind of
that middle ground and for many of us
the price tag on this is still going to
be an investment um $64 for the 12
brushes and if I mean if you're real
into makeup and you've researched a lot
of what brushes can cost you think
that's a good deal others might see hear
that and think oh I don't know and if
you want this brush roll at $79 so I
want to put that out to you there
however these are some phenomenal
brushes and for that price for the many
things I've compared them to they are
really great brushes so I'm going to get
started here and take you brush by brush
tell you what it's designed to do and
how well it works in mind if you want to
let you know also that when you get the
brushes you're going to get an actual
brochure that tells you what all those
brushes are used for so if there are
some that you've never you know a type
of brush that you've never tried before
this is gonna tell you what it's made
out of and what you know it's best uses
you may like me sometimes I get a brush
and then I figure out a whole other use
that I like it for as well but it's nice
to have that starting point that
description of every brush and you're
also gonna get a nice little card that's
gonna basically telling you how to store
your brushes and how to care for them so
that's always nice to have as well
because this is setting you up to give
your brushes the longest lifespan and
just the best quality that you can give
them now on to the brushes as I said
they come here in this brush roll and
they're and you know easily easily
stored in here and the first one and
these numbers do correspond to Mac
brushes so if you you're hearing the
number on here and you're thinking that
sounds kind of familiar this is what
it's kind of relating to or this is
basically what the brush is designed
after so first is the SS 150 and this is
going to be your all-over face kind of
powder brush I really like using this
for all over face powder bronzers
highlighting powders it's really nice
and this is the first brush that I got
out of here and I touched it I touched
it to my face and said this is softer
than anything I have ever used I'm dead
serious another great thing about this
brush is how dense it is it is very
densely packed so it's not only fluffy
and soft and all those good things that
a lot of brushes can have but it's very
dense that brister's bristles are nicely
tapered from the you know inside to the
top and it's just you know a great for a
nice even application all over your face
so that's the SS 150 and by the way
brushes can be purchased individually so
if there are a few of these that are
just standing out to you and you don't
need a whole set keep that in mind as
well the SS 187 ok this brush I've been
using to stipple on my foundation and
it's gotten a nice stiffness to it and I
have tried the Coastal Scents version of
this brush which was very very similar
to this only this one has not shed on me
yet this one and most of these do i've
tried actually for more than just
Coastal Scents I've tried several brands
of a duo fiber stippling brush and they
almost always leave something behind
this one at least so far hasn't left
anything behind and I did clean it
before I used it and that may be what's
helping but this type of brush like
you're gonna basically like I would put
my liquid foundation on my hand
and then get some of that foundation on
the brush and basically stipple it on
and you get a very even application you
keep from getting too much product on
your face and this is nice because while
it is you know it does have those light
bristles there they remain very stiff
and very durable so you're gonna like
that this is an angled brush
it's the SS 168 and this is great I love
having an angle brush it's probably a
little bit smaller than um I would
normally want to apply blush this is
about I mean it's definitely it works
and I successfully you know get my blush
on there I love it most for a contour
but for like the apples of my cheeks I
would like to have something that is
maybe not tapered and just a little more
full but still this is this is a very
nice brush to have in your collection
and sometimes angled brushes can just be
harder to come by in general so this is
this is a good one to have but like I
said I might prefer just something a
little bit thicker but that's not no not
thicker just a bigger you know a larger
brush but anyway that still works fine
the next one you have is your ss190 and
this is a great foundation brush I have
used this I've since cleaned it off and
you can see that it can clean basically
completely and get back to the original
look but this is a great foundation
brush because it remains stiff you can
see you put pressure on it it's not
gonna you know bend all the way down and
that kind of thing and you want that
because you want to be able to apply
that coverage and not feel like you know
you want to control the product
basically and that's what makes applying
makeup easy as brushes that help you
control the product this is great for
when I use my Bobbi Brown foundation
stick and I want to get that just right
around my eye area sometimes you you can
kill two birds with one stone with a
foundation brush you can apply
foundation and you can apply your
concealer and it comes to a nice tip
here you can see when it's nicely formed
you're getting that tip and that
kind of what makes it possible to get in
those small small areas now we're going
to start getting into some eye brushes
although I will come back to a concealer
brush and a lip brush here in a moment
but the next one we have is the SS 239
okay this is going to be like your elf
eyeshadow brush it's guy it's you know
densely packed it's about the same size
and this is what I use to pack the
shadow down on my eyelid and this is
salt once again softer than the elf
brush softer than the brush from Coastal
Scents that I've used of this kind and a
little narrower which I do like just for
you know the size of my eye I like to
have a little more control this gives me
that it packs on the shadow perfectly
there's nothing bad I can say about that
brush not like I'm just looking for it
but it does work quite well another nice
thing you get with this set is the SS
275 which is an ankle brush and so that
angle brush is going to be similar in
thickness to the one I just showed you
but it is gonna be a little bit longer
up here on this side and obviously
tapered so what do you use a brush like
this for a long long time ago I used an
angle brush in a video to show how you
can just use one brush to do an entire
eye look I used it to get the shadow on
my lid I was able to work in the crease
and I was able to use it to do to do a
highlight to even an outer V so it's a
very multifunctional brush you will
probably as you use a brush like this
decide how it works best if I were going
to give it one specialty I would say
this is nice
for putting it right the pointy err part
of it right in your crease and using it
to apply that sort of halo of color
that's just barely reaching up to your
brow bone and that's a great use for
that brush I'm so glad that a brush like
this is in the set the SS 224 one of my
absolute favorites here this is going to
be the brush that can apply a wash of
color to your crease that you can use
bare and blend out your entire eye look
that you can use to lightly apply a
highlight shade and not get it too dense
and thick and you know obvious makeup
looking you know it is soft it's dense
it's
the perfect taper in my opinion and the
perfect size to really fit with my I
like I said this is I've tried so many
of these brushes that are this style of
brush but bigger and a little too fluffy
for me to really be able to have control
I've said control a zillion times here
but that's what makes makeup application
easy and it's able to like I said apply
that wash of color here but I can also
you know just use it bare buff out the
look it's gonna buff it out flawlessly
all of these brushes I can't say enough
about their softness either I've never
tried anything as soft as these before
the next one I have here is the SS 219
to give you a size comparison yeah it's
quite a bit smaller this is what I would
compare to the fine crease brush that I
use so often um this is quite stiff and
maybe when I first tried it I'm getting
a little adjusted to it because when I
first tried it I thought that's a little
stiffer than I'm used to it's still able
to be used very effectively to create an
outer V and get definition you right out
and here in that area it was but in
terms of like blending that out then I
might switch back to that fluffier one
whereas with my essence of beauty brush
from CVS I could kind of swirl it oops
just dropped it this one's harder to
kind of you can get the circular motion
but it's just not designed to be quite
as much of a blending brush you know
what I mean so you may want to within
this set if you had both of these apply
your color get your definition there
buff it out with the thicker brush or
the more full brush just an idea there
but yeah still a very great brush not
maybe one of my favorites in the
collection but I'm still very pleased
with what it does just goes to show you
sometimes just in the design of a brush
you can still go back to something very
inexpensive and it can work great for
you the next brush is the SS 252 and
this is going to be the kind of flat
eyeshadow brush that you can use to pack
that shadow right like in your crease if
you want to I
you could use us definitely to apply all
over your lid but what I like using
these foremost is why I want the color
packed in my crease and then I want to
buff it up just a little bit it's great
for a controlled application of pigments
because well this one and this one can
give you a similar look this one would
make pigments go kind of crazy if you
kind of just did your windshield wiper
motion with it
this one is more that packing approach
okay so hopefully that makes sense to
you the next one is your concealer brush
this is the ss190 for like I said
sometimes you can get away with cheating
and just using your foundation brush for
that concealer step or if you got some
real fine areas you want to get to use
that concealer brush for me that would
be like right in here in my eye area or
if I'm doing someone else's makeup you
know it's kind of like I want to get in
there with my finger but I don't want to
like stick my finger in you know in
their eyes so these are just great for
those purposes around your nose you
can't beat this brush it is very stiff
and it is somewhat smaller than some
concealer brushes I've used but it still
looks like the little the little this is
the little mommy brush and this is the
baby so they work hand-in-hand and it's
nice to have the option of something
smaller if the SS 209 and I'm going to
Pat Sigma on the back for the attention
to detail here yeah you get the little
cap thing on it so you've got your lip
brush here but you have a way to kind of
shield it from getting all over your
nice little brush roll that you have but
this is a nice lip brush I like it
because instead of coming to a
rectangular tip it comes to a point so
you're basically able to use a lip color
you know brush this over your favorite
lipstick and practically use that as a
liner at first and then you can fill in
of course but with that point you're
able to easily do that with some of the
brushes lip brushes that are more
rounded off or squared off it really
doesn't make as much sense because
you're not getting the definition that
you're obviously looking for if you're
using a lip brush the last brush I'm
going to tell you about is the SS 266
is a stiff eyeliner brush this is gonna
work well with your creams I've just
used it so far with powders just to set
you know whatever the liner was that I
used you know used to use a pencil liner
down there and then top it off with a
powder but this is the type of sides
that will work well with creams because
it's not too big it's gonna give you a
lot of control like I've said and it's
stiff enough to be able to take those
creamy formulations so anyway those are
the twelve brushes that come in this kit
like I said it's one of the I've it's
some of the softest brushes some of the
most well constructed brushes in terms
of you know you hold one it's it's
weighty it's you've got a big handle to
it to work with it does not feel in the
least like this whatever fall apart on
me it's just very well made anyway how
can you get these yourself well I want
