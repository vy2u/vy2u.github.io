a review on a great great brush set and
I'm going to tell you all about it it's
new from Sigma it's called the bunny
collection so this is a vegan friendly
brush kit it's all synthetic brushes
they all have that if you're familiar
with Sigma brushes it's the sigmax brush
fibers that are super duper soft but
it's like a whole set of that that can
be like your full face brush set I have
the travel size of this so this is a
kind of small little double brush holder
thing and I'll show you that in a minute
but these come in black like I have or
they come in this cute blue handle and
pink Farrell set so again there's a
travel set which is what I have and then
there's a full set so because all I have
is a travel set that's what I'm going to
talk about and these were sent to me for
review by Sigma and I got them a little
bit of a head of their launch date which
is December 5th so I have gotten to try
these and I so enjoy them and I've got
to say I've got a whole little carousel
of a ton of different brushes there are
some that I reach for every day and I
know I've talked about my Sigma complete
kit as being that go-to brush kit that I
love but then I have a lot of other
random brushes that you know maybe I've
used them a few times like literally
once or twice and then I don't get much
more use out of them and there are a lot
of brush sets out there that can throw
in you know two dozen some brushes and
okay that's a great kit that's a lot of
variety but I think it's a real
accomplishment when a travel kit a kit
of seven brushes can give you everything
you need for a full face that's an
accomplishment there and that's one of
the reasons why I wanted to talk about
this actually these are the brushes I
was using in my Maybelline one brand
tutorial then use any other brushes but
these and so for me to be kind of
satisfied with using just out of one kit
of brushes it's pretty cool so again it
unsnaps here you've got this great
little container and you've got three
face brushes and for I brush
if you're familiar with like say the
Sigma f80 brush this is a great
foundation brush this is not in this kit
but I just want to show you you know
it's those really super soft dense
fibers that you know they kind of look
light at the tip and they're very very
soft but they're still very densely
packed it's that kind of a concept only
you're looking at a full line of face
brushes like this and keep in mind this
is a travel kit so you might think well
these are a little smaller and I've
tried plenty of travel kits that are
giving you like a mini sized brush and I
tape them this one is the large powder
brush I gotta tell you this is so darn
soft and this can do your powder your
bronzer this could even do your blush
this could blend out your contouring I
mean talk about multi-purpose and so
soft so dense I mean the blending is
going to happen and you don't apply a
lot of pressure to your face with these
brushes you don't scrub your face with
these brushes like some brushes I feel
like it's like okay blend already you
know these blend very easily if I had
this kind of brush set when I was like
15 16 years old getting started with
makeup the process would have been a lot
easier I must say you also get a large
angled contour brush this can be this is
what I would more likely use for my
blush I could also contour with this
very easily it's targeted enough you
know it's small enough to where that can
be you know a great contour and can
apply a little more concentrated color
than your powder brush is going you've
also got and I kind of did this a little
out of order here but a foundation brush
I had kind of gotten off of using flat
foundation brushes for a while but I
must say this one having all of these
teeny tiny benefits of HD here there are
tons of little brush fibers there there
are tons of little bristles and that
helps in the application of foundation
so much blending is so important so you
can kind of dot your foundation all over
and then you can take a brush like this
and really make sure it's all blended in
so that's great - so there's face and
then for other brushes here for eyes and
I'm really glad they give you what they
give you here you've got a great brush
here that can be used for you know just
applying that eyeshadow packing it on
the lid look it's kind of chubby it's
really thick with with bristles again
super duper sorry to get a dense
application of powder product from a
cheap shadow to a more expensive shadow
I've used it both ways it's still really
good at picking up product from your pan
and putting it on your eye I love the
size of this tapered blending brush this
is phenomenal here this is a great tool
for blending I used all these brushes on
my face today by the way and nothing
else and this was the thing that gives
you that beautiful wash of color right
up in this area you don't apply a lot of
pressure with these brushes because it
doesn't take much to blend out your
shadow pencil brush so glad there's
pencil brush in here because this is
what I use to put the shadow on my lower
lash line I've gotten to where I don't
like super precise real lines under my
eye here on my lower lash line so I
really keep it very blended and diffused
and that does that for me this could
also you know smudge out your upper
liner it could smudge out your creams if
you like that and then there's a small
angle brush and actually what I like to
use this for and you'll find this is
going to be a pretty flexible brush okay
it's pretty soft SM angled brushes are
very stiff and the about the only thing
you could imagine doing with them is
eyeliner this is a little bit it's
really small okay it's not very wide
from here to here but it's also kind of
flexible so I have loved using this it's
my little detail brush and I will use
that to put my highlights right here in
the inner corner
the eye sore them all like in one of
these little parts and then you could
use this other one for other brushes
that you have or eyeliners or mascaras
or whatever I also want to note that
with the seven brushes in here this is
not packed so let's say you've got
another Sigma brush one of these large
ones this is the f80 foundation brush
that can fit in there just fine as well
still room maybe I really want to take
my little brush that I used to go
through my brows pop that in there no
problem or maybe a lip brush throw that
in there okay so you've got it all and
then your top just comes right over that
and then it snaps and you kind of want
to make sure that all of your brushes
you know I like to put this top on and
then kind of twist and you make sure you
know you're not trapping any brush hairs
in there snap-snap
and you can throw that in your bag and
go with it final points on this I know I
really raved on this and I raved on it
because I think this kit is really
something special this is a travel brush
kit but guys this could be someone's
everyday brush kit because I am one who
when it comes right down to it I use the
basic brushes these are basic brushes
but with a whole new level of blend
ability with them because of the way the
fibers are and they are vegan-friendly a
lot of kits with a lot of brushes in
them when some when a brand can boil
them down to just the ones you need it's
really something special and you will
use all of them I'm confident that if
you get this you will use every brush in
there is black there is also a pink and
blue design that you can check out so
hope you enjoyed this video hope it was
informative for you this would
definitely be a great gift idea for this
season so thanks again for watching guys
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
