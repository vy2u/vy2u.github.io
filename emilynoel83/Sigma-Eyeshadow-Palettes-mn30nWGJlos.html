reviewing the three eyeshadow palettes
that Sigma recently came out with one is
called vert one as flair and the other
is dig I don't necessarily feel the same
way about each palette and kind of feel
differently from some of the other
reviews I've seen on YouTube so I just
wanted to sum that up for you in this
video and give you my opinions I'm going
to start out by talking about the bear
palette and the packaging on these while
they're colored differently the
packaging style is all the same it's
sort of a cardboard field and then when
you open it up you see let's see eight
different eyeshadows yeah and you also
get a different double ended brush with
each palette which i think is really
cool because you're not just getting you
know some flimsy applicator you are
actually getting legitimate Sigma
brushes in each one so like this combo
here is the e25 and the e30 and it's
going to be a different double ended
brush in each in this kit as you can see
you're getting a range a really wide
range of colors from the lightest of the
light creamy shades to really deep black
colors and personally I think this is a
great palette to have because I feel
like quality wise even the light matte
shades with which are sometimes the
shades in a palette that don't come off
as well
I feel like these are really nicely
pigmented and the blacks are so-so
blacks so I feel like for what you're
getting here you know each shade is a
good representation of what you're
seeing here in the packaging lots of
colors look good in the packaging but
it's a matter of what they look like
swatched that determines you know really
how how good they are next question I
get a lot because this might remind you
a little bit of The Naked palette you
know which one should I get
and I feel like The Naked palette is
giving you a more diverse selection
we're like the shimmery shades are
concerned you know you can get a lot of
different looks in that Naked palette
because you're getting more bronze
shades some plummy shades some deep deep
blue colors even so I think you can have
a little more creativity with that but I
come back to it this is these are the
basics you know you can't go wrong with
having a great basic black eyeshadow
or a matte cream colored shadow or a
matte brown so a couple of the shades
that are my favorites in here I love
both of the black shine and control want
a sparkly one is Matt I love hitch for
being just a really perfect medium
brownish tone and I also like it low
because for being like I said a light
creamy color it has a ton of pink for
all I would say if you're lacking some
of the basics in your collection and you
want really great quality for those this
is a palette I would recommend next
panel I'm going to talk about is the
flare palette and so this one is a lot
of fun it gives you some kind of like
colors that I look at I think of almost
like a peacock kind of exotic shade
because you are getting you know some
tones of green and some tones of pearl
here we go with the brush you've got an
e 40 and an e 55 so a great flat brush
for packing on color and a big fluffy
brush to blend out so a couple of great
basic brushes the pigmentation on these
is again awesome I was really happy with
all these different colors and if you're
one who says you know I've got my basics
already I want something fun this one is
awesome this might be my favorite
palette just for the fact that I feel
like I really am getting a different
selection of colors here I love the kind
of jade teal greens and the purple plum
shades are just great and what's also
nice is that if you took out those super
bright colors in here like these two
greens and that purple you've got a nice
palette of basics there with just some
olives and some you know some light
beige and deep deep plum and that sort
of thing so this palette can be both fun
and basic and I like that I love the
quality of the coloring I want to note
about these palettes is that sometimes
certain colors I find can be kind of
powdery so that's something that I'll
tolerate because I feel like you know it
is making it easy you just need just the
slightest amount of some of these shades
rather than having to kind of scrub on
the shades to get color which even with
certain high-end shadows certain Mac
shadows I've had I feel like the color
didn't come up as easily so I like that
feature of these shadows the last
palette I have to talk about is the dare
palette and when you first open
this one is really I think kind of
impressive and eye catching when you
look at these different colors because
it R is those beautiful tones that kind
of remind you of summer or even fall
you're hitting some nice rust colors
oranges peach yellow a deep deep plum
here and as far as the brush you get in
this one and these are a couple of the
brushes that actually come in the
premium kit so that's a 45 which is kind
of a pointed but still somewhat full
crease brush it just kind of is very
very tapered and then the other one is
in a 20 which is a nice brush that you
can use to kind of smudge the liner
underneath because as you can see it's
not super thin but it is rather sure I
like the range of colors however I don't
think it is as versatile as it could
have been just to spend the money on it
I would think that I want my palette to
be able to do several different things
like I said with the flare palette or
the nice basic bare palate you know I
feel like each of those is really great
quality it can do a lot of things this
one I feel like swatched very nicely too
and you can get you know some beautiful
looks but not as much I'm surprised that
this is the only deep shade in here
which is a sort of deep burgundy plum
called surrender right here on the end
I think this palette could have done so
much more if they put in a brown say a
bronzy brown or a taupe or something
like that I think you could have gotten
some different looks going on because
when you take out this color look at
everything else is just kind of in that
bright category and so I just don't know
that unless those are really your choice
shades for everyday I don't know that
you'll get as much good out of this one
as you would the others so that's sort
of my thoughts on this palette although
surrender is a great color and I also
like this shade called grasp it's the
second one in the kit and it's kind of
like a coral e gold so that's my take on
the new Sigma eyeshadow palettes as a
whole I find that the quality is really
impressive I don't know if you remember
when Sigma came out with some shadow and
blush palettes in the past and they like
held four different colors and you could
pop them out and they were all super
duper shimmery so they came out with
these and they really worked
a nice mix of matte and shiny the
textures of both they've really done a
good job of you know finding great
colors that really have a nice color
payoff I think it's just a matter of
choosing what do you think you're really
going to get a lot of use of if you are
a neutral girl and you're lacking some
of the great basics in your collection
like black cream you know matte brown
things like that
the bare palate would be a good choice
if you want fun colors to play with and
you want to be able to get a variety of
looks that are somewhat colorful out of
one palette the flare palette is good
but don't get me wrong you can get some
fairly neutral looks out of this one as
well if you pick the right colors so I'm
very happy with those two and then dare
I mean it's kind of personal preference
here because the colors are so bright
and you're really only getting one deep
shade to kind of pull it down and create
contrast and tone it all down I feel
like I just want like but anyway those
are my thoughts thank you so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
