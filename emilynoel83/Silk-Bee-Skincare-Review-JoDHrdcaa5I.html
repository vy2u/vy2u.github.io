going to be reviewing a whole line of
skincare products that i have been using
for quite a while now i really don't
like to jump right into a review on
something that skin care related because
i feel like you really need to take some
time to make sure this is not going to
break you out you know i need to kind of
be assured that if i'm going to say it's
a good product i want to have used it
for quite a while before i go ahead and
tell you guys I think it's a good
product so anyway the brand is called
silk be and you may this may sound
familiar to you because I did a little
Q&amp;amp;A session with someone from the brand
on my blog so he answered some of the
questions I had when I first started
using it and so if you have more
questions on its especially where this
brand is made and what some of the
natural ingredients that are used in
this brand also what makes their
different formulations different for one
another and who should use which
formulation make sure you look at my
blog I will have a link to that in the
sidebar so you can actually read you
know some information on it sometimes
that's easier than scanning back through
here and trying to remember what I said
so anyway I'm going to breathe as
briefly as I can take you through all
these products and must say as a whole I
am extremely impressed with this stuff i
like i said i've been using it on a
daily basis now and i use it's a series
of moisturizers you've got moisturizers
for the face for the body for the feet
and eye cream and lip balms as well and
there's two formulations in each one is
the classic silk and the other is the
alon vut all i hope i'm pronouncing that
correctly but the basic difference is if
you've read my blog you may already know
this but the classic silk is you know
sort of their traditional you know
standard product but the Elan vital has
some more vitamins and more nourishing
ingredients that will give you extra
moisturization so I think basic
difference here is if you have really
dry skin you may want to head toward
that side of the line otherwise and the
classic silk should work fine for you
another basic fact across the board on
this brand is that the products are not
scented okay they are using all natural
ingredients by the way it is handmade in
the USA all of these products if that is
a concern of yours but yes all natural
ingredients and you will be able to read
on the bottom of these just what sorts
of things are in it they're water-based
which is a good thing you don't want to
i mean if for those who are concerned
about mineral oils in their base most
risers these are water-based some of
those different ingredients I mean of
course water grapeseed oil olive oil
vitamin E it's just a lot of really
quality ingredients that are going to
make your face feel good and make your
body feel good so anyway that being said
I'm going to go through what I think
about the different items first I'm
going to start with the face as I said
you've got two types of moisturizers and
they come in these little tubs here
which are 1.3 ounces and these are the
same size this one is the classic silk
and this one is the Elan vital and so
basically it's going to be kind of hard
for me to describe the consistency I
don't know if you can see there but you
just got a creamy creamy texture to
these and I generally for my face I've
been using the classic silk mostly
because you'll remember the alonda tall
is more a dry skin thing and as we head
into summer especially I don't need that
much moisturization for my face so I've
been using the classic silk and it has
been i have it on right now under my
makeup and it's been working wonderfully
well um however it does not that i am
aware of having SPF in it so generally i
mean i will i will use it more as a
night cream than a day cream i have
another product from be luscious it's
the the vitamin C Line i like to use for
daytime it has an SPF 15 but this makes
a great nighttime moisturizer as well
i'll switch it up from day to day though
but as I said classic silk for those who
may not need the extra moisture if
you're a dry skin person the alon
tall and like I said you know we say
things are unscented but I mean there is
a bit of it just sort of a natural sort
of a fresh scent it smells clean i'm not
going to if that describes anything but
there's really nothing strange about the
scent but it is not a strong flowery
scent which can be a source of
irritation for a lot of people and now
when we get to the body creams um as far
as these are concerned you know some
people like a real fragrance lotion
other people say you know I like my
perfumes to be able to you know be the
scent that I we're not the lotion so and
I had asked you know is there going to
be anything scented coming out and it is
a possibility from what I've been told
but again you've got the classic silk
and you've got the alon vuitton in the
body cream and for me I have been liking
the alon vut all because i feel like i
am dryer on my legs my arms my elbows
and that kind of thing this goes on very
very smooth it kind of helps me to use
it as I describe it it does kind of melt
right into your skin but you continue um
with some moisturizers I've used I felt
sticky afterward I don't like that
feeling I like to just feel a smooth
smooth feeling as I'm rubbing the salon
videl right here on to my leg you're
getting that feeling as you rub it in
like okay I am moisturised but i am not
greasy okay so that's a great great
thing about this and it is enriched with
a lot of vitamins a lot of great
moisturizing agents there so that is
probably my pic on the body cream now
for the foot moisturizer this is sort of
one of those in my opinion like
auxiliary products if you really care
for your feet maybe you give yourself
pedicures and you really really want
that added moisture for your feet which
can be important during the summertime
we're all walking around in flip-flops
we are exposing our feet to the elements
a lot more and I notice mine do get a
lot drier so I have enjoyed using the
foot moisturizers but if you are trying
to sort of cut your costs if you got the
alon vuitton body cream and use that
also on your feet i think that would
work fine as well however you want
again have the same two options classic
silk or the Allonby tall for the foot
cream once again this is going to be a
little bit heavier and there's an
interesting texture to the foot cream
that the body cream doesn't have it's a
little more solid just a little more
firm in there so you are getting quite a
bit more added moisture with the foot
cream obviously you've got tougher skin
on your feet you do need something
that's a little bit more moisturizing
there but as I said the alon vuitton
body cream will do wonderful things
either way so and then lastly something
i really recommend it's a little more
expensive than any of the other products
but the classic silk eye cream there's
only one option for eye cream and it's
the classic silk and i have used this
night and day and i have love this so
much i love it it's got something it's
got emu oil emu or emu I know everybody
says it differently but it's got some
very unique ingredients but it goes on
so smooth and I put it I mean I put it
on my eye area like I said the last
thing I want to feel I use this only
before bed and the last thing I want to
feel when I lay my head on my pillow is
I have a greasy face I don't want that
feeling you know I want it to feel like
okay I've been moisturised but it's not
like I'm going to have like wake up to
an oily mess in the morning so you can
use this it doesn't take much you do get
a smaller size here this is point 65
ounces as compared to the typical size
of everything else so the eye cream is
really outstanding very moisturizing
without being too heavy and thick and
feeling like it's giving you some sort
of irritation I have gotten irritation
with certain eye creams and that scares
me a lot I hate having some sort of
irritated feeling around my eye because
my eyes I mean I go to work and I need
to look you know I can't have redness I
can't have you know some sort of problem
that keeps me from putting my eye makeup
on because I do the news and I kind of
need that everyday so um like I said
this has been a fantastic product I've
enjoyed using it day in and day
out and then the last thing that you
have a choice of our league lip balms
you have of course classic silk and
alamba tall um lip balms I kind of would
have liked if these were flavored just
because i love scented lip balms but i
will take something that is also if it's
very nourishing and it you know does the
serious things i guess that a lip balm
should do i will still enjoy using it
and i would have to say of the two I'm
not as big a fan of the classics silk as
i am the alon vittal for this I do want
pretty much as much moisture as I can
get on my lips this goes on more smooth
this one doesn't quite glide on the same
the classic silk so I would recommend
the alon betal and I know this I've been
told this is one of their top selling
items along with the classic silk on
face moisturizer but anyway the things
that are in this it's got beeswax
grapeseed oil coconut oil shea butter
extra virgin olive oil I mean the things
that are in this I be it's it's not like
you're reading off a little list of
harsh chemicals or anything like that
and that's how all these products are
very natural very good for your skin
I've taken a lot of time to use these
and test them out and I feel like I can
say this is a great line of products and
as far as any cons to this is with the
face moisturizers it's I would like to
see something with an SPF in there
perhaps that may be something they'll
work on in the future it would be nice
to have the option of getting some
scented products so keep in mind that
once again these products are not
scented but I enjoy having the option of
either you having that ultra
moisturizing Elan vital formulation or
the classic silk so I like the classic
silk for my face I like the ilonka tell
for my body and I love that eye cream as
well so anyway guys I will have the
links available in the sidebar so you
can check out more on this brand more on
that little interview that I had on my
blog that little Q&amp;amp;A session there so
you can read up on the brand some more
but if you're looking for some good
skincare this is definitely an option
for you so i think thats so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
