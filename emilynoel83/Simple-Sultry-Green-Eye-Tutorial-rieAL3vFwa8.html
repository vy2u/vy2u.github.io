tune into beauty broadcast today I hope
you enjoy this look I'm about to show
you it's using some fun metallic green
shades some different tones of green
it's very easy to do there's not a whole
lot of advanced blending or liner
techniques with this so if you're just
looking for something fairly simple that
you can try to incorporate a new color
into your eyeshadow look good go ahead
and check this on is to prime your lids
so I went ahead and put on my L'Oreal
decrease I prime or just put that all
over my eyelid and then I'm going to go
to a cream liner or a gel liner rather
just to kind of give myself a nice base
color for this look and it just
coordinates really well and I think it
helps the look last a little longer as
well and these are this is a gel liner
from Coastal Scents called feline and it
has a nice kind of metallic green light
green color to it with a golden
undertone so I think that's going to
work well for this look and it's just
some people have asked like can you do
that can you put that on there well
these are not like the cream liners like
you put them on and then it it like
dries to an immediate you know unblended
will finish you know these are kind of
easy to work with so I'm just using a
random like flat brush i have here from
Coastal Scents just kind of smallish and
collect some of the color there on your
brush and then just brush it on your lid
basically I work it from all the way all
the way from the inner corner to the two
up into the crease just a little bit and
you can see you know how you could go
with this as is it's got that gorgeous
golden e a tone to it that is really
going to work well with our more olive
colored greens then we're going to put
on in a second so I'm kind of just
blending it up just a little bit to the
crease it's not that critical but
because the main source of the color is
the lid okay so once you've got that all
over the lid then I would advise taking
your brush sticking it right down into
the product getting some of that on your
brush or you could just use a
an angled liner brush for this but since
this brush is small I feel like I can
use it as well and I'm just taking some
of that product and dragging it right
under my lower lash line here ok so just
incorporating that color all the way
around because we are going to put some
of the shadow underneath there too so I
figure why not give it the same kind of
base color that the top has and also it
looks nice kind of right around the tear
duct too so just get some of that on
there really really pretty color and
like I said you could go as is with this
and this would last you longer than
anukul cream shadow because it is the
nature of a liner you know once it does
dry it really will stay next I'm going
to grab my L'Oreal hip duo in gunmetal
and this is one of the metallic
eyeshadow duos from hip and I just think
these counters are beautiful one is kind
of more your classic metallic and then
the other one has some more sparkle to
it so we're going to start on this side
with this shade that's sort of an olive
tone green and I'm going to use my elf I
shadow brush get some of that product on
there and pack that all over the lid and
you're going to see a little more of the
golden eat owns come out then as we top
put this over the cream liner but you
can feel it kind of clinging to that a
little bit so this is going to be a
really nice long wearing eye look okay
so we're just going all over that area
it's like that I'm going to also use the
strategy where you can double up on one
brush just using the tip of the brush
get some of the product on there and
then we can kind of sweep that under the
lower lash line as well so it kind of
like look I don't know I don't know
what's easiest for you guys but just try
to keep it close to the lash line it's
ok if this smudges out and looks a
little smoky I think it looks kind of
good that way too ok next we're going to
take a medium crease brush I'm going to
go into this pretty deep kind of sparkly
almost like an emerald green shade I'm
gonna get some of that on my brush and
just look down into your mirror
and sweep that from the inner part of
the crease to the outer part really
making sure to concentrate the bulk of
the darkness here right in the crease
don't forget that when we do outer V
sins have unless you're going for you
know some sort of a cut crease look or
something where you you know really
changing the shape of the eye or
something like that and something unique
and kind of artsy you really do want to
get the color right in the crease and
then blend it out and fade it out okay
so I'm just going back and forth and as
I go I'm kind of working up and out just
a little bit so you can see how the
color is is not just in my crease it's
also blending up alright and to really
give this look a neat blend and this
works for so many duo shadows that
you're using if they're in kind of the
same color family like we've got here
you can see lighter green darker green
I'm going to take my lighter green with
a fluffier shadow brush and use that to
kind of sandwich the darker green so I
had the lighter green on the lid the
darker green and the crease and then
we're just going to fade up using that
lighter shade there now one thing that
this duo doesn't really give you is a
great shade and to work as a highlight
so alongside this kind of earthy tone
green look I'm gonna go with sort of a
golden II bronze colored highlight and
this shade might look a little intense
this is from covergirl and it's called
golden golden sunrise and if you use
this shade in a really sheer I mean it's
really pretty like all over the lid kind
of packed on for a really intense gold
look but to make it more sheer just use
a fluffy brush and you'll just get a
nice like amount of color just to kind
of perk up your skin kind of bronze it
up and it just works really well I feel
alongside this green so just go all the
way up to your eyebrow with that next
for liner I'm just going to go ahead and
handle the bottom lash line first I'm
going to go to the darker shade of the
shadow with an angle
a brush I'm using my tackle on liner
brush from coastal scents and just go
right up under your lash line there I'm
only going with this shade about half
way in this point you're going to be
kind of running out a product on your
brush so just kind of fade it in the
rest of the way it's just going to be at
a little definition to the green that we
already put there then on the upper lash
line I'm just I'm not really going for a
major look with liner here but I'm going
to be using my NYC liquid eyeliner in
black and just follow the natural shape
of your eye and I'm not looking for this
to be a really big winged out cat eye
look I just like the pretty shade of
this green and I want it to show as much
as possible so I'm going to keep this
line pretty thin and I'm just going to
start at the inner corner here it's like
so and just stay really close in to your
lash line and go all the way across now
for mascara I'm going to first go ahead
and curl my eyelashes and i'm going to
use covergirl LashBlast length on the
upper lashes and Maybelline lash
discovery on the bottom it's just got a
really nice small brush that grabs every
lash and I've never really had issues
with smudging with this so I'm going to
put those on and join you with the
finished look
alright guys hope you like this look
using some fun kind of metallic green
shadows I really am impressed with these
L'Oreal hip metallic shadows I love the
color payoff on these the intensity and
how you know in the Sun each side of the
duo isn't exactly the same finish one
side has more Sparkle the other is a
little more metallic so I like that the
shade that I'm used today in gunmetal
but another one that I have that I like
a lot is in sculpted and it's got sort
of a sparkly purple side and then it's
kind of a light lavender pink shade and
I just love the the colors they've put
in some of these duo's and I may try
more I know they have some matte ones
out now that I haven't really tested out
too much but anyway this is a really
really quick and easy look to do so I
hope you guys maybe try it out let me
know how it works for you on my lips
today I'm using a tinted lip balm called
from eco tints called mocha velvet and
this is something actually Tyler was at
a vitamin world store and he needed to
purchase something for a few more
dollars to get some kind of deal or
discount the next time you went and so I
was like okay I'm sure I can find
something and you know trust me to pick
out the one lip balm in the place so I
found the Eco tints and it was like a
three pack it's called naturally
glistening lip moisturizer and this
shade is mocha velvet so it's kind of a
pretty like deep sort of a brownish
shape with with some red in it so I put
that all over and then to give my lips a
little extra definition since it's kind
of hard with the lip balm rounded shape
I used um my wet and wild lip liner
number 666 in brandywine and so that's
just kind of got a little bit of
metallic you know bronzy red tone to it
and then over the top I used Neutrogena
moisture shine lipgloss in spritz which
is pretty much neutral just has a little
sparkle to a little bit of a bronzy rose
tone so hope you guys like this look and
thank you so much for watching have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
