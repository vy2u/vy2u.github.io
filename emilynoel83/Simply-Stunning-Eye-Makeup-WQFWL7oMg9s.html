me for this tutorial I'm really excited
because this was a requested look after
I did my finale video for the Emily
Awards a lot of people asked for
tutorials on the look I was wearing
there and I was really excited because
it was such an easy look to do so
sometimes when you know I'm seeing down
I'm doing my makeup and I'm not doing a
tutorial on a particular look it's like
I'll mess around with a lot of products
and it'll be like when it comes time to
remembering what I did it'll be kind of
hard but with this one it was actually
super simple so I wanted to walk you
through what I did it was very simple on
the eyes so it does involve um you know
some liner some false eyelashes which
are optional if you don't want to do
those but I think you're gonna be
surprised at how simple this one is so
keep on watching step one for this look
apply any primary one all over your lid
I used my Palladio herbal eyeshadow
primer and then we're going to use a
jumbo shadow stick in what I believe is
one of the prettiest colors I've come
across in like a cream jumbo shadow
pencil and it is from Malley and the
shade is called champagne and so this is
one of her ever color shadow sticks and
you can see there this is just a
beautiful light shimmery color so I'm
gonna just kind of draw this on all over
my lid and you can see that really nice
shimmer coming out also kind of circle
just around the tear duct area so you
can get that a little bit of sparkle
going around there anytime I use a cream
product on my eyes I want to blot it
just a little bit with my finger to pick
up any excess moisture or product gonna
take a shade called nylon from Mac and
this is a frost it has a quite a bit of
shimmer and Sheen to it and it just
looks beautiful on top of champagne so
I'm gonna look down take a flat shadow
brush this is my ELF eyeshadow brush and
I'm just patting that all over my lid
just for simplicity's sake we're also
gonna use nylon as our highlight so I'm
gonna take a larger brush this is just a
Revlon a contour shadow brush pick up
some of nylon there and we're just gonna
take that up just under our eyebrow on
the crease we're going to do something I
don't usually do but I've realized this
is just a
great great natural contour and I
realized that because I use this to
contour my cheeks all the time and so I
thought used in a little more
concentrated way this can be great and
simple as a shadow I don't know if you
have the elf studio contouring blush and
bronzer duo but this bronzer I'm agin
using that larger elf shadow brush or
not elf but Revlon and I'm just picking
up some of the bronzer and it creates
just the most natural contour here if
you're trying to create that effect of
sort of having a little more of a crease
there and you just want to do it in a
really natural way as you can see no
major effort there I'm just taking this
larger brush hitting it right there in
the product and away we go very very
easy next I'm going to use a product and
a brush that really make liner easy the
brush I'm using is from Mac it's a 209
se it's a mini brush and it came with a
fluid line that I got but I'm going to
be using it with my wet and wild cream
liner this is just in black and I love
the way this glides on this has been
recommended to me by quite a few people
and I've just been very happy with the
way it worked out so I'm gonna get some
of that on my brush and then what we
want to do is create somewhat of a
thicker line on our upper lash line I
think whenever you're putting false
lashes on top which is what I'm going to
do I like to have that little bit
thicker line to place them on so I like
to kind of start in the middle and I'm
just gonna draw it out winging it out
just a bit and then filling that whole
area and then get a little more on your
brush and we're just going to continue
working it in until we get all the way
to our inner corner just like that
another thing I like to do I've got a
little extra product here on my brush
and because this is such a nice long
wearing cream liner I'm just kind of
getting it right there this is my
natural lash line not my waterline we're
going to deal with the waterline in a
second but as you can see just kind of
taking a little bit of that just
underneath and it's going to give
even more rich definition around our
lashes we're the waterline I'm going to
be taking my Urban Decay liner this is
the one of the 24/7 glide-on pencils in
zero so this is black and I'm just going
to apply that on my waterline here I'm
gonna take one of my favorite shades
from Mac which is beauty marked and as
you can see as it catches the light kind
of plummy lots of shimmer and I'm gonna
take one of my ultimate new favorite
brushes which was part of a swab from my
friend Abby from color swept Beauty I'll
link to her channel but she gave me this
brush this is a Sonia Kashuk brush and I
believe it was called a smudger but I
don't remember the exact terminology
because I didn't keep the little outside
packaging or I can't find it but as you
can see it's small it's kind of flat and
it is just ideal for smudging out liner
on the lower lash line when you want to
look softer than it does with a real
precise angled brush so I'm gonna pick
up some of beauty marked there and I'm
just gonna go kind of right over the top
I'm holding the brush so it gets more
vertical here as I sweep the color over
the cream liner on the lower lash line
and so I'm getting a lot more of a
smudge there and then as I take it under
the rest I'm going to hold it so it's
going flat and just take that on my
natural lash line and just gonna provide
a nice not intense smudge down here next
I'm gonna curl my lashes apply a coat of
voluminous carbon black mascara to the
upper lashes this is going to sort of
prep them for the false lashes that we
put on in a moment and for some
definition on the lower lashes I'm using
my Maybelline lash discovery mascara it
doesn't smudge on me and it just doesn't
overdo these lower lashes but does help
them show up a little better so I'm
gonna apply some false lashes and this
is really what takes to the look up a
notch you could definitely leave it as
is but I think this extra pop of lashes
really puts the emphasis on the eyes
here so I'm using my Ardell fashion
lashes they come in kind of a packaging
that looks like this got them from Sally
Beauty Supply and this type is called
Demi
that's the oh that's all the title is
Demi and it's thicker lashes on the
outside and they're a little bit shorter
thicker and longer on the outside and a
little shorter on the inside they're so
easy they fit right in very nicely with
your natural lashes but giving you that
extra little pop so I'll put those on
and then I'll join you with the finished
look and let you know what's put on lips
and cheeks
so there is the finished look for the
eyes as you can see those lashes are
really set off the look and I also want
to let you know what I did for the color
products on my face and my lips for the
face let's see I did some contouring a
little bit with the elf contouring blush
and bronzer duo I use the bronzer I just
kind of went around here
around the forehead a little bit just to
kind of get that overall a little bit
bronzy glow there so it just shows how
multi-purpose this is contour your
cheeks but you can also get a really
natural contour in your crease of your
eye so I used that and then I used a
blush that I'm loving right now
it's from that malli all day gorgeous
kit which I did do a review slash
tutorial on but it's a great pink cream
blush and then this awesome kind of
shimmery pink blush that you top it off
with and I love the pink glow that that
gives and it's just so convenient having
the two kind of coordinating shades in
the same packaging and for my lips it's
kind of a cocktail of three different
colors one of the shades is from Rimmel
and it's the lasting finish lipstick in
pink blush mention this in the haul
video this is recommended to me as a
similar shade to Mac's Lady Gaga
lipstick so I put that on and then I
used this wet-and-wild perfect pear lip
wand I've had this for a little while
the shade is 123 and basically it's got
like a bigger kind of lipstick end and
then a well it's not really a lipstick
but like a jumbo pencil end and then
this liner and they're kind of like
berry shades so I use that a little bit
just to kind of give this look some
dimension a little used it to sort of
basically I want like this deepen it up
kind of right along the outer parts so
the middle kind of pops a little bit
more and then for a gloss over the top I
used covergirl wet flicks fruit
spritzers and berry splash this is a
very light shimmery pink just put that
all over the top well that's all for
this tutorial guys I hope you enjoy it
let me know if you try this and how it
works out for you and please keep in
mind that even though I was using you
know obviously some
pick products that I mentioned if you
have anything similar you can totally
sub that in a lot of the colors I used
were somewhat common you know when it
came to some of the eyeshadows and stuff
like that so if you know of any dupes
that you want to use feel free to fill
those in and I'm sure you will look
absolutely awesome so thanks again for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
