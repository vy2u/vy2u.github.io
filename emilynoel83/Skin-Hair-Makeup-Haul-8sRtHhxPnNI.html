this is a whole video of pretty much all
drugstore items so stuff that's been
picked up over the past I don't know a
few weeks I'm guessing got my hat on too
by the way
go cards my pink Cardinals hat it's
actually white this just got the pink
detailing I love this hat it's really
rainy today so I just thought what
better day to go ahead and just do a
haul video I will be going over some
things that are makeup hair skin care
elated I'll start with a skin care thing
I pretty much used up most of my Queen
Helen mint julep mask so I went to CVS
to get some more but they and they
didn't have it but they did have the CVS
kind which is apparently the purifying
mint mask
I assume it's pretty much the same thing
if I notice any big differences I'll let
you know but I have a feeling it's gonna
be almost exactly the same so one head
and got that that's a really good mask I
also like the be luscious what was it
called we're finding sea mud mask that
one's really good too it's super tingly
though I also got a new hairspray
because I really like the Tresemme tray
too hairspray I think it's really really
good and I use it on a daily basis but I
was looking for something to kind of
help me more in styling my hair like
when I flip my head over and I've curled
it and I want more volume basically in
it and I can just spray something in my
heads like upside down you know you flip
it back enough so much volume well I got
the 24 Hour Body it's actually a
finishing spray but I figured it would
work for the purposes I needed it looks
like this kind of neat packaging it's
got this big pink cap and um yeah 24
Hour Body I've used this on and off a
little bit it works fairly well it's not
like a super super stronghold like the
other one I was using which I will
continue to use that one for just you
know to end off my look and really get
some hold but what was strange about
this was the first few times I used it
it was like I depress super hard like
nothing would come out and then I
eventually read that it's like there's
some sort of seal that you have to
with that like so you really have to
press down hard after a few times and
then it starts coming out easily so I
know that was weird I was like is this
you know just a messed up product that I
happened to get but now it's working
fine but just you'll hear kind of like a
click in there if you in case you pick
this up as well so I may review that or
you know try to get more of a feel for
how I like it
um I also got this degree nature effects
orange flower and cranberry body mist
it's just a little thing I thought you
know I could use this for travel but
really I didn't go out like too with the
purpose of picking this up but there's
this really sweet old lady in my Walmart
and she was like wanting me to smell the
you know the fragrance she sprayed it on
a card I was like oh that smells good
and and I just felt I don't know I just
felt really guilty like not getting one
no it's just kind of a strange
circumstance I'm like okay I'll get it
cuz it it really does smell good and I
do like it used it like every day it
smells so delightful just very fresh
very summery really do you like it and
it's a nice size I will you know use
this for travel I don't really like to
travel with like glass bottles I would
hate for that to break so I think this
works pretty well
I also here's another non makeup related
item my band-aids my Hello Kitty
band-aids somebody told me they saw I
had one of these on my feet in there
like you do know they make band-aids
that match your skin tone and I'm like
that's not fun these are much cuter
especially if you like Hello kitties
I use them a lot like I have gotten the
band-aids stick that some of you have
recommended to me it's like a stick you
can rub on places that like areas of
your foot that rub on your shoes and
then it won't create as much friction
it's like a friction block stick I think
it is it's almost like a jumbo lip balm
or something but you put it there and it
keeps the rubbing to a minimum so I will
use that but I had a blister and so I
was using these quite a bit in recent
days um now some makeup products that I
got I'm big big into these revlon
colorburst lipsticks i had a couple of
them already
and I got a couple new shades one is in
mauve and one is soft nude so soft nude
is like the lightest one and it's like a
serious nude lipstick I use this in a
recent tutorial so very much now give
you a definitely a nude lip I don't feel
like I'm talking about today a whole
week of you know anchoring and stuff and
now I can't talk this one mauve sort of
like a soft kind of berry tone I really
like that I just love how light these
feel but yet they're really colorful
they last decently you know decently
long time there's nothing really
annoying about the scent or anything the
packaging is cute you can see the color
at the end so you don't even have to
think you're like oh that's the one I
want to use today I'm going to post a
blog with some swatches of the ones that
I have so you can get a better look at
them so keep an eye out for that that I
just think these are fantastic lipsticks
and I just hope that they don't this
isn't one of those come and go
type parts of the Revlon line you know
there used to be a lipstick that they
sold that I really loved and it was the
any use guys tried the use of the Revlon
renewest lipsticks they used to have
these and then they started being sold
at Big Lots saying you know they were on
the way out but they had like the little
collagen or some sort of moisturizing
balm like in the center of the lipstick
and I love these but then they they were
only kind of like a temporary thing I
guess so
I hope the colorburst sticks around for
a long time because I really liked him a
lot
another Revlon thing that I'm wearing
today okay usually I really don't like
Revlon mascaras the double twist thing
was a nightmare for me I blogged about
that it's just I was just horrible but
the grow luscious by fabulous mascara is
a new one and apparently it's like a I
just got this the other day this is a
mascara and lash lash enhancer it says
96% of people who use this instantly
longer more lush lashes so that's just
the quality of the mascara but then I
guess some over time you're going to
improve your lashes overall appearance
and condition with each
so that's kind of exciting and I really
actually like this the very first time
this is the first day I've used it I
really do feel matte like my lashes feel
I mean they appear to be thicker and
longer but it's a really big brush news
Matt dropped it let's like do your show
it's about the size of that traditional
brush very large but I really like the
way it works so far and I usually I mean
there's very few mascaras that I kind of
like from the first try so I really
really am impressed with this and I'll
let you know how it goes if it if I can
really tell that my lashes have gotten
thicker or longer over time and the lip
gloss I'm wearing is from Milani 3d
glitzy glamour gloss some people on
Facebook had been talking about this
kind of gloss and how it's like similar
to Mac's dazzle glass or whatever this
shade I have is designer label it's kind
of a peachy coral shade and I have it on
right now it's really glossy I like it I
really do it's got kind of a brush tip
applicator it's a little sticky but I
think I have a feeling that's going to
allow it to be very long wearing as well
but it's it's got definitely like some
different tones to the there's some
little glitters in this I can't really
feel them a whole lot on my lips but
they're like some of them are peachy
some of them have like a rosy undertone
so you get like a lot of different tones
in this I like that what else is going
on here I haven't even opened this yet
but this is a Milani brow product dark
brown easy brow it says so it's like a
brow pencil with the little brush on it
on the end I'm getting more and more
into brow products I'm not really sure
why I really like this revlon colorstay
brow enhancer that I have with the two
ends the one that gives you the shimmer
under your brow and stuff really been
enjoying that I guess I'm just kind of
keeping my eyes out for other things I
always like that so I don't a lot of you
guys probably I'm sure you already know
about makeup geek on YouTube I really
like watching her videos I think she
does a really great job and she recently
used a drugstore product but I just felt
like I had to go get after I watched her
use it it was
the Maybelline trio and blue and bronze
glitz and I like this one I like using
these three shades though I wish it came
with like one dark brown shape because I
always pull out a dark brown when I use
this but one shade it's like coppery
gold one has light it's like a rose gold
almost with kind of a rosy tone to it
and then you've got like a champagne
color they're all shimmery and I like
using those with a dark brown I think it
makes a really pretty eye look and I
also got a trio from wet and wild from
my dollar store it started Dollar
General is selling several more makeup
brands than they used to it before it
was like some cover girls some la girl
some elf things and now they're selling
wet and wild Lorri Allen Maybelline and
different brands and I got this trio
called walking on eggshells and it's
just a very neutral you've got a
brownish crease crease shade and I
really got let got it for this pinky
it's like a golden e pink you can't
really see but I really like that
at the bottom and then you've got a
really light shade for the brow bones so
like that trio so far and yeah that's
what I've gotten lately those were some
of the things I'm trying some of the
things you can I guess request some
reviews on if there's anything you're
especially interested in I'm very
intrigued by the grow luscious mascara
so I'll let you know if that actually
works and like I said I'll have some
swatches of the color burst lipstick
