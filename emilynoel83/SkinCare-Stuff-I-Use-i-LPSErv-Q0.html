you my skincare routine I've had a
couple questions about that and I
thought it would just be a real good
basic thing to tell you about maybe
you've got some suggestions for me or
maybe you got some questions and I can
go into this a little further some other
time but I just want to give you a
rundown of what I use and how well or
and not-so-good it works for me first
I'll start with what I used to like take
off my makeup at the end of the day and
that would be the Olay daily facial
cleansing cloths I get the ones for
combination slash oily skin I just think
that that's pretty much keeps me from
getting you know greasy or whatever
throughout the day and night as well
these cloths are really great they're
especially great for travel too because
you don't have to like travel with a
bunch of washcloths it just has the soap
and everything just self-contained you
put it under the water it foams up one
side it's a little more like a scrubber
side and the other side is a little
softer so I'm it's kind of an
exfoliating thing too
it does take off all my makeup totally
it takes off my mascara online or even
you know step the cleanse to be long
wearing or waterproof it does a pretty
good job with that as well some people
get concerned with these irritating
their eyes now keep in mind my eyes
aren't super sensitive but they have
become irritated by the generic brands
of those face wash cloths but the Olay
ones have never given me trouble so if
you're looking for a good kind of all in
one thing that will cleanse your skin
you know kind of clear your pores but
also really get rid of all that makeup
and you can see it when you look back
down you're like oh my god I should that
was all on my face so those were pretty
good so I would recommend those I also
tend to use an eye makeup remover if I
do you know wash my face and I have some
stubborn areas or sometimes you wake up
in the morning and you're like I thought
that was all gone but it was it kind
I make up remover on hand and also
something you can just dip a q-tip in to
get rid of any mistakes so what I'm
using now is this oil free eye makeup
remover it's just something target cells
it's the one that's comparable to
l'oréal's eye makeup remover this is
pretty good it gets the job done it
takes away the makeup it's not maybe
quite as effective as the Neutrogena
oil-free eye makeup remover which was
what I had before this I really like
that the best I think it just it just
like sweeps it away this you might have
to work just a teeny bit harder at don't
get me wrong it does it does work but I
just felt like the Neutrogena stuff was
a little more effortless and getting the
makeup off so moving on to what I might
do to moisturize my skin I want to tell
you about several different kinds
because I really don't stick the exact
same moisturizer all the time a good one
to use actually before bed sometimes is
this over a complete touch of Sun I
don't know if any of you have heard
about this before it's been around for a
little while it is over a complete that
is a very popular moisturizer that they
sell it's got SPF 15 in it and and
that's a great moisturizer in itself but
this has a hint of sunless tanner in it
it is completely white as you would
squeeze it out of the out of the tube
here but it has it's like that gradual
sunless tanner so I had heard somebody
recommend once you know try putting that
stuff on before you go to bed because
then when you wake up your skin looks
really refreshed instead of looking so
sleepy and puffy and that kind of thing
and that is a good tip or you can also
put it on like before you put your
makeup on it really wants mess it up or
anything like that I just put it on me
way do something else wait a little bit
before I move on to my makeup in the
morning but this really does hook up
your skin a little bit you know if you
use it over the course of a week you
definitely gonna see a difference but it
is a gradual thing which means you know
if you're wanting a real major instant
result this is it
do that for you but if you want you know
a good moisturizer quality moisturizer
which Olay complete is and you want that
gradual tan that you don't have to pay
super close attention to when you put it
on this is really great
so I'm definitely recommend that day or
night is a good deal other things that I
generally use as a moisturizer when I
use most often just a great standby is
Neutrogena oil-free moisture its sheer
tint with SPF 15 this is a real diluted
tinted moisturizer you have some of
those it's like they say they're tinted
moisturizers and you're like oh well
this might as well be a foundation or
the other way around it's a foundation
and it's like wow this is really a
tinted moisturizer this is truly a
tinted moisturizer it does what you
would assume a tinted moisturizer would
do the color in it is a not a whole lot
it does function for me to even out the
skin tone a little bit perks up the skin
before you put your makeup on you know
great amount of moisture and also has
the SPF in there so that's always a good
thing to have in any moisturizer you use
this does not make a sheen oily it's
very very light so this is a great
summertime moisturizer so always a good
good bet good safe bet for moisturizer a
couple other times that I tend to use
throughout the winter time a little bit
more because they are a little bit
heavier and I am one of those people
that I can tell the change in my skin
from season to season and what I need as
far as moisture the Nivea simply glowing
I don't know if anybody's tried this I
don't know if this has an SPF in it or
not it's got a really nice set to it and
it just it just really without having
any color it's like a white cream it
just does something there's some sort of
like pulling this almost I want to say
to it not not shimmer or anything like
that there's no glitter in this
whatsoever but it just really revives
your skin and I'm really like that and
all
so the Dove essential nutrients day
cream this does has an SPF have an SPF
15 in it that's again like just a white
cream perhaps not quite as thick as the
Nivea brand but it is you know
relatively at thicker moisturizer really
great for those winter months when you
walk outside and that air just kind of
hits you that very dry air so those are
good that's and then I lastly I just
wanted to pass along a couple of sort of
skin care products that you may not use
on a regular basis but just you know
from time to time and one is clean and
clear Persie gel this is a 10% benzoyl
peroxide formula it was something that I
remember when my sister was younger she
would get a prescription to get this
stuff and now you can just buy it right
off the shelves of your drugstore it's
just sort of a spot treatment for acne
if or you know not really like I think
of acne is more of a widespread problem
but a blemish here and there if you get
one put this on go to bed you'll wake up
and it really dries it up wonderfully
well you know if you've got a stubborn
one maybe a couple days and but this
really will dry it up it keeps tends to
keep redness out of it and just a great
product for those if you're one of those
people just had the occasional blemish
and then the last thing is the Queen
hoenn mint julep mask oh my gosh this is
a great product if you smell it it's
just got that really nice like you
wanted to stick a spoon in it and eat it
seriously but it is a clay mask it just
really it makes your pore smaller it
takes care of any excess oil use it like
once a week I have to get out of the
shower it's just a really really great
thing it's green so you look like an
alien it's awesome so anyway that's all
I have to share about skincare today

request or if you want more information
