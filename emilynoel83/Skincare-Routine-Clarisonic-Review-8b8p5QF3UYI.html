opportunity in this video to update you
on my skincare routine because it has
changed quite a bit since last time so I
also thought it would be appropriate to
give you an update on the Clarisonic
which I got that around Christmastime so
I feel like I've had plenty of time to
kind of understand the effect it can
have on my skin and whether or not I
like it and that kind of lets you feel
like I've sort of streamlined my
skincare routine and I feel like my skin
is really at the best it's been probably
like looking back you know through my
youtube videos and things like that I
just feel like my skin is in a good
place right now let's get started at
what I do at the very start of the day I
just go ahead and give my skin a quick
rinse at the sink because I shower the
night before so I'm not in the shower
for this I just go to the sink and I've
been using this L'Oreal youth code youth
regenerating skincare foaming gel
cleanser just to give my skin a quick
rinse off so I've got a nice clean slate
for doing makeup so that's step one then
I use morning and night from philosophy
it's the I hope I cream this is a little
pricey this is probably the biggest
aside from the Clarisonic the biggest
skincare splurge I have but you get a
lot of product comes in a little pump
like this I would definitely caution you
as the lady who did the Sephora I
purchased this from told me don't do
like a full pump of this because you
will have way too much I just do just a
little bit and I've got plenty for each
eye but it's this claims to it says
multitasking eye cream for dark circles
puffiness and lines and I got to say I
have noticed a difference in fine lines
especially under this eye I don't know
why I know that I have the fine lines
more under this eye it's supposed to
that eye but I just noticed some little
lines kind of forming fine lines and
since I've been using this I just feel
like the area's just a little I don't
know plumped up maybe you might be the
wrong word but I feel like it it
definitely has had an effect on that
area because I noticed it whenever I do
my makeup so I use that morning and
night and
I Pat it around all through here and
also the tendency to have a lot of dry
skin around the inner part of my eye and
that really takes care of that then for
a morning like moisturizer day cream I
use the simple brand I talked about this
in my recent shopping list ideas this is
the sensitive skin experts they call
themselves vital vitamin day cream it
has an SPF SPF 15 good thing that wasn't
open and I just put that all over I feel
like it kind of brings some life back to
my skin in the early morning hour leave
I didn't say this in the start but I
have combination skin so I will get oily
a little bit in the forehead t-zone area
but I'll stay rather dry around my
cheeks and also I do have some dry spots
around my eyes so this kind of seems to
balance that I feel like it's not too
heavy for those oily areas but yet it
does get the dry areas under control too
so that's great I also do like the
Aveeno moisturizers and I will use those
for from time to time the ultra combing
and the positively radiant I think those
are both great options so then all my
makeup goes on and I go to work I come
home and at nighttime it's all about
getting the skin extra extra clean and
something I've been using a lot for my
whole life like since college basically
is the Olay daily facial cleansing
cloths lately I've actually been using
the equate brand which is you can save a
little money there I used they are the
hydrating face washcloths I think
they're called and they seem to work
fine I've never had a irritation with
the Olay and I really don't have that
with these either but the equate brand
is at Walmart and basically I take a
shower I use this it takes off all my
makeup I make up everything you twist on
my skin care has been the Clarisonic and
this is the clarisonic mia - I got this
on QVC for Christmas time and I think
this particular kind the package that I
got this and it's still available it
comes with philosophy purity made simple
cleanser it has a little case that goes
with this also the charger but basically
the
is a smaller version compared to the
full-size Clarisonic and I use this
several times a week after I get out of
the shower to just kind of get gift my
skin that extra deep cleaning and I feel
like I use the sensitive skin so it's
like the softer brush head and it came
with another brush head as well of about
this is when you turn it on it has a
little kind of like timer function and
like basically give you an assert amount
of time for your forehead and then a
certain amount of time for your chin and
your nose and then certain amount for
each cheek it's like it just beeps them
and prompts you along to the next phase
which i think is very cool you make sure
you don't like overdo it on certain
areas and you kind of get all of the
parts of your face attended to but this
is the sonic technology that is in like
the Sonicare toothbrushes so this brush
is not going to be making full rotations
it's going to be going back and forth so
fast like if I turn this on you wouldn't
even be able to see it move it's moving
that quickly and in that small of a
little like
back-and-forth movement I also have the
Sigma cleansing and polishing tool which
makes full rotations and that was what
initially turned me off of any type of
brush like this because when I first
used that on my face it was pulling I
felt like it was really pulling my skin
it was very uncomfortable to use and I
thought if this is what the Clarisonic
is like I'm not interested if they're
learning a little bit more about the
Clarisonic and that that it did not
operate in the same way I thought you
know this might be a great way to sort
of give my skincare routine that added
boost and even though I feel like I have
good skin this has made my skin better
definitely in terms of brightening my
skin in terms of areas where I have had
like sun spots in here and here
something about using this I don't know
if it's the exfoliation that's happening
more frequently but those have become
less of an issue for being less visible
just overall brightness of my skin the
size of my pores around my nose and
everything like that I mean I just feel
like there has been quite an improvement
in my skin and this was even emphasized
even more to me when I didn't use my
Clarisonic for a couple of weeks around
the time I had the pinkeye issue because
I just didn't want one more thing to
sort of be in contact possibly even
close to my eye area so I stopped using
it for a little bit and I could tell the
difference so some people use this daily
maybe even twice a day and I know that
that's that's totally cool but the
reason why I haven't been using it all
that much was because number one when I
started using it I just wanted to kind
of ease myself into it because I've
heard when people first start using it
their skin may have a little bit of a
reaction to this at first so I only used
it a few times a week and then I
realized I was noticing a difference and
I do use some sunless Tanner's on my
face and the dr. Dennis gross alpha-beta
globe had switch I may do an updated
sunless tanner video and talk about that
some more but those are like a little
pad you can use on your face and so like
one day I might use that and then the
neck
today after my shower you know I'll go
over my face with this and I'll use just
a little bit of soap just to kind of
give it something to work with so maybe
some of this or some purity and go over
my face and I just it feels so smooth
you'll have the smoothness on your face
that makes you want to go up to somebody
and say hey touch my face it feels so
nice so it's just been great and I feel
like as one who wears a lot of makeup
during the day for the news and things
like that makeup tutorials etc you know
it's very important to get it all taken
off I really really love this I was not
one who was quick to jump on the
Clarisonic bandwagon at first but I got
it as a Christmas gift and have just
really really enjoyed this so far and I
wasn't it cute to also need to let you
know what I do
nighttime moisturizing wise again the I
hope I use that so that's the second
time during the day that I use that and
then it's kind of a night cream i've
been using the Neutrogena ageless
essentials continuous hydration night
I've been using this for several months
now very happy with this I felt like for
a long time I was going to bed and
waking up as if no no cream had been put
on my face and dryness was kind of like
whatever I was putting on before it was
this is my face drank it up and it felt
dry in the morning which was just didn't
seem right to me and so I was in a sort
of a search for something that would be
more moisturizing without at the same
time making me wake up feeling like I
had an oil slick on my face so I used
this I put this on my face I go down my
neck with this as well that's an area
you do need to pay attention to just
feels very soft very silky when I put it
on my face I mean it just adds to that
smoothness I just feel really good after
I put this on I still have questions
about the Clarisonic or about my
skincare routine go ahead and ask them
in the comments section and I'll
probably go through there and maybe do a
follow-up blog kind of with frequently
asked questions or anything I might have
missed so I can I can make sure I cover
those things onic is not a small
purchase I mean this this is one of the
pricier thank beauty related things I
own so I want to make sure I'm informing
you and getting giving you the answers
you
one about that so thank you so much for
watching guys I'll see you next time
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
