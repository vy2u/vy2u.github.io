time to tune in for my latest skincare
video I've done maybe one or two of
these in the past but I'm always trying
new things and so when I kind of feel
like I've gotten on to somewhat of a
regular pattern of my skincare routine I
want to update you on that gotten a lot
of questions about it so I'm gonna run
through that but first I just really
want to say thank you so much to
everybody who has subscribed on my
youtube channel I'm getting close to
50,000 subscribers on there and I'm just
really thankful to everyone who not only
watches the video but seems to have
something constructive to say about it
or something kind to say it really means
a lot to me I really appreciate you
taking the time to do that and that
never really gets old to me you know I
never stop really feeling that feeling
like I love doing this and I love you
know teaching people something and so I
really really enjoy the feedback you
give me and also on my Facebook page and
Twitter
I just feel like I've made a lot of
friends out there and I feel like we
kind of have a nice little beauty
community together so thank you again so
very much for just taking the time in
your day to click on one of my videos
and watch it so it's really neat anyway
to the skin care routine there are a
couple of I guess parts to this routine
the morning wake up get ready routine
and then the go to bed take off the
makeup so I'm gonna just start at the
beginning of my day
the first thing I will do since I don't
have makeup to take off but I still want
to start with a really clean palette I
guess to put my makeup on I use the
purpose gentle cleansing wash as you can
see it got an allure Editors Choice
Award but this is it says clinically
shown to be as gentle as water soap free
hypoallergenic won't clog pores it's by
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and this is really the
most gentle face wash I've ever used but
it still manages to get my skin totally
clear you know it gets every any residue
or anything like that it manages to get
it off of my skin
sometimes I wake up in the morning and
my eyes might be a little red or you
know puffy or something you know don't
always get as much sleep as I need but I
feel like when I use something that's
really gentle on my skin it's not going
to provide any further irritation to
some of those places so I just like to
use something that rinses off really
easy you know I don't have to spend
forever with my head over the sink you
know just scrubbing it out with my hands
so it you know put it on washes off real
quick and I think feel like it gets the
job done for getting my face clean so
that is step one for me when I wake up
and then I go through sort of several
steps you're here with the
moisturization process we'll call it
first if I am having a problem area with
a zit or something like that
this has always been I think this has
been mentioned in other videos but this
has always been my go-to blemish product
it's clean and clear person Coop's
person gel 10 it's a 10 percent benzoyl
peroxide acne medication so I you I will
use that as a spot treatment I mainly
use that actually before I go to bed but
if something's still lingering when I
wake up this really does a good job of
just kind of drying up those problem
areas so definitely a fan of the clean
and clear person gel but then I will go
ahead and put on a serum and I use the
Olay Regenerist daily regenerating serum
and this comes in a cute little
container like this and I actually won
this when um I won one of those L video
star things on the Elle magazine website
and for I don't know views on one of the
videos that I put up there and so I got
this sort of compilation of just really
random makeup products and this was one
of the things and so it says Olay
Regenerist double skin's surface cell
regeneration rate versus untreated skin
for younger looking skin without drastic
measures so the main thing that I
noticed the main difference I noticed
with my skin when I use this product is
how smooth it feels I'll use it before
bed and in the morning and it just
really gives my skin
such a smooth feel to it and I've been
asked you know how old would you need to
be to use something like that um you
know I don't think that there's
necessarily an age where you need to you
know really really start doing
anti-aging I would say maybe 20s might
be normal for that but I mean if you're
concerned about this or if you have
problematic skin I would ask a
dermatologist or a doctor about you know
maybe finding the right skin care regime
for you but I do really like using this
though every morning before I get my
moisturizer on which takes me to my
moisturizer and you'll find that I'm
using basically the whole line of the
Olay age defying anti wrinkle that is
one you know how you go to the drugstore
and Olay is Olay is everywhere but they
have you know several different lines
and the age-defying anti-wrinkle it's
probably not one of the most expensive
or the most advanced in terms of the
anti-aging benefits but it is just sort
of I feel like a basic line of skincare
products and I've been using them for
probably more than a month now I would
say maybe a month and a half and I'm
really really happy with just the
texture of my skin how soft it feels and
I do feel like I'm sort of getting to
that stage where you know I may notice a
few fine lines around my eye area and
it's like okay I want to nip that in the
bud and try to give my face the best
hydration it can have because that's a
real key to you know in this whole
anti-aging thing that everybody's all
about right now you want to keep your
skin hydrated so I'm just trying to find
something that can sort of counteract
the aging process a little bit but I
don't necessarily have huge wrinkle
issues to correct at the same time so
see where I'm going with that just
trying to do what I can I guess so the
moisturizer I'm using is the age-defying
anti-wrinkle daily SPF 15 lotion so it
has the SPF in there and usually my
foundation has an SPF in it as well but
yeah just apply this all over your face
this feels a lot like Olay complete
which I recommend to a lot of people
just in general people needing a good
moisturizer that
not too heavy I mean it just it's it's
perfect for me because my skin can be a
little combination meaning I have some
oiler areas sometimes nose or forehead
and this is not so heavy to wear it
makes those places out of control so
it's just a nice standard moisturizer
works good for combo skin anyway so
that's what that looks like
and once I get done with that then I've
you know move on to a primer I'll use my
Smashbox photo finish or Rimmel fix
imperfect or something like that and
then get on with the makeup so that's
basically skin care for the morning so
then we go through the whole day and
nighttime comes and I need to take off
my makeup so what I will use for it oh
wait never mind getting ahead of myself
what I'll go use at night to take off
everything take off the eye makeup and
the face makeup is the Olay daily facial
sneak cleansing cloths actually just
bought a new box of these I use them for
combination oily skin but they have
different skin types as well and this
really stemmed from the need I had in
college to not want to wash a bunch of
washcloths all the time so these contain
you know your face wash they lather up
they take off everything for me I won't
say I have the most sensitive eyes in
the world but I can get this stuff in my
eye and it won't sting some of the
generic versions of this have stung my
eyes so I've stuck with this I think
I've mentioned this in pretty much every
skincare video I've done this has been
one of those long-standing things so
takes off the eye makeup takes off the
face makeup and if you have some
resistant eye makeup on there that
doesn't really want to come off very
easily just kind of treat it like you
might I makeup remover like hold it over
your eye and then kind of just really
let it soak in and then just kind of
wiggle it a little bit and it will sort
of break down some of that makeup so
yeah and I were you know for the news as
you all know I were full face and makeup
everyday and I really trust this to get
rid of everything so do that and then I
will moisturize actually I'm going to do
the Sarah
I take the makeup off this is the next
thing I do after I take it off at night
is back to that regenerating serum so
that's a twice a day thing and then I
have the night cream so this is your
daytime with the anti-wrinkle
age-defying
that's the day this is the night I don't
know if I said that backwards the first
time but basically this is this is the
age-defying anti-wrinkle replenishing
night cream and this is a little more
rich actually quite a bit more rich than
this but I'm not really worried you know
what I'm going to bed about you know
having shiny skin well I lay there in
bed you know but I just want to really
hydrate the skin since this these tend
to really strip your face of the all the
makeup and you know the moisture
moisturizing agents you've had in your
skin throughout the day I really want to
put back and so that's why I use the
night cream which is yeah you're just
just a nice little tub here white cream
not it's it's quite a bit thicker than
the other but still it's not like I mean
I've used some heavier creams than that
this cream and also the day cream are
oil-free and also just had to check my
facts on that it says dermatologist
tested oiled oil-free won't clog pores
and this claims to renews the renew
skin's appearance at night when it needs
it most well visibly reducing the
appearance of fine lines and wrinkles
the big claim here is that this product
is proven to reduce the appearance of
fine lines and wrinkles away intense
moisture with vitamin E replenishes skin
without added oil leaving skin soft and
smooth so yeah that's basically what it
does I always feel the need to sort of
let you know what the products claims
are so rather than just going off of you
know this is moisturizing and I like it
so anyway there's parts 1 &amp;amp; 2 of that
moisturizing line and then the eye cream
age-defying anti-wrinkle eye cream just
like this you're gonna just put this it
says use oops this says use this twice
daily around your eye area but I only
use
at night I don't want anything to
mooster I don't want too much moisture
around the eye area when I'm doing
makeup so I will put my regular
moisturizer there but I won't go in with
a heavier eye cream on top of that but
at night I do and so if this is the
least thick this is a little more thick
this is going to be a little bit closer
to the consistency of the night cream
and so I just dab that around the eye
area um I mean it's been working well
for me so far none of this stuff has
made my skin break out part of that I
think is the fact that it's all oil-free
so that's really good and what else do I
have here to mention a few little random
like add-ons things I might change from
the routine from time to time in terms
of masks that might be a thing I do you
know after I get out of the shower or
something like that
I like the Queen Helen mint julep mask
it's a good oil fighting mask if you
have blackheads and a lot of oiliness
you might enjoy this too it also comes
in a tube and it's green so you're here
you're gonna look kind of alien like
when you put it on I've even gotten
Tyler to do this with me as well he has
more oily skin so he'll do that with me
from time to time if he's not you know
playing PlayStation or whatever but I
also sometimes just get these randomly
I'm not necessarily recommending this
one cuz I haven't even done it yet but
these little masks that are at Walmart
or Walgreens for like two for two for a
dollar or I don't really remember what
they cost two for three dollars maybe
but they're just different like fruit
masks for different needs this is deeply
cleansed fresh and sparkling pore
cleansing fruit smoothie masks so they
usually smell really good I like the
peel off ones I don't I get some kind of
strange satisfaction out of the peel off
stuff so that's something I'll use from
time to time
also the Biore Pore strips that you you
know will peel off and they'll get rid
of blackheads on your nose I'll do those
maybe you know while this might be a
once a week type thing maybe doing a
mask
I might use the poorest trips once every
couple weeks just whenever I think about
it I'm like I haven't done that in a
while you know it's there I don't really
have it marked down on my calendar or
anything um another thing I might use
sometimes is my tan white sunless facial
tanner I talked about this a lot in my
video about how to wake up glowing so
some days if I feel like I want to give
my my skin a little extra perk up for
the next day after I get out of the
shower wash my face I'll put this on and
then you know later on I may go ahead
and put more moisturizer on top of that
before I go to bed you can do that but
this is somewhat moisturizing in itself
it doesn't break me out I can sleep with
it on and that's tan wise sunless facial
tanner and I got that at Sally Beauty
Supply
in terms of my eye makeup remover like
this pretty much the only this is from
Almay oil-free I also like Neutrogena
and Rimmel but I'll just take a q-tip in
this sometimes right before I start my
makeup and if I have any sort of residue
that's pretty much when I use this but
like I said I can count on those face
face washcloths to pretty much take off
everything else so that is my whole
skincare routine every one I've gotten a
lot of questions about it and I hope I
didn't bore you with all this
information but it's working for me well
right now I mean I feel like you know I
really do like to try different things
so this is not to say that I won't very
from this a little bit from time to time
to test something out or bring you more
information on this or that new thing
but this is what I've been using
consistently some of these things for a
long long time and some of these things
like the Olay age defying been using for
more than a month now have had good
results from that with my skin and I
didn't want to really sit here and
recommend these things until I knew the
effects on my skin would be positive so
thanks so much again for watching and
have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
