had mentioned in a haul video not too
long ago that I got my hands on the
sweet peach palette from Too Faced my
local Ulta happened to have it in stock
at the time I think it was sold out
online on Sephora site two-face site
Ulta site but at that point in time it
was like if you can find it in person
that's the only way you're going to get
it and actually even before I got this
palette I was noticing some different
things in my collection just based on
pictures of this that I'd seen it
actually seemed to have some really
similar shades so I was thinking you
know if I don't get this palette it's
fine but then what I finally saw that I
had access to it in person I'm like okay
let's go for it and maybe we can really
do some good comparisons here so this is
what the peach palette looks like it's
kind of in the style of those chocolate
bar palettes except instead of smelling
like chocolate it smells like peaches
now none of my alternatives smell like
peaches so I'm just going to burst your
bubble right there but there are several
like I think clearly peachy colors in
here and then you've got all these
different supporting shades you've got
highlights you've got some different
warm colors that I think play really
nicely with the peachy tones and then
you've got a few kind of interesting
colors to throw in with a couple of deep
dark plums some olive greens as well you
could certainly leave peach out of your
look and get a lot of other kinds of
looks with this palette but bottom line
a lot of neutrals with a few pops so I
thought okay let's do this the first
thing that I actually laid eyes on in my
collection before ever getting the peach
palette and I talked about this a little
on snapchat but this is a palette that I
think can give you some very similar
looks I'm not calling anything in this
video a dupe because it's not like I've
found something that has a shade for
shade like identical comparison to this
palette these are more like some
palettes that are kind of inspired by
some of the things I see in the peach
palette and the one I'm talking about
right now is this makeup revolution
neutrals versus neutrals palette and as
you can see it's got several peachy
shades it's got a nice warm brown to
work in there but there are a lot of
other neutrals as well you've got that
really dark like kind of sparkly plum
color
and I definitely saw that in the peach
palette in this bottom row you've got
everything ranging from pink to bronze
to taupe so pretty much any neutral you
wanted to mix in with the PG shades
you've got it and I'm wearing this
palette today I did a lot of this color
which is kind of like a mattr satin
finish peach all over the lid and then I
used a lot of this sparkly really dark
plum in the outer corner and then I kind
of blended just up above the crease with
this light rusty shade right there so I
love the quality of this I thought the
shadows were super easy to work with
this is probably one of my favorite
makeup revolution eye palette and using
those particular colors that I used from
this palette it's definitely a look that
you could get with the peach palette as
well so kind of a dupe type look I
really like how all these alternatives
are very budget-friendly as well the
other one I want to mention here is the
city color fig tastic palette again this
is not a total you know dupe for the
peach palette but it definitely has some
similar things happening with a couple
of peachy shades right over here you've
also got like a few little colorful pops
in terms of the purple and you have
something a little bit extra here and
different from the peach palette with
that magenta color I also really like
the gold that's in this palette as well
but you do have kind of a deep olive
green a really pretty dark plum so I
think this is a really fun palette and
if you are looking to do a look that had
a little pop of peachy color you could
definitely get there with this this next
palette is maybe a little bit of a
stretch but it's something that I think
would be nice for those people who do
want that little Coralie pop on the eyes
but don't necessarily want to load up on
tons of other warm shades because where
a lot of the supporting colors in this
palette I think have a lot of warmth to
them in this palette from sleek this is
called the oh-so-special palette you've
got a couple of kind of Coralie pinky
shades but then a lot of cool tones to
mix in with it kind of wear around it so
you've got the deep dark plum there's a
nice black in this palette that's really
nice quality kind of a warm bronzy type
shade overall I feel like it's got a lot
of cool tone things happening
so if you wanted more of a cool take on
sweet peach this might be for you my
next three things are smaller drugstore
quads are one of them's a five color
palette and I'm definitely not saying
like these are the equivalent to the
sweet peach palette because they're not
you know they're smaller but if you are
just wanting to pick up a little
something that could give you a pop of
peach on the eyes these are just a few
things that are out there a really nice
option I've worn this one quite a bit
actually is this L'Oreal color riche
quad and the shade is called shopping
spree and there's this beautiful matte
coral here and then kind of a golden
peach along with it and then a couple of
fun deeper tones to pop on one is kind
of like a silver mixed with charcoal and
then a matte black and the quality on
these is actually pretty good so if you
were just wanting that little coral pop
on the eyes that can definitely take you
there another one that I know I've
talked about for years this is one of my
favorite Maybelline eye studio quads and
the shade is coral Oasis and you can see
where the L'Oreal one is a little more
pinky coral this goes much more Orange
there I love this interesting like light
spring green like mixed between spring
green and lime green in there that's
really cool
a really deep dark rich brown and then a
pearly shade in there as well that makes
it really pretty highlight it is all
shimmer in this palette you can
definitely get a nice amount of contrast
when you work in the brown but just a
heads up on that I love that palette
those eye Studio quads are just a
fantastic texture and then the other one
I need to mention here and I think this
is still available on the NYX website
maybe a lot of you already have this one
in your collection and you just didn't
realize it's kind of similar to the
peach palette it's the NYX eat love and
be fat this definitely gives you a
pretty emerald green this beautiful
peach with golden shimmer a matte light
brown which is awesome for the crease
you've got kind of a golden a champagne
highlight and then a really deep dark
brown as well so there's one more way to
get that pop of peach in your look for a
very affordable price and I'm not trying
to say that this isn't a good palette or
a beautiful palette or a palette that
can give you some awesome looks I think
it's great but for the fact that it's so
hard to get your hands on you might be
look
for some alternatives so that's just
what I'm trying to mention in this video
some things that are sort of inspired by
this type of look and if you'd like to
see tutorials using any of the palettes
I mentioned please let me know and thank
you guys so much for watching I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
