is going to be a sleek makeup haul and I
had actually asked last week on the
Beauty broadcast Facebook page if there
were any like lesser-known or smaller
beauty brands that you'd like to see me
try and talk about and sleek was an
overwhelming favorite for many of you so
I placed an order lots of random
different things from I products lip
products several that I'm sporting on my
face today and I just thought it would
be fun to go through and show you what I
have I was so excited to do this video
this stuff actually came in last night
so this is definitely a whole and not a
review but I will show you swatches of
everything in case you're not familiar
with sleek it's a brand out of the UK
and I have tried a few products here and
there a couple eyes shadow palettes and
blushes something that's really exciting
about all this stuff is that it's really
a lot of kind of drugstore price range
items nothing that I have here is over
$15 and the palettes seem to be a little
bit more expensive like the face and eye
palettes but then a lot of the other
like little individual products seven
dollars five dollars six dollars just
was shipping from London the delivery
charges were only five dollars and 44
cents and I think it came and maybe just
over a week so I thought that was pretty
and everything came intact no broken eye
shadows let's jump in I'll start with
the eye shadow palette that I chose to
play around with today it's the eye
divine palette that's what these twelve
color eyeshadow palettes are cold and
this is the one in Garden of Eden and I
just thought the colors in here we're
stunning I really wanted to get
something you know with some more colors
that I could experiment with and I just
thought the Purple's the greens it all
looks so good on the website and just
really really stunning in person
I love how some of these purpley shades
are so unmute it's like they're all
various forms of kind of a soft lilac
some are deeper some are lighter but
just really really pretty one has like a
very nice golden eat own to it that's so
unique but something I've noticed is
certain shades
and there are two and this palette right
here and this brown one right here it's
like they've got a little glitter in
them but I don't feel like the the
sparkle really translates on the eye and
they turn out to be kind of met which is
cool with me I think those go on fine I
used today in this look I actually took
this gold and put that all over my lid
and then the brown in the crease and
that was it like I went very very simple
on the top part of my eye because I knew
I was going with this bright lip but
then couldn't help myself on the lower
lash line and I took a green liner to
kind of prime that and then I used let's
see what shade was it this one right
here to kind of top it off and brighten
it up these matte shades are amazing so
rich so dark eye palette that I got
again another 12 color palette and this
is called sunset
there's tons of shimmer in this one like
I wouldn't just say even shimmer but
really really metallic shade plenty of
pinky burgundy rose gold type things and
then some interesting pops like the
orange the orange is out of this world I
don't think I own an orange eyeshadow
that is that you know bold and really
pops maybe a slight disappointment in
this palette the black wasn't quite as
pigmented as I expected it to be it's a
matte black and I didn't think it was
anywhere close to the same texture as
those dark matte shades that I mentioned
in the previous palette face stuff I
really wanted to try this face form
contouring and blush palette and I have
it in the shade light and maybe you've
picked up on the fact that these
compacts all have mirrors on them and
they're all like really compact you know
they're very sleek as the name implies
and here you've got a matte like
contouring bronzer type color and a
shimmery highlight and then this blush
as well which is very shimmery I
probably would have liked to have seen a
little more color come out of that
because I feel like the main thing I see
in it is golden shimmer but I did use
this today I'm very very pleased for my
skin tone with the depth of this color I
think this is great for contouring
no problem with the highlight blush does
really come off very glowy I like the
look I mean I'm not complaining about
him but if you try to stay away from
shimmery blushes you might not enjoy
this as much but I also wanted to try
the face contour kit so kind of
interesting this basically is you know
the contour and the highlight - the
blush so a smaller compact I got this in
the shade medium and yes that looks like
a very very dark color there I was kind
of playing around with this last night
it didn't actually use this on my face
yet but it seems that you know your
initial swatch of that shade I mean it
just looks like chocolate right but when
you sheer it out um I think it may be
kind of workable I've sheared it out
just right there on my head the
highlight that's in here is kind of a
soft like champagne golden color so
pretty cool I just love you know the
little waves they're combining stuff in
these very compact palettes and then the
blushes sleek blushes have a pretty
great reputation I got this one called
it's blush by three and it says
intensely pigmented shimmer and cream
blushes and this is in the shade pink
lemonade and so I am I'm so pumped about
this I like had such a hard time
deciding what to use today as like why
would I do the contouring thing do I
want to use this but there's your cream
right in the middle and then you've got
two tones of pink blush on either side
one is definitely cooler you know like
kind of a bubblegum pink and this one
incorporates a little more corals so I
can't wait to see how those perform
layer it on top of that and then you
know you're getting a little more
intensity more staying power on my lips
today I got one of the pout things I'm
so excited about this this totally
reminds me of my OCC lip tars so that's
great it's a super concentrated lip
product you just squeeze it out apply it
with a lip brush and it's just very very
intense color I have it in the shade
rosette so that's this beautiful like
hot pink color going on here I could not
be more pleased I mean it just went on
so smoothly evenly I've eaten some
breakfast I have not touched it I you
don't haven't added anything else to
absolutely thrilled with this it's the
kind of product that you try one it's
like I think I'd like every shade in
that please also got one of these lip
glosses it's just it just says high
shine lip gloss with vitamin E and this
is in the shade angel delight looks like
a pretty typical lip gloss I just wanted
to get you know a little sampling of
different things to see what the brand
really had to offer and so this looks
like kind of a peachy rose
type color it's got your traditional doe
foot applicator then I got one of the
lipsticks and first off
behold the squat eNOS of this tube I
think it's so darn cute I love the size
of this and I got it in the shades the
true color lipstick it's matte and this
is the shade called heartbreaker and I
thought this would be just fabulous
going into spring and summer I mean look
at the brightness of this shade and I
love how it's a pink but it's definitely
got some warmth to it it's got a little
bit of coral thrown in there and it's
crazy because I swatch this and I had to
swatch on my hand for maybe I don't know
30 seconds and then I'm trying to get it
off with a wet wipe and you know the
swatch remains
it's definitely staying some so I think
this is going to be a super long wearing
lip product I'm just judging by that I
also got a mascara and I tend to kind of
like some of these mascaras that have a
primer on one end and the mascara on the
other well let me rephrase that
some I have really disliked that I've
dried from the drugstore some I have
loved I love L'Oreal double extend so I
thought this might just be fun to try
and see how it works
and it says magnitude lengthen on the
primer side and magnitude volume eyes on
the black sides like a pretty
traditional standard type brush there on
the primer end and on the other end the
bristles seem like maybe a little bit
shorter and like it's perhaps a bit more
tapered and I think I am also seeing
maybe some little micro fiber type you
know pieces that could latch onto your
lashes and kind of extend them out more
so did not use that today I just forgot
I should have used it
I just reached for my closest mascara
earlier but yeah I will definitely try
this I put on some false lashes today as
well with this look last thing I got and
this is probably the only thing was just
that was just a little bit disappointing
to me and I feel like such a doofus okay
because it wasn't like I was trying to
pick out my exact one shade of a
foundation or powder or whatever it was
a little sampler pack so assuming you
can get your range right you will have
probably a shade in there that works for
you okay I got the cream to powder
foundation tester kit and I chose the
shade light to medium perhaps I did not
research this enough but I just kind of
thought light to medium that's probably
me right and the shades are so dark this
is actually a little like compact I love
you know that they have something like
this available but on yeah everything's
pretty deep the texture of these very
creamy um I don't know that I notice it
going to a super dry finish which I
actually kind of like but yeah the
shades in here are latte
creme caramel honeycomb praline and
sweet honey so and it does say light to
medium on the back so I was kind of
surprised at how dark those works that
is my sleek whole thank you guys so much
for just bringing this up to me on the
Facebook page I mean it's definitely
been a brand that I've been aware of and
I have even tried a few things from but
clearly I needed to try more because I
needed to get one of these pal paints as
far as my initial reactions go loving
the pout paint really really excited
about the eyeshadow palettes
particularly the Garden of Eden one and
also I cannot wait to try the blush by
three that has the cream and the powders
at it together so yeah I think it was a
success thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
