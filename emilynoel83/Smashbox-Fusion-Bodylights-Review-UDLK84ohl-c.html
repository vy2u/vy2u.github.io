going to be doing a quick review today
on a product from Smashbox that I find
myself reaching for almost every day and
it is called the fusion body lights
bronzing powder and the shade is the
strip and basically what you've got is
this huge compact that is larger than
the palm of my hand and you open it up
and you've got a big big mirror here but
you've also got a lot of bronzer and
it's three different tones you've got
kind of your main kind of warm bronzy
shade there if I were to smart swatch
that in a concentrated way on my finger
you can see it's got a little bit of a
coppery tone to it then you've got a
light shade here that's just kind of
light and shimmery and then sort of a
more golden tone right there at the top
and basically what the concept here is
is that you can take your big fluffy
brush like I have this random kabuki
brush here from I don't even know where
I got this but it's just really nice and
fluffy you just swirl it around in there
get all those colors mixed together and
then you can put that on any you know
part of your body you want you can put
it on your face some people who tend to
gravitate more towards Matt bronzers for
the face so they don't look too shiny
you may not want to use that for your
face but if you do like some shimmer you
could use it as like a face highlight
but you can also use this all over your
body you can use it on your decollete
area like I did here like I just
basically swirled my big brush right
here in the product like that get some
on the brush and then just kind of you
know put it right here on your neck area
down in here you know just to kind of
make yourself look a little more give
yourself a little more color sometimes
we cater so much to our faces with using
blush and bronzer and then before you
know it you look down you're like a man
you know maybe I need a little more
color there as well or maybe it's just a
special occasion and you want to just
perk up your entire look maybe you did
some sunless tanning on your face and
you did some on your body as well but
you want that last little finishing
touch that's sometimes what I like to do
is use this once I've used a sunless tan
and if your shoulders are showing how
gorgeous is that Ted that little bit of
shimmer there on your arms so I really
like that aspect of it just do keep in
mind that if you're getting this with
the intention of using it a lot on your
face there is shimmer in this and if
you're not comfortable with shimmer on
the face this is I think primarily a
body product the shade is really nice I
feel like it's just kind of a warm
bronzy tone as ice watch that you know
my finger look kind of coppery but
you're never going to get that
concentrated of a look on your skin if
you use a nice big fluffy brush with it
and you don't need to necessarily have
like the perfect brush to use with this
if you've got any brush sitting around
that is just a little more full maybe
more full than you would typically use
on your face and just use it all over
because you're not doing any tricky
blending you're just kind of buffing it
on all over your body and another really
unique thing about this is the scent it
actually has sort of a tropical scent
like I'm kind of thinking like I'm sort
of a coconut tropical thing going on it
reminds me of the scent of like a really
good smelling um sunscreen or something
like that and i like that i think it
makes me feel a little more summery it's
the dead of winter there is like six
inches of snow on the ground where I
live and I don't know I just felt like I
needed to pick me up in most days I do I
mean if I'm wearing anything that
exposes this area I like to put a little
bit of that on there because I just feel
like it really amps it up and also what
i would do before i got this was just
used the bronzer that i might typically
use on my face and just use a little
more in here and then i realized i'm
using a lot of product and you know i'm
wasting what I would use on my face so
this is kind of nice because you have a
very large amount and you can just kind
of reserve that for your body I mean you
could even like if you were wearing a
dress and you really wanted to highlight
your legs put a little of this like
right down the front of your shove your
shin and your legs will look even more
like highlighted and elongated I mean
there are just so many like little
tricks you can do on yourself to make
yourself look
you know slimmer more glowing and just
all over your body so something kind of
a unique product I haven't really done a
lot with body type makeup but that's
sort of what this is so it's the
Smashbox fusion lights in this strip I
kind of not used to saying that because
this is the first product of its kind
that I have so thank you so much for
tuning in for this video everyone and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
