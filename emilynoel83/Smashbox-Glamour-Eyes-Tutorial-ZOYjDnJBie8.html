tell you about today actually it's
something that i don't necessarily know
a whole lot about yet because it's the
first time i'm trying it is the smashbox
masters class glamour eyes for brown is
this so this is a brown eye kit i got
from sephora it has everything you need
to have seven different products to
create this I look that I have on now
just like a smoky Navy look I tried to
follow it to a team in this tutorial
just using their direction so basically
this is a tutorial of me doing following
a tutorial but basically this is the
look that I'm going after right here the
smoky look and it what's really nice
about these kits this is not the first
one I've picked up primitive or I've
gotten different ones that were like you
know maybe like a face kit or different
things like that but this has
step-by-step instructions on how to get
it so that's what I'm going off of
throughout this entire look and it's
really nice because there's pictures you
know you've got like essentially a
diagram telling you what you need to do
there and these are all the products
that come with it and they're all there
in that kit and you've got your shadows
your liners I'm you're going to see me
use all this stuff and a brush that you
use in a lot of key ways although there
are occasionally the needs to use other
brushes with this look but anyway it's
very self-contained and very uneasy to
follow the direction so if you want to
see how this look turns out for me just
keep on watching everyone is to take the
photo finish lid primer and it says to
put that all over your eyelid so just
dab that on and blend this feels um kind
of similar to Too Faced shadow insurance
only it's a little thicker and seems to
therefore neutralize like the natural
color of your lid and sort of eliminate
you know the color that you have on
there naturally you can see how it
really just looks completely you know
neutral at this point okay the next step
is to apply the jet-set water
proof eyeliner and this is in midnight
blue what came with it you can see it's
just a nice creamy shade there it says
to apply that with the smudger brush
that's the one brush that came with us
and that's really the only brush you
would need to do a lot of these initial
steps here but anyway it says to use
that to line the upper inner rim of your
eyes well I didn't follow directions the
first time and I applied it on the upper
lash line all you really can't tell that
because what so many other products are
layered over it but i'm probably going
to go ahead and do that anyway just
because but anyway this is a really
really small brush and I'm just going to
get some of that on the tip and then I'm
just basically going to pull up slightly
here on the inner rim and just apply
that product okay and then I'm going to
go ahead and just apply a little bit of
that on my natural upper lash line it
doesn't say to do that in the
instructions that's the one part time
I'm deviating here because I didn't do
it on purpose but I want my eyes to look
even I just basically read it wrong and
thought it said upper like lash line
instead of upper rim so I'm just
applying some of that jet set and it's
just a gorgeous creamy blue so I'm kind
of glad I got to see how it looks on
natural skin as well but just apply that
all over the lash line if you want to
otherwise I'm just go along with the
directions and ok now I just kind of
smudged the jet set on there with the
smudger brush and that is the waterproof
on liner that this gives you then you
get a regular cream liner as well in
blue steel so that color is a little
more shimmery a little um a tad bit
softer but it's just a little more
reflective it says applied that to your
lash line so I just kind of applied you
know they're very close to the same
color so this is going to do virtually
the same thing but apply that to your
lash line and then it says blend that up
to the crease with your smudge brush I
believe ya with the same brush so I'm
just gonna go over what i did there
this is a little bit creamier the cream
liner is even though the jet-set is a
cream product and this blends a little
easier and is clearly being used here as
a as a base sort of color and it's a
dark base which I don't use a lot of
usually but I am now trying to follow
the directions and so as you can see
even though it said apply that up to the
crease I'm doing that but I'm kind of
going with a little outer V because that
is sort of the look that they give their
with their um their demo pictures I
guess you'd say so I'm just going to
apply the keep applying keep dotting it
on all the way to the crease now you'll
notice by looking at each I this I looks
super diffused out and that's because we
need to bring in a shadow on top of all
this and it says to use the deep blue
shade in this eyeshadow quad so that's
that one right there it says layer the
deep blue shade from the quad over the
cream liner to diffuse and smoke out the
color using an eyeshadow brush so on an
actual eye shadow brush other than the
smudge brush did not come with this kit
so just used whatever you want i used my
Smashbox number 32 brush this is
obviously from a special collection that
I got a while back but I'm just going to
get some of that on sort of pact that
all over and then I may take a crease
brush just to really get in the crease a
little more with that so again this
shade coordinates beautifully gives as
you can see as soon as I put it on there
some more depth to the color it more
like sparkle basically which is great
you know if you're doing these smoky
looks um I think it's gorgeous to have
like a sparkle that's really pretty and
soft you know not like over the top but
just oh this is gorgeous these colors
and shades are just a dream to work with
and so you can see like anywhere that it
wasn't perfect i mean i was using a
teeny tiny smudger brush to get that
color all over that pretty large air
especially because I was creating an
outer V with it on you wouldn't
necessarily have to do that but um
trying to be as close to the pictures I
can get I guess but yeah I mean it was
not the most perfect little base that I
had drawn down there of the liner and
now this is just really perfecting the
outer edge I noticed that a lot with the
other side too then I'm going to take my
fine crease brush just to continue to
build up that shadow and I can really
get in my crease with that so basically
I'd say use whatever shadow brush you
want just to get that all down there
alright the next step moves us down to
the lower lash line and it says to smoke
out the lower lash line first apply
jet-set waterproof eyeliner that was the
one in the little glass jar on using the
smudger brush to the inner lower inner
rim so our water line is going to get
line here with this I love how the
instructions are already here this is
really an easy tutorial for me let me
find my side your brush okay so that's
the liner that's the one that I put on
the inner upper rim already and my lash
line and just going to get a little bit
on this little brush and just apply that
to the lower waterline here all the way
to the inner inner corner so now that
we've applied the waterproof product
just kind of take waterproof waterline
and that's kind of how the this little
tutorial works so the waterproof product
on the water line so that should stay
hopefully all night for me and I'll
report back on how well that really
works but then it says to take that same
brush and use the blue steel cream liner
and put that on your actual lower lash
line so I'm going to load up my brush a
little bit and kind of just blend in Wow
a little bit goes a long way that's a
lot of product they're blending that in
with my outer sort of V that I had going
on there may have to blend back over I
think it calls for some shadow to top
this off so that should take care of
that and then I'm just blending it in
with
well it's a small brush it's still a
little bigger a little thicker than I'm
used to for a liner but this is what
gives us that smokey look it's going to
turn out to be you know a little less
precise and a little more smokey so I
can use that kind of training i think we
all can now they're calling for the deep
blue shadow in the quad and it basically
sense to just layer that over the top to
soften this up even more and to kind of
set that liner as well so that smudger
brush again this is really easy we're
not using a ton of different brushes
here so just pack a little bit of that
shadow on and we're just going to go
over what we just did softening the
corner and just going right over the top
of what we put on there this is great
because while this shadow is super soft
and pigmented it's not giving me like
problems with fallout knock on wood as
soon as I say that I might have issues
but um no seriously it's going on really
well with and being a dark shadow you
always fear that you know that's going
to fall all over your cheek even if he
and it's so soft and riches this is that
would be a problem but not having an
issue right now so just going over
everything they're softening it up next
comes a really fun product that was kind
of a big reason why I bought this and
it's the i-beam double-ended brightener
and it has one side for brow and one
side for I and the brow side is more
just a light tone pencil there's not not
really any shimmer to it is just to kind
of brighten up under the eyebrow and so
it says to take that kind of up under
the brow just in highlight a little bit
and I just went back to this lightest
shade and just top that off a little bit
I thought it just made it seem a little
more blended and bright there you go so
just use a fluffy brush and do that if
you choose and then we're going to take
the more shimmery side which is the I
side and it says to use that on the
inner corner and technique I've been
using a lot lately and not necessarily
with this product but this is absolutely
perfect for it
and we're just going right around what
we did there it's keeping it bright it's
just bringing light to a very dark look
and so just go around the tear duct and
then I mean I once again we have what's
going to be a very long wearing look I
believe with all this waterproof liner
and creams with powders layered on top
so I don't see why not just layer a
little bit of that white once again
right over this it's going to give it
the very same look just a little more
staying power and I'm going to use my a
detail brush this is the C 148 mini
contour it's from coastal scents and I'm
just going to pack a little bit of that
white right in there love the kind of
glossy look that that gives even though
it's a powder I tell you it couldn't
look more dewy and glowy it says
complete the look with two coats of
Bionic mascara to the upper and lower
lashes once again this came with the kit
and it is in indigo ink so it's a blue
mascara you wouldn't probably be able to
tell that by this look but it is blue
and this whole look really is great for
brown eyes I feel like it really is
making my eyes stand out using all this
blue around your eye does make the
whites of your eyes pop a little bit
more so anyway I'm going to apply this
mascara to goes to the top to go to the
bottom and I'll join you with the
finished look
hey everybody I'm back with the finished
look oh well that's her that's her than
the box with the finish look this is my
finished look I think it looks it's a
pretty decent duplicate of what's going
on here with these shadows I love this
kit I love this expert or in my
expertise it's the master's class could
I have the expertise one as well but
there are several different looks you
can achieve with this and I chose to do
the signature smokey look what's great
about this kit is that has a little a
very detailed fold out to show you all
the different I looks you can achieve
with this kit and so I chose the smokey
look great for brown eyes lots of fun
Navy shades incorporated are not
necessarily lots of different shades but
lots of different products that kind of
layer one on top of the other for what I
hope will be a long wearing look here on
my lips it was there was nothing
included for lips in this kit for this
look because it was a I kit obviously um
so what I went ahead and did was judging
by the picture I mean she just has kind
of a nude lip so I put on my wet and
wild lip liner in number 666 brandywine
and that's just kind of a neutral sort
of bronzy with hints of red in it
layered that up with on my Maybelline
volumizing Excel seduction lip color
it's just a very nude shade it's called
in the nude and then I top that off for
a little shine with a Smashbox product
in honor of Smashbox in a gilded this is
a gloss that's just a pretty gold kind
of peachy not sure if this is a limited
edition or not because it came in a set
around Christmas time but anyway um I'm
just so pleased with how this turned out
these are some new techniques from me
I'm lining my upper inner waterline yeah
that was new but I enjoy how I feel like
sometimes I feel like lining my
waterline primarily the lower that's
what you're seeing more I feel like it
makes my eyes look kind of closed in but
somehow this look I mean I feel like my
eyes look bright and awake and yet
really kind of
Ian smoldering at the same time so I
hope you guys like this look and are
kind of excited about this kit and how
fun it is to try to duplicate the looks
that are in there I may have to try the
other ones to show you how those turn
out but um oh also on my face I have
another new product I've got the benefit
tin which is a Scota like a bronzer side
in a highlighter side so I use some of
that i use my standard Milani bronzer
it's the Milani sunset duos bronzer one
of those just kind of all over for that
wash of color and yeah just really
excited about the eye look thank you
guys so much for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
