talking about some products from
Smashbox new holiday stuff and I have a
history of having some very good
experiences with Smashbox holiday kits
but actually the first item from this
art loved color collection that I
purchased I didn't love it so much
and it kind of put me off from buying
anything additional from this line until
very recently I did cave and go ahead
and buy their Ulta exclusive kit and I
love that so it's kind of one of those
split reviews but I'll give you all the
swatches of course all the details on
both of them you may have different
opinions than I do when it's all said
and done but I just thought it would
make sense to put them in the same video
in case you were deciding between them
and so the things that I am talking
about are the art love color masterclass
palette it's a really big palette it's
the same kind of size as their master
class 3 palette that I talked about a
lot last year but this is available at
Sephora and it's $65 and then the other
part that I'll be talking about is $49
it's available at Ulta and it's a series
of three separate palettes so it's kind
of a cool concept with this Holiday
Collection because it really doesn't
scream holiday it just screams bright
bold and kind of different because they
partnered with an artist his name is
yago hortal and that's where the outer
design comes from and this is really
cool I don't know if you can tell but
there is a texture to this almost like a
dried paint type texture so you take
this little band off and it opens up
like a book and here's all your product
on the inside I could see this being so
like makeup artist friendly if you had
all of your you know products sitting
out on a table open to the air you can
have these and they fully open with
these windows but you could keep them
nicely covered when they weren't in use
also these palettes will completely
detach from the book if you wanted to
use them like that but when you first
open it up this is just a little card
like kind of a bio on the artist and
then inside the back panel it's kind of
like an old-school binder that you've
got here you got your little folder and
this has just a bunch of different like
face chart style cards I'm showing you
different looks I'm gonna be doing a lot
of comparisons makeup wise to the
Smashbox masterclass 3 palette which
last year for a couple of reasons eh
last year it was kind of like the
premier big gift that I talked about one
of those big-ticket makeup items that I
really thought would be a great quality
gift and B that's still available and
it's the same price as this so as I've
been using this over the past few weeks
I've definitely been drawing some
comparisons but what you have in here
are a bunch of the eyeshadows which are
the smaller size circles and then you
have several blushes up top sunset down
here is a blush and then also several
soft light shades which is basically
Smashbox is version of highlights
Smashbox really does a great job with
their eyeshadow palettes incorporating
all different finishes you never get a
Smashbox palette and feel like oh my
gosh you know it's just all the same
finish over and over again like a really
generic you know standard shimmery
eyeshadow let's say all throughout they
really switch it up they did it very
well in the master class 3 palette also
in there I think it was called the on
the rocks collection was their specific
holiday collection last year and I
thought there was such great variety you
had metallic shades matte shades lightly
shimmery shades satin finishes same
story here with the exception of the
little green row it's all shimmery but
in every other vertical eyeshadow family
you've got at least two matte shades in
terms of the color selection I feel like
overall there's a lot of cool toned
colors in this palette and your
selection of straight-up neutral shades
is pretty minimal I mean you're dealing
with one brown and it's a dark brown
there's no like mid-tone Brown you know
that kind of Brown that people like to
kind of throw in the crease is just a
soft crease color I would have really
liked to have had you know maybe one or
two shades of that nature to play around
with and mix in with some of these more
colorful looks I mean this palette is
loaded with pretty shades and pigmented
shades and like I said a great variety
of finishes I just think some more
neutrals would have made it even more
versatile I don't know maybe for me the
everyday makeup using person quality
wise I love the Smashbox photo op
eyeshadow formula and there are only
maybe a few exceptions in this palette a
few that I found to be more flaky than I
anticipated the Shea
called see cosmic is extremely hard to
control
I thought silver moon can also be a
little bit tricky but as a whole a lot
of your mid-tone shades your matte
shades your really colorful shades
really great stuff fabulous quality on
the blushes here I think you get a
generous amount of them a little bit
definitely goes a long way the soft
lights colors and glow prism and shimmer
are all gorgeous like I love the three
different tones there and I don't want
to make this video all about the master
class 3 because I know I talked about it
a lot last year but I just want to show
you this is a little bit more of a
straightforward layout I feel like
you're getting a much larger selection
of just straight-up neutral shades both
warm and cool matte and shimmer I feel
like this is just a really well-balanced
side to the palette and then your colors
you're getting a lot of bright pure
colors kind of like the newer one is
giving you but I know anytime I've gone
into these I've always pulled quite a
few neutrals to kind of round out the
look and I felt like the quality across
the board eyes shadow wise on this
palette was spectacular like I wasn't
finding little shades here and there
where I was thinking ooh that one's kind
of tricky to use you know it was really
great eyeshadow wise and then the
contour products here the contour bronze
and highlight these were the exact same
three that are sold in smash boxes
individual contour palette they are so
good this is a huge draw I think for
this palette the fact that those are in
there plus the blush shades in here are
great as well each one different from
the next so I guess I just wanted to put
out there if you're looking at a palette
of this size this price range yes this
packaging is absolutely spectacular on
the outside but as far as the products
are concerned this one really continues
to WoW me way more like it's every
neutral look you could want to do plus
some fun pops of color that are very
very pure and very pigmented and this
does have a bunch of like get the look
cards with real faces which I kind of
prefer and then they also give you blank
face charts in the back if you wanted to
fill those out moving on I would like to
talk about the kit that's available at
Ulta so here you're getting three
separate palettes this is what they look
like when you get them out they're all
in a sleigh
that says the to and from I'm sorry but
this is like deluxe stocking stuffer
materials so you slide it right out of
the sleeve you've got just a classic
little skinny pallet here there is a
mirror in each one of them which I love
it's the same like configuration same
design as Smashbox is regular full-size
you know trios that they sell and then
each one has a blush just compare the
overall vibe of these little palettes to
this one first off portability you
definitely got that with these because
just taking one with you takes up no
room here I'm not saying it's not
durable or it wouldn't travel well but
it's just big also you're dealing with a
lot more color in this one if you're
going for color these may not have
enough of it in there for you a few of
these little trios have some pops but
nothing to the extent that that larger
palette does these are a little more
like everyday neutral type colors smoky
colors that Smashbox definitely brought
it with the quality the photo op
eyeshadows are great the blushes are
great in here the first palette I'll
talk about is kind of my favorite I'm
wearing this trio right here I also
pulled a matte crease shape from one of
the others I wouldn't have had to but I
was just playing around and it says all
of the shade names on the back there are
a few shades here and there that I have
in the master class 3 palette and also
this trio here the one that hasn't has
nectar cinnamon toast and roast in it
that actually is the trio that Smashbox
sells in its regular line on its own so
that's kind of cool but this shade right
here you kind of see it among the others
and your eye can play a little bit of a
trick on you because I glanced at it and
I almost think that's pink but that's
actually kind of peachy and I love the
way that pairs with this shade right
here it's so unique it's kind of like a
combination of pink and rust it has the
most gorgeous Sheen and then this
sparkly plum down here absolutely
stunning so I've got a little bit of
this on the lid a lot of this like
blended up above the crease and a lot of
plum in my outer corner and like I said
a matte Brown in my crease this other
trio just very neutral very easy you've
got your matte cream shade kind of a
shimmery bronze a taupe and a shimmery
deep brown and then sunset is your blush
that is also in the larger art love
palate I'm wearing that on my cheeks
today that's all I'm wearing blush wise
it's one of those surprising like it
looks like such a soft shade a
borderline neutral type blush shade but
it's so pretty on the cheeks this next
one is definitely your most basic color
selection still superior quality but
it's the most neutral and it's got the
most mattes in it as well this whole
trio right here is matte and then this
shade right down here it's it's not
quite black it's just really close to it
and then you've got a nice shimmery
champagne and then this cool taupe with
golden shimmer that's kind of a unique
twist on it and the Blessed shape is
called flush and that is one of the
blushes in the Masterclass 3 palette
really love this shade it again comes
off a bit more intense than it even
looks in the palette and that's always a
nice surprise with blushes so if you've
got a person who you know prefers mattes
you're kind of classic glamour friend
and this would be a nice one for them
and then this final palette is full of
pretty cool tone shades really adore
this trio right here because this shade
I mean I don't know if the cameras doing
it justice but it's like a grey with
maybe a hint of lilac in it and this
shade down here is like an incredibly
dark plum it's called royal and I
believe that was in the master class 3
palette last year it's gorgeous
so you're getting a soft shimmery a
little bit pinky shade there this really
deep blue that has kind of a satin
finish a soft lilac and then this
interesting shade here kind of a fusion
between lilac silver and blue it's very
pretty and the blush shade here is
passion so if I had it to do all over
again I probably would not buy this
palette because I feel like the
Masterclass 3 which I already had has
tons of great color selection a better
neutral selection the contour and
highlight shades plus the blushes I mean
it's just everything I want to need if
you're wanting to get someone a really
deluxe great quality makeup gift $65
it's pricey but everything in here is
fabulous and then this kit I think it's
a total winner if you were to keep all
these for yourself if you were to split
them up they've made that very easy for
you to do but it's more of a neutral
lover's kit I love them I think the Shea
those are great quality the blushes are
great quality I have compared blushes
you know that I had seen show up in
these to the larger palettes the quality
is very consistent with those I totally
have this high standard for the photo op
eyeshadow formula and I'm really really
looking closely at these shadows to make
sure you know they didn't just water it
down for a holiday kit and I don't think
they did thank you so much for watching
this review I hope it answered some
questions for you continue let me know
in the comments section what holiday
kits you want to see reviewed next and
I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
