video because you remember back in the
Emily Awards when I talked about this
amazing creamy rich pigmented eye shadow
formula that doesn't flake of it goes on
super easily blends like a dream
well it's smashbox photo up and i'm
using the mega palette in this video
this is an amazing palette i got off of
QVC months ago and this has been a real
go-to product for me for just getting
ready for work or just forming different
looks with any colors i could possibly
want and there's also a great panel in
here for face products and eyeliners and
lips and things like that so we're gonna
be diving into everything with this
video this look i feel like as you see
me head on you think okay this is kind
of a fresh you know natural look but
really there's something special going
on here with the eyeshadow i know there
are a lot of palettes out there that
brands put out and you know they're
filled with kind of a lot of generic
shades but in terms of this palette
these are all full-size trios that
smashbox actually sells individual if
you were to go to an Ulta or a sephora
you would find these trios sold
individually but for this palette
they've all been kind of sectioned off
so it's a real no-brainer you can see
the name of the trio the names of the
shades and how they've all been kind of
divided up and then you have a couple of
quads actually down at the bond so I'm
going to be using the trio in quick take
which has vanilla ambient and serpent
you want to duplicate this look keep
your eye out in your collection for a
matte creamy color a shimmery gold and
kind of a deep shimmery emerald green so
here's how to get the look all the
brushes I'm using or by Sigma by the way
used a flat brush to pick up ambient
which is the gorgeous gold here and I
just packed that on the inner part of my
lid
instead of doing a typical champagne or
silver color like I would do I went with
gold which I think still provides a lot
of brightness around the inner corner of
the eye next I cleaned off that brush
and then we went to the deep green shade
called serpent I picked up some of that
patted down the outer part of my
pull the color up into the crease just a
little bit and then we're going to use
the line that this brush can create to
kind of angle upward at the outer part
of the eye and this is just gonna create
our shapes it's really easy because
you're shaping exactly where you want
that shadow it comes to kind of blending
with the gold you know when your brush
is just a little bit bare you know you
can kind of just Pat over that line
these blend really effortless just take
a liner brush anything you want go into
the green and we're gonna take that
underneath the eye so Green is going to
be kind of like our lower liner on our
natural lash line then I'm gonna use a
fluffier brush gonna go into ambient
again that gorgeous gold shade and
that's gonna be kind of our buffer shade
between skin and the deep green then you
can you know clean off that brush get a
different fluffy brush and go into the
matte shade which is vanilla and I just
took that in the remaining space between
my shadow look and my eyebrow xed try to
round up a dark green eyeliner that's
what I'm gonna be using in my waterline
I wanted something that was going to be
provide the depth in that area but not
quite as much intensity as a black so I
think a dark green coordinates well with
the whole look so I'm using Mally's ever
color automatic eyeliner in fierce for
hello op mega palette does contain some
cream liners so I'm going to be using
caviar which is a great black just using
a small liner brush just go all across
your upper lash line and when you get to
the outer portion you can sort of um
make a little connection around the
outer corners what I usually like to do
I think it finishes off the look ties it
all together from what's going on on top
of your eye to what's going on below
your take serpent again with a pencil
brush and you can just dust over that
area next I curled my lashes and I use
my prestige my blackest lashes mascara
just kind of deciding what I think of
how this one at this point it's brand
new to me and I used my old standby
Maybelline lash discovery for its
wonderfully tiny brush use that on the
lower lashes just to get some definition
going on there the
cheeks and lips I'm thrilled that this
palette gives you two ginormous blushes
and one of them is warm apricot so just
kind of dust that on the cheek as a lips
I used lava and I just put that on with
my finger and I feel like it gives just
a really natural tint to the lips this
is keeping the whole whole face looking
really nice and fresh but then when you
really get that peekaboo effect with the
eyes when you look down you're like oh
there's something special going on there
I love that I love it when that happens
so the mega palette gives you tons and
tons of options here and you could
totally go outside of you know a
specific trio but I just kind of wanted
to demonstrate how the way they have
these outlined is kind of how they're
designed to be used and that was really
all I needed for this look you know was
the trio that was identified their quick
tan I hope you enjoyed this look and
learned a few things about the photo op
mega palette it's one of those go-to
things in the early morning hours when I
don't really want to dig through my
collection but just pull out something
where it's all laid out for me so thanks
again for watching have a wonderful day
and I'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
