video I wanted to do a quick product
review for you but before I get to that
I wanted to show you something that many
people ask me about like what is that
picture up there over your shoulder that
you know is always up when you're on the
couch doing videos and I've forgotten
repeatedly to show you I guess I just
you know set my camera up and just
naturally see it behind me and don't
think anything of it but my sister
painted this picture for me it's of me
and Tyler she gave it to us for our
wedding and it was just based on a photo
we had of us just sitting there on the
couch like doing crossword puzzles or
whatever and my sister is an incredible
artist she is Kelly aka pup she appeared
in a video I did around Easter time we
did like a haul video or whatever but
she has I have several pictures around
here actually that she has painted for
me so I'd just kind of like compiled
them maybe or just put together a little
video of all of pups artwork that she's
done for me but she is a high school art
teacher and just an incredible artist
and I thought I would go ahead and show
you that picture alright guys here is
that picture um this is me and Tyler
like I said we're sitting on the couch
at back home and just like just hanging
out just being ourselves you know not
like putting on for the camera or
anything as you can clearly see but it
totally looks like me and it really
looks like Tyler - Tyler was kind of
coming off of his football playing days
he played football all throughout
college and so he was a little more
bulky looking many is maybe these days
but but seriously she got it totally
right on with the facial features and
everything and she just has that knack
for anybody she paints really so I
should really show you some of the other
things that she's done or made up a link
to her blog over in the side because you
can see some of her various works of art
there but anyway guys just wanted to
show you this and now let's get on with
the review
alright the product I want to tell you
about is from Smashbox and it is the
photo finish lid primer and you'll
recall I went and did a whole big review
on eyeshadow primers i ranked them i
mean it was big i really took a lot of
time
during out what I like best and why and
then like I think it was in within maybe
one or two weeks I tried another
eyeshadow primer and I'm like oh no no
you know I already had that video up and
now I'm trying more but yeah inevitably
that'll happen but I wanted to just let
you know what I thought about this and
you can kind of factor it into that
review as well this I got a I'm sure you
can get it individually but I got it in
with my Smashbox masters class set for
glamour eyes and it was for the brown
eyes kit I think this came in every eye
kit regardless of what color it was
but yeah it's called photo finish lid
primer it says wear alone or under
shadow which is interesting because this
the difference in this and anything I've
tried is that this neutralizes the color
of your eyelid more than anything else
so you put this on its I mean it's just
a creamy kind of beige I don't know if
you can see that swatch there but you
know skin tone
shade there but when you put it on your
lid it completely undoes any
discoloration you know some people
actually have sort of a bluish tone on
their eyelid naturally or you know
whatever and this kind of keeps you if
you put this on this keeps you from
feeling like you have to put foundation
I don't usually put foundation on my
eyes or concealer on my eyes under my
eyes but not like on top of my lid
because I just worry about things
slipping around and you know I just want
to be the shadow and my primer on there
and so this is nice because it just
completely undoes any discoloration the
staying power is honestly just as good
for me as the Too Faced shadow insurance
this is a little bit drier when you put
it on it still has just that little bit
of tackiness to grab your shadow but I
feel like it doesn't have that
necessarily like moisturizing feel that
Too Faced shadow insurance almost has
you know what I mean like you put that
on and it's like okay this is kind of
slick this is a little bit more dry but
it still has
slightly tacky field so it will grab
your shadow so it's really really great
like I would put this right up there
with my Too Faced shadow insurance and
it's just a little more heavy duty and
like they say you can wear this alone
because it does honestly you know kind
of you know neutralize the eye eye
shadow or the eye shadow the shade of
your natural lid so you could put this
on with some mascara and just get a
super natural look and nobody would
really be able to know what you know was
going on there but this is really really
great so if you are you know in the
market for some Smashbox purchases or
you know maybe whether or not you
purchased one of those sets was hinging
on whether or not you thought this was
any good this is really good so if you
see this in different collections that
they have I know even for like QVC
Smashbox has a lot of different sets of
things so if you see this in one of
those and you know there's some other
good-looking stuff know that this is a
good product and it is every bit as good
as Too Faced shadow insurance it and
which was my number one in my last video
so I just wanted to fill you in on that
I've used it like I mean the staying
power throughout the day I'll come home
from work and my shadow will look just
the same as it did when I left I love
that you are getting the true shade of
the shadows you put on top of this
because it is has that neutralizing
quality to it so thank you guys so much
for getting in for this video I hope you
learned a little something new about
this product and my picture back there
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
