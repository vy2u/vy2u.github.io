great start and today I wanted to talk
about a new mascara from Smashbox I've
actually had this for a couple of weeks
it's called the x-rated mascara it
claims to be a volumizing formula it
also claims to be long wearing it says
it will give you micro defined
separation I'm actually wearing the
Smashbox x-rated on one side and the
covergirl super sizer on the other side
so maybe as I go throughout my review
you can try to tell which side switch
which is the drugstore which is the
high-end side it will definitely be
revealed to you in my little demo as I
apply them and what's really kind of
unique about this first off the tube I
think that's really cool very
interesting and different packaging as
far as this brush goes it has three
separate rows of bristles and I actually
drew a little diagram to show you what
that's like because I was really
struggling to get a good shot of this a
good close-up on camera but you've got
these bare spaces on the wand and that
does seem to be kind of a trend with
mascaras these days so I thought I would
compare that to another mascara that has
a similar concept and that's the
covergirl super sizer as you may know if
you keep up with my videos this is my
current favorite mascara I think it
gives great length great separation
really a lot of the same claims that
this one has so I thought it would be
really interesting to compare the two
um one key difference though besides
this one having rubber bristles and this
one having more traditional bristles the
super sizer actually only has two rows
of bristles but my point with this
diagram is to show you that there's a
lot of bare space on this wand and
there's some bare space on this wand as
well and Smashbox and the claims didn't
really talk about this a lot but I know
what the super sizer one thing that that
claims to do is to like hold some of the
product so you can apply that to your
lashes and then kind of twist the wand
and comb through with the little Komi
part and then get that extended
lengthened out look so I would assume it
might be a goal of Smashbox is as well
by having those little wells in between
the rows of bristles it can hold some
product and then the bristles can extend
it out onto the lashes I've had this
mascara for a couple of weeks and I
don't know about you guys but
times I tend to like a mascara a little
bit better the more I use it sometimes
if it started being a little too wet or
a little too goopy by a couple weeks in
it's like a pretty good benchmark for me
to tell me if I'm gonna start to maybe
like it as it dries out a bit more with
this one it's really strange I really
liked it when I first got it I thought
the effect actually reminded me a lot of
the super sizer I feel like every
mascara tube has some sort of little
internal mechanism that is cleaning off
that wand and taking off a good amount
of product so you can sweep it through
the lashes but I think somewhere in this
tube there is product collecting and
instead of getting cleaner and cleaner
every time this brush is getting more
gunked-up with product every time I take
it out I mean if you look closely you
can see there's a lot of product in what
will call those little wells between
each of the three rows of bristles but
then just on the bristles themselves you
know there's a lot of product in between
those also and I know some will say well
the solution to that is just to blot it
off on a tissue get rid of the excess
product and go at it but I don't like to
have to do that because this is I feel
like this is not functioning the way it
should for a product that claims such
amazing separation you know I shouldn't
be pulling out a brush that has this
much on it because there's no way it's
gonna separate with that much product to
work with the formula seems pretty thick
and creamy it doesn't seem especially
wet like say a Maybelline Great Lash but
one other note about it is I can see the
little like microfibers they look like a
teeny tiny piece of hair that's going to
extend onto your lashes and lengthen
them out further so it's just an issue
with product overload it affects the way
it applies onto the lashes for me it
definitely affects the way this mascara
holds the curl because I tend to get too
much product on it ways the lashes down
really more than it did in the early
days using this mascara that's why I
really wonder if the people who created
this like how long did they actually
test it you know how many days and weeks
did they go on to use it because I could
see it being a great mascara at the
start because it was for me it
lengthened out better is separated
better it held the curl better
then as time went on it just started
getting more and more gunked-up and with
the super sizer when this comes out of
the tube you know it also has those bare
sides to the brush that could
potentially hold a lot of product if it
wasn't getting cleaned off properly as
it was pulled out of the tube but I mean
it's a very clean brush you see no
clumps on it so in my demo I wanted to
show you both how these mascaras went on
but also my eye look which is very very
simple and I kind of came upon it as I
was traveling over the weekend and a
couple times just wanted a really quick
look to throw on so I wouldn't spend
forever doing my makeup and so here's my
little tip I use my Milani shadow eyes
an almond cream I just dabbed this on my
lids and blended it out with a brush and
you've got kind of a nicely concealed
evened out lid I also use this pencil on
the lower inner rim it really widens the
eye and brightens then I used my Laura
Mercier matte radiance it's in the shade
highlight zero one I did wedding makeup
on several people including the
beautiful bride and myself and I just
thought this was a fabulous highlight
because it's so buildable I was working
on different skin types
some people had more oily skin and I
felt like I was really able to even out
their face first apply a little bit of
this they never looked greasy they just
looked like they had this nice soft glow
and so in a pinch like I said as I was
hurrying around just doing quick makeup
on myself throughout the weekend I
realized that this can make a great
quick eyeshadow as well not that you
couldn't use other highlights you might
have other champagne colored shadows and
so I would call this look like eye
strobing and basically because I don't
do any kind of contour to the crease I
didn't pull in any dark shades I just
spotlighted my eye in three key areas
with this so I just used one brush
it's my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow brush
dab into this product patted it on the
lid first that's the first zone to kind
of highlight and then I also place this
around the inner corner if you get those
dark caverns on the inner parts of your
eye that's a great place to highlight
and then you get a beautiful effect if
you'd add this just under the brow I
mean I just love the way that kind of
finishes the brow and sort of lifts the
eye just a nice quick natural look and
something I've learned over the years is
when I'm demonstrating a mascara in a
video
for a review I don't want to have a lot
of distracting liner and different
shadows on my lids so you can really see
what the mascara is doing so anyway that
was a great little thing to use then as
you can see it's my left eye that's
sporting the Smashbox x-rated mascara
again pulling the wand right out of the
tube it's got a lot of product on there
and just to try to help this product out
a little bit I did blot off some of the
excess on a tissue but I just felt like
my lashes got overloaded very very
quickly also on the little press package
claimed that the product was super
buildable and I feel like okay I try to
add a little bit more thinking maybe
more swipes through my lashes will give
me more separation more thickness more
length the length I can't really argue
with but the more I swept through the
more they really just stuck together my
lashes and I looked like I had fewer
than I really have when it was all said
done and I did curl my lashes first but
I do blame the weight of this product
for straightening them out rather
quickly I applied this on my lower
lashes as well and I have tested this on
my lower lashes and I noticed occasional
smudging it's kind of inconsistent some
days I'll see it
some days I won't now in my other eye I
just wanted to give you a little frame
of reference with my covergirl super
sizer like I said my current frontrunner
mascara and it also has that designed to
the brush where there are some bare
places that hold a little bit of product
but then you can comb through it with
the other sides and talk about
separating the lashes I truly feel like
you're seeing every lash that I have but
it's lengthening them out it really is
holding the curl better than the other
side and staying power throughout the
day I mean I'm not having any smudging
or flaking both sides feel really nice
and soft but I just feel like the lashes
over here are so much more separated and
kind of fluttery and here I feel like
I'm seeing the look of less lashes and
they're just a little bit more like
drooping down but that was my experience
and I would say save yourself the money
get yourself the super sizer because it
really gives the best look to the lashes
so thank you guys so much for watching
have a great day and I'll see you soon
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
