a go-to glam look that you can do it's
very very simple to recreate this is
actually the look I was wearing in my
last video where I was showing all sorts
of different lip colors so if you want
to see how it comes off with various lip
looks you can check that out this goes
with absolutely anything I mean you
could not wear the orange lip and wear
any lip color or any outfit and it
really is going to work but it's gonna
add just that little special twist we're
using a very basic maybelline quad and
then some sparkle I'm going to show you
actually a couple different ways to add
the sparkle if you've got any kind of
special occasion I think of this is just
a super simplified smoky eye with a
sparkly twist I hope you like it first
off I applied a primer all over the eye
area from lid to brow I used my bare
minerals prime time there then I'm gonna
use this NYC City proof jumbo pencil
this is in the shade Rockefeller Center
snowflakes so it's just a shimmery white
and I'm going to take this all over the
lid just the entire lid space this is
giving us like a nice white base and
some added shimmer I'm also taking this
around the inner corner the tear duct
next I'm taking my Maybelline duo in
dusk and we're using this satin finish
taupey shade here with my Sigma e25 this
shade is just gonna go all throughout
the crease and this is where you can
really you know customize the shape you
can keep this extremely simple and
really confine it to the crease or you
can build it up and shape it you know
however you like I think this is a super
versatile shade you know it's not too
light not too dark but it can create
some very I don't know convincing
looking shadows in the eye area so I'm
taking mine outward just a bit - other
just small but important ways that we're
using this shade I'm just taking this
sponge tip that came with this I want a
little bit of that on the lid because
there's going to be a little bit of
glittery
overlap happening
and I do just want it slightly deeper on
the outer part of the lid so just dab it
right on there also I want this inner
part of the crease to be kind of nicely
defined so I'm picking up some of the
taupe with my pencil brush and I'm just
going to lightly apply this pretty much
as far in as my crease goes I'm also
going to take this shade on the lower
lash line so I just think about actually
filling you know this kind of no-man's
land here between lower lashline and
where you pulled that shadow out to just
kind of connect up to that
oh and don't mind this that's a crease
from my sheets I actually tried
concealing that earlier it turns out
it's just gonna fade on its own I
seriously couldn't believe it I was like
taking product and I cuz I could see the
shadow it was creating I'm like why is
this not going away anyway just take
this shade all across the lower lash
line somebody will probably be really
nice about in the comment section and be
like how did you get those lines on the
side there it's really artsy then I'm
taking this pinky shade right here with
an e forty brush this is gonna be our
highlight slash just kind of blending
things out blending out the border of
the taupe and if you wanted to do this
look - anything glittery I would just at
this point take this pinky shade and
just put it on the lid and boom you're
done but I think what's so fun about
this look is the bit of glitter we have
going on on the lid so this is urban
decay space cowboy it's a lot of fun I'm
using this up and up I shadow brush from
Target picking up a little bit of this
and this is where that creamy white base
kind of comes in handy because it helps
grab this shadow a little bit but I'm
pretty much just gonna cover the lid
except for maybe just the very very
outermost part now what I like about
this shade is that the shimmer in it is
so fine that from a distance like if
this catches the light it almost just
looks like glossy on the lid you know so
you could stop here with space cowboy or
I want to show you how to just amp it up
a little bit more see how this is like
extra sparkly I busted out the OL Iraq
three D liquid lustre you just shake it
up all it takes is like the littlest
drop you can do it with your finger I'm
gonna just pick up a little bit with my
brush here
and you can just dab this over the top
and see how it's like just next-level
with the sparkle eNOS so I think space
cowboy is super pretty on its own but I
just wanted to show you how you can kind
of work with another level of shine here
on the eye for liner I'm using my
Jordana color and the liquid liner and I
get a lot of questions about what liquid
liner I use and this is it pretty much
all the time I just recently bought
three of these on the Jordana cosmetics
website because I can't find them in my
walgreens and I use a lot of black
liquid liner so I don't feel like I want
to you know spend a bunch on it I'm
winging this out on the outside so just
pulling that liner outward kind of
making that little triangle shape there
and then filling it in I don't know if
the hell well that showed on camera and
then I went very smoky on the lower lash
line using my Tarte skinny smolder eyes
in black and that is going to go in the
inner rim so from the outside all the
way in and then see how this just
doesn't look that finished so I'm going
to dab this right kind of into the wing
and just also on the skin just below the
waterline and that black will set but
before it does I'm just taking my e21
smudge brush and going over that just to
soften it and then I think I am gonna
pull in a little bit of taupe over that
as well just to make it look a little
more blended and soft and I'm just
curling lashes I'm using this Tarte
gifted mascara on the upper lashes just
a quick coat there and then my new NYX
skinny mascara on the lower lashes I
have a full review on this over on the
Express channel really nice for grabbing
those teeny tiny lashes and the lashes
I'm using are these Koko lashes number
201
I let the Revlon
and lash glue get a little tacky and I
just lay the lash band down and attach
it and once that glue dries I just kind
of blot some mascara right there at the
base of the lashes and then you're done
so the lip color I'm wearing with this
look is the Rimmel show off lip velvet
in orange ology so a great matte orange
lip got a very soft pink cheek with this
look it's the Tom Ford blush in frantic
pink and then my bronzers slash contour
is this Make Up For Ever Pro sculpting
duo in zero one I really started using
it for this highlight I think that's
just gorgeous but now I've kind of
gotten into that contouring shade as
well so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video thank you so much for taking time
to watch and I'll see you later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
