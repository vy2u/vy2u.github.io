town coming up and you'd like to spice
up your look not only with a little bit
of drama with more of a smoky eye but if
you want to add some color as well I'm
going to show you how you can do that
you can definitely sub in your own
favorite colors to use on your eyes for
this look but I use some tones of blue
and teal to achieve this look as well as
some black and of course some false
lashes and liner so if you want to see
how I pull the look together keep on one
is to definitely apply a primer to your
eye i use my Too Faced shadow insurance
and then we're going to get going with
the color I'm going to use this new beat
luscious palette the name of it is
erotic mermaid but it's just some tones
of blue and some deep teals there's a
mix of matte and shimmer and even some
kind of sparkly shades there so the
first color i think i'm going to go for
it does come with a nice little brush
but i am going to use my own just for
purposes of you know packing the color
on here i'm going to use this one on the
end it's kind of a sparkly blue and I've
already applied that primer and these
the formula on this is much improved
from past be luscious palettes that I've
had it was kind of hit and miss with
some of them some of them were fantastic
or certain colors were but across the
whole palette sometimes certain ones
wouldn't just absolutely you know show
up a lot which is what some people want
for a subtle look but if you are one of
those color people you know you'll
really like these pallets so I just
packed on that medium blue all over and
then we're going to work with this
pretty matte teal shade right here and
for that I'm going to use a medium
crease brush you get some of that on
there and this is probably one of the
most pigmented shades in the of the
bunch here and so I'm going to take that
shade there's my phone I'm going to
apply it right here in the crease all
the way across and this is the type of
color we're really gonna build up a
little bit here
so just go back for more and kind of
extend it up as high as you feel
comfortable and you might feel strange
because this is kind of a powerful shade
here that we're using but we are going
to be using some black which is going to
add some depth number one and number two
it's going to sort of tone down the
color a little bit and so as much as you
want to tone it you can see how we've
you know added some depth to the entire
look but that's basically the color step
on that you're going to go through for
this and then for up in here i'm using a
gold any highlight shade i'm using my
covergirl single and golden sunrise
fluffy shadow brush or create fluffy
crease brush is actually what this is
but i like to use it for my highlight
because it just diffuses the color so
well and you can kind of buff out the
edges there too so then with a dark
shade take any black shade you've got I
like this sparkly black shade it's Make
Up For Ever diamond shadow and I'm going
to take my fine crease brush so if you
have any brush smaller than the crease
brush you just used get some black on
there and just kind of go focus it in
right on the outer corner and it's
amazing what you know you can you're
getting you're not necessarily getting
black out of this but you're getting a
whole different deeper blue shade just
from applying that there you know what I
mean I mean I'm not I can see this right
in front of me probably a little more
clearly than you can through the camera
and it is not pure black and it's not
blue but it's like I've just taken the
shades just like you would work with
paints sometimes shadows can work that
way as well so just apply as much of
that as you want again leave as much or
as little blue as you want and then
before I finish off the look or actually
I could do it right now I'm going to go
back to the medium crease brush and go
back to the blue and just give myself a
little halo of color right up in here
just to make sure I keep some of that
color and then I like to take that
lightish that lighter shade that we put
on the lid and then just kind of make a
little sort of border there with them
it's really pretty a really pretty kind
of faded effect there so I like that a
lot I'm the other key to this look is
the liner and we're doing sort of a cat
eye defect again I'm kind of really
liking that right now so basically I'm
going to use my I'm Jane gel mineral
eyeliner which this stuff is really good
this is this is smoother than the
L'Oreal hip I like them both for their
color but this one just seems to go on a
little bit smoother but it's still very
long wearing and I'm going to actually
get this on like a pointy brush this is
a brush that I got from Walmart for less
than two bucks and so just getting some
of the product on there and I'm going to
just start in the middle
so here we go we're just kind of
creating a little bit of an upswept look
here at the end thickening the line but
doing so straight out from the very
corner of your eye when you continue on
the inner part just kind of overlap what
you did right there and slowly slowly
just work your way in
all right guys here is my finished look
excuse me if the lash glue is still
trying there on this side just put them
on but it's just a look that can be you
know a smoky or as colorful as you want
to just whichever into the spectrum
you're more comfortable with you can
definitely go with it but I applied my
false lashes there it just gives it a
really you know kind of dramatic effect
when you do that and on my lips to kind
of keep the focus on my eyes I'm using
the Bonnie Bell lip lights in caramel
latte it's a really pretty color if you
like nudes with a hint of gold so anyway
I think this is a really fun look guys
in like I said just make it as dramatic
or colorful as you choose and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
