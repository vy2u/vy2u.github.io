of a cool summer to full transition type
look we're using the very popular peach
and coral type tones that everyone loves
in the summer but putting a little bit
of a deeper twist on it not only in the
eyes but in the lips is what I look is
overall pretty matte we've got some
tones of orange and rust and brown in
here that just blend beautifully
together from a palette that I have not
reached for in a long long time then how
do you get your lip and cheek to come
together to kind of complement and I
look like this so I'll be talking all
about it in this video I hope you like
it
so I've already gotten a few steps out
of the way I did my foundation and that
is the foundation part of my how to
cover melasma video so I'll link to that
if you haven't seen that yet
went through the very same steps with
the Estee Lauder Double Wear maximum
cover foundation and I'll list the
products below but if you want to see
the technique very same technique from
that other video and I also just went
ahead and did my brows as well I use my
Too Faced brow envied kids so now I'm
just going to continue on with some
bronzer to contour with this is
something new that I'm trying out it's
from it cosmetics got it from Ulta it's
the CC plus radiance ombre bronzer and
it says warm radiance so you can kind of
see you know the gradient effect here
and I'm seeing kind of like a mostly
matte bronzer type color here in the
bottom so I'm picking some of that up
and I'm going to use that to contour
this is one of my new brushes from
Target I got a little brush set they've
kind of redone their up and up brushes
and I instagrammed just over the weekend
finding this little set that I'm trying
out so this is the angled brush I'm just
going to start this right back here in
the hollows of my cheeks and blend that
deepest part of this compact one of the
interesting things about this is like to
touch it it feels really creamy it's not
like a typical powder type feel
and I'm not saying it's a cream either
but you know what I mean it's one of
those really rich feeling powder
products so I'm liking that
out this bronzer and I like to kind of
just swipe that color on and then buff
it out in a circular motion there in the
hollows of my cheeks I'm also taking
this under my jaw and I'm also taking
some of this around the hairline as well
and so far I've just been using that
bottom most part that's pretty much the
deepest bronzer this middle part I'm
going to kind of blend the deepest in
the middle part and use that a little
bit kind of right here in the center of
the forehead giving a little more of a
glowy finish there I'm going to do a
little bit of that just right on top of
my cheeks - then we're going to do some
blush this is one of my favorite like
dollar-store hidden gem types of finds
the brand is Ayane cosmetics they have
some amazing blushes I think I remember
talking about these a year or so ago on
here and I still love them this is a
matte one and the shade is called
ecstasy it's like a really deep coral
shade with my up-and-up blush brush I'm
just going to barely tap into that and
also tap off the excess and I'm going to
apply this right here on the outer part
of the apple of my cheeks such a pretty
coral glow it's one of those colors that
just makes you look glowy by the color
it is not because it's packed with a
bunch of shimmer it just goes to show
you never know what you're going to come
up with at the dollar store sometimes I
find these this line at a store called
Fred's super dollar and they're so great
they're just like a couple bucks and
then I'm just going to finish off the
face by using the shimmery top part of
the it cosmetics bronzer here and I'm
just going to sweep that right on the
tops of my cheeks I'm gonna put a little
bit here on that Cupid's bow area I kind
of like put it on and buff over it and a
little bit down the nose also before I
move on to the eyes I'm going to go
ahead and do the lips and the concept I
was kind of building in my mind for this
look a lot of times we see kind of a
peachy makeup look and it's very very
light what I wanted this look to do was
incorporate those peachy tones but kind
of on a darker level so I'm going to go
ahead and do my lip liner first this is
the Too Faced perfect lips in perfect
spice sign that it's deep enough to
really provide some nice
finition to the lips and it just plays
nicely with you know anything from more
nude tones all the way through these
deeper kind of peachy dark coral colors
so I've got them lined and then I'm
going to kind of fill in a little bit
here on the outsides just to allow that
to blend a bit more easily once we put
the lipstick on and then the lipstick
I'm using is from bite and it's called
cincin I have the mini size here and you
can see a lot of like corally orange
color coming out of that so I'm just
going to apply that all over so smooth
love the smoothness of these white
lipsticks I'm taking the sleek high
shine lip gloss in the shade is angel
delight of a soft peach gloss a little
bit of shimmer here just makes the lips
come off very full and juicy you know so
on the eyes we're working in a lot of
that peachy coral warmth but also as far
as the shape of this eye look as opposed
to doing it very you know cat eyed and
out like this I really wanted the eye to
take on more openness you know more
vertical up and down so the lashes help
with that also the places where we
choose to go kind of bright with a base
or inner rim line I'm using the Milani
shadow eyes and almond cream cannot get
enough of this product but this is so
easy to just take we're going to just
encircle the tear duct area with this
and then pull it upward onto the lid
doesn't take a lot of product you'll
find it kind of does blend out with your
finger then on the lid kind of a
smallish brush that I've really been
enjoying is from Sigma it's the e 54
medium sweeper such a nice size for you
know just small areas where you want to
place your shadow it's kind of nice to
use interchangeably with my Sonia Kashuk
small shadow brush I mean it's about the
same width but just not quite as flat
dug out my Coastal Scents Mirage palette
folks I have not used this in a while
and there's no reason why I'm not this
has a lot of really great earthy tones
and just the perfect shades for this
type of look so I'm going to Rose over
and down to this
kind of classic matte beige : I'm just
placing that right here around the inner
corner and just up onto the lid just
barely then going right across that same
row I'm going to this orange II shade
I'm using that same brush and I'm just
patting this all over the rest of the
lid
seeing big-time orangie color coming out
of this shade and then I want to start
taking this a little bit deeper almost
more toward the shade on my lips so
we're going to stay in that same row so
we started here we went to this one and
then I'm going to go to this matte kind
of reddish burgundy color kind of a rust
type Pat that shade right out here
on my outer corner see the beautiful
blend that starts to create with the
more stark orange II shade I'm also
flipping this little brush over and
getting some of that up in my crease as
well I'm going to blend over that with a
bear brush just soften these edges out
then we're going to add some smokiness
so across the top there's this nice dark
matte chocolatey Brown using the Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush with this and
this is going on just the outer
outermost corner and as it overlaps with
that rest shade it just creates a nice
like fun smoky effect here and I'm
working that up into the crease also
using some of that brown with a fluffy
brush and just working that kind of back
and forth in the crease as well for the
highlight I'm going back to that first
creamy beige that we started out with
just with my e-40 from sigma and taking
that just right over the border of our
nice warm shades and up under the brow
oops sometimes I forget that I'm
actually cheating a video and I just
cover up the camera with a lower lash
line I'm going dark brown so that
same shade we used earlier right up the
top I'm going to use that right out here
at the outer half of the eye and then
the rest of the way in I'm using
something just a little softer so down
from that Brown going right here to this
kind of cool taupe color just to
continue to have a little definition on
the lower lash line
not quite as much as what a dark-brown
would give if you don't have this
particular palate but maybe you can
round up you know similar shades in your
collection that's fine I'm just trying
to you know get use out of things that I
haven't reached for in a while and on
the upper lashline I'm just going to use
a little black pencil I've got my tart
skinny smolder IDEs and onyx and this
just goes on so smoothly and easily so
I'm just going to take this from my
inner corner to outer corner not winging
it out really like I said we're going
for kind of a round very wide open eye
with this look I got a whole set of
these liners on HauteLook not all that
long ago and they're just awesome feel
like I've got a little more like reddish
tone in this crease compared to this
crease so I'm going to go back and add a
little more here these are the things
that you notice when you do one eye at a
time and then you come back you're like
did I do that exactly the same yeah I
think that's better and then I'm going
to just curl my lashes I'm doing mascara
top and bottom using this Rimmel
scandaleyes rockin curves mascara does
provide some nice length the brush takes
a little getting used to I see it's all
swirly and like a s shape a little bit
and then on my lower lashes my
anti-humidity lower lash mascara trick
would be the covergirl clump crusher
water resistant it lasts so well on the
lower lash line without flaking off or
smudging and that is my mascara problem
area when it comes to staying power
would be the lower lashes so just get
about a coat of that on here and the
lashes I'm using I've just been itching
to try these since I picked them up at
Target they're from Sonia Kashuk I've
never tried the Sonia Kashuk false
lashes before and these are called the
full glam eyelashes so they come in this
nice little case and when I put them on
this eye I decided to give them a little
trim I just trimmed off a couple little
segments there at the end so they would
better fit my eye left to right I've got
glue on there that's just starting to
get nice and tacky you've got a full
tutorial on how to do this like absolute
start to finish from picking out the
lashes
taking them off and saving them and
cleaning them up and reusing so check
that video for some more detailed info
but for now just line these up with the
center of my eye and attaching them at
the outer and inner corner here right on
top of the liner those went on pretty
easily Thank You Sonia and now while
that glues really starting to adhere you
can still mess with them a little bit we
really want to make sure these dry in a
nice upturned
way I really want any false lashes to
dry that way you don't want them sagging
down and cutting your eye off you want
to take advantage of that nice full lash
and let it just lift your eye open this
looks very open over here so we want the
same look here kind of just blink down
on to it a little bit and then I like to
apply just a touch more mascara here at
the roots think about just blotting it
so there's the finished look I hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial as much as I
did I had a lot of fun just kind of
picking out that one tone which is peach
and working it into my look in several
different ways on the face yay for
rediscovered old stuff totally going to
have to be reaching for this Mirage
palette more because it's got some great
tones not only in this orange e family
but just some nice kind of muted earthy
color so I think will be great going
into fall so thanks for taking time to
watch every one I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
