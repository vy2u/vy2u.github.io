you how to create a smoky eye with loose
powder shadows and for some of you that
may be kind of like an intimidating
thought because when you're using loose
powder and you're doing a dark look some
people can find that kind of difficult
because you worry about having fallout
and when i said i'll say that throughout
this video and what i mean by that is
when you've done your tail a little
mascara down there when you've done your
eye look and suddenly you've got like
shadowed kept falling off of where you
meant to put it onto like your cheek for
example so i feel like i've got a
strategy to tackle this um that will
keep that from happening you still have
to be careful because this isn't just
like normal you know press shadow this
is loose so you do have to be careful
with it but it's something that I think
will help you and it's a very affordable
way to do it so I want to show you some
of the brushes i'll be using along with
my normal brushes i'm going to be using
some of these brushes from low cornell
and this is what they look like you get
a package of 10 in the walmart craft
section for i want to say it was like
right around two dollars and you can see
there's like some it will be good liner
brushes some they're good or you know
they're nice and flat and those are the
ones i'll be using today the number is
4135 shader and these are the brushes
i'll be using to end either identical
and i'm the reason why i have two is
because i'm using one extremely light
color in one very dark color so i
thought i'd just if i have that many
brushes then i'll just keep them
separate and like i said i'll be using
these along side my normal brushes it's
just part of the process i'm going to
use and also if you want any more
information on
what's on my face and my lips I'm going
to post that in the little information
box there on the right so you can check
their if you want that info so let's get
right to the tutorial I already have an
eye primer on and i'm going to be using
my theme couture mineral shadows the
first color I'm using a soft cloud and
this is just a nice light shimmery you
know kind of white champagne kind of
color and so I'm going to take my low
cornell brush it's just a really flat
brush and what these are good for the
reason why I'm doing this is because
these are great for packing on the color
without getting it all over your face
okay so I'm still being careful but look
at the method I'm using to do it I'm
just pressing it right on my eyelid I'm
not going in a back-and-forth motion I'm
just pressing it in just like you see
here it's really really simple and you
know go back for more if you want a more
concentrated look and you could always
apply these shadows with a mixing medium
but part of the challenge is applying
them dry actually so that's why I wanted
to show you this way of doing it so just
get that all over your lid just a light
shade you don't have to be using the
femme Couture brand you could use any
loose light colored shadow that you
prefer and I'm just going to put a
little bit right in here under my eye to
just on the inner corner alright so now
that you've got that step one is done
and I'm not going to go over this with a
different brush because I wanted to sort
of a pact on effect there I wanted to
look very concentrated but next I'm
going to go to my my dark shade it's
called what's it called black jewel so
this is just a black with a little hint
of sparkle in it I'm going to use the
exact same brush that I used for the
white only since I have multiple ones in
that pack I'm just going to use the same
that I reserved for darker colors dip it
into the black and then what you want to
do is just Pat this over the area that
you're going to want to be dark for me
that's going to be the outer half of the
lid notice how I'm not being too precise
here I'm just putting it in the general
area I also wanted to come up in the
crease a little bit okay so I'm just
padding not rubbing whatsoever with this
brush and I don't have any fallout yet
on my cheek and I want to come out and
form sort of an outer region okay so see
where I've put that and now it has been
placed on it's been sort of packed on
the skin I'm going to grab my normal
contour brush I'm just gonna blend it
out now and I mean I'm still going to be
careful about it but I shouldn't really
have many issues since you know the
shadow has been packed on it at first I
didn't just get this brush in and then
just go crazy with it because you will
start to see a little bit of fall out
there I do have a little bit there but
for the most part this will be much more
difficult to control if I just started
with the brush that i'm using right now
and see how well that's blended out even
though I you know pressed it on in a
really unusual sort of look I've now
blended it out and I'm using a smaller
contour brush now to just take a little
bit lower sort of blend it in with my
lower lash line just a little sort of
creating that outer be look and if you
want to apply more you can do that but
use your flat brush not you're not
you're fluffy contour brush
and you know circular motions whatever
works for you to get the color blended
then that's what you should do so and I
mean I don't really mind when the if i
get i got a little bit of the sparkly
shade down here just a little bit so it
shows you know you can still have some
issues but you just got to really be
careful with it and if you are for the
most part i mean you're going to have
way less problems than if you just want
with your straight typical brush and
there are makeup brushes that are made
that are similar to this this isn't the
only type of brush you can get these are
craft paint brushes but you know i'm
sure you could find some that are like
this but this is just what the brand
that's working for me right now next I'm
going to use a highlight shade that's
actually just a little bit darker than
the white cloud it's more of a golden
shade and it's called golden oasis and
for that I'm going to take my one I use
for light shades dip it in and then I'm
just gonna kind of dot that along where
I want it to be blended okay then I'm
going to take my typical eyeshadow brush
and just blend it out really simple so
we did just a simple I mean a
three-color I look here that turned out
to be a nice smoky eye but you know
using these blue shadows that a lot of
people you know are getting loose
shadows mineral shadows and things like
that and you know you need to know how
to use them to make them work so next
I'm going to use some gel liner I'm
going to use my jane be pure mineral
liner in black I'm just going to use an
up fine eyeliner brush and just go in
and blind from the inner corner the
outside with this
and just you know this is pretty easy
i'm using a really fine tip brush here
so it's extremely easy to control and
get a very fine line and of course if
you work fast enough you could also
smudge this line which i'm going to do
on the bottom so just work that out to
the end before you can see what i'm
doing here and then we're going to just
go right underneath too and then just
start in the middle and a inside and
work my way to the outside
sometimes it helps to meet in the middle
come back out here blend sort of the
outer corner together
and connect the line there we go and one
last step if you like to do this I
sometimes like to take a smudge tip and
it kind of removes excess product and at
the same time softens the line a little
bit if you're going for a smoky look you
know that can be exactly what you want
to do there and it also is nice to kind
of connect at the corners so last but
not least I'm going to run out of time
so I'm just going to curl my lashes I've
already done my brows and the normally
curl those were a lot longer but I just
want to finish the look and then I used
I'm using Maybelline to finalize Volume
Mascara and just put on a few coaches of
this and your look will be completed and
you'll have a nice smoky eye look that
will not only last you but won't create
fallout under your eye area so hope you
guys learn something thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
