probably want to know you know how do
you get that cat eye look the look that
makes people's eyes look like you know
they're really stretching across their
face just a really kind of you know
interesting dramatic eye effect and I'm
gonna try to show you a technique for
doing that today I'm gonna be using a
couple different kinds of liners to
achieve it and also just you know in the
overall eye it's gonna be just tones of
gray smoky grays and blacks and things
like that so I hope you enjoy this
tutorial and if you have any questions
stay for tea for this look is to grab
your NYX or NYX trio palette that has
the matte white shade the silver and the
charcoal shade this is actually called
white pearl but you can use any
comparable shades but I just wanted to
show you that so you have an idea of
what we're working with just take an
eyeshadow brush this is from my Coastal
Scents brush kit and I'm taking that
white shade and just applying it all
over my lid by the way before I did this
step I applied my ELF mineral eye primer
all over my lid I'm kind of testing that
out to see how well it works so I'm just
gonna Pat that lightest shade on there
just like that we just kind of want a
sheer you know light shade going on
there next I'm gonna take a kind of
medium sized crease brush and we're
gonna go to this charcoal color here on
the end so just get some of that on your
brush and we're gonna just go all over
the crease here it's just got a nice you
know depth to it it's it is kind of
shimmery as well so that's nice and you
can see I'm just following the natural
shape of my crease here and then the
next step that we do will sort of
accentuate our cat eyed effect just a
little more so just get that we're
definitely taking this kind of from the
inside to the outside and we may come
back to it in just a moment but now that
we've laid that down I'm adding one more
shade to this you can see here you've
got you know you go to sort of a
'i'm gray i'm adding on my back carbon
to that says i do want one shade deeper
than that whole set so this is just a
matte black color
I'm gonna take my fine crease brush into
this shade and we're just going to use
this to define our outer V just a little
bit more here so I'm just kind of
working it and practically like circular
motions and then kind of up from the
corner over from mid crease and that's
gonna help you form that outer V just
continue blending it out as much as you
feel like you need to to get to get the
shape you're after and once you've got
the outer V basically how you want with
that darkest shade I would recommend
going back to that charcoal gray color
I'm getting out your medium brush and
just kind of maybe swiping over the
border and it'll just make a more
natural fade up if you know what I mean
okay so once you've done that just get
any highlights shade that you like to
use I'm gonna use that champagne from
covergirl it's like a shimmery
buttercream kind of color and just get a
little bit on a fluffy brush and just
use that as your all-over highlight all
the way up to your brow next for liner
and the liner is really key in this look
you want something intense and black and
something that you can kind of
manipulate easily to get the get a
really defined shape so for that I'm
gonna be using my L'Oreal hip cream
liner in black and this is another brush
that's part of my Coastal Scents brush
kit it's very firm and and it's a very
small angled brush it's very narrow so I
like that makes it very easy to control
so I'm gonna get some of the product on
the brush and basically I'm gonna just
line you know I'm gonna go the idea is
to go from all the way into all the way
out and with the cat eye but I sometimes
like to start in the middle it really
depends on what product I use whether
I'm using liquid or a cream or whatever
but just kind of pack some color on that
brush and start out trying to get close
to your lash line and then just work it
in slow
sometimes this takes me a while really
using this method because I am trying
you know to keep it straight it is such
an intense shade the only thing I don't
love about this liner is how it does get
a little bit dry so just be aware of
that but there we go we're getting it
all the way to the inside and then you
do want to really we are idea what this
look is kind of elongate the eye from
left to right so kind of make sure
you've got some product on your brush as
you take it into the inner corner like
that you know just kind of going in even
further than you might normally and you
can kind of flip these kind of brushes
around just to really get it in there
next we're gonna concentrate on this
outer half getting that all finished off
so more product on the brush and
basically what I'm gonna do is use that
angle to my advantage and kind of just
put it right in the corner and you can
see I'm just flicking up like that and
then we want it to be filled and we
don't want it to be just one fine line
we want it to be kind of like filled in
and it's coming out a little bit thicker
there as you can see on the other side
so keep that in mind you know just
really filling it in straight from the
corner not just from you know whatever
your little swooping off point was there
so I'm kind of going from the corner
sweeping it out and just kind of
following the shape of that outer V with
the shadow too and you can go back with
the shadow and these these two steps
kind of work together to make give your
eye that elongated kind of cat eye look
it's not all up to the liner it's also
kind of up to the shadow as well so make
this I mean step is dramatic as you want
you know obviously don't swoop it up to
absolute crazy heights but I'm just
extending line just a bit there
and what I like about this cream liners
you see how we practically like you when
you when you're starting to run out of
the product on your brush it's like you
can fade it out almost right at the tip
and I really like that effect so then
we're going to go ahead and go
underneath with this same same liner it
really is long wearing and it does give
that nice black intensity so basically
what you're going to see me do here is
just blend up with what we did in the
corner there and just continue it right
along your lash line I'm not talking
waterline here I'm just talking your
lower lash line yes now to get that
ultimate smoky look I'm taking my Revlon
Colorstay pencil liner and I'm just
gonna use that to just kind of draw it
right there on my waterline and it's
just gonna really bring the intensity in
there to the eye there you go next for
lashes I think lashes are really
important to this look just for really
and you can totally tell the difference
now from one eye to the next with the
effect that the lashes give just a real
wide open looking it's a dramatic look
this is what this look is about you know
it's something for fun it's not
necessarily everyday for you for anyone
really but so I'm gonna go ahead and put
a coat of mascara on I'm gonna use my
Maybelline colossal mascara and then I'm
gonna put on my salon perfect lashes
number 53 those are available at Walmart
and I will join you with the finishes
welcome back time for a look at the
finished product here like I said it's
just a really smoky eye but it's still
very defined what the cat eye looks so
it's an interesting combination you know
sometimes here with smokey eyes like
it's just very you know kind of real
smokey all the way around but I think
this keeps it defined and really clean
but also just with a nice kind of haze
of the the gray colors up there on my
lips right now I'm wearing a very very
light application of a shade from NYX
called called harmonica it's a really
pretty light for
steep pink and then over the top of that
I am wearing my Revlon Colorstay mineral
lip glaze which I love in eternal
blossom so just a couple of really
inexpensive products there and on my
cheeks
you know just general foundation routine
and then I'm using my Mac bronzing
powder in golden which I continue to
love and on my cheeks I'm using my
covergirl cheekers blush and plumbery
glow it's just a really pretty kind of
you know pinky shade there so it's got a
little bit of shimmer to it too so I
like that
so anyway anyway guys thank you so much
for tuning in for this video I hope you
liked this kind of new twist on an eye
look and I have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
