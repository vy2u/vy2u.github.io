off-balance right now well I'm actually
going to do a tutorial for you on a look
I'm going to be doing this weekend for
my sister's wedding if I had the
bridesmaid dress here I wouldn't show it
to you but it's the colors are it's kind
of a pretty navy blue kind of a little
bit shiny and um just a really pretty
color out in the sunlight and I'm
messing around with some looks right now
and so I thought hey I'll do a video on
this I know I had some more things on my
to-do list to show you guys but I
thought the weddings this weekend so
I'll go ahead and look this into a video
so what I've got here is sort of a it
I'm not sure this may be just looking
real just kind of dark and black but
it's actually kind of a smoky navy blue
eye so I'm just going to duplicate that
on the right side right now and just
describe what I'm doing as I do it so
I've already put the primer on here so
um the first step I'm using a palette
from revlon lip cream eyeshadow palette
has a ton of colors in it and i'm using
it's actually a small concealer brush
fine concealer brush from CVS essence of
beauty brushes but i actually use this
little bitty guy for my um cream shadows
and I'm using this silvery color right
here I'm just going to put it all over
my wood
so this will just I know I've already
put a base on there this one's kind of
enhance that and really give the shadow
that put on over the top of this
something to really cling to them so
once I do that then I'm going to go down
here to this pretty navy shape this put
some one right here and I'm just going
to concentrate that on the outer half
now just using the same brush smudging
it into the crease a little bit so I'm
just working it in from the outer half
okay
so here's what you're looking like now
so now we're going to move on to the
powder shadow phase and I'm just going
to be using my ELF eye shadow brush and
this curly white shade in my Smashbox
trio and I'm going to be putting that on
the inner portion of my eyelid
just kind of packing it in there it's
just going such a pretty curly effect
and this brush looks great with my
Smashbox shadows so now you starting to
see a little more contrast with it
hopefully and then I'm going to take
this kind of sparkling Navy shade
it's from the LA Sally girl line they're
all like 99 cents and they like hook
together and this one is Navy so I'm
going to grab my small contour brush and
just go along the you know my lashline
towards the outer half and then up into
the crease area
just going back and forth watching
edging my way slowly in okay
just getting going along with the basic
shape of my eye right now and now we
want to be you can see the difference
right now this eye this eye rather has
been smoked out a little bit and so to
do that I've got a really easy trick
that I want to share with you guys I'm
taking my angled liner brush dipping it
in that same Navy shadow I was just
using and then I'm going to start like
I'm gonna just like do a powder shadow
line on the lower outer half of my lash
line only I'm drawing this directly up
like I was going to do a cat eye or
something okay now I'm going to take my
same little brush that I was using dip
it back into that same shadow just a
little bit and what this is going to do
is force me to blend out that little
line and where that line was placed is
the helps you create the perfect kind of
boundary for this little outer smokiness
we're dealing here so I'm just putting
on more shadow I'm extending it out
based on that one little area that I was
working with there okay and then I like
to take when I'm working with those
little brushes you have a lot of control
but I like to end up taking a bigger
brush that is bare
and just going over it it's like so
going back and forth comparing
what good thing is the other guy
and at this point you know I'm just
adding coverage what I feel like I need
it okay um so there there's the shadow
and then it's under shade that I just
happen to pair what this is called
cinnamon it's kind of a pretty shimmery
peachy champagne color and that's what
I've used it's a highlight that's how
many use as I highlight all over the
brow bone area and just on the verge of
that shadow I just use just to kind of
blend it further okay um
next comes the eyeliner and I'm going to
be using the prestige prestige liquid
liner in like a navy blue color
I'm just going to go ahead and do a line
all the way across with that from the
very inner corner all the way to the
outer corner and this is the kind of
kind of to go over me once you've drawn
a line a little bit gotta go over it
again
and then I'm just going to kind of wing
this out just a tad swinging it out ever
so slightly and you'll get a more subtle
look this isn't black so you get a more
subtle look there and then on the bottom
I'm going to take Revlon Colorstay on
the outer half I'm going to kind of
blend that in here right over that
little bit of shadow we had down there
and then the inner half I'm going to use
my covergirl perfect point plus in
midnight blue okay so just going in on
the inner inner part and it just kind of
helps tie in our blue theme all those is
a very subtle navy blue okay and then
last but not least I'm taking my
itty-bitty Coastal Scents brush the mini
contour brush this is seriously tiny see
how tiny that is I'm going to dip it
back into my Smashbox that white pearly
shade I was using before and just kind
of go around the tear duct area okay
bingo finally um my curl my eyelashes I
always hold it for 15 seconds that start
around time here so I'm just gonna do it
quick and then I'm using my your show
mascara
I just always wiggle friendly root of my
lashes to tip
okay and cut up there's my look for my
sister's wedding coming up this weekend
I hope you guys like this look I hope
it's something that will work for me
this weekend and end up looking good but
thank you all for watching and I hope to
do more tutorials and things like this
in the future thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
