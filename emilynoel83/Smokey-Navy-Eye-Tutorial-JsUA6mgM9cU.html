right now well I'm actually going to do
a tutorial for you on a look I'm going
to be doing this weekend for my sister's
wedding if I had the bridesmaid dress
here I wouldn't show it to you but it's
the colors are it's kind of a pretty
navy blue kind of a little bit shiny and
just a really pretty color out in the
sunlight and I'm messing around with
some looks right now and so I thought
hey I'll do a video on this i know i had
some more things on my to-do list to
show you guys but I thought the weddings
this weekend so I'll go ahead and look
this into a video so what I've got here
is sort of a it I'm I'm not sure this
may be just looking real just kind of
dark and black but it's actually kind of
a smoky navy blue I so I'm just going to
duplicate that on the right side right
now and just describe what i'm doing as
I do it so I've already put the primer
on here so the first step i'm using a
palette from Revlon lip cream eyeshadow
palette has a ton of colors in it and
i'm using it's actually a small
concealer brush fine concealer brush
from CVS
Beauty brushes but I actually use this
little bitty guy for my cream shadow so
i'm using this silvery color right here
i'm just going to put it all over my
wood so this will just i know i've
already put a base on there this is kind
of enhance that and really give the
shadow of the crew on over the top of
this something t really cling to them so
once i do that then i'm going to go down
here to this pretty navy shape this this
one right here and I'm just going to
concentrate that on the outer half now
just using the same brush
smudging it into the crease a little bit
no I'm just working it in from the outer
half like so ok
so he's are looking like now so now
we're going to move on to the powder
shadow face and I'm just going to be
using my ELF eyeshadow brush and this
curly white shade in my Smashbox trio
and I'm going to be putting out on the
inner portion of my eyelid
just kind of packing it in there it's
just such a pretty curly effect and
brush looks great with my Smashbox
shadows so now you starting to see a
little more contrast with it hopefully
and then I'm going to take this kind of
sparkling Navy shape it's from the LA
sally girl line they're all like 99
cents and they like hook together and
this one is Navy so I'm going to grab my
small contour brush and just go along
the you know my lash line towards the
outer half and then up into the crease
area
just going back and forth watching
edging my way slowly in okay
just getting going along with the basic
shape of my eye right now and now we
want to be you can see the difference
right now this I this I rather has been
smoked out a little bit and so to do
that I've got a really easy trick that I
want to share with you guys I'm taking
my angled liner brush dipping it in that
same Navy shadow i was just using and
then i'm going to start like i'm going
to just like do a powder shadow line on
the lower outer half of my lashline only
i'm drawing this directly up like i was
going to do a cat eye or something okay
now i'm going to take my same little
brush that I was using dip it back in
that same shadow just a little bit and
what this is going to do is force me to
blend out that little wine and where
that wine was placed is the helps you
create the perfect kind of boundary for
this little outer smokiness we're
dealing here so I'm just putting on more
shadow I'm extending it out based on
that one little area that I was working
with their okay and then I like to take
when i'm working with those little
brushes you have a lot of control but i
like to end up taking a bigger brush
that is bare and just going over it
it's like so going back and forth
comparing looking good thing is the
other guy
and at this point you know I'm just
adding coverage what I feel like I need
it okay um so there there's the shadow
and then it's under shade that I just
happen to pair what this is called
cinnamon it's kind of a pretty shimmery
peachy champagne color and that's what
I've used to highlight that's i'm going
to use as I highlight all over the brow
bone area and just on the verge of that
shadow I just use just to kind of blend
it further okay um next comes the
eyeliner and I'm going to be using the
prestige prestige liquid liner in like a
navy blue color
I'm just going to go ahead and do a line
all the way across with that from the
very inner corner all the way to the
outer corner and this is the kind of
kind of have to go over maybe once
you've drawn a line a little bit you
gotta go over it again and then I'm just
gonna kind of wing this out just a tad
swinging it out ever since likely and
you'll get a more subtle look this isn't
black so you get a more subtle look
there and then on the bottom i'm going
to take revlon colorstay on the outer
half you can kind of blend that in here
right over that little bit of shadow we
had down there okay you blend in
and then the inner half I'm going to use
my covergirl perfect point plus in
midnight blue okay so just going in on
the inner in part and it just kind of
helps tie in our blue theme all those is
a very subtle navy blue okay and then
last but not least i'm taking my itty
bitty Coastal Scents brush the mini
contour brush this is seriously tiny see
how tiny that is I'm going to dip it
back into my Smashbox that white pearly
shade i was using before and just kind
of go around the teardown area okay
bingo finally um my curl my eyelashes I
always hold it for 15 seconds that
started around time here sounds good do
it quick and then i'm using my your show
mascara
I used always wiggle friendly rid of my
lashes to tip
okay and cut up there's my look for my
sister's wedding coming up this weekend
I hope you guys like this look I hope
it's something that will work for me
this weekend and end up looking good but
thank you all for watching and I hope to
do more tutorials and things like this
in the future thanks bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
