I just really freaking love this I look
so I'm gonna show you how to do it in
this video and the stars of the show are
my macros pigment and my lorac pro 2
palette this is a pairing of that
beautiful highly shimmery rose shade and
some matte navy blue I just love the way
it comes together so I hope you like it
too just applied some Milani eyeshadow
primer all over the surface of the eye
area just to get started because we're
not actually beginning with the pigment
part I want to lay down sort of a base
of color first so that can really stand
out I've practiced this look a few times
and I've kind of mess with the sequence
of the shades I'm applying I think this
is the way I like it best to help the
pigments stand out but yet everything
looks kind of blended so I'm gonna begin
with my lorac pro 2 palette and this
light brown shade taking my sigma e25
thatshe is just going right here in the
crease very simple just back and forth
all the way from the inner most part to
the outer part really just kind of
accentuating that natural shadow that's
already there then using a fluffy bear
brush this is my e-40 I'm just going to
blend over the edge of that and I'm
going to take buff with that brush and
I'm going to apply that just under the
eyebrow and kind of along the edge of
the light brown then I'm going to use
just a little bit of nectar this peachy
shade again with the e25 and that's
going right in here kind of just above
where light Brown was so that was the
neutral phase of this look now we're
bringing in some pink and I am using one
of these Maybelline Color tattoos this
is an inked in pink I'm using this as my
base for the pigment I find that this is
able to grab that loose shimmery product
really well and you're going to want to
put this over pretty much the whole lid
and then here is my Mac pigment in rows
this is the 239 from Mac and it works
really well I think for laying down this
pigment so I'm just going to pick up
some of that very carefully you know
we're going to go a little at a time
here don't overload the brush and I'm
just going to begin patting that right
on top of where we put the Cutler tattoo
and my thought with this is that I want
some of the Navy to come in and kind of
overlap so I'm applying this probably to
3/4 of my lid here why not add a little
bit more I'm making myself feel like the
Pioneer Woman you know how she keeps
adding butter to stuff I keep anything
rose pigment to stuff I do love watching
her show on Saturday mornings so it's my
new Saturday morning cartoon so I'm
happy with the way that looks and then
as promised so you catch up small shadow
brush and I'm going to this gorgeous
Navy shade right here in my lorac pro 2
the first place you put your brush is
where the most shadow is gonna lay down
so we're gonna do this right here on the
outer part of the lid and I'm kind of
wedging this shade up into the crease
also but I'm slowly working my way
inward a little bit so I'm starting to
overlap some of the rows and I think
it's just a beautiful thing when this
matte Navy comes in contact with the
Rose pigment it just does something
really special
not to get too deep or anything but I
love it and then something I love doing
with this brush is just flipping it
around we want to make sure the deepest
part of this shadow is right here in the
crease and on the lid because we will be
kind of shearing that out a little bit
on the outer part going into that Navy
again but with a very wispy brush this
is my e36 now I'm normally using this
for lighter transition type shades but
now we're actually going to use this
brush to help us kind of shape the the
way this Navy is coming off here like
give us a little bit of a very soft
outer V and blue can be a tricky shade
to use in this manner I think you know
it's great packed on but to wear navy
blue in a soft way I think can be a bit
of a challenge so I'm doing this with
like the tiniest amount of product on my
brush and you see how I'm kind of
working that outer V shape as if it's
pointing to the outer part of my eyebrow
here and of course you've got your
friend the bear brush to bring in to
soften everything up if you mean to I
like to let my liquid liner kind of set
the stage for what I'm going to do on
the lower lash line so I'm using my
Jordana color Envy yes I got a fresh one
I ordered three of these off of the
Jordana website the shade is black Envy
and I just love this liquid liner brush
tip applicator really smooth dark matte
just starting in the inner corner there
pulling across and I do think a wing
kind of accentuates the shadow shape
we're going with today so I am winging
it out a little bit winging hard to say
I sounded a little dr. evil it should
air magma so nothing huge that's my
typical wing size I would say in the
lower inner rim I'm taking a true-blue
liner I think there's a lot of darkness
happening here and a heavy lash but the
blue and the lower inner rim kind of
brightens up the whites of your eyes
somewhat so this is the Jane liner in
midnight blue by the way I'm not seeing
Jane on ulties website anymore if it has
it already been phased out I think you
can still get Jane on the Jane Cosmetics
website but anywho any blue liner that
you like I think NYX has a nice true
blue slide on liner I'm also just kind
of dabbing this in between the lashes on
the actual skin stiff angled brush going
into Navy blend up to our wing right
there and overlap some of the eyeliner
and then I'm using my pencil brush and
basically just kind of combining a
little bit of charcoal and Navy and
that's gonna be what I do on the whole
rest of the lower lash line and now
here's the part in tutorials where I
start second-guessing the met level of
darkness from one eye to the other it's
a problem when you do one eye first
curling lashes and then using tarts
gifted mascara here just getting a
little bit of that on the lashes to act
as kind of a base for the falsies this
is covergirl clump pressure
water-resistant
on the lower lashes this is the Coco
brand
number 201 the reason why I love a lash
with this look I think it's pretty even
without lashes but I kind of loved the
peekaboo effect you know you don't
really see that high
with the with your eyes open but then
you look down it's like that pretty just
pop of something should that be the name
of this tutorial pop of something and
just getting these lashes placed here
there's something that just feels good
about it snowing outside and me being
inside doing makeup so to finish things
off I just did one quick dab of mascara
there to blend the real and fake lashes
and that is the eye look I've really
really enjoyed playing with these new
Mac pigments that I've gotten my hands
on in that little set this is the set by
the way that Rose came in I talked about
this in my Mac haul video but I'm loving
these just to let you know a few other
key products that I used in this look I
used this highlight and contour pro
palette from NYX which I am loving this
shade right here is my contour and I
think I've got a pretty fierce contour
happening today my blush is this Milani
romantic rose powder blush good lord do
I love this shade it doesn't look that
exciting maybe here in the product I
mean this is gorgeous but the shade
itself you know might not seem like
anything too must-have --is-- but I love
just that neutral pink look did I just
say must-have ish what is my deal today
my highlight is this Becca shimmering
skin Perfector this is the liquidy
version the mini sized from that trio in
pearl lip is to face melted in melted
nude that's pretty much most of the
color you see coming off of here but I
do have a little bit of my Milani color
statement lip liner in spice just a
little bit around the edges to help
define things but that's all thank you
guys so much for watching this tutorial
and I will see you again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
