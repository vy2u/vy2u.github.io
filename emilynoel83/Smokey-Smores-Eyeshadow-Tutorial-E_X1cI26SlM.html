for this video this is a requested look
based on a photo I tweeted over the
weekend
I was going out and I took a picture of
my I look and I think I pretty much
duplicated that it's hard because I was
using the 88 shimmer palette and or not
88 shimmer 88 warm which is full of
these neutral shades and so I knew I
used it for that look but going back
it's like okay did I use that brown or
the brown two shades over but I kind of
did my best at duplicating the basic
idea of the look which is kind of smoky
kind of some winged outliner that's not
liquid liner it's actually pencil and so
I hope you like this tutorial with my
face makeup i just used actually my
dream mousse dream smooth mousse
foundation it's the new product from
maybelline which i'm going to be
reviewing but anyway i used that used a
little bronzer also my elf blush and
bronzer duo i use the bronzer as a
contour and the blush that peachy kind
of shimmery blush on my cheeks so i'll
take you through the whole eye looks so
keep on launch thing i did I applied my
Urban Decay primer potion all over my
lid I have several different eye primers
so I just kind of rotate through them
all on Urban Decay two faced shadow
insurance palladia herbal eyeshadow
primer they all work really well so
anyway I'm going to reach for my coastal
scents 88 warm palette going to use this
peachy pink shade right there I'm just
going to apply that mainly over the
inner half of my lid using my Sigma SS
239 brush it's good for packing on color
so just get some of that there and I'm
going to look down into a mirror and
just Pat that all over there and kind of
on a little bit on the under side there
too so just Pat it on until it's all
kind of blended in on the lid next I'm
going to go over to the far side of the
palette and use this brown right here
going to be using this on the outer part
of my lid and kind of in the crease and
then I'm going to go to this darkest
shade in the corner to further define
that area and set some of the line
so now that you've got a picture of what
those two are I'm going to take the same
SS 239 brush get a little bit of that a
shadow on there and just kind of overlap
that last shade that I applied and kind
of buff the edge between the two and
start working this shadow all the way to
the crease there and just kind of go you
know the inner part and just kind of
using that brush like a little wedge to
really get the color in there now using
that same shadow I'm going to use a
different brush it's the 226 and it's
from the premium brush kit from Sigma
I'm going to get some of that on there
this brush is a little bit pointy and it
can give you a pretty you know defined
application of the color I'm going to
use that to kind of create the outer V
just kind of taking it over and up from
the outer corner a little bit and you
can see you get like a really nice
buffed out appearance there now to
really blend that out I'm going to use
the SS 222 it's also in the premium kit
and I'm going to just really blend that
shadow out even more so you can't really
see any sort of harsh edge to it and
next I'm going to take a new shade here
it's let's see which one was then oh
it's this color right here um just a
couple of shades up it's kind of a light
well not super light but it's a purple
plum that has a little shimmer to it get
a little bit of that on the brush and
just go over the border of what we just
did just like so really warms it up and
then go back to the shade that we put
all over the inner part of our lid that
peachy pink and use that right under the
eyebrow and then i'm taking my small
brush this comes in the regular sigma
brush kit the 219 kind of
small pencil brush take the shade in the
very bottom corner on the right hand
side of your palate I pointed it out
just a little bit ago and I'm going to
take that to deepen up the crease even
more right on the outside next I'm going
to go in with some liner I'm just going
to use a really soft black pencil liner
for me it's the Maybelline de final line
and ebony black it has a nice smudge tip
on the other end and so I'm going to
take this and go all along my upper lash
line so you know you some people you
know you can start in the middle if you
feel more comfortable with that or you
can start on the inside like I'm doing
right now and just kind of take that all
along and i'm actually not probably
applying it as intensely as you could I
just kind of want sort of a smoky
smudged look there once you get to the
outside actually try drawing it out just
a little bit like that kind of doing a
wing with it and then just fill it in
once you've got that when kind of
connected to the bottom do whatever you
need to do to kind of make that look a
little more fluid there on the outside
and then just go all the way under and
that we're going to definitely be
smudging out actually I'm just forgot i
only went part of the way under with the
liner and then i want the rest of the
way with shadows so that's going to give
it a little softer look there so take
off your smudge tip as well and kind of
go over that bottom part there and
smudge out this little outer area to
because it's going to help us when we go
in with some shadow on the underside
there next I'm taking my Sigma SS 266 it
is the stiff angled liner brush and I'm
going to go to that far bottom corner of
my palette again that dark brown and I'm
just going to go over that liner just a
little bit and give it a really softened
appearance you can see how soft it looks
around that liner on that side we're
going for a similar look here and so I'm
just going to get some of that on there
to set that and I'm going to take that
same shade all the way in and then going
back to our pencil brush that's what's
going to really give you that that
softened up appearance here on the
outside so I'm taking that with that
same brown just a little bit on there
and we're going for that kind of same
look on this I so just go again with the
outer corner and just kind of round
around your your black liner there
another finishing touch is to take that
same shade that you used all over your
lid and kind of take a smallish brush or
a q-tip and just kind of run that around
the tear duct area here I've been asked
what my favorite white eyeliner is to
kind of go in on your waterline here and
I don't do this every time by the way
just some of the times when I eat
sometimes if I have a really dark I look
I think this kind of brightens up the
eye itself I use the soft Kohl pencil
from Rimmel and the color is what's the
color pure white so just take that all
over the water line and then I'm going
to curl my lashes and i'm using the
revlon grow luscious mascara on the top
and bottom lashes and then i'll join you
with the finished look
all right guys it's time to check out
the finished look for this tutorial as
you can see just a really super warm
brown look it kind of comes off extra
smoky when you put the mascara on your
lower lashes I just think it kind of
heats the whole look up just a little
bit again this was just a random look
that I did over the weekend tweeted a
picture of it and then you guys said you
wanted to see it so thanks for your
interest in this look and I will do more
like this soon I've just been using that
88 palette so much lately just messing
around trying to do different looks Oh
on my lips I am wearing my jordana
lipliner in baby berry I just kind of
put that on really lightly and then over
the top of that i have my be less lipped
oxyle sheer I think this is a lip
plumper and the shade is celeb so it is
very sheer it's just kind of like comes
off like a really lightweight gloss so I
like that it's not one of those stinging
lip plumpers that you really feel on
your lips a whole lot so I like that
very much so thanks again for tuning in
for this video guys let me know if you
have any other requests and have a great
day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
