brown I look but not only are we using
brown we're using a lot of really
interesting bronzy tones to some sparkly
colors some pigments so it's going to be
a really fun look and i also want to
mention that on my lips I'm using a glam
couture lip gloss which I haven't tried
before this shade is silky so it's a
pretty you know bronzy a little bit of
golden undertones to it I think it's
just perfect with the whole face look
we've got going on so if you want to see
how I pulled off this I look keep on
watching step 1 i'm going to take my be
less at 0 magnet in light and just apply
that all over my eyelid this is since
we're going to be starting out with a
loose pigment i just really like how
this grabs on to that pigment and it
will really keep it on our eyelid so
just really really sheer layer of that
then i'm going to take my pigment sample
that i have here from glam couture
cosmetics and the color is bronze
goddess so it's that sort of a look
really sparkly and it turns out to be a
little darker than you initially think
it will be but that's good because we're
going to we have some other lighter
shades to work with as well so i'm going
to take my ELF eyeshadow brush and just
kind of dip it into what I've got here
in my cap and tap off any excess and
this is just going to go basically all
over our lid and we're just using a
patting motion just trying to to Pat it
in all over our lid and it's kind of
like a nice chocolatey brown shade but
the bronze aspect is definitely that
sparkle that's in it as well and also
take it up to the crease
and this is just sort of that stage
where we're putting the color on we're
not necessarily really blending it at
this point we're just trying to get on
there in the least messy way possible
okay then now that I've got it on there
I'm going to take my Sephora round a
crease brush and just kind of blend it
out really does have a nice warm quality
to it I really like that then I'm going
to take this is the LA colors it's a
five color set called darling I actually
found this today for a dollar fifty at
my local dollar store and I think that's
great i love these five color sets from
LA colors because they remind me a lot
of the ad a chamber palette from coastal
scents but anyway i'm going to take my
little low cornell one quarter sized
brush here and i'm going to dip it into
this middle shade here it's kind of just
a metallic gold get in there and just go
over the inner part here of your eye and
you can see it's just lightening it up a
bit just go about halfway in and then if
you want to get even lighter there is a
white shimmery shade in that set if you
want to get that right there in the
corner okay now we're going to pay
attention to the outer half of the
crease here i'm going to take my fine
crease brush here form essence of beauty
and i'm going to use a pressed glam
couture shadow here this is called cocoa
puffs and it's just a really pretty kind
of shimmery medium brown shade and so
just get your brush in there and this is
going to be a little bit deeper a little
more on the brownish side of that bronze
shade we put on there so I'm just kind
of going over the top of what we did in
the crease and just working it out a
little bit
then I'm going to take my glam couture
eyeshadow again in night in Vegas and so
this is just this has gold glitter in it
so you might think of you know blacks
and browns mixing but this works really
well because we keep that warmth with
gold glitter that's in this but it's not
over the top this is a black you could
be your go-to black for really any look
but I'm going to take it and target it
right here in the on the outer outer
section of the crease and just kind of
define our outer V a little bit more
there we had the brown now we're putting
in the smoky and just kind of blend up
out till you do develop your desired
level of darkness there and then after
you get done with that step it's
probably a good idea to sort of blend
out around the edges just to make sure
you've covered your tracks there a
little bit and then I would say go back
to that color in the middle of this
palette that pretty gold shade makes a
really nice kind of fade up there makes
it excellent highlight so I'm just going
to apply that all the way up to my
eyebrow next I'm going to use a deep
brown a liquid liner I'm going to use my
femme Couture liquid eyeliner this is
available at sally beauty supply and i'm
going to use it again in brown is the
shade name and so i'm just going to go
from inner to outer corner on this just
building a foundation here for the false
eyelashes that are going to come
and we're extending out a little bit
just kind of to blend and make sense
with that outer V it's just going to
make your eyes look a whole lot bigger
when you do something like this then for
a lower liner i'm using my revlon
colorstay pencil in black brown and for
this part is blending it up to that
brown liquid and then just taking it
down below and I will pull this all the
way into the inner corner here now we
want to make sure we set that on liner
that we just did there so I'm going to
use night in Vegas on the outer part of
that and then I'm going to use a
different brown shade for the inner
portion so just to kind of keep with
this you know darkness we've got going
on on the outer part here this just
helps with absorbing any oils that come
about as a result of that liner then I'm
going to take coco puffs that pretty
brown shade get some of that on my liner
brush and apply that right there kind of
meet him halfway next you want to go
ahead and curl your lashes I'm going to
apply a coat of Too Faced lash injection
mascara and then I'm going to apply some
false lashes and I'll join you with the
finished look alright guys here's our
finished smokey brown look it's just a
really warm look it's good for summer
because a lot of us are trying to go for
that bronze skin look as well so this
goes right along with that without being
maybe a stark as a black bloke smokey
eye elsewhere on the face i use my
Milani powder bronzer in light i did a
lot of contouring with that kind of
around here and around the cheeks and i
also use my covergirl cheekers blush in
golden pink as a nice cheap contour
there it goes right along with our color
scheme and then it's sort of an overall
shimmer concentrating mostly on the
center of the face I use my shimmer
strips from physicians formula
in Waikiki strip that's kind of a peachy
glow bronzer and / highlighters so um I
hope you guys like this look I think
it's definitely very wearable for the
summer months so and really any time I'm
hearing for that matter so thanks so
much for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
