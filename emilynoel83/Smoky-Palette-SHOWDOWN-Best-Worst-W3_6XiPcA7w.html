you're all having a great day I'm having
a good morning so far because I am
surrounded by eyeshadow palettes one of
my favorite topics to talk about and I
thought this video would be kind of
relevant now because Urban Decay has
recently released the smokey palette the
naked smoky eye thought as opposed to
just giving one review on this I could
kind of review this but also talk about
all the other palettes labeled as smokey
and kind of see how everything stacks up
so I've got drugstore thinks I've got
really really inexpensive things but
with this video I am sticking to just
pallets that have like smoky or smokey
eye in the name because I mean if you
look across my collection or probably
your own collection you could see a lot
of palettes that you could create smokey
looks with that aren't necessarily
marketed as a smokey eye palette so if I
wanted to talk about every palette that
could potentially create a smokey eye we
would be here all day and probably
tomorrow and maybe even the next day so
we're really just looking at those
palettes that have smoky in the claim
and how well do they execute on that so
I've got a couple that are definite
misses for me a few that are so-so and
then a few recommendations so I'm going
to start at the low end and talk about
the one that was probably my least
favorite and it's the LA girl smoky
palette they've got these things called
Beauty bricks but this smoky one really
has a lot of cool tones in it you've got
some bluish colors some deep navies some
very cool Browns you've got some
shimmers and then sprinkled throughout
there some mattes there are several
neutral mattes right in the middle at a
glance that seems like it would be a
totally workable palette but
unfortunately the pigmentation is just
not there I mean could you put a base
underneath these and get a little bit
extra out of them yes you probably could
but really it's a lot of extra work with
just building up the shadows and making
them look how you want them to look and
still I didn't feel like I was achieving
you know my my vision that I had with
this palette so it's too bad because I
really love a good affordable nice
quality palette but this one's just
missing the mark another one that was a
real dud for me is the NYX smokey eye
shadow palette and the reason why here
is not so much that the shadows are poor
quality but they're also dark that I
really only end up getting one look with
this regardless of the different deep
tones that I choose they've got a navy
in here they've got a plum a black a
very deep charcoal type shade and you
might use it and think I'll do a plum
smoky I'll pull in that shade and really
you find when you finish the look it
ends up looking no different than the
Navy smokey eye would have or you know
just sticking with the charcoal shades
it just looks dark not that a dark eye
is bad but I do see people picking this
up and thinking oh it's got a couple of
colors in there that'll be fun but it
really it's just not so fun sadly
there's a fabulously pigmented black in
this palette and the other shades
actually have a pretty nice texture as
well but for me there's just a real lack
of versatility in this palette so it's
one I would definitely skip now I've got
a few so-so smokey palettes one is from
Maybelline and it's called the smokes I
think I may have mentioned this in a
whole video I have already reviewed the
nudes and the blush nudes and so now
here is the smokes palette and the way
Maybelline has set these palettes up
it's so you will have three separate
quads or three shades that will work
together side by side for trios or than
a bunch of duo's as well and I think
that theme kind of works for this
palette you would have a very you know
frosty duo but those do together as I've
said when I reviewed other palettes of
this kind I do like that idea I like the
thought that it's making it more user
friendly and it's all mapped out on the
back I feel like this is definitely
better pigmentation than that la girl
smoky palette I was talking about so
that's why it's kind of in my
middle-of-the-pack section here because
you know it could be better it could be
much more pigmented some of the
different colors they've put in here
could have a lot more payoff similar to
that NYX one you know you throw in the
plum into your look and it just ends up
looking dark and I mean that shades
pretty weak actually as is doesn't show
up very plummy I do think there's a good
balance of dark medium and light here I
really like that they threw in just a
medium matte Brown to work with and that
one's actually pretty nicely pigmented
there's just some inconsistency
throughout the palette I don't hate it
but I also don't love it now the elf
everyday smoky palette if you watch my
big review where I took all of these new
elf palettes that have come out and kind
of did a big rundown on them you saw
this one mentioned and this is called
everyday smokey
you look at it I mean it looks fine you
know okay got highlights you've got
mid-tone shades you got dark shades or
some shimmer there's some matte actually
a lot of these shades feel really nice
to the touch I problem with this is that
there's just nothing getting me super
excited I can do a decent smoky eye with
this no problem and even that black is
really saturated and intense I'm not
saying this is a horrible palette or to
totally stay away from it it's just for
me as I look at it I wish there was
something a little different going on
and this just may be someone's take you
already has a lot of eyeshadow palettes
it's like I'd like to see something
maybe that pops just a little bit more
maybe a little brighter like bronzy
shade that could switch up the look
somewhat because I think when I look at
palettes and when I review palettes I
tend to look at them from the standpoint
of if this were all you were going to
use as opposed to thinking oh this could
be good if I brought in X Y &amp;amp; Z because
I think the concept of the palette is
having a kit you can use as is so for me
again this is in the middle don't love
it don't hate it I just feel like I'm
only going to turn out basically one
kind of look with this and the last one
that I feel kind of about is this BH
Cosmetics forever smoky palette this is
more of a multi palette I guess it's got
six eyeshadows it's got a highlight
which could be an eyeshadow as well a
couple of blush shades and actually a
couple of lip colors in there as well
big old mirror a nice packaging good for
travel and actually I think nice
pigmentation on these shadows you're not
going to get like again a wide range of
looks with these but what they have
included here you know it is kind of
soft and nicely pigmented and some nice
shimmery tones in there and then you
just have the one matte black I really
would have liked to have seen more than
just that one matte shade in this bunch
the blushes I found to be a little bit
chalky didn't love that looked not wild
about the particular lip colors that are
thrown into this as well really and this
is going off of the the Smokey theme for
a moment I actually have the forever
nude palette and I used this all the
dang time right before we moved because
I was packing up so much makeup but this
was kind of new to me at the time so I
kept this out and so I was using this so
so much and I
love this palette I actually really like
the blush shades
I love these eyeshadows either there's a
really really dark plum that sheers out
and can kind of go a lot of different
ways and this matte pink is fun to work
with some rosy gold type colors and I
just love this so when I pull out this
forever smoky palette I can't help but
kind of compare it to this and think
about how much better I like this so
it's really not that this one totally
sucks but it's just average in the scope
of my smoky palettes and definitely
average compared to this one
ah you guys have no idea how many times
stuff has fallen off of my desk okay now
some happy thoughts some positive
thoughts on the pallets that I really
enjoyed a couple of them that I want to
tell you about are my NYC yes
NYC individualized pallets here I
actually have the ones for smokey greens
and smokey Browns that's what they're
called I have really enjoyed these I
really would recommend them to you they
actually include their own like kind of
nude base in here and when you put the
shadows on top of that they are so darn
pigmented or even decent if you swatch
them out on their own but on top of that
they're really fantastic you also have a
cream like illuminizer as well which I
don't love under every circumstance
actually with this smoky palette and
this silvery shade looks really pretty
topping that because this has a little
bit of glow to it but talking about the
smoky Browns first I have gotten such a
great little smoky eye out of this kit
and I'm taking into account the fact
these are so inexpensive but I still
think they're really good there's a nice
deep black in here I really like the
kind of dusty it's like they're not
trying to make it purple it's just like
a dusty deep kind of plummy grey and it
really works for that and I've loved
that shade on my eyes and then you've
got this medium taupe and then like I
said this really light silvery shade
which can totally pop if you put it on
top of this but I would say this gives
me kind of a classic smoky eye I have
worn this before in videos I always seem
to get questions about my eye looks when
I'm wearing these dang NYC palettes
whether it's these or the trio's and
it's just crazy and I'm more than
excited to tell you about them because
they're so darn inexpensive but of these
two I think the one that I even like
better just because of my plum and
burgundy obsession is the smoky greens
because you get this super deep dark
plum this burgundy shade which does have
a little shimmer to it there's a soft
lilac and then this creamy color right
down here I've just gotten such pretty
looks with this if you'd like to see a
tutorial actually on any of these
palettes let me know in the comments
section which ones because I'd be happy
to do it you're going to pay like four
or five bucks for this thing
and it works that well like yeah I
totally recommend it and then the other
thing that I would recommend and this is
probably the priciest one that I'm going
to talk about I kind of knocked this in
my haul video a little bit just on kind
of a first impression basis because I
look at it and I think what's different
about this you know I've got a lot of
smoky things in my collection what makes
this different and talking about the
naked smoked pallet but the more I've
used this and more I played around with
it the shadows really are phenomenal
quality you look at them all swatched
out in the lineup and it's like yeah
they all really look nice
I only complaints on this which it's
probably kind of a nitpick that I would
like to see maybe some mid-tone mattes
they're truly like medium because this
is pretty dark this is pretty light
something kind of in between that that
would make a nice like crease shade just
a general shade for that purpose because
a lot of the colors that you would put
in your crease to get definition are
very very dark and I get it it's a smoky
palette it's going to be dark I think
you might have a little more versatility
if you had something like right in
between these two shades you know what
I'm saying if you've got this palette
and you've got a lot of eyeshadows no
problem you could probably pull one in
and you know use it to supplement this
palette these shadows are so easy to
work with easy to get the color payoff
with for this look today I used the
smoky palette but I didn't actually do a
classic smoky eye I kept all the drama
above the eye I'm kind of liking to do
that lately and then kept it very bare
on the lower lashline actually only
using a little bit of mascara down there
but up top I used basically these three
colors I used slanted all over the lid
and then I blended dagger into the
crease and I used this darkest shade
black market on the outside a little bit
oh and 13 is my highlight and a little
bit of this shade around the inner
corner more I use this the more I kind
of realized yes this palette can go in a
pretty natural direction if you want it
to I mean you look at what's happening
down at this end it's all just matte
very classic shades
I'm really glad they have this shade
called radar in there because I think
it's great to have kind of a pretty
bronzed e-type tone but there's just a
lot of cool in this palette if you're a
big warm eyes shadow fan there's not
a lot in here for you I haven't gotten a
lot of use out of this brush yet it's
kind of a blender type brush really soft
and then a smudgy brush so if I were to
do a classic smokey eye I would totally
used it right down here on the lower
lash line bottom line I can't argue with
the quality if you're a collector of
Urban Decay Naked palette you're
probably going to want to have this I
like the packaging it's very solid but
one thing I got to mention I really like
the Urban Decay smoked palette it was
the kind that zipped around it was a
different layout than these naked ones
on several jewel tone colors that really
had nice color payoff and then some
neutrals as well I love that and I don't
think they sell that anymore otherwise I
totally would have given that my fullest
recommendation like I love that thing as
well pull it out to show you and a lot
of you might already have this I love
the fun options in this and Urban Decay
does their shadows so pigmented that you
really do see these colors when you use
them so that medium matte Brown and some
colors that are just I don't know a
little more fun could have made this
palette a little more unique and special
to me and you do have the plum in there
but beyond that it's all just very cool
and neutral I hope this is making sense
in the scope of everything Urban Decay
has done I don't think this is their
best but if you just want to talk smoky
eye palettes which is the topic of this
video I do think this is one of the ones
along with those at little NYC ones
which for the price are amazing but I do
think this tends to come out on top
because it's great quality and you can
go very natural or very deep and dark
with this thing so thank you guys so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this video hope it gave you a little
insight on some of these different
smokey eye palettes and which ones may
or may not be worth your time and money
so I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
