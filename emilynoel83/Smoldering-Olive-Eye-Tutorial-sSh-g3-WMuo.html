prime our lids I'm gonna use my ELF
cream shadow in olive and I'm gonna be
using this pretty spring green shade
here and just gonna lightly really
trying to use it sparingly because you
know a little bit can be great for
staying power too much can kind of mess
you up so just lightly kind of apply
that all over the wood next step I'm
gonna go for my Smashbox eyeshadow duo
in delightful and this is a nice pretty
green with sort of a buttery yellow
shade this came out in the rapture set
of a bunch of duo's that came out this
past Christmas so you know you may if
you don't have it you may not I'm not
sure if you can get your hands on it but
this is great but if you have something
comparable by all means get that but
this green has some nice golden
undertones I really like it I'm gonna
use my ELF
eyeshadow brush to pack this on all over
my lid love love the quality of Smashbox
eyeshadows just fantastic in my opinion
and I'm gonna work that up to my crease
there next we want to get a wash of more
of less of a spring green and more of a
deeper olive green shade and for that
I'm gonna use this Milani single and
antique gold and it is kind of like an
old gold shade but it does have some
notes of olive in it so this will work
really nicely for this step I'm gonna
use my Sonia Kashuk medium eyeshadow
brush I'm just gonna start packing this
along the crease
just like that kind of starting to
create that outer-v but we're going to
come in with a black shading a little
bit to take care of any unfinished
business there but for now you can see
this is just kind of really enhancing
the green we already have just taking a
different shade and I know it's kind of
a hodgepodge of shadows that I'm using
for this tutorial but I'm just so
pleased with how they work together and
because of this I may do more green
looks because I just love the way this
is this Sun look turn next we're gonna
go for any black shade you have shimmery
matte it really doesn't matter I'm gonna
use this makeup forever diamond shadow
here and it's a very nice sparkly black
shade and I'm gonna use my fine crease
brush my essence of beauty crease brush
and just get a little bit on the brush
and with this we're just going to try to
define our outer V a little bit better
here within these nice olive shades
we've got just deepening up and I just I
really enjoy working with blacks
sometimes you layer a black and if it's
really an opaque matte black you know
it's just it's just gonna look black
sometimes but it's an interesting effect
you get when you go over like the spring
green shade with a black that has a
slight hint of shimmer to it you you
know you get you get that dark green
shade really so it's kind of like you
know mixing shadows practically becomes
like it would be mixing paint or
something like that so anyway just get
that outer crease is defined as you want
it and I'm gonna go with it there and
then as my highlight I'm just gonna go
back to my Smashbox 2 duo and use that
buttery yellow shade first though I'm
gonna go back to the Milani umm antique
gold and just sort of use that to create
a border then kind of smoothing out the
black we put on there and and just
really you know fading it up to nothing
now for that highlight I was
talking about just right under the brow
and there's your shadow the liner for
this look I'm gonna be using my Revlon
Colorstay eyeliner in black it's black
and it's just a matter of taking it from
the inner corner to the outer corner
here just making it a nice thin define
line now what I'm not talking some
people say they can hear my clock which
is kind of right above my desk here
ticking so I apologize if you find that
annoying I think someone said they just
couldn't stand it so you never know I
can never you know sometimes you think
you know what people are gonna say about
certain videos you do it sometimes you
just cannot predict it it's one of those
things but anyway my apologies for the
clock I kind of need it there though so
it's probably gonna stay I'm just
extending this liner out a little bit
past the natural lash line also using
black on the bottom lash line this time
it's Revlon Colorstay pencil liner in
black and just looking it up to blend
with the outer corner of the liquid
liner and then just kind of get it
smudging right there in your lashline
taking it all the way to your inner
corner
now for a little bit of a smudged out
effect on the lower lash line I'm going
to take my liner brush put it in the
Milani antique gold and just go over it
with that so you know this you can take
maybe a little lower than the liner you
put on and it'll just kind of sort of
soften it up but make it a little more
smoky too
alright guys that's the finished look a
nice all of I utilize in several
different shades of green really and
quite a few different kinds of eyeshadow
too I went ahead and put on my false
eyelashes it's the Ardell fashion lashes
number 106
and I used on my bottom lash line I
don't usually put mascara there but for
fear of smudging but I have noticed
after you know a few times I've done
this that two-faced lash injection
actually works pretty well it holds up
really well if you put that on your
lower lash line so in on my lips I'm
using a product from Max Factor it's a
long wearing a lip color this side is
sort of like a neutral beige shade and
then you have this golden kind of top
coat that you put over it and it feels
really good on your lips for being like
a long wearing lip color so I like that
as far as the shade it says eighty on
this side and 740 on this side I hate
that when they don't put actual names of
the shade on the product but it's the
one that's kind of golden and neutral
and you'll probably you know you may
notice that if you're out in the stores
but anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
