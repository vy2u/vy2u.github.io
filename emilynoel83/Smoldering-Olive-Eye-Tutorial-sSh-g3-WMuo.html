prime our lids I'm going to use my ELF
cream shadow in olive and I'm going to
be using this pretty spring green shade
here and just gonna lightly really
trying to use it sparingly because you
know a little bit can be great for
staying power too much can kind of mess
you up so just lightly kind of apply
that all over the wood next step I'm
going to go for my Smashbox I shadow duo
in delightful and this is a nice pretty
green with sort of a buttery yellow
shade this came out in the rapture set
of a bunch of duos that came out this
past Christmas so you know you may if
you don't have it you may not I'm not
sure if you can get your hands on it but
this is great but if you have something
comparable by all means get that but
this green has some nice golden
undertones I really like it I'm going to
use my elf I shadow brush to pack this
on all over my lid love love the quality
of Smashbox eyeshadows just fantastic in
my opinion and I'm going to work that up
to my crease there next we want to get a
wash of more of less of a spring green
and more of a deeper olive green shade
and for that I'm going to use this
Milani single and antique gold and it is
kind of like an old gold shade but it
does have some notes of all of in it so
this will work really nicely for this
step I'm going to use my Sonia Kashuk
medium eyeshadow brush I'm just going to
start packing this along the crease
just like that kind of starting to
create that outer V but we're going to
come in with a black shading a little
bit to take care of any unfinished
business there but for now you can see
this is just kind of really enhancing
the green we already have just taking a
different shade and I know it's kind of
a hodgepodge of shadows that I'm using
for this tutorial but I'm just so
pleased with how they work together and
because of this i may do more green
looks because i just love the way this
is this son look turn next we're going
to go for any black shade you have
shimmery matt it really doesn't matter
i'm going to use this makeup forever
diamond shadow here and it's a very nice
sparkly black shade i'm going to use my
fine crease brush my essence of beauty
crease brush and just get a little bit
on the brush and with this we're just
going to try to define our outer v a
little bit better here within these nice
olive shades we've got just deepen them
up and i just i really enjoy working
with blacks sometimes you layer a black
and if it's really an opaque matte black
you know it's just it's just going to
look black sometimes but it's an
interesting effect you get when you go
over like the spring green shade with a
black that has a slight hint of shimmer
to it you you know you get you get that
dark green shade really so it's kind of
like you know mixing shadows practically
becomes like it would be mixing paint or
something like that so um anyway just
get that outer crease is defined as you
want it and I'm going to go with it
there and then as my highlight I'm just
going to go back to my smashbox duo and
use that buttery yellow shade first
though I'm going to go back to the
Milani um antique gold and just sort of
use that to create a border than kind of
smoothing out the black we put on there
and and just really you know fading it
up to nothing
now for that highlight shade I was
talking about just right under the brow
and there's your shadow liner for this
look I'm going to be using my Revlon
Colorstay eyeliner in black it's black
and it's just a matter of taking it from
the inner corner to the outer corner
here just making it a nice then define
line now what I'm not talking some
people say they can hear my clock which
is kind of right above my desk here
ticking so I apologize if you find that
annoying I think someone said they just
couldn't stand it so you never know I
can never you know sometimes you think
you know what people are going to say
about certain videos you do at some
times you just cannot predict it it's
one of those things but anyway my
apologies for the clock I kind of need
it there though so it's probably going
to stay I'm just extending this liner
out a little bit past the natural lash
line also using black on the bottom lash
line this time it's Revlon Colorstay
pencil liner in black and just flicking
it up to blend with the outer corner of
the liquid liner and then just kind of
get smudging right there in your lash
line taking it all the way to your inner
corner
now for a little bit of a smudged out
effect on the lower lash line I'm going
to take my liner brush put it in the ink
milani antique gold and just go over it
with that so you know this you can take
maybe a little lower than the liner you
put on and it'll just kind of sort of
soften it up but make it a little more
smokey too alright guys that's the
finished look a nice all of I utilizing
several different shades of green really
and quite a few different kinds of
eyeshadow to I went ahead and put on my
false eyelashes it's the ardell fashion
lashes number 106 and I used on my
bottom lash line I don't usually put
mascara there for fear of smudging but I
have noticed after you know a few times
I've done this that two-faced /
injection actually works pretty well I
holds up really well if you put that on
your lower lash line so and on my lips
I'm using a product for Max Factor it's
a long wearing a lip color this side is
sort of like a neutral beige shade and
then you have this golden kind of top
coat that you put over it and it feels
really good on your lips for being like
a long wearing lip color so I like that
and as far as the shade it says 80 on
this side and 740 on this side I hate
that when they don't put actual names of
the shade on the product but it's the
one that's kind of golden and neutral
and you'll probably you know you may
notice that if you're out in the stores
but anyway guys thank you so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
