just playing around with and I thought
why not do a tutorial on the look it's
one of the l'oreal infallible 24-hour
eye shadows and smoldering plum if you
keep up with my blog you saw me
incorporate this in one of my walgreens
holes on i thought how can i use this in
a look and I wanted it to be something
you know a little bit a little bit smoky
but still not too heavy for even a
daytime summer look so I threw in a
great silver shade from a wet and wild
trio called don't steal my thunder and I
used the smoldering plum as a liner it
has kind of a hard edge on top and then
it's really smoked out on the bottom
look is really easy and it could totally
be you know recreated with a lot of
different shadows and products you might
have every other product I'm using in
addition to these is drugstore except
for one so I hope you like the look so
after applying primer I started out by
taking the silver shade in don't steal
my thunder from wet and wild and I just
used a small eyeshadow brush this one is
one of my favorites it's actually from
Target I think it cost me like maybe a
couple dollars if that but it's a nice
small flat brush so I just patted that
all over my lid then I went to the light
shade in this trio just for a little
added brightness around the inner corner
and then take like a fluffy eyeshadow
brush and use that white shade under the
brow I used this really lightly if you
don't like this smoldering plum is a
real is really kind of walking the line
between burgundy and plums so I used my
Malley black cherry ever color starlight
eyeliner if you have something similar
use that or you could use a dark plum
liner if those are easier to come by but
I just went all across my lash line and
winged that just a little bit don't be
too concerned with the shape of the of
your wing because we're going to be
going over that we got out the L'Oreal
infallible shadow I've been talking
about I used an angled liner brush for a
really precise line and just top off
your eyeliner on the upper lash line and
then m'apelle it out we really want that
edge on the top I just thought this
would be kind of a different twist on an
eye look coming from me so I went with
more of an edge on top and then on the
bottom we're still going to take that
down to the lower lash
line and still take it all the way under
but we're going to be smoking that
bottom part out so it's like straight
line on top nice and soft and smokey on
the bottom and so you can use a pencil
brush to do that really easily it can be
bare or if you want to add a little more
product feel free but just go over that
took the pencil brush and just tapped it
on to like the little stopper type of
thing that comes on top of the
infallible I just went off of there just
to make sure I didn't get too much and
just go back and forth and your natural
crease for some more drama with this
look I used my Maybelline master drama
liner in midnight master it's a great
rich black very long wearing and I use
that in my waterline then I'm going to
curl my lashes and I applied some of the
Maybelline mega plush mascara which
isn't really one of my favorites but I
have it so I'm using I'm using my
Maybelline lash discovery mascara with
the tiny brush on my lower lashes to
give it that really nice feathery smoky
look after all was said and done I
decided to throw on some false lashes
these are from Revlon I will post the
exact style that they are but I just
thought they added a little bit to the
look and kind of emphasize the wing that
we've got going on with the line see
that eye look was super quick and simple
and it's just utilizing this pretty dark
plum color as a liner and just so you're
aware of the texture of these in case
you haven't seen these this is the first
one I bought but it does have that
little piece there and then it's a very
very soft shadow it's like a pigment
that's been pressed in here but not
totally rock-hard solid so that's what's
gonna give you such nice color you other
key products I used I'm trying out a new
foundation story of my life I've got
several others that I'm trying to but
this is the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
healthy luminous makeup flan photo-ready
bronzer it's that kind that I talked
about in my shopping list ideas with the
for color that became a bronzer and a
contour I used this wet and wild blush
in mellow wine I got this in a special
kit and just bitten kissable balm stain
and precious if that's what's giving me
this nice barely-there lip look I hope
you enjoyed this kind of simple quick
tutorial let me know if you have any
have a great day I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
