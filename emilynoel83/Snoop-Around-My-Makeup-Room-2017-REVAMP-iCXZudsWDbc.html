the makeup room for a little tour I am
joining you right now from my hot pink
chair that's one of my pops of color in
the room you may have noticed over the
past couple of months a lot has changed
in this room not just the paint color
but I've switched some things around
just decor wise and the whole placement
of my desk where I sit where I shoot my
videos that's all changed so I wanted to
show you around a little bit it's not
100% completed its really really hard I
find in decor to feel like yes I'm at a
place where I'm 100% satisfied and I'm
not going to change a thing because
there are certainly some things I'm
still going to be you know looking for
and tweaking a little bit but what I've
got going on in this room I am by far
the happiest I have ever been with any
makeup setup and if you've been with my
channel for a while you've seen it go
through a lot of transformations I mean
the apartment days was like a brown
closet in the background and then we had
the hot pink room in the old house and
then coming to this house I went through
you know my pepto-bismol pink phase
we'll call it that and now in here we've
got these lighter walls and it really I
think plays with the camera a little bit
better although I am going to still be
making some lighting changes just
equipment wise I'm going to be getting
some different lights in here
and I'll show you by the way at the end
of the video what the setup looks like
when my lights are back in here so
anyway I'll try to point out you know
where some things came from if I forget
feel free to ask in the comments section
also try to share as much as I can in
the info box as well with some specifics
but let's take a look around the biggest
change that I notice about this room is
all the floor space open in here now
because this l-shaped desk used to be
pulled right over to this area and it
was out from that window a little bit
I had my drawers pulled back a few feet
this way and so I had this just a little
like gap of carpet
space you know between the table and
that window so everything was just kind
of chunked over in this area so we push
the desk back against that wall and
centered up here between the two windows
hi Here I am in my PJs orts ensure the
artwork on the wall here by my sister I
love this painting by the way with the
gold and stuff it actually is just so
perfect with this room with the you know
black and pink and gold accents those
black cords those are part of the accent
now just kidding I got to deal with
those but you got space over here on
that side of the table
and also here as well I've still got my
IKEA drawers underneath the desk which
is a big part of my makeup storage and
I've got these over here as well so
these shifted down the wall a little bit
still got my little like starburst
mirror thing there so I thought I'd pull
this table underneath and one of my most
recent additions to the makeup room is
this pink chair I got it on
hayneedle.com and I love just the fun
pop of color in here you guys know I
still love my pink
even though Pink's not on my walls it
still lives in this room very much so
I've got that little gold pillow there
from five below I just think that makes
for a fun little more homey feel to this
room because well this is kind of a
studio setting in a way it still is very
much a room in my home and I wanted to
stay that way my makeup storage by the
way has changed up a ton I it was kind
of unintentional I just started weeding
things out once the new room was in
place and I pared down a lot I got rid
of so much stuff and I mean anybody
would look at the pile of stuff I got
rid of it's like dang that's a lot but I
still want to tear down even more so I
think what you're going to see on my
channel coming up is kind of a series
and it may be kind of broken up but some
declutter videos here I've been asked to
do those a lot and I do declutter on a
regular basis but I just haven't shot it
for a video but I feel like we're kind
of at a fun stage of the game here where
I can show you how my storage has
changed and in the process get rid of
some stuff too and give myself a little
more space but while I'm pointed over
here at this wall what's going on here
I've got another little few drawers
and those are holding a lot of like PR
types stuff things that are kind of
coming into my collection faster than I
have a chance to look at them so they're
kind of on standby in those drawers I've
got my empties been there which is
holding a few makeup bags at the moment
these are my IKEA drawers absolutely
love these they're one of the best ways
to store makeup that's why you see them
so often I'm sure in collection videos
and stuff like that and this is some of
the stuff you're currently seeing in my
backdrop I think you can expect this to
change probably seasonally but I really
like having an element of gold in this
room it's just kind of become the theme
I didn't really even intend for it to be
that way but once everything in this
room just kind of switched around
I saw what pieces I had and I thought
yes this sort of you know white stuff
the wall being what it is which is just
a little bit off-white it's Valspar
cream in my coffee by the way or is it
cream in your coffee
I think it's cream in my coffee but
that's the paint color and then we got
all this black and gold so I'm feeling
that very much but I've got some Besame
stuff here because that really fits the
vibe I've got a little picture there
ceramic cacti yes love those that was a
t.j.maxx line and this little table back
behind me this has always been here in
this place I put a clock up here as well
by the way and this is not what I want
to stay here I'd rather get more of a
furniture looking table here something
maybe that has some drawers to it so I
can actually use it storage wise I got a
little picture baby Eve there for now
some flowers that probably won't keep
there love my emote from a girl Erica
yeah that little area will be changing
this is a nice closet there this area of
this room is so unique I love how it's
got this notch back here and this has
always been kind of my office nook and I
haven't changed that really much I mean
I have gotten rid of the iMac that you
sit back here because I just found I
wasn't using this as a real editing
space most of the time I really find
myself just editing wherever the heck I
can but I do have the opportunity here
just with my laptop which is what I
primarily work on I can sit it down
there or just do whatever I want in this
area I got my little bulletin board
whiteboard there bookshelf with some
gorgeous makeup books makeup is art my
avanti's book i really love having this
tall bookcase here there's me and bub on
this little shelf a lot of times I've
got like a light just sitting over
against that wall I've got this picture
this was me in the old makeup room that
was kind of bright pink I'm planning to
get a gold frame around this one which i
think is really going to tie in nicely
my zebra bench with some stuff stored
under it yes stuff it exists I was here
this will stand that the TV is on I
don't know if you guys remember I had
this way back in the apartment it was
just kind of given to us by our landlord
at the time and I have since painted it
white I believe I did that when we were
in the old house and I kept it around
because it's just perfect for the TV and
now I have really repurposed this I
guess for what its storing down the
bottom I've got a bunch of different
face masks and skincare things I'm
storing those in a letter holder that
Cristen game gave me and I love that
it's really working great for not only
palettes but now face masks and this is
my nail stuff I have pared down a pretty
big nail polish collection to just as
much you guys may have noticed I rarely
do my nails anymore but I'm keeping
around just the shades that I really
really like I'm just not in a big nail
doing season of my life right now with
two little kids but I'll get back to it
eventually got some fragrances here in
that level and then this little twisty
turny thing I just have cute stuff you
know like really pretty pieces I've also
got some smaller perfumes and stuff up
top I've always been looking for the
perfect place to house that little
turntable storage thing and it seems to
be that top shelf so this is where I sit
to do my videos and my chair is usually
turned about like that so I'm looking
off in this direction this is where my
ring light sits and I've got two softbox
lights on either side I've got a few
things out here because this is kind of
just what it looks like on a regular
basis there's coffee mugs remote control
stuff see right here I've got my little
brush turntable thing I'm kind of
keeping that poked behind the mirror
just a little bit I've got some more
brushes in that gold thing those are my
eye brushes I've got a lot of surface
area to work with here and this is just
a lot of times where items sit that
currently using currently testing don't
want to tuck them away and forget about
them how it's that I'm using and
enjoying kind of rotate through that
basket need to empty my trash you see
that down there kind of wish the
lighting would have been a little bit
more natural light coming through the
window for this video but it is kind of
early when I shoot this so we're seeing
some overhead light and by the way this
picture I believe this is available as a
print if anybody wanted this amazing
makeup watercolor in their makeup room
or just anywhere in their house my
sister gave me this and that's the
original she gave that to me a couple
Christmases ago but if you go to our
website you can get that and you can get
all kinds of prints of her artwork too
which is all over our house and we just
love it but yeah I am so enjoying this
makeup room guys this is just a happy
place this is a wonderful space to get
to spend my mornings often time and this
is also a place that Belle has enjoyed
coming into and getting to poke around
I'm sure that will only increase as she
gets older and heck I've got enough
floor space here you know I've laid out
blankets put Eve down on it and you can
turn something on the TV there's room
for so many activities on this floor
like we could bring in twister we could
pull on a table and eat around it I mean
there is space for stuff to happen in
this room again so I'm really really
glad the overall layout has changed not
just to make it better to shoot my
videos but just a better space to live
in as well so this is what it looks like
with my lights in here typically I leave
that one up just for convenience sake
like when I'm not using them I turn them
off and that stay sitting there the ring
light sits right over here at the corner
of the table and then this one I just
pick up and stick back in here somewhere
but yes bright bright bright I think
what I want to do is maybe get some
softbox lights or some other kind of
side or back lighting that is just a
little bit slightly warmer in color
temperature I am obviously no lighting
expert but I feel like I don't know
everything will look a little more
natural like actually what I see in real
life if those lights were just a little
bit warmer and this is my
you when I shoot videos my cameras is
right on this tripod type thing that's
attached to the ring light so thank you
guys so much for taking time to watch
this video I hope it was interesting to
see a little bit more inside my space I
tried to give you the best sense that I
could of what's going on in here again
kind of a work in progress if you want
to see like some updates as I continue
to tweak things in here let me know and
I will most definitely be taking you
through what's in some of these drawers
going through the storage and just doing
a little bit of a declutter on some
things that have been decluttered once
but this next round will be like I think
I'm literally going to call it no mercy
makeup declutter because we're really
going to pair some things down so anyway
thank you guys again and I will see you
soon
