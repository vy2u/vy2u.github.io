this video is all about the brand soap &amp;amp;
Glory and I have mentioned some of their
products just here and there recently
maybe in some best in beauty videos and
I had mentioned maybe doing an overall
video on the things that I've tried and
a lot of you said yes yes do that so
that's what I'm here to do I've got some
individual products body products and
also some makeup things they actually
have a couple of makeup kits out I
thought I would include those in this
video and I really wanted to get this
out before Christmas because I find a
lot of these things to be very giftable
the things that I like so I think I'm
going to start out talking about my
favorite things and we'll wrap it up
with the not so favourites and just a
couple notes real quickly on the price
range of these things I love how a lot
of the body products are sold in smaller
sizes so for like $4 you could try a
travel size of let's say the hand cream
or one of the body washes some of the
big tubs of moisturizer are going to run
around $15 which i think is pretty fair
considering the amount you get i think
that's actually a really good deal and
then the little kits are kind of all
over the place
but i find it to be a pretty good value
you know relatively low cost brand
generous sizes really cute packaging
cute product names and stuff so let's
jump in if we're talking body products
first and I had to narrow it down to
just like two top body products from
this line I still got other things that
I like but my two like top of the
mountain favorites first one you know I
love this the sugar crush body butter
cream the sugar crush scent you're going
to see that showing up if you're
browsing the line on ulties website
let's say I think they sell it in a body
wash a body scrub I have it in the body
butter cream and this is a combination
of both loving the formula of this
lotion and loving the scent it's a sweet
lime fragrance I talked about it as
being like a margarita + vanilla ice
cream it's that kind of a creaminess but
then a little bit of tart bite and I
really love it it's sweet and it's
really refreshing when you put it on and
it's just really unique I don't have
anything else that smells remotely like
this product I love the consistency of
the body butter cream because I feel
like well it's like
it's still surprisingly potent in terms
of how moisturizing it is on the skin
it's a great thing to put on after the
shower I find myself just wanting to o
put this on any time just to get a whiff
of that scent and like I just talked
about in my best in beauty video I have
from Marc it's the crazy for cranberry
body spray so you can be cranberry lime
if you want with that little combo of
this and the spray but I love this the
other top body product for me which is a
little bit more of a recent find and I'm
just loving it so much it's called the
smoothie star breakfast scrub so it's in
the same sized container as the other
thing but this is something you're going
to use in the shower this is such a
potent scrub like it really does
something you kind of scoop into it you
know you can see here scoop out some
product the scent is so yummy it says Oh
sugar and Shea and I didn't notice this
until after I bought it but it says
great maple scent and I can sense a
little bit of that not like knock you
over like you just made some pancakes
and pour it on some maple syrup but
there's just a hint of that it's a
slightly sweet scent but it's a very
warm scent to me it says with kapu COO
kappa kappachu bio scrubs bananas almond
and honey extracts I can sense that
little bit of almond in this it's just a
soft but really yummy scent and then the
texture the consistency of the scrub if
you're like me and you get frustrated by
scrubs many times not being scrubby
enough and you go to apply them and it's
like it's scrubs for two seconds and
then where'd all the scrubby's go you're
not going to have that experience with
this product and I sometimes get those
little like bumpy texture things on my
arms and I have noticed a difference in
those since I've been using this it's
just really great all over the body your
skin is going to feel softer scent is
amazing so those two are my favorite tip
top favorite body products but still
there are some other body products that
I really enjoy if you're looking to try
more I know a lot of people talk about
the righteous butter this is a small
size of it it's going to be the same
consistency as the sugar crush body
butter cream but it has
maybe a slightly softer scent it's going
to be less fruity it makes me think of a
very feminine scent a little more floral
kind of rosy occasionally I'll bounce
between these two just depending on what
kind of scent I'm after because they are
totally different I also have a small
size of this clean on me it's the creamy
moisture shower gel this is probably my
favorite just regular shower gel body
wash type product that they sell one
thing about that smoothie star scrub
it's not going to really lather up for
you it's a straight-up scrub and that's
what it does so if you want more
something that's going to foam up and be
kind of bubbly it really is kind of like
that righteous butter scent put into a
body wash builds up into a really nice
lather and it is something I would
consider buying the full size in and the
last two body items that I thought were
really great are the hand food and
really awesome hand cream especially if
you find a lot of hand creams to be a
bit too thick and take a little too long
to absorb or just feel like too greasy
on your hands I love this because it
softens the hands up really nicely but
doesn't go overboard and I think this is
probably a small size that I got here as
well I was just in a real testing mood
one day when I was ordering on Ulta I
think there's the classic scent that
this comes in is very similar to the
righteous butter you know again that
soft feminine floral but still very
clean not too heavy also I really liked
and I never heard anyone mention this
the heel genius foot cream so good this
I believe is the full-size I don't know
that this comes in a small size but this
contains glycerin macadamia oil menthol
orange and lemon fruit acid smoothers it
does not have a scent that's like any of
the other products I've mentioned it's
actually um can you see there it's blue
and color
it's rather thin for some reason I was
expecting a thicker cream to put on the
feet for some reason when I take a whiff
of this I think of like clean cotton but
I do get a hint of that menthol vibe
going on - not super strong but they say
put this on your feet and then put
cotton socks on top and let it soak in
while you sleep I am one of those people
I cannot sleep in socks I really can
barely sleep with my feet
a sheet I always kick my feet out a lot
of times after a shower I will put this
on my feet and slip on some socks just
like for the evening and it really does
an amazing job just for that span of
time softens up the feet so much you'll
makeup wise I'm really happy to report
that I love both of the makeup kits that
I tried and I believe both are still
available at least at the time I'm
shooting this on ulties website or if
they're anywhere else I'll put the links
below but if you're needing some
last-minute gifts and you want to give
something makeup related these are great
first off this is the crazy sexy Kohl
liner kit shout out to all the
old-school TLC fans out there but isn't
this so cute I love this little canister
and inside there are five eye liners
full size liners this is like a 22
dollar kit so I think it's an amazing
deal these are truly like waterproof
intense liners and I have rave rave
raved about the Tarte skinny smolder
eyes these are just like those I really
feel like they are they go on so
smoothly even over powder eyeshadow it's
one thing it's kind of deceiving when
you're in a store sometimes testing
eyeliners and swatching them out on your
hands you're like okay that went on
really smoothly I think I'm going to try
it not every liner that swatches easily
on your bare skin is going to draw
easily over powder shadow on your eyelid
these I can say for sure they go on
easily the colors are really pretty
you've got your basic brown and black
and then three very wearable jewel tones
the brightest of which is this like kind
of jade green you got a plum and also a
navy I had swatches these on my hand the
other day forgot to really make a point
to scrub them off in the shower and they
completely lasted through the shower so
if you want to take these off some sort
of soapy makeup remover and a little bit
of a gentle scrub is what you're going
to need to do staying power on the inner
rim your waterline is good but not great
when you're applying it on the upper
lash line if you do want to smudge it
out you've got to be kind of quick with
it I mean it definitely can be smudged
but don't like do this eye and this eye
and then think you're going to have
enough time to smudge it smudge it right
after you apply if that's the way you
want to wear but I just thought these
were such an awesome find I couldn't
wait to tell you
about that the other makeup kit that I
got this was a $40 kit and it is the
glamoflage set and this I thought you
know it's kind of big some of the
products lift out but it's kind of a
bulky set so for me to say this is
worthwhile I'm going to really want to
love everything that's inside first off
big mirror there and then a bunch of
full-size products so you're getting
three eyeshadows right over here the
glow all out luminizing face powder
there's a little brush here for face a
double-ended eye brush one of the sexy
mother pucker lip lacquers yes you heard
that right
gotta love the product names then
there's a thick and fast mascara and a
super cat liquid eyeliner pen the shades
are cream soda copper and chalky and I
am wearing those all on my eyes today I
love how copper is just like that really
wearable rose gold that so many of us
love chalky is kind of like a mix
between brown and taupe and it looks
really pretty like smoked out and
smudged on the lower lash liner in the
crease cream-soda is very brightening so
those are one of my favorite parts I
also love this luminizing face powder
which looks kind of peachy just at a
glance and it's not crazy shimmery like
I've got a swatch of it on my finger and
I'm looking at it like where's the glow
it's very subtle this is the kind of
thing you really could wear all over the
face for just a little boost in
luminosity or you can apply it with a
smaller brush just on top of the cheeks
and you get that little more
concentrated glow I am wearing this over
my frat boy blush from the balm and I
think it's just a gorgeous subtle
highlighted look and I do think the fact
that these two things aren't like
insanely shimmery that'll make this kit
work for a lot more people also really
love this lip product I mean this is the
liquid lipstick trend - the matte
basically it's completely opaque full
color this shade is called charm
offensive and I'm wearing it here in
this video there's no shimmer in it it
feels kind of thick and when you're
first putting it on and you're thinking
oh great you know is this going to be
one of those thick sticky glosses but
honestly and let me know if you agree if
you've tried these it gets more
comfortable as it stays on your lips and
I'm not talking about just because it's
where
off it's got great shine really good
staying power for a glossy finish lip
product and I also love the applicator
it's one of those that's more flat as
opposed to a classic doe foot so I feel
like you can really take advantage of
the edges to get right out to the edges
of your lips so this is an awesome of
some element of the kit this super cat
liquid liner pen is nice I don't notice
anything incredibly unique and amazing
about it though probably because it's
not waterproof in terms of staying power
those pencils lasts way longer than this
a little bit of moisture can cause this
to smudge some not that everyone's
needing a waterproof liner every day of
their life this is still totally usable
don't get me wrong and I think a lot of
people would appreciate a pen liner
finally the thick and fast high
definition collagen coat mascara this
actually has a brush that reminds me a
little bit of a mascara that I love very
much from the drugstore it's because
it's got short bristles on one end and
longer bristles on the other don't know
if you'll be able to tell that by the
way I'm holding it here but it's a lot
like the almay one coat nourishing
triple effect in that way I like having
short bristles on one side because I
feel like I can take that side really
really close to the base of the lashes
this is a nice mascara from a thickening
standpoint to lengthen I feel like I
have to do a little more work to get the
length to build up for me not saying
it's impossible but my covergirl super
sizer can give me length like that so I
don't love it as much as that mascara I
still think it's a decent mascara though
and of course one thing I've learned in
what 8 years on YouTube is that we all
have different preferences for mascaras
one other thing I want to mention here
there is a little extra length in all of
these individual product compartments so
I do think this would fit a lot of
standard size mascaras and even if it
was a little bigger than this one or if
something was a little taller than that
liner pen you know you could swap them
out once you run out of these but this
last minute gift idea for just about
anybody who might have an interest in
makeup it's a fun kit well I don't have
nearly as much to talk about in terms of
things I did not like but I've got a few
things so I'm going to mention the scrub
of your life this is a small size this
like a clear scrub with little pink
beads in it and scent wise it's along
the lines of the righteous butter and
the clean on me body wash I like it from
that aspect but if we're talking scrubs
this does not hold a candle to this one
like this stuff will scrub you down this
you know it's one of those things where
I felt like it scrubbed me nicely for
the first few seconds that I was using
it and then I kind of needed to add more
it's truly just nowhere near the level
of scrub Ã¤j--
that you get out of this one the
smoothie star breakfast script the other
little kit that I tried that I was just
not a huge fan of and this might be just
personal preference on scent because the
consistency of the products were ok I
just didn't really love the way they
smelled and it's the stuff that came in
this super woman this is a nice little
container actually I do like that and
you do get one of these shower puffs in
there and the two full-size products in
there are the rich infamous shower and
body wash and also the smoothie star
body milk which is like a lotion
now the body wash says almond oats and
brown sugar scent this I just can't
quite rally around this it's nice and
rich and creamy don't get me wrong I
like the pump and this is going to be
the weirdest scent description I've ever
given but this smells like a buttered
popcorn Jelly Belly jelly bean tastes
like it's kind of sweet
but it's a little salty it's got a
little saltiness to it and I just can't
I don't know I just don't feel clean
with the scent on me you know what I'm
saying I know not every product has to
smell like skittles in my shower but
this is just a bit too savory for my
liking and the smoothie star body milk I
notice a little more sweetness in this
scent it's very similar to the body wash
but it's a little bit more like I don't
know enjoyable on the skin it says
almond oats and sugar scent I really
wish it smelled like the smoothie star
breakfast scrub because you'll recall
this has that little hint of maple this
is like the yummiest scent ever and yet
there's a fine line between these but
this
you think warm baked sweet yummy
delicious and this you know smells okay
but not my favorite thing to be putting
on the body so guys everything I've
talked about this is by no means the
entire soap &amp;amp; Glory line I think they
actually have some facial skin care
items as well that I have not dug into
yet but I feel like I've tried a lot of
the different scents in different
formats and hopefully this helps you out
if you're browsing the site like I said
last-minute gifts those makeup kits were
great a big tub of the body butter cream
would be a nice thing to stick in
someone's stocking or under the tree so
thank you for watching and I'll see you
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
