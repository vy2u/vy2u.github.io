I recently did a tutorial called smoked
peach great summer to fall transition
makeup look and I had a lot of questions
about the hair in that video and it's a
really really easy technique that I use
to get loose waves it's not only about
the curling iron or the curling wand
that I use but also the steps I do
afterward to kind of loosen it up and
get some actual volume out of the look
my hair naturally is very straight kind
of curl resist this look works out
really well for me the styling tool that
I'm using is from Remington it's called
the T Studio Pro is a little bit cone
shaped kind of skinny toward the tip had
this one for at least three years now
I've also gone ahead and bought the
larger size of this as well I think
these are great wands you can get them
at like Walmart Target Ulta here's a
little step-by-step how-to of how I got
the looks to make this whole process a
little bit easier and because I have
layers in my hair I just took like the
top section and clip that up so I'll do
that last and first just focus on the
bottom part so I love using the Paul
Mitchell hot-off-the-press it's called a
thermal protection hairspray my fine
hair really likes to stay straight so
just a little bit of this I don't use
tons but even just you know a light
misting on each side it seems to help
out in the long run and I can get you
know a couple of days worth of wavy
styles out of this even sleeping on my
hair it still ends up keeping that way
factors that will determine how tight
your waves are first off how long you
hold it around the curling iron and also
how big the sections are if you want
looser waves pull bigger sections around
you're why I was saying my hair is
pretty fine so even if I do take a kind
of big chunk of my hair and roll it
around this wand
I still tend to get a really good effect
with the curl this one does come with
gloves by the way but I just kind of
hold my fingers just up but just off the
end and hope for the best I don't
usually burn myself but this is the kind
of wave that you end up like to hold it
so I'm getting a larger part of the curl
up higher on my head and then it gets a
little bit tighter toward the boss so
I'm just going to continue on around
this side so now that I finished that
section I just give it a light mist with
some hairspray this is my Tresemme trade
- and then we just get going on the
other side I'm wrapping the hair away
from my face here again and just holding
the wand in such a way that I'm getting
the larger part of my curl up high and
the tighter part toward the ends
all righty so now I'm just gonna take
down this top part and kind of figure
out where I want my hair to be parted to
begin with another mist of the thermal
protection spray so this layer gets and
this is totally personal preference but
I kind of like the top layers of my hair
to be a little more loosely curled than
the bottom so I don't find that I hold
my hair on the iron quite as long as I
did with the bottom part it's gonna
start over here wrap it around
now this area right in the front kind of
like a side bang type area this is a
spot where I really don't want it to end
up too terribly curly so I really try to
stick to the wider part of the wand only
when I wrap it around and then just
don't leave it on there too long the
curls are done and I'm just gonna give
this a light mist of hairspray but I
mean I think the key to this whole look
is what you do to loosen the curls up so
right now we're looking at waves that
are pretty tight and so I'm gonna go
ahead with my brush and just kind of
brush through that and I find them
separating out a little bit I start to
see a little more volume in the hair as
well it pretty much any two hair
tutorial I do there comes a time when I
have to flip my head over really work my
hands into the roots and something about
this just to really bring some body
alive in my hair so I always need to do
that and now we're left with these
really really volumize duei --vs so I
give that one more little spritz of
hairspray on each side and you can
continue and style this up however you
want if you want it more teased in the
crown you could do that any more I just
kind of like to tease in a couple of
places I section off about an inch or
two right here just parallel to the part
and I tease that just a bit feel like it
helps kind of lock in the style that
I've got going on around my face so I
don't have to worry about that really
changing too much throughout the day and
then same thing on the other side I just
section off some give it a little tease
right there and then just very gently
comb over that smooth it out however you
want if you like more of a bang coming
across you know you can sort of more
easily manipulate it into that shape if
you tease it just a little bit and then
just go ahead and give that a little
extra spray
this is definitely a style that I can
wear for multiple days like I will
continue to have some wave in my hair
with each passing day it kind of loosens
up a little bit from this state but it's
kind of cool it's it's still totally
wearable but it's just a little
different kind of wave and now you know
it's starting off a little more toward
the curly side but something I love to
do if I do want to refresh my hair on
the next day I used this when
replenishing treatment mist this is the
little pumpkin one that I still have
some of I've also got a lavender one I
think that's a really great product you
just kind of mist it on your ends
scrunch it up a little bit and it really
revives the curl the other product that
I talked about before that you can use
in that kind of a way is from dot 2b and
it's like a little curling lotion a type
thing and you just get a little bit of
that in your hands and kind of scrunch
it through your hair and if your ends
were it started looking dry or anything
that really brings the whole look back
to life so I hope this tutorial was
helpful for you on these loose waves or
mermaid waves as some of you referred to
it as it's a really simple hairstyle to
do because it's one of those things
where it you know it doesn't have to be
precise you don't have to get the curl
you know just so everywhere you just
kind of make sure you hit all your hair
with the curling iron and assuming you
do that you're gonna end up with some
sort of wave you can work well thank you
guys so much for watching if there are
any other hair tutorials you're
interested in seeing from me let me know
and I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
