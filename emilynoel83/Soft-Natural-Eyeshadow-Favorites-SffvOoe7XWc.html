natural I kind of want to say barely
there I make up and you might be saying
what's the point every point in doing I
make up the if it's gonna look like so
natural but I really think that while
there's an art to the smoky dramatic or
bright eye makeup I also think there's
definitely an art to using the really
subtle stuff to make it look like you
know just a very very naturally
contoured and defined eye it's something
that will enhance your own eye shape
it's something that looks good with
pretty much any lip color cheek color
thing you want to have going on thought
this would be a great video to do this
time of year if you're wanting to soften
things up a little bit you know lighten
up the wall so it's great any time of
year for teens or people who just you
know want the softer I make as you watch
this video think about like what of
these you know quads trios duo's
whatever you would like to see a
tutorial on because I want to do you
know maybe one or two so definitely
share in the comments section if one of
these is like ooh I want to see how to
use that one let me know I'm gonna start
out talking about the one I'm wearing
today it's a trio from it cosmetics and
it's called pretty in nudes and I
remember when I first got this one I was
like yeah right you know there's not
enough contrast between these shades I
thought to make much of a difference on
the eyes but really there is you know I
went with like this light pink kind of
around the inner corner use this in the
crease blend it out with this kind of
sort of like a sandy colored shade so I
used that on my eyes today and I just
find that you know it's very fresh it's
very simple but yet there truly is kind
of a technique to getting the most out
of you know this tree one that I was
wearing on beauty broadcast live the
other day is called urban basics and
it's from covergirl this quad has been
around for a long time and I have passed
this up a lot as I've walked past it you
know in the local Walmart or wherever
but this is actually really great for
achieving the very look I'm talking
about you know kind of a light lid and
naturally defined crease you've got in
here kind of like
dusty'll I live a light brown taupe
color a pink and an ivory squad
surprised me at first like when i
swatched it I wasn't even that impressed
by the swatches but then I put it on my
eye and I thought this is that exact
kind of soft look that I'm liking these
days so and that's urban basics Minerals
has a nice little duo and one of my
twitter buddies recommended that I tried
this and I again like I swear I see
these at first and I think really you
know but they actually end up working
for me this is a duo in the top shelf
and the shades are this is cognac and
this is mixologist and so I think I you
know saw this in the store thought is
there enough contrast between those two
to give the eye the depth that it needs
and also you know the brightness at the
same time so these shades are great I
also love the texture the bareMinerals
ready shadows just in general would
definitely be a fun easy tutorial but
these feel so soft and luxurious on the
I have really liked them another palette
for just classic natural eyeshadow I
think everyone should own this I mean it
is $2.99 it's a trio from wet and wild
called walking on eggshells I used this
in a bridal look and I demonstrated one
half of the face high-end and one half
drugstore and I believe I used Mac's
shades on the high-end side and then
these were my drugstore dupes of several
Mac's you know this brown can look you
know somewhat deep but you can
definitely use this in a way that is
very natural and very prim nuts about
this soft kind of pink color down here I
you know how I feel about these wet
while eyeshadows in the spectrum of like
that whole color icon line I feel like
this one is definitely the most natural
the most if you're going for like a nude
eye look this is it Physicians Formula
this is a nice matte shadow quad and it
definitely could take you to a more
dramatic place if you use all the shades
or if you use them in a more densely
applied way but this is the matte
eyeshadow quad in Canyon classics and
here I mean this is an example where a
lot of these you know maybe
there were some kind of pinky tones and
some of these different palates I showed
you know this one we're definitely
talking about like the beige sort of
color
I've talked about so far as to
in-your-face shimmery shiny one from
bareMinerals has a little bit but I mean
I did that on purpose because I think
that that adds to the natural look on
the eyes things that aren't too shiny
these are obviously matte think about
the darker shade it's like an eye line
see to blend very easy to work with I
only recently tried the Physicians
Formula quads and you can find them I
always see them at Ulta I don't often
see them in other drugstores but
definitely worth checking out if you
like matte and finally and this is from
NYX I got it when NYX the last time NYX
was on HauteLook and it's the matte
smokey look one night in Morocco palette
and you're thinking smokey I thought you
were going there but I mean these can
give you you can skip the smokey shades
and get a really natural look with these
I did a whole blogs watching these
comparing this to the Urban Decay Naked
basics palette these are all matte
shades some have a little bit of a
satiny finish which I pointed out in the
blog also some bonus lip products which
doesn't hurt and an eyeshadow base you
think about you know using the lightest
shades in this kit or you know just
barely tying in one of these deeper
shades maybe as your liner the look can
be so pretty these I love this texture
been craving Urban Decay Naked basics or
you even like that I feel like this
palette even gives you a few more
options in terms of the Grays than that
palette again let me know which of these
eyeshadows you'd like to see kind of
demonstrated in a tutorial a lot of us
are probably thinking you know well
smokey eyes are hard or maybe I need the
tips on that more and yeah I think suing
a smoky eye is harder than using any of
these but I do think there are some
tricks to making the most out of these
kinds of little quads and trios of light
shade I hope you like the suggestions
and thank you for watching hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
