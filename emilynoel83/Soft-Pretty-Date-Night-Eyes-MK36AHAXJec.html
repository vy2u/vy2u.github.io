to be showing you how to achieve the
perfect date night eyes okay something
that's a little more glamorous than your
everyday look but something that I think
is very wearable it's like it's it's
glamorous without being too in-your-face
and I do have some false eyelashes on
with this look that's totally optional
but it's definitely really warmed up
with some interesting shades that I some
new shades that i got from mac like um
blackberry and another gorgeous shade
that were going to use to contour with
called beauty marked and so yeah i'm
going to take you step-by-step through
how i do this at the end i'll let you
know what's on the rest of my face and
my lips and my outfit too so i hope you
enjoy this video guys and keep on
watching step 1 i'm taking my Coastal
Scents shadow works eyeshadow primer and
this has a little bit of shimmer to it
it's kind of like a champagne color so
you'll see as I spread that on that it's
going to give the lid some shimmer to
begin with so I'm going to take my NYX
shadow single in aloha and you can see
that's got some pretty shimmer to it
it's actually a really really high
shimmer shadow and so with my ELF I
shadow brush I'm just padding that in on
the inner part of my lid here and then
if you want you can take that same brush
and just kind of Pat that up right under
the highest part of your arch to really
highlight your brow as well next I'm
going to take a matte shade from Mac and
it is called a blackberry here so you
can see I mean it's just it there is no
Sparkle or shimmer to this color but it
does give you that kind of very purpley
look so I'm going to look down into my
mirror and just Pat this on the outer
half of my lid right up to the crease so
once you pack that on there I would
switch brushes and use something like a
crease brush you know a mid-sized crease
brush with that same shade and just kind
of carry that in all through the entire
crease just going to deepen that whole
area really nicely
and really warm it up next we're going
to do liner we actually have one more
shade to work with with the shadow but I
think it helps using the liner is your
guide so I'm going to use a pen style I
eyeliner and it is the Physicians
Formula felt tip I definer and sin ultra
black so this is a really long wearing
black liner and I'm going to go from
inner corner to outer corner here so
just start drawing it on really close to
your lash line and then when you get to
the edge we're going to be weighing that
out a little once you get to the end as
you can see here I kind of instead of
going down where it with the natural
shape of my lash line I actually went
straight out and then I'm going to go to
the very corner here and just connect up
with that and then fill that in we're
going to go ahead and do the lower lash
line i'm taking my maybelline define a
line pencil blending it right up to um
what we've got going on there with the
liquid liner so kind of making that a
seamless connection there and then just
go all the way I'm trick a Mac shade
called beauty mark this is one of the
ones i've recently picked up really
really pretty kind of plummy shade with
some burgundy sparkle in it and so i'm
going to take an angled liner brush and
just top off what you've done there with
the black liner this is just going to
help it last a little longer it's also
going to give it sort of a plum colored
tint so just go over what you've done
there all the way to the X I'm going to
take my fine crease brush this is from
my essence of beauty brush duo you can
find those kinds of brushes at CVS so
I'm just going to get some of the beauty
mark shade on that brush and this is
going to become sort of our outer v
shade so this is a technique that I kind
of outlined not too long ago but I kind
of wanted to refresh it for you because
I have had some questions again so we're
going to start at the very tip here with
our dark colored shadow and work that
into the crease and then we're going to
once we get
blend it into the crease we're going to
go up just a little bit with it kind of
working in circular motions it's kind of
like you want to get the product in
there and then you want to blend it out
so that's what I'm doing here getting it
on and then giving it a little blend
just like so and then what you'll want
to do with a color like this is just
blend it out take a fluffier brush let's
see i'll take my sephora rounded crease
brush just go over the edge of that
there and then we're going to do
something that's just going to make it
look even more blended and this is a
great technique take a medium tone shade
kind of like a blackberry like we just
used on the outer part there and take
any kind of brush it doesn't really
matter but get some of the product on
there and then we're going to kind of
basically sandwich beauty marked which
became our darkest crease shade and
blackberry which was down the crease so
now we're putting blackberry up here
it's a little bit softer and it's going
to make the transition up to that
lightest shade we used as a highlight
even easier it's going to make it a
little more flawless I guess you'd say
so there we go ahead and curl my lashes
and apply a couple of coats of my
voluminous carbon black mascara and then
I'll join you with the finished look and
let you know what's on my lips and cheek
all right guys here is the finished look
as you can see it's just a really
feminine girly look all around my outfit
my shirt actually I got this from wet
seal it's just one of those like longer
shirts that you can wear with like
skinny jeans or whatever that's what I'm
wearing mine with and it just kind of
comes down a little bit longer but it's
got this really cute like roughly flower
print here on the side my necklace is
this actually it looks like a little
feather I got this from forever 21 just
it was very inexpensive where you some
gold stud earrings and this cocktail
ring that also came from forever 21 and
it had
I don't know if you can really see it
has like peach and purple colored
flowers in there so it kind of sets off
this look nicely which is just an eye
look that brings out some plum colors
and just some warmer shades other than
your typical smokey eye I did go ahead
and throw on some false eyelashes here
so I'll start telling me what else is on
my face on those lashes are the mix
eyelashes in nirvana and those are the
ones that kind of crisscross if you
watched my anniversary haul video I
showed them up close but I went ahead
and put those on here oh I'm kind of
like leaning into the light there but
yeah there's they just really you know
lengthen and volume eyes instantly but
you guys saw my eye look step by step on
my face I went all over with rimmel
natural bronzer and my foundation by the
way is Neutrogena Healthy Skin so i used
the Rimmel natural bronzer just kind of
a light bronze are all over you use my
too faced chocolate soleil bronzer which
is a little dark or use that as a
contour it's sort of a base for my blush
i use my NYC flushable cream stick and
wild berry so kind of a bright cream
blush that I really blended into the
apples of my cheeks and then went over
that with mac blush in uh oops I'm
holding up the wrong one I pulled up the
wrong one that's my cream blush i used
my mac blush in dolly mix which is a
bright pink so lots of pinks all around
some Purple's on the eyes and then the
lips I used a combination of NYX lip
liners I used this one in mahogany which
is sort of a little bit deeper shade and
I went and I use that for like the main
outline and I kind of filled in my upper
lip with that and I filled in like right
in here and right in there and then so
I've got my the center of my lower lip
kind of bare and i fill that in with
Rose which is a lighter pink so your
lips are always going to look fuller any
time you use that sort of strategy with
the lightest shade right there in the
center so I just kind of use that
instead of a lipstick I used a
combination of lip liners and
then I put something on top that is so
awesome these are the most flavorful and
best smelling lip glosses they're from
Bath and Body Works there the liplicious
cupcakes and this one that I have is in
strawberry and it is so good like it
smells and tastes just like some kind of
like strawberry ice cream or frosting or
something but it kind of is a swirl of
bright and light pink in there so I just
kind of put that over the top and yeah
that's basically it guys I hope you
enjoyed this look thanks so much for
watching my videos and leaving so much
kind feedback I really appreciate it and
have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
