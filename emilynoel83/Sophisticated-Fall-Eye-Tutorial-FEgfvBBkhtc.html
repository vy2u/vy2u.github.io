with a great look for fall we are
heading out of summer into the fall
season and a lot of people feel like
maybe they want to switch up their
makeup or give their makeup just a
little bit of a change you know as we
change seasons here it's not absolutely
necessary i mean if you have a classic
way that you think you look good you go
with it but if you're curious to know
you know sort of what some of the
different fall colors might look like on
you I have a quad that I'm going to be
using today from Avon i'm actually using
all avon products today on my eyes and
part of things was due to the fact that
i don't know how many emails and
messages i've got from some of you
faithful avon users that have said
you've got to try avon you don't use any
avon why not and really there's no
particular reason why I haven't I guess
it's just maybe the accessibility or you
know I just haven't really you know
necessarily sought it out um but I had
used Avon you know a while ago quite a
while ago so I thought hey now's the
time i'm going to try to you know maybe
rediscover some products here so i'm
using the this is a new color new quad
for fall it's the true color eyeshadow
quad and nocturnal and here you're
getting a couple of nice matte shades
matte pink matt brown and then sort of a
couple of satiny really pretty plum and
forest green shades and i'm just going
to show you how to use all of those
different colors in this look to get a
really blended and kind of natural look
but get something that could be more
traumatic for nighttime as well so if
you want to see how I put it together
keep on watch that one I'm going to
apply some of my Too Faced shadow
insurance and just get that all over my
lid and also up a little bit into the
crease and kind of drag what's left
right up towards the brow bone there
alrighty feel like I'm going to sneeze
hopefully I don't alright next I'm going
to grab my avon true color eyeshadow
quad and this is in nocturnal and so I'm
going to go ahead and start by taking
let me see here if I can find the brush
I wanted to you
okay i'm using my Sigma SS 239 brush
it's just like a flat eyeshadow brush
and I'm going to start by applying this
light matte pink shade here it's very
very light pink and just pack that on
the brush and I'm going to get that all
over my eyelid here just Pat it right on
ok just like that and then we've got
another mat really natural shade and
it's this light brown that's right next
door here so I'm going to take my Sigma
it's the SS 224 and I'm going to just
pet that into that shade that light
light brown and I'm going to use this
sort of as a base shade in our crease
it's really really light and natural if
you wanted to get like a supernatural I
look that's really easy and just doesn't
have a lot of shimmer in it you could
take these two shades and as you can see
just build up a little really natural
color there in the crease but anyway go
on and just kind of build that up here I
think it offers a nice kind of base
shade there for the more colorful shades
we're going to put on and then while I'm
at it with these lighter colors i'm
going to go ahead and take the light
pink again get some of that on that same
brush i just used and apply that up to
the brow there just like that ok next
we're going to start messing with some
of these fun colors down below we've got
a sort of satiny forest green and a plum
shade we're going to work on both into
this look but definitely if you wanted
to simplify things you could just take
one or the other if you just wanted
plumber just want a green that's
absolutely fine I just kind of wanted to
work on both into this tutorial I'm
going to take Milo Cornell one quarter
brush you could also use a like an
applicator a sponge tip applicator
something small that can give you a lot
of control and I'm going to Pat that
into the forest green and the area we're
going to be putting that on is sort of
this outer half of the eyelid here so
it's it functions to kind of deep in it
deepen it up none of these shades we're
really going to come off super loud but
it's going to be just kind of natural
subtle and very fall-like look here so
I'm going to get some of that on my one
quarter brush and I'm just gonna start
packing that on right here on the outer
half
and the fact that we've put that light
pink underneath its kind of functioning
to keep these colors really soft and
give us a really good blend on them but
you just pack it on as much as you want
I'm something that I've noticed about
these avon shades is that they are
buildable and if you want more color I
mean you just start slow and keep going
with them it's a great kind of beginner
product because you know if you're not
quite sure okay do I want to go that far
with it you can definitely control it so
I've gone back like probably three times
now with that green and I'm just packing
that on keeping it right there watch out
for the fallout I'll get that later
packing it on the outer half next comes
the plum shade and something I love to
do with plum or burgundy tones is use
them as a crease color that kind of
blends up onto just slightly onto that
brow bone area they play so much off of
the natural tones in your skin that I
think they look really natural give a
really warm look to what's going on here
you know we've got that green kind of
concentrated around the lower part here
but we're going to build up with a
little bit of warmth on the outside so
I'm going to take my essence of beauty
fine crease brush those are available at
CVS this is just I've yet to find
anything that really matches this brush
in terms of when I want to really get
color in the crease unless you know you
want to use a flat shader brush those
are nice too that could work here as
well and I'm taking it all the way in to
the inner part of the crease bringing it
back out again buildable color you don't
feel like you have to go go too far
overboard with this just get it how you
want
and then we're slowly going to start to
develop a little more of an outer V
right out here kind of working off the
corner of the green and just kind of
swirling up and out just kind of
creating that v-shape right there and
then swirling within that very soft very
natural remember we're going on top of
the that light brown shade which makes
these shades all appear to blend a
little more flawlessly okay one other
thing I do want to do is make sure just
going to take a flat brush here real
quick and make sure I've got that green
blended I'm going to grab a little more
that green this is my Sigma gosh I don't
have all the numbers memorized it's the
two SS 252 grabbing a little more that
green because I want to make sure it's
really blended up to that crease
sometimes it really helps to look down
like this and you can see exactly how
how you're doing there in terms of your
blending and then take that small brush
again just make sure that the two colors
are kind of fused there and it is just
kind of a dark look it appears a little
bit smoky you can smoke it up more than
I'm doing it now or you could go lighter
or you could like I said just use one or
the other next thing I want to do is do
a little detailing here i'm using my c
148 mini contour brush this is available
on coastal scents for like a dollar
ninety-nine and this brush is so tiny i
get so many I get more questions about
this brush than anything I've been using
it a lot lately but I'm going to get
some of that light pink right there and
we're gonna just build some of that up
kind of make sure we're still nice and
light right here in the corner this is
also a step you can do after your liner
I sometimes touch it up after my liner
but I'm just going to do it now as well
alright and there you go now we're going
to move on to the liner now the liner
i'm using is another avon product that
i'm trying it is the jillian Dempsey for
Avon professional Kohl eyeliner in
charcoal so this is going to be like not
necessarily black but you can see it's a
very
deep gray color and what I'm going to do
is line from the inner to outer corner
here and then I'm going to connect it a
little bit here on the end and go on to
the inside so I'm just getting that line
drawn it doesn't have to be super duper
neat but we just want to kind of create
the illusion of more thickness right
here around our lash line anytime you
get that color that eyeliner color
riding around your eyelash line it it
gives the appearance that there's maybe
more lashes there there's more growth
coming out of right that right in that
area so just continue on into the inner
corner now I'm continuing it right here
along my lower lash line you can see
I've gone all the way in there this you
know tones of gray naturally give off a
little more of a smoky look a little
less defined look than black we'll just
because it's not going to give the same
amount of contrast to your skin so I'm
just continuing that right in here to
the corner and there we go and this
liner comes with a built-in smudge tip
on the other end so if you have any
areas that you feel like maybe you
didn't quite connect or you just want to
kind of fudge them out a little bit you
can take this tip and just go right over
it next thing I'm going to do with this
look is curl my lashes and I'm going to
be using the Avon super Croatia's
mascara and before i use it i just want
to show it to you real quick and the
color is black and this brush reminds me
so much of covergirl LashBlast if you
have that you're looking at this you're
probably thinking oh yeah but it's a
curved brush which some people probably
think some of the benefits of that are
that maybe it reaches more lashes or it
just feels a little bit more natural
when you put it on to get every lash and
I like this formula a lot better than
lash blast lash blast is not bad don't
get me wrong I don't think it's a bad
mascara but this formula is a little bit
drier and therefore I feel like it is
capable of holding that curl with your
lashes
curl let you know you can you can kind
of sense that it might be like sticking
there you know what I mean and it's kind
of hard to describe but it's more
buildable that way sometimes when you're
using mascaras that are very wet they're
not quite as buildable but this has that
same separation quality that many people
like in lash blast but it does it is
just a little bit drier and I think it
makes it a little bit better to work
with I think you can work up a little
more volume so I'm going to apply a
couple of coats of that to the top lash
line and a coat to the bottom and then
I'll join you with the finished look
all right guys here is the finished look
I really think this lipstick totally
sets it off this lipstick is from flirt
it's in elixir that's a brand that's
available at Kohl's and it looks kind of
you know deep and dark there in the tube
and it might be coming off a little
brighter like on camera right now than
it does in person but it's just like a
nice kind of deep sort of somewhat warm
red shade and so I really like that I
think it works with this look this look
is this is a versatile quad but be aware
that you're not going to get necessarily
you know a ton of color out of each and
everything like it's not going to be
like one of those super duper you know
bold in-your-face oh my gosh she's got a
ton of green eyeshadow on and that's not
always what people are looking for but
this lets you play with some different
kinds of colors and I do feel like it um
this is a look that I would totally wear
to work this is appropriate for more
dressy occasions to I feel like it's
nice to be able to do things with shades
that aren't just your typical Browns and
this is a fun way to you know kind of
integrate some new color into your
collection now this mascara is wonderful
it's the against a super Croatia's
mascara I was pleased with how i could
just instantly apply another coat I
could tell a difference after two coats
you know and so it's just super easy to
use I do like it better than lash blast
so and the liner is a little bit dry
this liner the Jillian Dempsey
professional Kohl eyeliner I mean you do
need to kind of warm it up either by
just kind of like I did coloring a
little bit on my finger or some people
like to even use a little lighter to
kind of get their pencil liners ready to
be a you know applied on the eye but
once you get it going i do think it's
it's it's a nice son you know basic
eyeliner it's not too different though
from any other eyeliner product that
i've seen just in the drugstore so
anyway guys thank you so much for tuning
in for this video i hope you like this
fun look for fall and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
