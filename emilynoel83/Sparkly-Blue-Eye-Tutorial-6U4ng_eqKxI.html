and the look I'm going to show you today
is a sparkly blue I look so um look at
what looks like on my right eye and I
don't sure how much the sparkle showing
up but it is actually a you know like
have a sparkly blue on the lid and then
it kind of goes out to sort of a darker
blue at the corner lined in blue and
black so as for the rest of my face look
I've used yeah if you see the video on
foundation how to apply with a stippling
brush it's the same it's the same day so
I just applied that and some wet and
wild bronzer and my elf mineral blush
and let me see what it is in Rose I
really like that too so and my lip look
is I put on elf candy shop lip gloss and
candy fix and then I lined all over with
my beautique with color liner in natural
is just a really nude liner from sally
beauty supply and I topped it off with
my victoria secret very sexy lip gloss
in your name so let's get started on my
left on my right eye here I'm sorry they
have been calling them the reverse my
left eye is the one with all the all the
makeup on it right now but I've applied
a primer and the next thing I need to do
is put down kind of a shimmery base
that's a very light shimmery base and
i'm using Jane color sticks in dream
world i'm just going to apply this all
over my lid
and basically right up into the crease
as well something I don't normally do
but it's sort of needed for the effect
of this look so just get it all over I
like these fixes they're just you know
you don't need to get out a brush see
once you've applied that all over I'm
going to be using my um my NYX trio and
frosted lilac Pacific and kiwi and
Pacific is the blue shade there in the
middle you can see it's kind of intense
so I'm going to take my ELF eyeshadow
brush and use that just all over the lid
and just into the crease and you're
going to see that this color what I like
about this is how um that's sparkly
layer that we just applied kind of as a
base sort of shines through with this
and so just get it up all the way up
into the crease this is kind of more of
a bold look that I usually do and if you
and I tried to keep it keep my coverage
that kind of pack this on keep it a
little lighter as you go into your inner
corner and a little more so as you go
towards the outside okay so simple is
that you got that all over now and then
i'm going to go to my hip duo in showy
and i'm going to use the man
kind of deep blue I wouldn't quite call
it Navy but it is a very deep blue and
I'm going to use that little applicator
actually that they provide you with and
I'm just going to just for one little
part because they want it to be a little
deeper right on the corner the outer
corner of my lid so I'm going to use
that just to deepen that up a little bit
okay and then next I'm just going to
take my crease brush and dip into that
same very same dark blue shade and just
kind of go from the crease in and out
we're just trying to deepen up the
crease a little bit from what was so
shimmery to now a little bit darker and
as you can see I'm kind of concentrating
really on the outer half kind of trying
to make a little bit of a smoky outer V
you can see what we have going on on the
other I here so just work it up to that
intensity of course you can make this as
light or as dark as you want you don't
have to use these exact colors but might
give you some ideas if you're out
looking around
there we go so we basically got the
smoky side of this done now I'm going to
go back to the NYX group I'm going to
use the lilac color there I'm just going
to go ahead and use that very same brush
the crease brush I had and what i'm
doing here is basically applying it
right over over the top of the outer
border of that darker shade i just used
and just sort of changes the tone of the
color and I just like what it does to it
so going over that and then I'm seeing
as i look at it that i do want the
darker color to be just a little deeper
in the crease so i'm going to take a
smaller brush smaller crease brush and
go right just go right back over it you
can see it's buildable that these colors
can you know build up as much as you
want them to
trying not to intrude on the part that
is on my lid that is still very shimmery
I want to maintain that so next I think
we're good with the as far as the blue
color goes there you get a look at that
and then since my whole the rest of my
look is kind of blond Z and I think
that's what keeps us looking still kind
of natural in a way I'm going to use
this Center color in my covergirl trio
in golden sunset the middle color is
called golden sunrise as you can see I
used that a lot as my highlight shade
because I think having a bomb or bronzey
colored highlight tides in the eye in
with the face because that's the color
I've got going on all over my face ok so
there we are we're pretty good shadow
wise now so we want to go on with our
liner and i'm going to use prestige
liquid liner in the color is as your and
it is a deep blue and this i'm going to
use on my top lash line so i'm just
going to start on the inside
and just continue my line to about
halfway and then this is not quite light
color stay you'll find because you need
to go get back in because the color will
fin a little bit as you apply it so go
back make sure that your line is the
color is not thinning out on your the
line you're drawing on there and then
I'm going to wing it up at the end quite
a bit
ok
and there we are
you can see that this this color really
meshes in well with the darker shade of
eyeshadow you use so that works well
give it a given another once over
because basically what I'm doing when I
wing it out like that that bar I am
altering the shape of my eye and
sometimes you want to go back and to
maximize that put a little more dark
shadow from the tip of the wing up about
halfway halfway over and then you're
really going to maximize that effect of
having a bigger I they're all right next
how much time do I have okay trying to
keep it under 10 i'm using my maybelline
expertise liner in velvet black super
cheap and i'm just gonna use this all
across my lower lash line it's like so
this is a these types of liners the
Maybelline expert eyes are also their
eyeliner / brow liners so that's why I
think they're a little bit drier but at
the same time they don't run as much so
another step here y'all get out the
L'Oreal hip duo again get out your
psyche a fine I'm eyeliner brush go into
the dark blue go over your line this is
just going to tie it in with the whole
look give it that same blue appearance
though not heavy blue and then curl my
lashes Joe curl them for longer than
this in reality and then I'm going to
apply coat of my Too Faced lash
injection sample that I'm trying out and
i would probably apply two or three
coats as this and there it is there's
the look thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
