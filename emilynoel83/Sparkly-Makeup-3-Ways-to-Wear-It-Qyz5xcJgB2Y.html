great day I'm really pumped for this
video because it's all about Sparkle and
three ways to add a little bit of
glitter to your look but not make it
look like you've gone out of control
with the product and in theory glitter
always sounds like a fun pretty thing to
add to your look but nobody wants to
show up at a party and have people look
at you and think oh she really you know
what nuts with the glitter before she
got here so I've got three kind of
controlled easy long-wearing ways to add
glitter to your line these all pertain
to the eyes I think that's the most
universally flattering way to wear it
first way I like to incorporate glitter
on the eyes and this is something I've
been experimenting with lately really
liking the effect is on your lower line
first thing you do is just choose a
liner and you could go with something
colorful go with something neutral
whatever the case may be with what I
pick I do like it to be a liner that
sets to a very long wearing finish what
you want to do is apply that to the
lower lash line and before that has a
chance to really set and lock in place
go ahead and take an angle brush into a
glittery shadow and just dab that right
on top and I find that it really clings
to that liner while it's still in that
creamy state and then you've got a long
wearing look with a little added sparkle
product I'm actually using as my little
glitter top coat is from Urban Decay and
it's a single shadow and space cowboy
love using this to top off your look
because it really is just sheer glitter
doesn't have a lot of like powdery
eyeshadow color to it so that's why it
comes off so nicely if you're putting it
on top of something because the color of
whatever you're topping off really still
comes through so while you could use
this as lower liner you could also like
dab this on your lid it looks really
pretty that way over any eyeshadow trick
to add a little long wearing glittery
accent to your look is some glitter
eyeliner and this is so easy you can
just apply it across your upper lash
line maybe even wing it out a little you
want to go with kind of a thick line
because I want to come in with some
black liner as well because while
glitter is beautiful and sparkly it
really doesn't work to define your eyes
very much apply
whatever glitter you want it could be a
light glitter something really colorful
neutral whatever and then go in with
your black liquid liner really really
close to your lash line so it allows the
glitter to still stand out but you've
got the black to actually define your
eyes video from I think a year or so ago
where I used a green glitter from Sally
Beauty Supply to do this NYX sell some
glitter liners as well the one I'm using
in this video is the Stila glitter liner
in kitten and this can be a fun accent
to a very simple eye shadow look if you
want I didn't really intend for this
trick to also be demo'd on my eye at the
same time that I did the lower liner
don't feel like you have to do those at
the same time you really want to keep it
subtle it might be best to just accent
one part of your eye at a time but if
you want to do them together go full and
finally what I've got on my eyes right
now is a great great product from lorac
it's called 3d liquid lustre and I love
using this as a way to top off your
eyeshadow it's a total liquidy product
so I just take a little bit out with
this dropper put it on my hand and then
you could use a brush for this if you
want but I feel like I've got the most
control with my thing and then just dab
it right on my lid on top of any shadow
look you want this could be gorgeous on
top of a deep dark smoky eye to add just
a little bit of shine look I've got some
pinks and purples going on you think it
looks really pretty when you've got it
confined to one space like here I've got
it on my lids I didn't go ahead and
bring it up through my crease and all
the way up into this area that's what it
kind of starts looking a little out of
control so that's sort of an overall tip
with all this glitter stuff you know
give it a place where it's gonna be and
stay within that zone and then you don't
look like you've gone crazy with glitter
but you've applied it in a very
strategic way this is fun because it's
on my lids you might not even notice it
that much with my eyes open but then I
close them and it's like ooh fun and
shiny to really make it look finished
top it off with some liquid liner maybe
even pop on some false lashes and you've
got a really pretty finished glam
holiday look and this is also the
quickest easiest way to go from day to
night if you don't even want to totally
redo your eye look but you want to glam
it up a little bit just get a little
Buddhist on your finger you might even
already have your man
Scarah and your liner on but just dab it
right there on the lid and it looks so
pretty and it couldn't be quit just
applying a glittery product to your face
is half the battle you've also got to
figure out how to keep it where you've
put so with all of these tips there's
been a little bit of a long wearing
strategy in my shadow you know you're
placing it on top of a creamy liner
that's gonna help it stay in place
glitter liner that's gonna last a long
time and then these luster drops are
very long wearing - so I hope this video
gives you a few tips for adding a little
glitter to your holiday looks thank you
so much for watching and have a great
day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
