get some primer on my eyelid i'm using
my smashbox photo finish primer it just
really neutralizes the shade of your
lids and really helps everything last a
long time but you can use whatever
primer you prefer just patting that all
over my lid and then i want a little
extra kind of sticking power so i'm
going to put down a cream base which is
the mac rubenesque Paint Pot it has this
pretty kind of golden a peachy tone to
it so I'm going to get a little bit of
that on my finger also and you can
really see that shine come through there
just going to Pat that all over my lid
next step I want to focus on getting
this pretty light glittery base kind of
surrounding the inner part of my eyes so
I am using my NYX glitter cream palette
in sweet chocolate browns and I'm going
to be using this side right here this is
kind of a fine glitter and what you kind
of need to do I feel like it's sort of
dig down into the product just a little
bit and I'm just using the sponge tip
applicator because there's kind of a
creamy gel base to this and so you want
to make sure you have some of that when
you put it on so just using the
applicator because we can really be
precise with the application I'm just
going to start basically applying that
like you would a regular shadow is just
this is a little bit creamier and it's
got glitter to it so just kind of start
getting that they're all over the inner
part of the eye so you can see I've
basically packed that all over the inner
part of the lid it almost looks like
just a really shimmery shadow because
this glitter is so fine but then I'm
going to get some more on my little
applicator and I'm going to be taking
that and kind of surrounding the tear
duct with it it's important you don't
want to get this in your chair duct you
don't want to have kind of glitter
collecting right there but I'm just
surrounding that part of the eye and
this is just going to give us that
gorgeous kind of highlighted look to the
area with the glitter so very pretty
next I'm kind of flipping my applicator
around to the other side and i'm using
the darker
brown shade that is in this palette
right next to the shade we were just
using and this is again kind of a finer
glitter product here so I'm going to get
some of that on my sponge tip and that's
going to be what I put on the outer part
of my eyelid so I'm just going to do
kind of a patting motion as I apply that
there with the applicator and it's going
to come off kind of looking like a brown
shadow from a distance but then you get
up close and you realize oh wow there's
some real Sparkle to that all right so
we've patted that all over our lid and
then for a little extra fun there is a
more of a more of a course glitter right
here I really think it's a pretty color
it's kind of a coppery brown just looks
very beautiful when it catches the light
and if you want if you want to take this
just a little step further get a little
bit of that on your applicator and
carefully kind of just path that on top
of what you've just done and you'll get
some sort of even more Sparkle going on
here I just kind of I did a little bit
on this side and you can see it's
somewhat subtle I mean you can see those
parts that are really catching the light
there so I mean just do as much or as
little as you want but I'm kind of just
keeping it on the lid because we have
another step here for taking the shadow
to the crease and getting this
combination glitter and shadow look like
we have here so that's really not very
hard at all um you just need to kind of
find a brown shadow that you like i'm
using this really pretty shade it's also
from NYX and it's called volcano and
it's kind of a medium to dark toned
shimmery brown and it just works
perfectly with the shades of the glare
we've been using i'm using my Sigma SS
226 because I do want kind of a precise
application because I don't want to
overlap my glitter too much so I want
the shadow where I want it basically so
this kind of is a crease brush that sort
of comes to a point there as you can see
so I'm getting some of the volcano
shadow on there and basically I'm just
applying this to the crease and we're
just pulling it outward just a little
bit sort of creating some nice
warmth with this shade and kind of like
making an outer V with this so you can
kind of come up from the outer corner
come over from the top and you're kind
of getting that nice warm shadow effect
along with this pretty glitter I want to
use just the tip of this brush just the
tip down in the shadow and then that can
be used to take it right under the eye
and we get a very pretty smoky look here
you want to think about a highlight as
well I'm using Aloha for mix just going
to stay with the Knicks theme this is
just a light shimmery shade gorgeous
shade to use as your highlight and i'm
using my SS 224 with that this has
shimmer it doesn't have real glitter to
it and you can kind of use this nice
large sized brush to buff over the edge
of your other shadow and get a nice
blend there for our liner I think a
liquid liner is really the easiest way
to go at this point because we've got
sort of a glitter cream thing going on
in our eyes so I don't think we want to
put do anything that's going to pull too
much on that so NYC liquid eyeliner
super cheap very very easy and gives you
all the black intensity you could want
so it comes with a little brush tip to
the applicator so I'm just going to look
down into my mirror and start the very
inner corner with this and i am going to
wing this out just a little bit so just
continue to pull it out just a little
bit beyond your natural lash line kind
of going straight out here and then up
from the very corner of your eye to meet
it and fill it in and i'm going to just
grab a black eyeliner and i'm using my
wet and wild color icon eyeliner here in
black and i'm just going to sort of make
a little bit of a connection here at the
outer corner and take this just slightly
under my lower lash I'm only going under
part of the way alright i'm using that
pointed crease brush to kind of buff
over that liner and i also applied it to
the waterline</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
