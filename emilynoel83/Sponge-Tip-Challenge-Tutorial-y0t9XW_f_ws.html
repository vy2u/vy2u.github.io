look I'm gonna be showing you today it's
kind of a neutral look with a pop of a
little bit of a turquoise color there in
the corners and the neatest thing about
this look is I didn't use a single brush
to do it I actually used completely
sponge tip applicator Xand I got this
great idea from one of my subscribers
they said you know a lot of people don't
have you know wide selection of brushes
or there may be just now building their
makeup collection so maybe try doing
something fun just using sponge tip
applicator Xand so I kind of took that
idea and went one step further with it
and I would like to challenge you guys
to put together a video response showing
a look you do only using sponge tip
applicator x' of course I'm not counting
like your mascara one but like you know
whatever you do on your I don't use any
brushes that can be you know easy
difficult complicated whatever whatever
you want to do or if you don't have
YouTube and you don't post videos on
here if you just want to email me a
picture of your finished look I will
start up a blog post on this and I can
kind of post people's different finished
looks so I think that might be fun so
you can email Beauty broadcast at
hotmail.com I also have a link in my
little box that's under my main video
there that plays on my channel so just
email it there and we'll get this thing
going all right sponge tip applicator
challenge and if you're wondering about
my lip gloss it is where is it it is NYX
brown lip gloss and the color is soap
opera queen so a nice pretty pink shade
there to top off our look and to see how
I did the eyes keep watching alright
guys the first step is to apply a creamy
colored base to your lids and I'm gonna
use my Revlon um cream shadow set here
in mystical magics and I'm going to be
using this light blue shade here so I'm
just gonna use my finger to apply that
all over the lid and what's the key to
applying cream shadow yes apply very
light
lair don't go too heavy with it or else
you'll notice you're staying power won't
be very good another thing I also put
some Too Faced shadow insurance on
underneath this so that should help my
cause here as well for making it last
longer so anyway just blend out a very
sheer layer of that and then we're going
to reach for our Coastal Scents 78 color
palette so that is the one that looks
like this it's got the blush at the
bottom the rectangular shadows and then
these and the first color we're going to
reach for is this one right here it's
actually kind of a vibrant looking
turquoise shade and we're going to of
course use our sponge tip applicator I'm
just going to use the one that came with
the set here to apply that all over our
lid here
you can see the shadow really showing up
it's really clinging to that the Revlon
base we put on there so I'm going right
up to the crease with this just like so
and then the next thing we're gonna do
is use that very same sponge tip what
we're just gonna use the opposite side
there I'm gonna grab a shimmery sort of
burgundy brown shade it reminds me a
little bit of Mac's
sketch where are we here other side it's
this shade right here that is three down
on the right hand side if you're trying
to follow along here and I'm just gonna
dip in with the tip of the sponge tip
applicator there and we're going to just
apply this to the outer half of the lid
so you can see it's giving us a nice
little overlap it's like water and land
our meeting here with the blue and the
brown and it's you know it's it's
different here it's it's different doing
that without a brush for me but you know
I'm trying here this is kind of a
natural seeming but then we're gonna try
to work in and get an outer V going here
so I'm just gonna extend it out from the
top this is just what I would do with a
brush I'm just doing it with my sponge
tip and then up from the bottom out from
the top up from the bottom and just kind
of try to get that general shape going
that I would normally do this is a
really the one the these little sponge
tips that come with the Coastal Scents
palettes are kind of are really stiff
and not real soft so I'm I
dig around and find a softer one if
you've got quite a few shadow like
different eye shadow things you'll find
that they're a little different in every
one of your little eye shadow kits that
you might have around so anyway I'm
softly kind of getting that on there a
little at a time because you could go
overboard with one of these things so
get it on there how I think I want it
and then I've got like um I have this
little pack that I got in a while back
from LA Colors six piece sponge tips and
they have like a really fine tip at one
end and a bulkier tip so yeah that tip
that's a little bit softer if it you
know if you if you find any that you
have that are like that those are good
for blending out any rough edges so we
achieve that sort of softened up look we
had on the other side with this and also
with that I'm going to take this shade
here that's right a blah above the the
black rectangle it's actually kind of a
topi brown shade and I'm going to use
that to also soften out the outer edge
of that with that LA Colors kind of
sponge tip and don't use this as like
you have to use this particular kind of
sponge dip the point whole point of this
is that and they're all sort of alike
and any will do I'm just telling you why
I switch my now I kind of look through
and found one that I that I thought
would work for this so anyway just kind
of blending around that and then we're
gonna have to do a highlight shade so
instead of reaching for a brush of
course we're gonna I'm going to go back
to this one that came with the palette
that has a little bit of a wider tip to
it and I'm going to go up to this top
shade in the very corner on the more
oranjee side it's just kind of a a light
champagne shade pretty much and I'm just
gonna apply that all over my lid here
all the way up to the top and then for
just an add a little bit of shimmer I'm
going to take this very light pink shade
it's at the very top it's one of the
lightest shades in the palette
go right under the brow liner I'm gonna
be using my femme Couture liquid
eyeliner in brown it's pretty much my
favorite brown shade that I have I don't
have Revlon Colorstay in this but this
has been working great for me so far so
I'm just gonna line from inner to outer
corner here starting in the inside and
moving out then on the bottom I'm going
to be using my Revlon Colorstay
automatic pencil liner in black brown
and for that we're gonna just kind of
connect with our outer corner there just
kind of flick it up to the outer corner
so it's sort of meshes with the liquid
and then we're gonna go down to let's
see about three-quarters of the way in I
just check and remember what I did on
the other eye and we're just keeping
that light as you can see and then we're
gonna go back to our sponge tip I'm
using a really narrow side here to this
and I'm gonna use that shade that I sort
of compared to Mac's sketch right here
it's kind of a brownish Bergin III down
on the right side and I'm gonna dip into
that and sort of use that to just go
right over that and it almost kind of
gives it see how it sort of Hazen's it
out just a little bit Hayes's it out I
don't really know what what I truly mean
by that but that's okay and then I'm
gonna use the other side and dip it into
that blue that pretty turquoise that we
put all over the lid and we're gonna use
that on the inner corner and I'm not
looked down into a mirror so I can see
this a little better
so we've got that there and then this
turned out with just a little bit more
shimmery cuz I went over it with this
lightish pink shade that's right up top
here where are we right here so I'm
gonna go over that just a little bit
just to give it a little more shimmer
just a little added lightness right here
in that tear duct area and down below as
well right there in the corner alright
guys and there's your eye shadow lashes
I'm gonna go ahead and curl my lashes
with my ELF eyelash curler then I'm
going to use my covergirl LashBlast
mascara I'm gonna apply just a little
bit on the lower lashes and also a coat
on the top to sort of prep them for the
false lashes we're gonna put on so just
a little bit I like to use if I'm gonna
do things on the bottom lash line I've
kind of learned through trial and error
that this lash blast is a pretty good
job of not smudging oops
I just hit myself did you guys see that
mini emergency we're having here oh the
cameras moving and everything
bingo caught it in time I'm glad you
guys get to see that I got the camera
ship too and everything it was almost
like we had a little earthquake or
something and that'll be fine okay
continuing with the the mascara here
compare the eyes right now you can tell
this I definitely has the false lashes
on I really like this set they're from
ELF it's the natural lash kit so they're
only a dollar on eyes lips face calm and
I think they're just great I trimmed
mine down just a little bit so they're
basically covering from here to here and
that makes it just a little more
manageable I feel like rather than
getting it all right down into the
corner of your eye I kind of like that
more you know more of the effect on the
outer portion so I'm gonna go put those
on and hey have you seen my false
eyelash video because that will show you
how to put them on so I'll be right guys
there is the finished look a nice little
sort of natural look with a splash of
color using only sponge tip applicator
so I really hope you guys take the time
to maybe mess around and see if you can
to do a look you know whatever colors
whatever level of difficulty you want to
do and just try out try it out it's kind
of just a fun little challenge and I
hope you'll all participate so thank you
guys so much for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
