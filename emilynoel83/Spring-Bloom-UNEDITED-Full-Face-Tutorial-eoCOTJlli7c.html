we want to tell you a little bit about
the motivation behind this video I
always like to give you a little bit of
backstory and first off the spring bloom
I mean who doesn't want that fresh
spring light makeup look very easy to
execute I wouldn't say there's one
particular star of the show with this
look like a really bold eye or a crazy
lip you know it's really about
everything in the face working in
harmony also I do really enjoy watching
you know some of those very intricate
detailed looks I know I've done plenty
of those in the past has probably been
most of what I've done but I'm realizing
how much I also enjoy watching people
just do a real free and easy makeup
application nothing is really too
precise and overdone and install just
kind of quickly slapped together and
it's fun to watch makeup like that
because I think that is the circumstance
many of us are in a lot of time
sometimes it's really nice to be able to
sit down and slave over the details
other times it just needs to be thrown
together and fortunately for this kind
of effortless look I think that vibe
really works this is also gonna be an
uncut makeup tutorial in other words no
edits it's just gonna be straight
through nothing left out you will see
everything and one more comment before
we get going I did kind of road test
this look yesterday and I was really
personally pleased with the staying
power of just all the makeup on the face
it looked really great at day's end
actually it was much better than I was
expecting and even Tyler I mean I'll
give him credit he's a pretty perceptive
guy but I was sitting in my chair
nursing Bell and he looked over and he
said you look really pretty that was
just and really nice
out of the blue comments so here we go
let's get started with the uncut
tutorial I'm using my dream pure BB from
Maybelline this has a 2% salicylic acne
treatment in it and I have it in the
light to medium
shade this was something I actually
bought while I was pregnant with Belle
and never ended up using it because I'm
like oh it has the salicylic acne
treatment
I want to steer clear of that stuff
while I'm pregnant but now it's game on
for that kind of stuff so I'm just
spreading this all over with my fingers
I actually kind of think this version of
the Maybelline BB has a little more
coverage than the one and like the pink
and white tube anybody else noticed that
and I just really like spreading it on
with my fingers I think it melts it into
the skin better it looks less like it's
just sitting on top of the skin so
that's what I'm doing here under the eye
is a bit and yeah I was just really kind
of shocked at how well this lasted
yesterday considering I was outside like
multiple times during the day went one
for walks we went for an evening walk it
was just really great so there's that on
then I'm gonna just do a little bit of
correcting with my benefit erased
pasting it there and I'm gonna take this
around my eye area at first off and I'm
looking down into a little mirror hear
yourself sometimes I pick up this mirror
during tutorials and I mistakenly like
hold it right in front of my face it's
like I forget oh there's a camera trying
to get that shot so again I'm just
blending this with my finger just trying
to correct you know any of the darkness
that's there and it is early right now
I'm shooting this it
6:00 in the morning somebody was quite
the early bird for their morning nurse
so go just pat pat pat melasma is you
know I I can sense that there's maybe
just a teeny bit of it lips still
lingering but for the most part I mean
compared to what I was dealing with
during the pregnancy that's pretty much
a non-issue these days so that's nice
make sure that's all patted in this
tends to have a little bit of a doing
Asst to it this particular concealer but
we'll take care of that I'm just using a
little bit of it right around my nose I
don't normally use this concealer there
but I'm trying to kind of minimize
products minimize fuss with this
tutorial so dab it all in okay then
we're gonna do a little brightening step
love this age rewind brightener and wait
if the age rewind eraser in brightener
so it's a little bit of a pinky toned
brightening product and I'm gonna take
this straight down the nose okay and
you'll get a little more product out of
there take a little bit on top of the
cheeks I just realized I hope I don't
have a camera malfunction or anything
that causes this to break up the
tutorial because if I'm doing it uncut
right I don't want to have to stop and
start again but this is a little
double-ended brush from Tarte that came
with the concealer I don't know it
you're so ago I got it I think it might
have been the creaseless concealer and
its really awesome actually it's got one
end that's a little more fluffy that's
what I'm using now you could blend this
concealer and with fingers but I kind of
like how this maintains a little bit
more of the coverage
so I'm just dabbing around like that not
using a particular powder for this look
this was another reason why it
fascinated me how great the staying
power was because I didn't go like crazy
with fully mattifying my whole face but
I did use you know a little bit of a
powder in key areas and one thing that
I'm using is this wet-and-wild
contouring palette full review on the
Express channel and this is the caramel
toffee shade going in with my ELF this
is the tapered small tapered brush
getting a little bit of that on there
and that light is shade I tell you a
really nice little under eye setting
product see how that totally mattified
that area but it's not too heavy I'm
using very little of this product here
so just dab dab a roux right around here
bingo might use that same brush to take
a little bit of this down the nose a
little bit on the chin and then I want
to use a little bit of this as a contour
right might as well where was the brush
I used I'm gonna use this little guide
this is a small contour brush from Sigma
came from some sort of travel kit a
while back and I just kind of found it
and it really is kind of nice here
hollows of the cheeks I also love the
Real Techniques contour brush
but this is kind of nice too we'll do
the product lay down and the blending
all in one just blend that out
really love the cool tone nature of this
powder as I mentioned in the review I
mean it's just a great deal it's like a
four dollar product found it at Walmart
I think it's exclusive to Walmart and
it's some Walmart's there are two shade
options in my store there was just the
one so you know I'm not doing like super
chisel face or anything here but just
getting a little bit of depth I'm gonna
go under I'm just a touch and I'm going
to take this a little bit around the
hairline as well I really just I mean it
for a subtle contour this is pigmented
but it's not too loud you know it's just
it's working for me for the springtime
lighter look okay there's that
synonymous with that product aside
because we are gonna be pulling it out
again for the eye look
but for now I'm doing a little bit of
blush and it's really cool we got a
couple multitasking things here this
this is gonna be contouring and part of
the eyes and this is going to be cheek
and lip here in this Mac trend forecast
spring 15 lip and cheek this was showing
my haul using my little elf small
stipple brush and for the cheeks I'm
gonna do mostly this shade right here
okay so dab dab dabbing and then boom
one little shot maybe two bit of that
reddish shade so this can come on a
little bit strong you might want to dab
off on your hand for a second but I'm
just gonna dab this here on the outer
part of the apple of my cheek it's gonna
work in perfect harmony with the lip
once we get that on a little bit more
there we go so pretty
I mean dewy gorgeousness sometimes when
I put my blush on I feel like that's the
moment where I feel like okay the face
has life again especially this early in
the morning in this small stipple brush
you know we're putting it on but we're
not really taking away what's underneath
I think the small stipple brush is just
a complete MVP in my collection for sure
so just blending that out a bit as you
can see I'm apple of the cheek but I'm
also just lifting it a bit right up in
there okay I think that's adequate right
think that's looking good then I'm gonna
take a little bit of my Becca shimmering
skin perfecter this is in this shade
opal and normally I might you know do a
little bit of this on my hand pick it up
with the brush or if you're in a hurry
just dab it straight for the cheeks I'm
gonna do like three little dots there
one right here boom and boom and then
take my brush
and just blend right over the top of
where you put that blush and look at the
glow yummy I'm sorry but that's a tasty
glow right there ah you know I love
getting excited about the makeup looks
it's it's great when products give me
something to get excited about now when
there gets to be a hair stuck in your
highlight that's when your got an issue
okay there you go that I'm using a lot
of this little by little viewfinder here
as my mirror also my secondary mirror so
please excuse all the looking I'm doing
in that general direction but that's
basically skin dang it okay this is
gonna be cutted at least in one spot
because my memory card had a little
freaked out there told me it was getting
low so I had to delete some things off
of there but anyway moving on nice spot
to move on because we're moving on to
brows this is my NYX taemin frame and
this is brunette so I like to use this
with my little angled brush from Sigma
e75 just dip into this and this tutorial
by the way would probably go a lot
faster if I wasn't talking throughout
the entire thing but you know what's a
video if there's no talking so I just
kind of start down low on the brow
filling that in taking off rogue brush
hairs that are sticking to my forehead
and this is kind of like the tedious
process I guess if any part of this look
is tedious it would be filling in the
brows just because you know you've got
to be a little bit careful with this and
I'm not doing tons of filling in I'm by
no means like coding my whole brow I
mean there is hair existing hair in my
brows but I'm just kind of evening
perfecting a bit wait no I'm not
perfecting my brows are not perfect but
you know what I'm saying and then I'm
going to take just this little brush and
kind of help that product through in a
couple places I'm not going to use any
finishing gel because I feel like this
product does kind of set the brows in
place a little more on the other side so
easy I love the texture of this product
too not too goopy it's nice and light
getting another little notification here
on my screen from my memory card like
the lot
let's just get the browser warehouse
under pressure if you only knew how many
times stuff like that happened during my
regular all edited up videos you would
be surprised moving on to the eyes now
outside of the brow I'm using this
bareMinerals 5 and 1 BB advanced
performance eyeshadow and soft linen I
use this and this alone in the eye look
yesterday and was really really loving
on the staying power with it so I'm
using that again today and just giving a
little dab on top of each lid this is so
simple I mean this is a crazy simple eye
look but it really seems to work with
what's happening here
because I want light on the lids I want
that lightness there because I'm doing
an eyeliner free look and the lightness
makes the lashes stand out that much
more you know it's like giving it a
light backdrop as opposed to something
dark and smoky so just dabbing right all
over the lid so you got that lightness
there then I'm taking an e25 brush and
we're going to our lovely little contour
highlight palette from wet and wild love
one things can multi-task go into your
contour shade and then this is going to
be guess what the crease yes
so just going right into you know that
deepest part of the crease going back
and forth and then just you know pull
the shade upward as far as you feel
comfortable further up you go you know
the more you'll kind of see that color
just peeking out above the eye and this
is so easy simple anything over here
just getting it in it deepest part of
the crease and then just up above beauty
of this uncut uncut for the most part
video is that you can really see how
long I'm taking with this and it's not
very long at all and then I'm just gonna
take this blending brush just a DAB with
the highlight and that's what's gonna go
right under the brow and border the
light brown and then a pencil brush
going into the contour boom boom boom
and this is just gonna be a very soft
about as soft as it gets and a
definition on the lower lash line
may need to go back and forth building
up a little bit
did I mention I've barely had any of my
coffee yet sitting over here at my elbow
I might need to take a sit but yeah I
really love this this shade this shade
that works great in the cheekbones works
great around the eye area for natural
definition and then I got this new
product also from wet and wild it is
this big old nude pencil you can always
count on wet and wild to give you some
giant pencils but what is the shade on
this
it's called calling your buff
and this is what I'm putting here on my
lower inner rim to brighten up a little
bit and this product I swear it really
needs to be warmed up a little bit like
practically just warmed up a hair
between your fingers because it's not a
pencil that transfers super easily so
once I put a little on there and then I
warm it up and go back and then it
really like clings to what was first on
there first applied dab over any little
creasing concealer concealers just kind
of do that but then you go back to
business here sorry I can't see
brightening up that inner rim and then
comes the mascara so I'm taking my
curler this curler is from Tarte by the
way it was a holiday thing and I just
really love it it's the same basic
curler that Tarte always has but it's
just got fancy pearls on it
I feel real snazzy anytime I pull this
out but I curl my lashes for a good I
don't know it probably ends up being
about 20 25 seconds on each side kind of
holding it in a tipped up way trying to
get the most curl out of my straight
lashes that I can and then I'm happened
to be using my what's your type mascara
from the balm just says what's your
tight black mascara so I really like the
brush on this it's got quite a few
bristles but they're pretty short pretty
easy to maneuver you know so even though
I'm trying to go fast and loose I got to
be careful and not touch my eyelid with
this stuff
I'm bad about that I feel like every day
for the past couple weeks I've had to
pull any q-tips so it'll be a personal
victory if I don't have to do that today
so see how nicely this build things up
I'm gonna take some my hairs out of it I
know that really thickens up my lashes
you know when some of my had hair from
my head mixes in but not the look I'm
going for
so okay I've got that going on now we do
other eye butter thing and now we just
have some time to talk here's where you
take your sip of coffee oh oh wait will
this work hold on you see this that's
like that complicated you know thing you
do at weddings where you interlock arms
and give each other a drink of champagne
or no your drink giving yourself a drink
of champagne but you're I don't know
weaseling your way through the others
arms it's I got a picture of that
happening from my wedding it looks
complicated but it made for a pretty
picture okay
um where's my mascara right at all
and yeah I mean I don't want to do
really a huge lash look here because
we're just keeping it kind of free and
natural but I'm definitely showing off
some of the length because we've got
that nice white well not really stark
white but kind of just cream on the lids
behind
and then I'm gonna do just a little bit
on the lower lashes with this the whole
classic covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant one of the only things I
trust down here just a light amount just
to kind of even out the look we're
getting from top lash line to bottom
lash line so just apply that
that's about all the amount of time I
ever take doing that step and then her
lips we're going back to the Mac palette
and I am gonna use mainly the shade down
here a really rosy reddish type color I
just think it's the it's the cherry on
top of this look I got a little
something-something not perfectly
blended around the brown here and also
around the lips all right fix that but
just dabbing it on with the fingers you
know it gives it a really kind of
pillowy soft look as opposed to the
super super defined you know lip liner
look but this palette has been so much
fun honestly the shades in here and even
the lighter shades I think in my haul I
talked about how well some of the
lighter shades don't throw up a lot but
they actually make fantastic mixers to
kind of lighten up or shine up some of
the others alright got to be a little
careful on these outer parts boom add a
little more here at the top so Rosie
love
okay whoa hello good morning camera
thank you for playing today okay so um
as I look at this look I'm a little
finishing touch I might do would be to
maybe just take a little bit of this
light shade again dab it right up in
here I don't know if I even took this
shade up in this area initially I'm
gonna revisit that okay okay
and then my hair you guys I used these
things called
I think they're called wrap snap and go
or just snap and go maybe and I use them
overnight to get some curl in my hair
because I rarely feel like there's a lot
of time to do that and then I've got
some decent you know body happening here
and you could really style it up you
know whatever man are you please you
could put it up yesterday I had my hair
up actually and I thought it gave a
really I don't know a very fresh look to
the whole shebang but this is just easy
to throw together simple fun I used I
think for me anyway pretty minimal
products and it's just you know a really
fresh springy look it gets you out the
door get you out enjoying you know then
pretty spring weather beautiful nature
just a lot of fun so thank you guys for
watching this video I hope you enjoyed
it as much as I enjoyed doing it for you
and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
