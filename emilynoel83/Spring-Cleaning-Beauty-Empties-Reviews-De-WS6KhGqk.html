Belle has her six-month doctor's
appointment six months can you believe
it I can't believe that much time has
passed but I was getting ready for that
I was not planning to do a full-on smoky
eye I was using the new revealed three
what-you-call-it palette from Coastal
Scents and things just got out of hand
I mean it was beyond my control that's
what I'm going with but yesterday I was
kind of trying to clean up a little bit
you wouldn't know it from looking at my
desk right now but I was trying to
straighten up and get rid of some
empties that I had compiled and I think
of this as spring cleaning maybe this
will be a seasonal type video that I do
I actually painfully before we moved I
threw away a ton of empties because I
was just getting frustrated with all the
moving clutter and I couldn't justify
moving empty trash to a new house and
I've also of course got those things
that I don't think about and just throw
away like the equate daily facials
hydrating cleansing cloths I go through
about one pouch of those consistently
every month so those aren't in here and
I also haven't kept like the cans of
Tresemme tray - hairspray and go through
a lot of that - but what I do have in
here is just makeup skincare some body
stuff as well and by when I say in here
I mean this awesome empty stub that
Cristen game had given me it really is
fun to toss something empty into this
tub but let's get the big stuff out of
here first on this vineyard peach shower
gel from the body shop love the scent of
this use this forever it was one of
those when will it end type of products
and I really like the scent but I don't
think I'm gonna rush out and repurchase
it because after 8.4 fluid ounces I've
kind of had my fill you know I've
experienced that scent I've still got it
in the body butter so I don't think I
need that again similar situation with
this one oh my gosh this is a kid's
two-in-one shampoo and body wash Galvin
and Galvan London kids in banana berry
this was a find in at Target and when I
opened it up to give it a whiff it
reminded me not of true banana scent but
of banana candy and so I had to have
and I've just used it not really as a
shampoo but as a body wash and it's
really good again for me not
earth-shattering enough to want to buy
more of it also went through this st.
Ives blemish control green tea scrub
really really liked this little scrub I
thought it had a lot of scrubbing action
it kind of reminded me of the philosophy
mmm micro delivery scrub but I really
like this and I went and repurchased a
different kind it's that pink lemon and
mango star fruit but I can't think pink
lemon and something I remember the pink
lemon because I think are they're really
pink lemons in the world I don't feel
like that has quite the scrubbing action
that this does it's a nice creamy
cleanser and it does exfoliate but I
think this did more so that might be my
favorite one this green tea went through
a whole moisturizer and this was used
all throughout my pregnancy and I really
wanted to keep this because I was whoa
really proud that yeah this thing I
cleaned that sucker out
it's the Cebu sea buckthorn replenishing
night cream all natural and I had
purchased a few different Cebu things
when it was on HauteLook and I really
did like this although again I was using
it during a time when I think my skin
was very hormonal II charged you know
with the I had the melasma that I was
dealing with and I just wanted basically
a good nourishing night cream that was
good natural ingredients and this did
the job you know it kept me moisturized
I wasn't having breakouts really but I'm
one of those people it's like I've used
this long enough I've had my fill I've
moved on to my Olay Regenerist skincare
stuff so I'm not really obviously using
that anymore
um couple of these puppies these little
owl male ash care is this one and
soothing and deep buffing is this one
and they are the little eye makeup
remover pads and I basically just use
these if there's any residue on my eyes
or to clean up little mistakes and stuff
they're really thin and I think they're
very good for that purpose I've never
actually really used these to remove a
full eye look um they're really small I
imagine it would take quite a few of
them to do that job as far as like these
being soothing and deep puffing I find
them both to be the
way because they're kind of cool it
might just be the temperature of the
room or wherever you're keeping a mat
but they feel nice when I put them on my
eyes like them I am out right now
probably buy more went through a whole
little tube of the Clinique all about
eyes and this is an eye cream that I
have really enjoyed for daytime I found
it to be lightweight but still
moisturizing I felt like I wouldn't be
so quick to get that dry kind of you
know gnarly looking under-eye thing
going on under makeup when I would have
this on under the whole look so this is
something I'm probably gonna repurchase
this is the bare minerals primetime look
at the mini primetime eyelid primer this
was something I did go purchase the full
size of still have not used all that up
mainly the eye primer I've been using
lately is my Milani eyeshadow primer
which I think wears like iron
I like the bare minerals this never got
Creasy on me it's a really good
consistency it's a little thicker than
the Milani but I like this stuff and I
did go ahead and buy the full size
nothing's in any particular order here
but this is the instant age rewind the
one in fair and I really like this I
think this is one of the best like
liquid thin consistency concealers from
the drugstore great for actually packing
in some coverage but being super
lightweight on the skin I know I've had
this in light before and I just recently
repurchased one in the shade called
brightener I'm wearing that on the eye
area today ran out of one of these
Revlon precision lash adhesives I go
through I've probably gone through
several of those to be honest and
they've just gotten checked in various
places o Estee Lauder Double Wear
maximum cover creamy tan love this stuff
this is kind of amazing that I've gone
through one of these because it doesn't
take much when you're using this it only
takes a little dad because it's spread
so well this is my fullest coverage
anything foundation check out my melasma
video if you want to see this cover some
big-time badness on the face and say
enough about this for those who need the
amazing coverage if you've got major
discoloration on your face this is what
you want to go to it's not something
everyone needs because
everyone has as much to cover up during
the pregnancy throughout the summer this
was awesome and I did repurchase this I
actually got two shades I got the creamy
tan and one lighter than that I think it
might be called creamy vanilla and if
you really want to get like all
highlighting with it on the face you
could use you know the lighter part down
the center of the face top of the cheeks
wherever when I really latch on to a
great eye liner I will suck that thing
dry here is the Jordana color Envy liner
there is no label left on this and this
lasted me so long I was using this so
consistently for months and months I
mean I'm trying to think back to when I
did an initial review on this on the
Express channel it was sometime in the
summer and I seriously used it all the
time and just recently ran out I went
ahead and repurchased three more of
these off of the Jordana cosmetics
website because I can't find them at
Walgreens but it is a brush tip eyeliner
really fine tip I'm wearing it today
it's great under false lashes or
whatever it dries matte and the shade is
black envy so great matte black liquid
liner inexpensive also I ran out of my
Milani ultra fine and black vinyl
another amazing long wearing dark rich
black liner the only difference really
between the two this Milani one instead
of having a brush tip it has like a itty
bitty um you know full felt tip thing
and I think I actually prefer the brush
because I feel like I can sweep it on
faster brow products benefit gimme brow
really like this stuff this has
incredible hold I think if you like the
tinted mascara type products in your
brows this is really nice hard candy has
something similar but I found it to be
much more goopy this I really like how
it cleans off the little brush and you
can get just the right amount in there
and this shade whatever shade I have
medium deep really seemed to work for my
eyebrows so it's a nice quick fix but if
you need precise filling in if you've
got like one little spot that you really
need to cover I don't think this gives
you as much precision you pretty much
got to go in with an angled brow brush
brush off of this thing brush off of the
wand and then go filling in so there's
that I'm just making a whole big mess
right in front of my selfie
went through the it cosmetics your brows
but better universal transforming taupe
I think this was my second one of these
this is a really great skinny brow
pencil I love the skinny version of it
because I think you can get a much more
natural fill in fine line and check out
my full review on the Express channel
but it's one of those one color fits all
type of products here within that
Universal taupe and I actually thought
it worked for me now if I were drawing
in an entire brow with this product I
don't know that it would have looked as
natural I've got pretty thick brows as
is and I was just looking for you know
little fill in here and there and that
seemed to work also went through a
Maybelline great lash clear gel I have
now moved on to the NYX control-freak
brow gel that's my favorite it I feel
like when you pull the brush out it
isn't overloaded with goop and it really
has amazing hold so I probably should
have updated since this time on the two
different brow products I've really
gotten into a consistent use with have
been the two-faced brow Envy kit and
also the NYX taemin frame that's one of
the little pomades
I love that one I've got a bunch of
mascaras that I've gone through over the
course of the past I don't know how many
months it's been first off covergirl
clump crusher water-resistant I know
I've gone through at least another one
of these in addition to the one I'm
holding but this is my go-to lower lash
mascara and yes I repurchase that as
soon as I run out what else do we have
essence I love extreme crazy volume
mascara I love this great great
drugstore mascara for the big lash look
the brush is kind of big it does have
like itty bitty bristles right at the
tip and I have really enjoyed that
mascara I feel like I can build up big
lashes with that other mascaras I love
almay one coat triple effect this is
another great drugstore option if you
love really dry formula mascaras and
this is about the driest of the dry I've
got some other mascaras that I'm also in
the process of going through but if I
needed another mascara I would consider
repurchasing that one couple of high-end
mascaras that seemed to come and kits
quite often that I just always have on
hand and I feel like grabbing for one
you know I crack it open but I've gone
through a Tarte lights camera
lashes and also a Mallee volumizing
mascara I actually feel like the effect
that I get from each of these is very
similar I love them both but like I said
I've got backups of backups on these
something I ran out of without even
trying it just really dried up on me I
don't know if it was a flawed product
but it never seemed to have much to it
and it might be worth trying again
but it's the it cosmetics tightline full
lash length black primer never could get
anything really out of this it's a teeny
tiny brush and then finally two mascaras
that were okay for me but not amazing
and it was just like okay I just want to
use these up Rimmel scandaleyes rockin
curves and the l'oreal voluminous miss
manga I do have reviews on both of these
over on the Express channel they're not
bad mascaras and if you're planning to
just layer on false lashes on top you
know they're fine but there are nothing
I'm gonna go and repurchase boom I just
finished that is it those are my empties
some of the most recent ones at least
the ones that I've kept on hand in my
empties been to be able to show you so I
hope this gave you some good little
product updates mini reviews along the
way and now I can get this trash out of
mustache thank you all so so much for
the great feedback on that crazy
lipstick video bloody said you enjoyed
watching that none glad I'm glad it
could be entertainment for you because
it was really fun to shoot that video as
well so I will see you guys later bye
