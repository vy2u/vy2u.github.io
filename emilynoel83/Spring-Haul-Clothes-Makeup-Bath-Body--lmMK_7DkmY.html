spring clothes body products makeup haul
everything really makes me think spring
and that's good because I need a little
assistance because there is snow on the
ground outside I'm looking out the
window thinking wow all right on some
good deals at rue21 I actually hadn't
shopped at that store in our mall in
quite some time but I was in the mall
over this past weekend and I was just
kind of looking around and I thought wow
that stores been totally redone like
they just totally changed the whole
interior and so I thought well maybe
I'll take a look around and I found some
really cute stuff one of the things is
this top get these other clothes off my
lap it's got that kind of gathered
elastic there and some kind of flowy
floaty sleeves but really what drew me
into this was the color and the print on
it it's got this great kind of light
light turquoise color and then the
flowers are like pink and purple it is
kind of a sheer top so I am wearing a
white tank top underneath it but this
was the only thing I got that I think
wasn't marked down or on some sort of
special deal this was close to twenty
bucks I think for this top and I found
this other cute top that was marked down
it's got that cute kind of zigzag
chevron is that what they call it print
here mint green and white it's got some
buttons there on the front is really
cute on I tried it on I thought wow I
love the way that fits because it's not
too tight but it still kind of you know
follows your figure probably a little
more than the one I have on right now
does but this was around 15 bucks and I
just thought that was very cute also
some sort of a twofer deal on 24 24 I'm
not sure what the price was these are
sort of like come down to your elbow
type sleeves there on these tops and
they've got like a little just notch
their kind of Enoch notch on the
neckline and these also are kind of
sheer I sort of wish they weren't so I
wouldn't have to worry about layering
something but it is actually really cute
when you do put something I know it's
got that kind of floral um sort of lay
type vibe going on there not one in this
kind of light jade green color another
one I was wearing in my last video but
that's that orange coral Cullen also got
a couple of accessory items while i was
at rue21 again I was just coming up with
so many cute things and they had this
cute necklace this again I was wearing
this in my color lovers video but cute
gold with the turquoise teal beads there
and guess what that's what inspired my
nail design here I did got it like teal
and then gold sort of like domed right
there around the bottom so this necklace
made me think gosh I love the way the
gold and the teal looks together so that
prompted me to do that and the other
necklace I found I just thought it'd be
cute with a lot of things it's gold and
little like cream colored roses there so
I just thought I'd probably have a lot
of kind of pastel soft shades that would
look really cute with that and we went
on to Bath and Body Works whom I say we
I mean me and Tyler he was with me so
I'm like we going to back the body works
and I'm thinking what can tyler go look
i suggested he check out the little um
car since you know there's like the
little i think they're called sent
portables and you can clip them on your
visor or now you can like put them on
your vent and then you get sense to put
in them and so not really thinking he
was going to come up with anything but
then he decides oh I think I'm gonna do
this so he got one of the little things
that's in its card now he you know being
a dude he gets like the leather sent I
guess um smells like leather car seats I
suppose but it smell pretty good
actually but before you start thinking
is too manly he also selected sweet pea
and tropical breeze so I was picking out
some new wall flowers it seems like
occasionally one of my little plugs that
goes into the wall and Walt flowers if
you're not familiar they're like little
you know scented oils basically that
they plug into a thingy like that go
into your outlet and I think they just
make the house smell wonderful that's
one of the first things people say when
they walk in it smells good in here so I
love that I want to keep that up you
know
want to let people down the next time
they is it but I feel like occasionally
one of my things that plugs into the
wall will go bad like it will stop
working and you can tell when you touch
it and it's not warm so I got just one
more of those and kind of a basic color
just in case and I got five of the
little things you put in and these are
all the spring time since I guess I got
the white bar number three renew and
refresh I actually already have this in
one of our bathrooms and it smells
awesome its got like a quail or
something on their cue design then I got
pair and so pair has guess what a pair
on it super cute and first bloom this
one's really cute that may be a good one
for here in the makeup room um but
normally they have a candle out so you
can smell what these are going to smell
like because obviously you don't break
the seal on these and crack them open
but there wasn't a candle out so I could
test this one I got it purely on the
cuteness of the outside they're not
market peach I love peach sense so that
one should be good this one it says
garden bouquet I just needed one more to
get you know the by six things deal so
I'm not sure what that one smells like
either but I figure I can't go too far
wrong with that name and then there many
things were 3 4 10 and you guys if you
watch my empties video you know I've got
a real thing for Rio rum berry and so I
found a couple boy I got the spray and I
also got a little lotion as well so i
guess i'll use that as travel stuff i
love the Senate then this is such a
yummy sweet delicious scent I love it
and then the girl there had me try the
beautiful day this is a new scent
there's an apple there's a picture of a
green apple on the front and I think I
do sense a little bit of it's like a
little bit of fruit fruity sweet scent
but definitely a little bit of floral in
there as well so I don't I think I'm
going to like it so again that's called
beautiful days to have a couple more
things I was out of town
cently and you know what people do when
they go out of town they definitely go
about the drug stores they don't have in
their own town is that just me okay um
but I went to a Rite Aid and I don't
have any rite aid's near me and I
noticed that they had some Jesse's girl
stuff not like the full line but they
had nail polishes and then they had this
little guy this little pallet here it
just says Jesse's girl makeup collection
that's all it says on the back and it's
just kind of a colorful palette and I
don't have like hardly any stuff from
this line so I thought maybe I'll just
grab this palette it looks like it'd be
fun for spring loving what's going on
here at the bottom with these pinks so
um thought that was really cute i'll
give that a try and then like I said
they had nail polishes the julieg kind
and so I'm like yay let's support julieg
because she was one of the first people
i remember watching on youtube and this
shade is called shark's cove and it's a
mint green but it has a little bit of
silver shimmer in it and I've heard
people say really good things about
these polishes so I was excited to get
one of those and I picked up one more of
the vivid collection from Maybelline
this is vivid rose and I couldn't
believe this wasn't like the first one I
went for in this line it just looks like
a really nice magenta pink color to you
that I already have our on fire red
which i think is an awesome awesome red
and I have shocking coral as well which
I talked about in my coral video kind of
comes off more as a pinky shade but what
I have noticed about these two that I
already have they stay on your lips a
long time like they feel kind of
moisturizing and the initial moisture
may go you know in typical time frame
that normal lipsticks wear off but
they're so saturated and so pigmented
that I feel like they stain my lips like
I had this coral shade even after
washing my face at the end of the night
I could not like get this coral shade
off my lips so they definitely have at
least the ones i've tried have a
staining effect so that can be a good
thing if you're looking for a long way
that's it everyone let's hope spring
actually gets here soon now that it
looks like spring in high house i'm
wearing spring clothes and it smells
like spring maybe all we need is just
the weather to cooperate now but thanks
for watching I'll see you again next
time and have a great day fine aren't
you cute what you doing just waiting for
someone to come along with the camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
