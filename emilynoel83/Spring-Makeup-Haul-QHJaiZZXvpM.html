video again even though I'm not really
back to one hundred percent I am feeling
a lot better in case you haven't kept up
with my Twitter my facebook or my blog
lately i have had pink eye it started
earlier this week i basically had a cold
last week like sinus kind of problems
and it just went right into pink eye at
the start of this week i've never had it
before so it was a really just not fun
experience this I as you can see it's
not like white back to a hundred percent
you know it's not looking as white and
bright as it should but I'm on like a
twice a day I drop thing to ensure that
it does get better but I went back to
work today so I did a little bit of
makeup you know and feel just that alone
I think just lifts my spirits and makes
me feel a little bit more normal if you
want to hear about pink eye signs
symptoms my whole experience all the
makeup I had to throw out as a result
because you know I don't want to
reinfect myself or infect this I so um
yeah lots of things had to happen so i
will be wearing my glasses for a little
while so I kind of liked them I kind of
like the glasses look it's growing on me
as I've been wearing them you know
pretty much non-stop so far this week at
home so anyway this little hole I have
one thing from walgreens and the rest is
from Ulta so my walgreens thing which
i'm really loving is this maybelline
colorsensational lipstick it's one of
the new spring colors so I think it's
limited edition but it's in coral
carnation and when I was talking about
bright lipsticks in a video not too long
ago so many of you said you've got to
find this color and so I went out and I
found at my nails almost kind of match
that how about for this this past
weekend and I just loved it I went with
you know kind of a lubs a big lash look
and kind of a bronzy I and this on the
lips and I'm just nuts about it it's
really creamy I mean it doesn't have any
Sparkle or anything like that but it is
just a great Corley orange color went to
my sisters Art Show this past weekend
and of course I'm totally aware
of where any altas are along so we
stopped off and I got a few things from
Ulta this isn't a big hall by any
awesome little kit called greetings from
cabana glamma from benefit and this is
super cute this is kind of boxed up you
see it up a little like postmark there
it's got a little stamp on the back it's
really really cute it's like this this
amazing little package and it comes with
like this neat little instruction guide
that looks like postcard pictures I just
thought that was adorable but really
what I was considering getting from this
brand was the hoola bronzer and the
Posie tint because I've kind of gotten
hooked on the cha-cha tint which is more
the orange coral lip and cheek stain and
guess what this came with both of those
and so I thought I'm gonna get to try a
little bit more with this and you know
smaller quantities but I still think I'm
going to get tons of use out of it so
you've got your hoola bronzer up here
and a little brush and I've just kind of
played with this so far I haven't really
done anything but this had a little
sponge tip applicator there's several I
shadows here they're just nice pretty
neutrals one's kind of a pinky one this
this trio here actually reminds me a lot
of the covergirl shimmering sands I
think it is you know that trio that's so
basic and like everybody has it that's
got that in there here's your little
Posie tint so this is kind of like a
benefits pink tint basic so there's that
very small and cute there and then it
also comes with some kind of gorgeous in
medium and I wasn't quite sure what this
was this says the foundation faker for
medium complexions I don't know if
anybody's tried this if you have like
let me know what you think of it or how
you use it but you get a pretty decent
amount here that cute little like old
school record design on there anyway you
get basically you know for products and
one and I think this little tray lifts
out and you can continue to use this
cute little box but I just thought that
would be a better way to test out to
products I was interested in as opposed
to buying them separately xpro ducks
where buy one get one half off so i got
the gloss that I'm wearing now this kind
of brighter pink color it's called pink
rose and it's sort of a shimmery pink
mega shine gloss in all the glosses this
one really stood out is like a brighter
shade and so I just wanted to try that I
feel like I have a lot of nude and light
pink shades and the mega shine so I went
for something a little bit brighter I
also ran out of the red lip liner I was
using recently so I picked up one from
NYX we'll see how it goes i haven't
tried any of their retractable lip
liners this says waterproof which is
interesting and the color is simply red
so just like that just a typical you
know retractable liner one that I know I
know I really like is rimmel's lip liner
and ravish but I just wanted to try
something new so I got that one you're
probably getting on the hint by now that
I'm kind of obsessed with the coral
orange shades so I got this which I
thought would be a nice actually kind of
coordinating color with the lipstick and
this is in cinnamon so um kind of a
pretty again orangi blush it's really
mad I mean I don't think it has any any
shimmer or any pearl to it but I thought
that looked very pretty and I only have
one other NYX powder blush it's moka
which is sort of a pinky color doesn't
really go with the name but I really
like that so I thought it would enjoy
the quality of that one and then
something I have not yet messed with but
it looked like a lot of fun it is the
NYX push-up bra for eyebrow and it's
like an eyebrow pencil to fill in your
brow and then sort of a highlighting end
that you can use you know inner corner
around the eye etc the extent of my
whole guys i just wanted to share those
few new things a future video will
probably be a new shopping list ideas
very soon so keep on the lookout for
that and as soon as I feel like I'm able
um some tutorials and when my eye gets
back to 100% normal thank you so much
for watching thank you for all the kind
words on twitter and face
look and pull the blog and everywhere I
really really appreciate that and just
thank you so much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
