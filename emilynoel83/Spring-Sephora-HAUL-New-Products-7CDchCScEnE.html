is gonna be a little Sephora haul I
really have not shopped at Sephora in
the longest time I don't have one very
close to where I live and I just I'm
more frequently order from Ulta it seems
like online just because of the
drugstore high end mix but this time
around there were just some new things
that I really wanted to try on Sephora
site so I'll go through everything in
this video also my samples the samples
really kick butt I mean I don't know how
long it's been this way that Sephora has
had such great samples but I got this
little Bobby Brown thing that has a
couple of the light peach correctors
I've never tried these the anastacio
concealers there's four shades there
I got a trio of vite agave lip mask
samples the Roses de Cloe perfume sample
and the Tarte rainforest of the sea
water foundation samples on the light to
neutral
I've worn that yesterday and I'm wearing
it again today and I could probably get
one more use just out of that sample but
it is the epitome of liquid foundation
it's very thin kind of runny liquidy but
surprisingly good coverage for that thin
consistency so I really like the way
it's looking I don't know that I would
pursue it in the full size simply
because another foundation I'm trying
now is from Shea Moisture and it's the
weightless shade serum foundation I wear
this in the shade nude and it's also one
of those thin liquidy foundations
surprisingly good coverage only this one
I think provides a little extra moisture
compared to the Tarte but anyway I just
love the fact that you know there were
multiple shades here the top one that
light neutral definitely worked for me
and I can get multiple tries out of one
of those and I apologize by the way for
the background I just kind of scooted a
bunch of clutter out of the way but
there's still a little clutter showing
over here I am reorganizing like
complete makeup storage organization
overhaul so that's probably a future
video but I'm kind of midway through it
what I find with having a child is that
you start a project you don't
necessarily complete the project in one
day it's kind of a piece by piece I'll
do these drawers then maybe when I get
it a little spare time I'll do these
other drawers so it's coming together
slowly but
but moving on with the hall another
thing I really wanted to try it was this
product from Tarte it's the wipeout
color correcting palette so color
correcting of course all the rage they
give you the little guide that tells you
what to do with these various shades so
green is typically used to counteract
redness you've got kind of an orange
shade that they recommend for like the
deepest darkest sort of purpley bluish
tone circles you've got a couple of kind
of lighter peach shades a contour color
and also this yellow and if you really
wanted to go big and use all of those
shades there's one example of what you
could look like but I really think with
color correcting it's important to look
at your own face kind of study what your
own needs are just because somebody else
corrects their skin a certain way with
certain products
it doesn't mean you necessarily need to
do the same for me even before I got
this palette I knew the ones that I was
most interested in was everything going
in look down here at the bottom because
I knew these peachy type colors would
hopefully be a lot like benefit erase
paste and just give me kind of an
alternative to try and compare to that
also the yellow very brightening but
it's not too yellow so I thought that's
gonna be great and the contour shade is
a really really nice tone to work with
so I am big on the peachy correctors on
the under eye area but going deeper than
that you know there are some oranjee
ones floating around out there
I've tried one from Becca that's very
you know pigmented and orangie and I've
seen people you know even of my skintone
using that kind of thing on their dark
circles for me I think there's kind of a
point where you know you're a little bit
too light then you're in the sweet spot
of actually correcting the color and I
think you can actually go too dark at
times and for me maybe my under eye
darkness isn't as dark as I might think
it is and I don't feel like that ends up
doing a whole lot and I think these are
these two right over here really end up
being just right I think if you're a
really deep or rich skin tone that's
where I've seen shades like this really
come in handy but as far as the
consistency of these creams really nice
you know they're creamy without feeling
greasy they're very pigmented I don't
feel like I have to pack on a whole heck
of a lot and today since I was try
yet another corrector type product
because there are a few things like that
in this hull the shade I used was the
yellow so I used a different corrector
thing on the under eye and then I kind
of dabbed the yellow kind of in this
area that I want to brighten also down
the nose and I used the contour shade a
little bit in the hollows of the cheeks
and around the hairline however
yesterday I really use the whole shebang
and I felt like you know these shades
right down in here one is just a little
bit more yellowy than the other this is
a little bit more peach this has a bit
more of a classic beige look to it but
they worked really nicely when I use
them yesterday I just felt like that was
a little bit overboard for my skin
now another color correcting thing that
I picked up that I did end up using
today as that peachy corrector step for
the under eye is the Smashbox color
correcting stick and I got look less
tired light so this is kind of a you
know soft peach shade it's a little bit
more deep and orangie in comparison to
the benefit erased paste and medium
sorry for all the array space references
that's just what I use all the time and
I know I've gotten many of you onto
using that as well so when I reference
that it's just you know to give you
something to think about in comparison
but this is a pencil that you would
sharpen it does come with a sharpener
it's extremely creamy absolutely no
complaints about the consistency of this
so I just kind of drew this on my
darkest areas I also used it kind of
pinpointed it on any kind of spot like
age spots sun spots this would have been
the kind of thing when I was dealing
with melasma hardcore I would have put
it on those kinds of areas you could
blend it out with a brush but I really
liked just you know dabbing a Beauty
Blender right over that are you ready
for the third color correcting product I
got I got this Urban Decay Naked skin
color correcting fluid in peach so wand
applicator just like the other Naked
skin concealer and yeah it's a light
peach tone but it definitely has enough
of a peachy pigment to it it really sets
itself apart from just a normal skin
tone concealer and I will put the
Smashbox next to this and it's
fascinating how different these are in
tone Smashbox much more yellowy and
and the urban decay has a lot more pink
to it yesterday I used the urban decay
just as kind of a spot concealer I
didn't really get all up on the
under-eye area just yet and it did okay
just in terms of covering a couple dark
spots here and there I'm kind of curious
to see how this would be when used
really full on like all throughout this
under-eye area and then possibly using a
powder on top to bake it because I feel
like the regular Naked skin concealer
really does set and baking isn't even
really necessary with that so much
because that concealer doesn't stay dewy
and tacky and doesn't really require a
lot of settings so I'm curious as to
whether this will perform the same way
there so this is not a full one review I
just wanted to tell you what experiences
I've had with these so far don't be
surprised if you see a video coming out
in the near future where I am comparing
these various color correcting products
probably with special attention to the
peachy tones because that's kind of
where I specialize that's kind of the
color correction I need the most a
couple of Beauty Blender products that I
wanted to get this micro-mini correct
for okay I was sucked in I know these
aren't going to like do special
specialized color correction depending
on the shade you use they just you know
put out for micro minis in various
pretty pastel colors wouldn't this be
great in someone's Easter basket
seriously though I have fallen in love
with my micro mini this is the size of
one that's been saturated and it
actually is green but I use this all up
in my color correcting today so it's
looking a little more I don't know baby
Shh but it's so incredibly soft really
nice for that delicate kind of under eye
area I feel like a lot of times with
brushes I would pull that area a lot and
once you start using something like this
you realize just how gentle you can be
so if you're not familiar with the way
Beauty Blender type things work you get
them completely saturated take them to
the sink and squeeze out all the excess
water but you see them you know change
in size they get so much bigger once you
do that and then I kind of wring them
out with the towel and then just go to
work use them wherever you need to blend
for the micro mini it's really just
ideal for the under eyes for me so I was
glad to have a few extras now super cute
also I didn't even know that this
existed until someone tweeted me about
it but they have a beauty blusher so
this is a Beauty Blender for blush and
it's kind of gray in color and this one
has also been saturated it's drying out
just a little bit feel like it was just
a little bit bigger than this earlier
but here's like regular Beauty Blender
all soaked up with water and that's what
that looks like and I would say this
feels quite a bit softer compared to the
regular Beauty Blender it feels more
like the texture of the micro mini which
I've found to be just much more soft
just a little less coarse to the feeling
of the sponge and I still think the
Beauty Blender is is very soft do you
know by these standards but this is just
even more squishy there's a little more
bounce to it I can see why this would be
a very like cream blush friendly type
application tool so I use this yesterday
and today for blush today I experimented
with a color pop blush normally with
cream blushes I would use my ELF small
stipple brush you guys know that because
I talked that thing to death it really
does work well I'm not saying I
absolutely needed this but I used it
with this color pop blush today it's the
kpop blush and flushed so a nice coral
and this did work very very well
something I've noticed about some of the
color pop blushes that I've had in my
collection for a bit longer as they get
just a little more dry and the texture
on these is kind of like a cream but not
a sticky wet cream okay so while an elf
small stipple brush can do great with
those I feel like as they become a bit
more dry they can be a little more
resistant to being picked up with that
brush and this seems to pick up that
pigment very easily and I like to use
just the butt end of this that's what I
did for my application today and then I
also use this color pop highlight this
is in fanny pack and I went in with more
just the side of it and let around like
that and it did very nicely there too
again it's like a jumbo sized micro mini
just the texture of it feels very much
like that it's crazy like how many gears
did I go without using Beauty blenders
at all and now I'm like all about do we
need a video on the various blenders and
the different ways I like to use them
let me know moving on to eyes I got a
new ipalo it's from Smashbox and it's
called fotomat
and it does come with a brush I'm funny
how in that perfect palette to tag video
there was a question about what do you
want included with your eyeshadow
palette brush eyeliner or nothing and
this one actually has a decent brush
after I knocked most brushes that come
in palettes it's got a brow brush and
also this just kind of borderline flat
fluffy you know could be a crease brush
could be a lid brush kind of thing
that's kind of the neat thing about this
palette they point out that these could
be brow colors as well as eyeshadows and
there's this little guy here on the back
where there's different configurations
of dots under each shade and it kind of
tells you okay this is an eye shadow
this could be used as a liner these
could be used as brow products I mean
you could probably kind of figure that
out on your own but it is a nice sturdy
feeling palette there is a mirror there
a nice sized mirror and I do like the
shade variety you know I feel like you
got a lot of cool shades to work with
some warm shades I don't know that I
necessarily like this better than like
my Too Faced natural matte palette I do
think this offers a little more
versatility over here with these matte
cool shades to work with also Smashbox
does tend to be very like educational
with their kits like this so there's all
kinds of info here on how to work with
different eye shapes and also different
brow shapes to where today's look I did
a mix of like these two shades in my
crease and this is what's giving me all
the darkness in the outer corner that's
that like kind of dark sort of warm
reddish-brown I also used some of this
lightest shade on the inner most part of
my lid just kind of lightly there today
I'm kicking myself because I forgot to
use these as brow shades but yesterday I
did and the colors I used were these too
and they weren't just fabulously they're
so pigmented you do kind of need to use
a light hand and if you want them to
have a little bit more longevity I think
and kind of clinging in there to the
brows you might consider getting a clear
wax pencil
I know Milani makes one honest hacia has
them you just kind of stroke that
through your brows first and then use
the angled side of this brush with
whatever powder you want to use and it
works so nicely I do really like that
out brushes well it's extremely stiff
the cut is just perfect Smashbox does
make some really nice brushes last thing
that I got is lip related and it's the
Sephora favorites give me some nude lip
and I think the first time I went
looking for this it was out of stock but
now it's back and it contains let's see
one two three four five different nude
or neutral lip options here and there
was only one product in here that I had
tried before so I was super excited to
get this the one that I'm wearing today
out of this kit is actually just the
liner the Marc Jacobs Primrose lip liner
really love this but was excited to see
just how similar this formula is to the
NYX
slide-on liners that I've been raving
about these days you know it goes on so
smoothly really evenly and easily as far
as the lip liner is concerned and the
nice thing about these is that they do
just twist up with the NYX you have to
sharpen them but I love the shade I was
comparing this to nude suede shoes from
NYX and that liner while I thought it
would be the closest one from NYX is
line it is quite a bit lighter than this
but the formula the feel the texture the
way they kind of set and aren't quick to
transfer off you know that is very
similar between the two lines I'll
continue looking in my collection see if
I can find an exact color dupe of that
shape because it is a really great color
they just love in these samplers how
they give so many different you know
different brands but also different
textures and consistencies of products
so you get this nude Stix lip and cheek
pencil in whisper this is the one thing
that I already had in a double-ended
nude Stix it was whisper on one end and
then what was the other shade like a
deeper kind of rosier shade on the
opposite side but that's really my kind
of nude right there very easy to wear
you get a NARS lipstick in this set in
the shade Dolce Vita and this is kind of
your rosy nude I suppose I'll do a
swatch of that here this I was wearing
this the other day it was more sheer
than I expected and I started pressing
hard and I think I press don't you hate
when this happens like you pressed the
stick over and then you get that little
line on the side but yeah I like this
color but it is quite a bit more sheer
than I was expecting from NORs you're
getting a laura mercier lipstick this is
in the
Jade Milky Way and this seems like more
of a brownish tan nude I'll swatch that
here another kind of shiny cream formula
lipstick I generally like nudes that are
more like these that have a little bit
more pink tone to them but I'll try to
give that one a go and then finally on
you get one of these hardest lip paints
in the shade namaste this seems like a
very lightweight moosie kind of texture
and there's a swatch of that looks like
a beautiful soft pink but not too you
know cool and cotton candy like it's
still kind of in that nude neutral
family but that is my Sephora haul
everyone thank you so much for watching
thanks for putting up with my little bit
of congestion you might be hearing in my
voice I don't know if it's springtime
allergy time or what but thank you so
much and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
