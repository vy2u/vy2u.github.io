only the products in that makeup starter
kit slash giveaway video you missed out
on what all is in that kit I'll link to
that video below but this first look is
going to be the quickest most natural of
the bunch I'm calling it my class a
class look but don't take that too
literally if you are beyond school age
this could be your quick go-to in a
hurry to go to work look or got to drop
the kids off at school kind of look I
mean it's just very quick but it still
makes the face look finished and it
still covers up your flaws you
characteristics of this look our light
face makeup defined eyes a little pop on
the lips and most of all it is quick and
easy this isn't going to require every
single product in the starter kit but
it's gonna only use those products
mentioned and only those tools and
brushes and stuff like that so to start
off you've just moisturized your skin
then take your covergirl plus ol a
concealer boom this little stick
well it says concealer this can
practically be like a stick foundation
for you so go ahead and just really
quickly draw that all over your face and
the areas where you need some coverage
it might be your under eyes you might
have redness around the nose or pimples
or anything like and then I like to
blend over it with the f60 foundation
brush that comes in the kit it's gonna
maintain the coverage you want without
over blending and just swiping the
product right off your face next up
we're gonna set the skin with some
powder if you're especially oily you may
want to use your maybelline shine free
otherwise if you just want a regular old
good coverage powder I really like the
L'Oreal True Match and with that you can
just use the powder brush that's in here
the f30 and get a little bit of that on
there buff it in on your skin over areas
where you've used some concealer make
sure to just dab over it that way you
don't undo all your coverage but in
other areas just buff that in if you
feel like your skin needs a little extra
color go to your Revlon Photoready
bronzer and you can use that same powder
brush and just go around sort of the
perimeter of your face you could do a
little light contouring with this
whatever
you want or you may decide you don't
need this at all but if you are using
this make sure to also take it down your
neck as well and onto the chest pay
attention to any exposed skin that you
have good we're going to crack open the
Bon Jovi palette and go to the blush the
pop pop blush which is the same as the
balms frat-boy blush and you can
actually use that same powder brush if
you want to just dot into that and buff
that in on your cheeks and we're gonna
move on to eyes and I'm using the elf
Studio brow kit I love this because you
can use more or less of the wax or the
powder to build up the right color for
you and the little applicator in there
works just fine so I use the angled side
first for the waxy side to just fill in
any sparse areas and then you can go
over that with the brush side and the
powder to set it and help it last all
day and really keep the shape of your
brows on the lids I'm gonna use the
Milani eyeshadow primer this is going to
undo any discoloration first and then
I'm gonna go back to the balm Jovi
palette and I'm actually going to the
highlight the disco disco highlight this
is the same as mary lou manizer and I'm
gonna use the flat eyeshadow brush in
your mr. bunny travel kit and just dab
that shade all over the lids this has a
little bit of a golden tone to it it
just looks sunny and bright on the eyes
and really helps you look awake then I'm
gonna use the fluffy crease brush the
tapered blending brush and go into a
Legg row this is a perfect matte kind of
light to medium brown and just take that
lightly in the crease you don't have to
work too hard at it just blend it right
in there and then if you want a little
under the brow highlight go to Adagio
that's a really nice creamy shade that's
gonna look great under your brows and
give you a little highlight without
looking too sparkly if you're in a super
big hurry you may want to just skip the
eyeliner but we're gonna use it in this
look I'm using the brown liner and I'm
just gonna take that all across my upper
lash line super close to the lashes and
then I just kind of DAB over it with my
finger to keep the line looking nice and
soft then I'm gonna curl my lashes with
the elf eyelash curler and I'm gonna top
it off with the essence I love extreme
crazy volume mascara as soon as this
hits the lashes it really grabs them and
makes them
standing you can go with whatever color
you want on the lips since the eyes are
so natural I like a little extra color
on the lips so I'm using the Neutrogena
moisture smooth color stick in a bright
berry love it because it's so quick and
easy to apply it smells great and the
color is fantastic so there you go guys
that's my quick classy class makeup look
it's just a nice way to look finished
and do it quickly before you have to run
out the door make sure to stay tuned for
the next tutorial will be just a little
more advanced and a little more
attention to detail so thanks for
watching I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
