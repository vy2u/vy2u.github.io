number 2 in my makeup starter kit series
in case you're just tuning in or just
finding my channel I did a whole makeup
starter kit video recommending a bunch
of different products that I think work
really well together and could just be
used on their own to create a lot of
different looks and so I did my first
look I called it the classy class looks
so that was just a very quick easy grils
about it but it gets you out the door
looking good so that was my first
tutorial this one I'm calling it my
photo friendly look so think about this
for picture day or any big events where
maybe you might be photographed or maybe
you're just working on a new Instagram
picture I hope but I really think this
is workable for a lot of different ages
really going for more of a full coverage
look in this video using some foundation
a light smoky eye so we are getting a
little bit deeper but nothing too
terribly heavy a little bit of shine on
the lips I went with a lighter lip for
this video so to start off you've just
moisturized then we're going to take the
Colorstay whipped foundation and just
doubt that all over your face I kind of
patch it you know roughly where I want
it to go and then I'm taking the blush
brush in the Sigma kit and this might
seem strange but this actually the
synthetic brush works really well for
blending in the foundation it's called
the large angled contour f40 so I'm just
buffing that in although then I'm gonna
grab the covergirl plus ol a concealer
bomb stick this is going to add a little
coverage where I need more it's also
going to help brighten a little bit so
I'm using this under the eyes I'm using
it on any redness I might have that's
still showing through and I'm just using
the f60 foundation brush to blend that
in next up we're gonna set the look with
some powder i'm using the l'oreal true
match and i'm using the powder brush
that comes in the mr. bunny travel kit
this is the f30 dab into your product
and be very careful around those areas
where you have really done some
concealer or layering the concealer in
the foundation because you don't want to
just blend that away and we're going to
use our Revlon Photoready bronzer in
bronzed and chic and with this look you
may want to pay even more attention to
contour
a little bit because it will really I
think come off nicely in pictures we're
gonna give ourselves the instant look of
Health by taking some of this really
great peachy pink blush in the balm Jovi
palette it's called pop pop it's also
the same as the balms frat-boy blush and
just blend that in on the apples of your
cheeks and then for a little glow the
key word is little we're taking some of
this disco disco highlight the same as
mary lou manizer it can be very shimmery
so I'm just barely getting some on the
brush taking it on my cheekbones down
the nose and then a little bit on my
Cupid's bow area the eyes starting off
with brows getting a good framework
going here I'm using the elf Studio brow
kit and I'm using the angled side of the
brush in the wax the tinted wax to just
fill in any sparse areas then flip that
brush over and use the powder side of
the compact to set the brows taking my
Milani eyeshadow primer just apply that
all over your lid up through the crease
and under the brown using the flat
shadow brush we're gonna go into a shape
called REM in our bon jovi palette this
is a really pretty lavender with gold
shimmer
I think it has a really pretty sheen on
the eyes so once you get that all over
the lid and kind of into the crease a
little bit as well we're gonna go back
to the palette and we're going into the
deep matte plum called moderato and with
this we're taking the same brush and
we're just gonna Pat that dab it right
in the outer corner of your eye and you
can work it up into the crease a little
bit as well we're just setting the
framework for exactly where we want that
shade and we'll blend it out in a minute
meanwhile take your angled brush go back
to that dark plum and we're gonna define
the eye on the lower part by just lining
our lower lash line a bit we're gonna
soften out the lower lash line with the
blank 1982 shade this is a really pretty
dusty mauve color and we're just gonna
run that over the lower lash line going
right over the dark plum to soften it up
then using the crease brush first off
we're using it bare just to buff out the
moderato color going into the blink 1982
that pretty mom
we're gonna totally warm up the look and
make it look really professional really
nicely blended and just lightly blend
that shade right up over the border of
your dark purple and in the career
and it's just gonna have a pretty effect
even when your eyes are open for a nice
smooth looking highlight we're gonna go
to Adagio which is the cream shade in
the palette and you can use your fluffy
brush again and just lightly dust that
underneath your eyebrow I really want
the eyes to be nicely defined so for
liner we're going with the Milani eye
tech extreme this is in black this is a
very easy liner to get super close to
your lash lines and just take that all
the way across then we're gonna curl our
lashes with the elf eyelash curler and
I'm going to apply a couple of coats of
the essence I love extreme crazy volume
mascara to my top lashes and then just a
little bit on the bottom lashes just to
help them stand out a bit more but not
to make them too thick lips do whatever
you want I'm feeling kind of a nude lip
today so I did prep my lips with a
little lip balm that will really help
the lip liner glide on smoothly it's the
essence in the nude lip liner so just
fill in the lips with that going to
apply on top of that my Maybelline Color
sensational almond crush which gives a
really pretty shine I think anytime I do
a nude lip it looks better when there's
a bit of shine on so that's it for my
photo friendly look I hope you guys
enjoyed this again it was using only
products that were part of the makeup
starter kit and if you missed that video
