makeup starter kit tutorial series it
all started off with my ideas for
products that would be great for a
makeup starter kit by the way that
giveaway runs through August 31st it
wraps up August 31st at midnight and
then the following day September 1st is
when I will contact the winners there of
course spammers trying to jump in on
this and send people messages but really
just be careful and make sure in your
inbox if you win it'll be coming from
emily noel 83 spelled exactly like my
channel name is spell anyway just wanted
to clarify that i think it's ridiculous
that people try to spam giveaways and
confuse p but anyway what i wanted to do
with this series was take the starter
kit of things that i've recommended and
do three different looks using only
things in that kids look i think could
be great for anybody really i was
thinking of teachers though and just
working world professionals and
interview type look with this look i
want it to be good coverage i want to
make sure it's long wearing and can get
you through the day with little to no
touch-ups if you're on the job you know
you don't have a lot of time for that
also i want to remove any distractions
and that could be covering up some of
your problem areas so you can feel a
little more finished and clean and
polished on the face or that also can
mean not adding in too much stuff that's
going to really catch people's eye and
distract from maybe your message and
what you're saying it's definitely easy
to recreate so let's get started I'm
gonna use the Revlon Colorstay whipped
foundation and apply that all over my
face and then continue to blend it in
with my fingers actually I have other
plans for the angled brush that I used
for foundation in the last video so just
blend this out with your fingers make
sure you're really hitting your hairline
and your jaw and just blending down your
neck as well much like the last video
we're gonna bring in the covergirl plus
ol a concealer boom and just add that
around any problem areas like dark under
eyes redness spots pimples units then
I'm bringing in the flat foundation
brush to blend out that concealer it's
really soft very good for just blending
your concealer
enough but not totally removing product
from your face we're gonna set that with
the L'Oreal True Match pressed powder
and this is going to be an especially
important step if you want this makeup
look to last through a whole day without
touch-ups I think setting your
foundation with powder is always
important and I wanted a little more Sun
on my face today so I use the Revlon
Photoready bronzer and Bronston cheek
you can use that same powder but
especially with my hair pulled back in a
headband I really like to make sure I
bronze up my hairline a bit and also
just take it around my cheekbone then
we're gonna give the cheeks an added bit
of glow by going to the bottom of the
balms yo V palette where you will find
milli and Vanilli thumbs up if you know
what that is and these are lip cheek
colors there's a red and sort of a dusty
pink color I'm gonna go with the pink
and just dab my angled brush in there
this is a great brush for cream products
I'm really keeping staying power in mind
with this look so I say we go over that
with the pop pop blush that's the same
as the frat-boy blush just take a little
bit of that and top it off you're gonna
get an even better color intensity and
better whatever times when I know the
lips are gonna be a bit more vibrant I
do those before the eyes so I'm just
taking the Baby Lips in cherry me this
is a really pretty sheer yet somewhat
bright tinted lip balm and so I'm gonna
take that all over my lips and just
feels good on there today we're gonna
move on to eyes I'm taking the elf
eyebrow kit as usual and we're going to
use the angled brush side and the wax to
just start filling in the brows a bit
and then you can flip that over and use
the brush side with the powder to set
the brows after that take the Milani
eyeshadow primer get just a little bit
of that on your finger not too much and
blend that all over your lid through the
crease and up to the brow bone taking
the flat brush first we're going to go
into Adagio that's a great matte cream
shade and going to apply that over most
of our lid then using the same brush I'm
going into a Legg row so that's a matte
light to medium brown we're going to dab
that on the outer part of the lid and
then I like to flip that brush over and
just wedge that in the crease even
though this is a flat brush it's still
kind of thick so I think it does a good
job of getting color in your creases
with using that same brush again we're
going to go to Alice copper one of my
favorite shade
in this kit it's a gorgeous burgundy and
I'm gonna just dab that on the outer
corner of my eye and a little bit into
the crease as well I'm not pulling this
out into a big long outer V like I might
normally I'm just keeping it very
confined right around the eye area then
we want to just take our fluffy blending
brush and blend out the border of those
shades we've put in our crease in our
outer corner then I love using that
Adagio shade again the matte cream color
up under the brow as a highlight I think
it makes the edges of your deeper shades
seem really finished the eye
I'm taking an angle brush going back to
Alice copper and just using that for a
little light definition under the outer
part of our lower lash line there are so
many colors in this palette that can
work well as liners and this is one of
them you just apply it really light and
smudge and I'm gonna go across my upper
lash line with the Maybelline master
drama liner in Midnight Master this is
the black shade and a friend was
actually telling me the other day how
they struggle with pencil liners because
they feel like they don't get right in
with the lashes and there tends to be a
gap and so here's my tip for fixing that
take that angle brush go into any dark
shade in this palette i'm gonna use
presto that's the matte Brown and just
top off your liner and something about
using the powder it really gets in there
more and so I'm just going right over my
line then we're going to curl the
eyelashes using the elf eyelash curler
and I'm going to apply a couple coats of
the essence I love extreme crazy volume
mascara to my top lashes and just a
little dab on the lower lashes for some
definition then just something I thought
of it's totally optional but if you want
even more of a red lip or a red tone to
the lip you've got on go back to the
balm Jovi and the vanilla shade which is
a nice rich red and you can just dab
that right over your lips again these
are lip or cheek colors in the bottom of
that palette you can use them either way
that's it everyone I think this could be
a really workable look for a lot of
people but I was really keeping my
career women in mind thank you so much
for taking time to watch this series I'm
really thrilled that I got to do
something with just one kit of makeup
and showing several different ways of
how that kit can work for you so good
luck on the give
stay tuned I'll have announcements
coming out on that toward the end of the
month when the giveaway actually wraps
up on August 31st so thank you for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
