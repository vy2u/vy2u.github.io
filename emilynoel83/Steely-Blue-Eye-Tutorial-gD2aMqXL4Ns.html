be showing you basically how to do a
look on your eyes that is overall sort
of natural just using some white and
black really basic colored loose shadows
and then we're going to jazz it up a
little bit with some blue liner and kind
of a blue shadow that tops it off and
brings out the color a little bit so
it's a really fun look so I hope you'll
stick around and keep the first thing
I'm going to do is start out with a base
on my eyelid this is the NYX jumbo eye
shadow pencil in pots and pans it's just
a light silver shade so I'm just gonna
apply that all over my eyelid just give
my shadow something to hold on to and
that's especially important because I'm
using loose shadows today so now that
I've got that all over I'm kind of gonna
blot it a little bit with my finger just
to pick up any excess moisture that
might be on there because we don't want
to overly you know use creams we want to
use cream sparingly on our lids the next
thing I'm gonna do is take out my femme
Couture mineral effects eyeshadow and it
comes in a little container like this
and this shade is white cloud these are
available at Sally Beauty Supply by the
way I'm gonna use Milo Cornell 3/8
Maxine's mop brush and just get a little
of this on here this is a very very fine
loose shadow and it has just got a lot
of light shimmer so we're gonna have an
ultra shimmery lid when we get done with
this step and I'm just gonna Pat that
all over kind of using a patting motion
just to pack it on to the lid as opposed
to a back and forth back and forth so we
don't get tense next we're going to go
to the other end of the spectrum and use
our loose shadow in black jewel it's
another femme Couture shade and I'm
going to use my Sonia Kashuk medium
I shadow brush it's kind of a flat
shader brush style and just get some on
there nice and black and this we're
gonna have to be kind of careful with
I'm gonna first just kind of go toward
my crease here with it and just kind of
you know pack it along the crease and up
just like that so we're getting that
nice depth right in the crease and then
just kind of pushing it outward
something you want to be really careful
with when you're making any sort of
sweeping motion with a dark blue shadow
would be very careful but that's
basically what we're going for right
there and then just to blur out that
edge a little bit more I grab my Sephora
rounded crease brush and just go over
that just lightly and giving a really
light touch around the outside cuz now
that it's kind of packed on there you're
not gonna have this much opportunity for
fallout so I'm just gonna running that
along there just like that next shade
we're gonna use we're going through a
lot of products in this tutorial is
gonna be an elf mineral shadow and
glamorous it's a really pretty sparkling
mauve shade and I'm just gonna get my
brush in there tap off the excess since
it is pretty sparkly and use this just
to kind of warm up using a lot of like
you know deep sort of cool shades here
so I wanted to warm up this area and
kind of right up to the highlight area
if you use this really lightly it can
act as that but you could also pack this
on and it could be quite a bit deeper
color so keep keep in mind that's a
pretty versatile one right there if
you're looking for a nice kind of pinky
mineral shadow the elf one and glamorous
is good next I'm gonna use a new product
that I got from Walgreens it's the wet
and wild idolized
um it's like a jumbo shadow pencil it's
just like you know the the NYX ones
really and this shade is distressed it's
a nice sort of deep royal blue I
wouldn't quite call it Navy because it
does it does have a little bit more
brightness to it and basically what I'm
gonna do is just keep this kind of close
to my lash line and just draw a line of
this on top of my little shadow creation
there and if you can't don't if you feel
like this pencil is a bit bulky and you
don't can't get really close in here
that's okay because we're gonna go in
with some shadow that's gonna brighten
this blue up even more and then thing
goes for underneath just get a little
bit there but don't go don't get too
stressed out about it you know okay next
I'm gonna go for a really interesting
product I got from cherry culture calm a
while back it's the starry boutique
colors and it's a really interesting
range of shades you've got like several
like really fall shades and then some
cool colors and I'm going to use that
blue that's just really um really vivid
and pigmented I'm gonna use that to top
off this blue um
sort of shadow liner we've put on so I'm
just taking an angled brush and just
patting this shade on top and it's just
going to be even more luminous and and
pretty I think and with this kind of
brush very easy to just get get that
shade right there in the corner and so
this is just a pop of color that I think
makes you know just because we've gone
with kind of Gray's and in lighter
shades on the on the lid and now this
blue it's a little more wearable
sometimes in liner form
so I'm just dotting this all along
just like that next I'm gonna curl my
eyelashes for about 15 seconds then I'm
going to use another wet and wild
products recommended to me by one of my
viewers someone said this mega Volume
Mascara is pretty good that they have
and it does build up the volume pretty
fast I've noticed on the other eye when
I used it it's like a really um a really
thick brush here so as you can see I
mean just one touch of the wand and
you've pretty much got some thicker
lashes so I like that about so there you
go guys that's my sort of steely blue
look for the day just a hint of color on
your liner can really make your makeup a
little bit more fun especially when
you're going with neutral or gray kind
of shades on your lids so I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and also on my
lips is the Revlon lip glide shear and
sheerly raspberry these can be found at
Big Lots right now so thanks guys so
much for watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
