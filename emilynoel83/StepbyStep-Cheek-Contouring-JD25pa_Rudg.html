through a quick tutorial on some
bronzing and contouring steps that you
can take to really sculpt your face and
not only slim it down but kind of bring
new life to end and new attention to
certain areas of your face so um right
now I have foundation on I just applied
my everyday minerals foundation and I
used a little concealer around my eyes
but I am going to go ahead and first do
like a quick wash of bronzer all over
and this is mainly more of a just color
enhancing step than a contouring step
I'm going to use my Milani powder
bronzer in light and I'm just going to
use my fluffy kabuki brush this one's by
upstage and I found it at my local big
lots um but I'm just going to focus this
mainly on areas where the Sun might
naturally hit this is not a shimmery
bronzer and I would not recommend a
shimmery bronzer for the step because
basically all we're doing here is just
trying to kick up you know our skin tone
a little bit we're not really paying
attention to certain areas just kind of
where would the Sun hit your skin you're
talking about your forehead that your
nose your chin and on top of your cheeks
and then just a light dusting everywhere
else okay so now that you've done that
step and you've kind of upped your the
glow of your skin a little bit you want
to pay special attention to where we
want to contour and you can definitely
contour with just powder products but if
you really want to kind of kick it up
that extra notch and I would go with
using a cream product and then going
over it with a powder one that I like
this is a product from Sonia Kashuk it's
a brand available at Target and she has
this golden cream bronzer duel and this
is the golden cream bronzer this is a
blush but we're going to use this
bronzer here and you can use a sponge
you could also use your finger what I
like to do is kind of apply it with my
finger and then use a sponge to blend it
out but I'm going to get some of that
golden cream bronzer there and I'm going
to streak it right under you know right
in this area where it's
just under my cheekbone then I'm going
to take a little sponge basically just
blend that out and you to where it's
like it's deep in the color but you
can't tell an exact start and end to
that line that i just put there now that
i blended out this blends so easily this
product so i love that it's not a real
thick cream but it's enough to where as
you can see you can create some
definition here so i've got some on my
finger sweeping it down and kind of suck
your cheeks in and see right where that
area is that you want to focus on and
then i'm just taking a little sponge and
blending it out you could continue to
blend with your finger but i think the
sponge somehow helps you from over
blending and applying too much pressure
so just checking my other mirror here
once you feel like you've gotten that
blended enough you can also think about
contouring other areas of the face you
can obviously you know slim your nose
down a little bit i don't really usually
mess with too much of that but you can
do things to your chin your nose your
temples here we have another place if
you really wanted that heavy duty
contouring but i'm going to mainly focus
on the cheeks here then you want to use
a blush or a bronzer a something in a
deep enough tone to where you can kind
of go over that and it will really help
that contour stand out one that i always
like to use and i've recommended at
countless times is the golden
pink-cheeked irse blush by covergirl
this is just the perfect contouring
blush shape for me and so I just grabbed
my blush brush mines from Revlon get
some of the product on there and
basically we're going right over what we
just did there if you wanted to keep a
dewy look you might want to you know not
even do this because that goal that
cream does give you a more dewy finish
but basically you can see what we're
doing here just adding that added
definition right here to our cheeks
really can be a measure that Slim's the
face a little bit there you can
the change okay and then I'm going to do
the same thing on the other side
and I kind of like to go you know back
and forth back and forth over it and
then sort of some circular motions below
and above that point to really blur the
line okay I do this daily this is a
daily step for me when I'm doing my
makeup for the news so you know you can
get a little bit on your cheeks or
whatever or and you know a splash of
that color all over this is kind of like
it's a borderline bronzer but it's still
kind of a blush because it has that same
warmth and it's got a nice intensity
there as well then it's a you know a
final step for your blush i would go
ahead and take a pinky or peachy shade
and kate in this case i found one that's
a real combination here it's the Milani
minerals flush in my time one of the
prettiest shades one of the most asked
about shades whenever i have this on i
usually have somebody asked me what
blush are you wearing i love this color
so much and i'm not really applying it
right here because you that the closer
you get to your nose with pinky colors i
can find it can make my nose look like
i've got like redness around it like
maybe an acne related redness or
something like that and we don't want to
get you know suggest that with our blood
so i'm going more on right on the side
here just a little bit just a little
touch of this a little bit kind of goes
a long way with this product and then
the final step if you really wanted to
do this full base and like i said this
is not necessarily for for everyone this
may not be an everyday thing that you
want to do but just something now and
then maybe you've got gonna get pictures
taken or something like that and you
really want your face to look it's best
um i would recommend taking a
highlighter you could do the cream step
again you could put down a cream
highlighter but i find for me what works
really well just take a powder I like
the Physicians Formula shimmer strips
this is Waikiki strip it's the peachy
glow bronzer and I focus in toward you
can see there's a whole range of color I
focus in toward the top when I want to
use this as a highlighter and just get a
little bit there on my brush and we're
going on top of the cheekbone here okay
and kind of right in here okay we're
going to bring that light to sort of the
center of our face and and make the
light hit on top of this cheekbone then
we got the contour underneath it's going
to really make our cheeks stand out and
look pretty and then you can of course
put this all over your face but just
don't go overboard because like I said
it is shimmery and you don't always want
you know your whole face to look good
eventually shiny by the end of the day
but anyway guys I hope this helped you
for those who are looking for some tips
on contouring and bronzing and that kind
of thing this is just how you can take
some products you might have and combine
them in such a way that you will get a
nicely contoured look for your cheeks so
I hope you enjoyed this video everyone
and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
