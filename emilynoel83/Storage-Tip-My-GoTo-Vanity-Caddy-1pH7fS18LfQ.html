refused central on my channel lately
between the Emily Awards and then the
fails video I've just been doing a lot
of like little product related things
and I wanted to take a short break from
that with this video and talk about a
cute little storage solution in my
makeup area I actually keep it and
here's my makeup mirror obviously right
over here on the side it's actually one
of those really inexpensive like acrylic
lipstick holders that I got from TJ Maxx
and at first I was like I'm gonna put my
go-to lipsticks in here but then I
slowly started realizing I was using
this little thing for all of these other
random like Beauty trinket little things
that don't really have a space elsewhere
in my makeup collection and several of
these things I have a real tendency to
lose because they just don't have a
clear storage space I think my mom used
to say a place for everything and
everything in its place or I don't know
maybe a lot of people think and that's
really what this amounts to each a
little product has its own slot and I've
just found it extremely useful and I
reach for these things all the time and
I always know where they are now
extremely inexpensive maybe two three
bucks at t.j.maxx and I've had mine for
several months now and I feel like my
t.j.maxx is just crawling every time I
go back to the store they're crawling
with these different clear makeup
storage things so if you're in need of
some things whether it's like this or
little drawers and stuff I've just
noticed a whole lot of that cropping up
lately but for right now if you're
curious I'll just show you the things
that I do keep in this little guy so
this actually lives just down to the
left of my mirror but the Lighting's
kind of better here easier to show you
what's inside so nine little
compartments here the things I keep in
it this NYX be gone lip color remover
that can come in handy when I've got
stubborn lip products that i'm swatching
back to back to back i actually do use
that quite a bit I've recently used up a
clean and clear person gel which has
been for a long time like my spot
treatment for blemishes but I was
recently sent this boo boo zap the boo
boo is that for benefit and I thought
I'm gonna use that and try out something
new for a while if I have any zips crop
up or any boo-boos that
to be zapped let's call them that if
this is my glossy a balm calm it says
Universal skin salve it is kind of like
a I don't know a thicker more potent
vaseline type product I guess and if
after I moisturize I see any places on
my skin where I'm still like stubbornly
dry or sometimes around the inner parts
of my eyes I can still feel really dry
for whatever reason there so I'll just
dab a little bit of this it only takes a
tiny bit that's just a handy product to
keep in there I just keep my tweezers
sort of right there so I won't lose them
elf lip exfoliator if you're wearing
matte lipsticks and you're not using one
of these on a regular basis you need to
be doing it's been used a lot and it's
looking a little rough but it really it
should be rough because it's gonna
exfoliate your lips then you need that
here's an opportunity to follow up on
this lip cheek product that my sister
gotten me for Christmas she thought it
might have fun trying this out it's a
lip sealer lip product sealer so it
really has a pungent smell kind of
smells like paint or nail polish remover
or maybe some combination of the two you
blot your lip product right after you
apply it and then you sweep some of this
on your lips and I haven't had the best
results with it so far I've tried it
with a lot of different lip products and
all around I don't feel like I'm getting
much extended wear out of them but I
think what I'm going to start watching
for now is just whether or not it keeps
things from bleeding outside the lip
line because that may be a more
realistic goal for this product but I've
had so many different kinds of lip
products to test it out with I don't
want to give a definitive yes it works
no it doesn't because I just don't think
I put it to use enough but one downside
yes as a very strong scent and also
leaves kind of a bitter taste on the
lips
I keep a go-to lip balm in here right
now it is the Nivea kiss of olive oil
and lemon my lash glue the Revlon
precision lash adhesive used it all the
time love it but it can be easily
misplaced and yep right here that's what
you think it is it is the perfect space
to hold one of these itty-bitty me
beauty blenders and I tweeted recently
that I kind of love this thing a lot on
concealer and I'll also just kind of
mist it later in the
if I want to refresh my under-eye area
if I feel like things are looking dry
this is a great way to do that and it's
looking dirty because I just used it
it's a little plumped up still from the
moisture but something like this it's
kind of open to the air is a great place
to put a damp Beauty Blender because you
know it's able to dry out and not get
all gross in a drawer somewhere but
seriously this thing is so soft and so
spongy and I just love the little
innermost corners it can reach I haven't
quite decided on a name for him yet but
someone did suggest Kermit and yes that
does seem very appropriate in this last
little section here I've just put
perfume samples that I'm using right now
I mean we get so many of these samples
if you're placing orders on Ulta or
Sephora you get them you want to use
them but like where do they go and you
always have more than one use right so
where the heck are you putting your
perfume samples that you're using stick
them in here I've got four in here I
could probably fit five and I think
that's just the perfect place for them
so thank you for watching I hope this
was a little bit helpful I'm just
finding a place for those little items
that don't really have a clear cut you
know storage space in my collection
things I tend to lose or misplace a lot
now they have a home and speaking of
items that have a home I do want to
mention this great little thing that
Kristen gained found for me she like I
think the moment she found it in the
store she texted me and she's like I
think this belongs in your makeup room
I'm like I think you're right the cutest
little like stationery or letter
organizer and I've talked in the past
about how these can be great things for
pallet organization and right now I have
14 pallets packed into this thing they
are pallets that like I want to make
sure to use or things that I hadn't been
using that I want to use more of and now
it's on the corner of my desk I see it
every day that I sit down to do my
makeup and I absolutely love that so
Kristen so thoughtful so adorable for
this room in particular so thank you for
that and thank you all again for
watching I hope you're having a
wonderful day and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
