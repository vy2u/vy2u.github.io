this video this is my second actually of
two storage related videos i went to the
container store recently my first
experience at a container store and I
was absolutely stunned at how many
things were there and plus there were
lots of things that could lend
themselves to being good makeup storage
items so I got one that I showed you
about mascara storage and sort of
reviewed my mascaras along the way but
this next one I have works really well
for me right now for my mac eyeshadows
because right now I have 12 and so this
is good to store all of them but if you
had more than this it would be a good
like partial storage option and you'll
see why that will work in a minute or if
you have just other small single
eyeshadows of other brands I'm trying to
think of other brains that I have like
maybe Milani or nicks or just any
smaller package eyeshadow that's just
you know not quite so big around I think
this would really work great for you so
I'll stop talking here and get out my
little new storage device and show all
right guys here it is you can see it's
kind of a little bit of a tower and it
has one two three four different
compartments in it this was 999 at the
container store and you may have seen
other people use this before but
basically this has kind of a little post
running down the side and it allows you
to kind of pop these little levels out
like that basically so you can easily
get into whatever you need but then when
you want to close it up again sorry it's
hard to do it all with one hand but when
you want to close it up it all real
lines basically and you can you know
keep it all connected there so what i've
done here is i've divided up my mac
eyeshadows into groups of three that
works for me because i have 12 and you
know if you've got three and four
different slots and that case takes care
of everything but the reason why i think
this could work for anyone who has
individual I shadows is that I've
divided them up into certain looks okay
certain groupings that I like to wear
together so when I'm getting ready in
the morning I'm trying to do things
really quick and it's just like
uh you know I don't want to sort through
everything if I could just grab three
shadows that I really like you know I'll
be good you might say well Emily why
don't you just put those all in a
palette well I go to work every day with
makeup bag and I don't necessarily like
to take palates with me it's easier for
me to grab a few of these throw them in
and then I don't have to worry about you
know taking a pallet and dropping it or
breaking things you know unnecessarily
and you know doing all that when I can
just grab a few so that's why I do what
I do right now and I don't even have a
lot anyway so anyway what I've got in
here I have max boo what shade is this
Angus blackberry and I've got um so I'm
still learning these are my new ones
Beauty marked blackberry and shroom for
example or three that I like wearing
together so that is one look and then I
just rotated out and then I you know
have those in there these next few that
I have down below that kind of make a
neutral look I've got wood winked and
satin taupe and embark and then I've got
yet another one you just swirling around
I've got naked lunch I've got tracks and
sketch for another sort of a plumbing
look and then three great smoky shades
down on the bottom here I've got night
divine carbon and cranberry so basically
what I'm able to do is easily grab for
looks that I have created and want to
use again and you could put as you can
fit as many as five in one section so
I'll go ahead and grab a few out here
just to demonstrate that so there's five
max shadows and then you've got three
four five to you know however you you
most like to wear them is a great way to
divide them up if you had way more
shadows than this you wouldn't have to
keep everything in here but it's kind of
a neat way to just know okay that's
something that works for me especially
when you're in a hurry and then you know
as you try out different looks it can
change and and you know you can use
different ways but it looks cute you can
totally see everything you have and like
I said once you're done it closes up
into its nice little cylinder there and
yeah I've just been enjoying it a lot so
I hope you got something out of this
video I know I hope you enjoy the
container store like I do and let me
know I mean like I said that was the
first time I went so if there's anything
cool that I need to check out let me
know have a great day guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
