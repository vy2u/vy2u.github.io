another one of my holiday I tutorials
this one is sugar plum eyes so it's
using purples and pinks and some colors
from our 88 share our palette which I
know many of you love and enjoy that
palette so get those out and otherwise
you can use other shades that sort of
are similar you can definitely get this
look in a lot of different ways but my
suggested products will give you kind of
a semi metallic look kind of fading from
purple to pink so if you want to see how
it all comes together keep 11 apply your
favorite primer to your eyelid I use two
faced shadow insurance and then we're
going to be using a old gel liner
basically as a shadow all over I and
around our eyes some of these gel liners
come in such pretty colors these days I
think it's fun to use them sort of as a
base color for your entire look so this
one comes from be luscious and the shade
is tanzanite and it's a really really
pretty very deep plum that has a little
bit of a metallic edge to it so what I'm
going to do first is actually just go on
all over my eyelid with this i'm using
sort of a flat smallish brush from
coastal since this may have been a small
concealer brush actually but it works
perfect for packing on creamy shades
like this so just build some up there on
your brush and then take this all over
your eyelid and basically it's just like
your painting it on there once you've
got it all over your eyelid you're going
to take a little bit more on your brush
and actually get it coming up into your
crease just a little bit so just kind of
think you know you're going to go into
your crease and up just slightly and
what's nice about this is a very long
wearing shade and are they a long
wearing product it reminds me a lot of
the Coastal Scents gel liners so you're
not going to have really an issue with
staying power I don't think and let I
think a primer is very important though
to wear end
neath so as you can see you know I'm
just kind of shaping this out going up
and around just slightly on top of my
crease just slight almost up to the brow
bone and just smudge it right out if you
use your finger to blend it actually
gets kind of the best blend on it that
you're not going to be able to get with
that brush so once you're finished with
that we're going to go underneath the
eye use any liner brush that you like
I'm going for a little bit thicker line
so I'm using this brush from coastal
scents and it is just like compared to
the size of the one I just used you can
see it's about half the size and I'm
just going to take that and go
underneath my eye with this liner as I
come out here to the outer edge I'm just
deepening it up a little bit kind of
trying to build I wouldn't really call
it an outer V but just kind of building
the color up around the outer part of
the eye next here's where our 88 shimmer
palette comes in we're going to be using
a couple of shades on this in the purple
column here there's a pretty purple
shade right here and then sort of a plum
colored shade which actually has more
pink in it than it's coming off on
camera right above it so those two we're
going to be working with here take that
purple shade at the bottom it's one of
the most intense Purple's in the palette
get just a little bit on a brush and you
know any brush will do I don't really
recommend packing this on but just kind
of get that all over your lid and you're
going to see a more purpley sheen come
through on your shadow you can also use
that on your lower lashline i'm using my
smashbox smudge brush right here just to
kind of add some more purple to another
wise very dark plum liner just like some
then we're going to go to that shade
just up above it that I said had a
little more pink to it i'm using my like
a fluffier crease brush this is my
smashbox rounded or pets
we rounded crease brush get a little bit
of that shade on there and see how we've
got this sort of pinkish halo around the
look we're going to do that on this side
too very easy suddenly you have a nice
pretty pink glow around this look and
then at the very top of the pink row in
this palette let's see here's the purple
row we were dealing with this row on the
pink go all the way to the top and we're
using this very light pink shade as a
highlight for this look so just get a
little bit again on that same brush and
just use that right up under your brow
bone it just creates a really nice fade
up from that dark purple to the pink to
a very very light pink now we do want to
kind of add a little bit of depth to
this look in a couple of areas because
it's very dark and we've been using a
lot of shimmer on top of it and a matte
shade is going to give it some more
dimensions so I'm using Mac's carbon
which is just a matte black shade and a
small my fine crease brush from an
essence of beauty available at CVS and
just take a little bit of that black
there and what I'm doing I'm not doing
an outer V I'm not like realigning this
look or anything like that but I am just
putting a little bit of darkness right
here kind of going just under the eye
and just around this outer corner just
to deepen it up slightly and to get an
even darker look if you like it just a
little darker on your liner you can take
your liner brush into that mat carbon
and just kind of go under here and you
could smudge it out later if you wanted
it to be kind of like this this thicker
kind of undefined line but it's fun to
kind of play with a colorful shade and
use use dark shades on top of it and see
how it kind of transforms the final step
in this look is just to curl your lashes
I'm going to use my lash blast lengths
mascara on the upper and lower lashes
and then I'll join you with the finished
look
alright guys the look is complete I hope
you enjoy this look kind of a fun twist
on a holiday look without necessarily
using reds greens gold silver and those
traditional colors you might think about
I had fun with this look and I like
pairing it with a little bit deeper lip
I think it makes it look a little more
glamorous and dressed up and to get this
look what I basically did was I went all
over my lips with this ultra last lip
we're from NYC in garnet it's a really
nice plum shade and I just went all over
with that has kind of a metallic edge to
it and then I defined you know some
areas a little bit better with the
Jordana liner and plush plum I really
love the jordana lipliner because
there's such a variety in color and
they're just really creamy they go on
really nicely um I also yeah just went
ahead and did the mascara on the upper
and lower lash line and didn't really
worry about doing false lashes with this
look I kind of like to let the colors
show through this pretty plum to pink
thing we've got going on so thank you
guys so much for tuning in for this
sugar plum tutorial and thanks for
watching have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
