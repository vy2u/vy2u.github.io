tutorial yes those words came out of my
mouth quick and tutorial on and I look
that I'm really loving it's using a
couple of wet and wild palates the one
in I'm getting sunburned and the one in
walking on eggshells I actually
Instagram a picture of this look a
couple weeks ago and I got tons of
tutorial requests and I was really glad
because I loved the look and I think
it's fun and easy inexpensive all the
eye products yeah all the eye products
I'm using your drugstore I'm starting
out by taking my one dollar elf eyelid
primer and just putting that all over
the lid then i'm taking my wet and wild
trio in i'm getting sunburned and we're
going to this metallic gold shade and a
flat eyeshadow brush and i'm just gonna
dab that all over my eyelid
then I'm going to the walking on
eggshells palette and I'm going to take
this top brow bone shade and just get a
little bit of that on the brush I've
cleaned the brush off a little bit and
I'm just dabbing that around my inner
corner to brighten that up then using a
fluffy brush I'm going to go to the
brown in this palette and this brown
while it's not you know entirely matte
it's definitely not as shimmery as the
gold shade is going from the inner to
outer part of my crease and you can just
build it up as much as you're
comfortable with depending on the amount
of space you have there between your eye
and your eyebrows I'm just taking a bear
brush and I'm gonna buff out the edge of
that go back to the white shade and just
a little bit of that will be our
highlight under the brow next we're
gonna focus on the lower lash line and
you don't have to use a sort of face
type liner like I'm going to but I do
think it helps a little bit with the
staying power but the color wise I think
the color seems to turn out kind of the
same whatever you do whether you use
this or not the NYX slide on liner in
pinks way you take this just all the way
under the lower lash line then I'm using
this smudge brush and going to this kind
of pinky purpley light metallic frosty
shade here in the wet and wild I'm
getting sunburned trio and I'm just
going to dab that right over the top of
the NYX liner I think kind of pulls the
whole look together it's taking this
deepest brown shade and I worked it kind
of into the outer corner and down and
around just a little bit down there and
I feel like it just kind of takes your
top and your bottom lid which are two
totally different colors and kind of
brings it all together so I'm taking my
flat brush again and just getting a
little bit of that ground a little bit
goes a long way here so be careful just
gonna dab this right here on the outer
part of my lid what most of my lid to
really show off the goal just on the
outside I'm using this dark grey
and bring in a blending brush or a
little bit more of the soft brown from
the walking on eggshells palette if you
want to make sure you get that blended
nicely and with my smudger brush I'm
going into the dark brown connecting
with the deep brown there and just bring
it down and overlapping a little bit of
the light pinky shade stuff I'm gonna
line my upper lash line I'm using my
Milani color play felt tip pen in black
line and I'm lining my waterline with my
Maybelline master drama pencil and
midnight master next up I'm just gonna
curl my lashes and apply some covergirl
clump crusher in the water-resistant cuz
it's really hot and humid out right now
but I'm gonna apply that to the upper
and lower lashes
now feel free to stop there but I am
actually trying out some new lashes I
got it from the dollar store Dollar
General Broadway lashes in flirty these
were a buck fifty and you actually will
be seeing a new dollar store Beauty
adventure video coming really soon where
I used a different pair of these but I
just really wanted to see how this other
set worked out and those lashes give me
a little more length but overall they're
pretty natural and pretty good quality
for about 50 that's for some key
products on the rest of the face i'm
using my wet and wild bronzer in bikini
contests not maybe 100 percent matte but
i do really like the tone of it and i
just use that kind of a little bit as a
contour and just dust it around the
thing also use my frat-boy
blush from the balm i love this color I
think just works with anything and then
for a little bit of added glow kind of
on the cheekbones
I used this benefit Sunbeam like to
highlight with a little bit of golden
glow so I applied that with my ELF small
stipple brush and did it mainly right in
here my lips I'm using my NYX lip liner
in beige so this is just a really good
neutral on top of that I used my L'Oreal
lip gloss in nude illusion and I really
like these glosses I like the way they
feel and you know it's a lot of my
natural lip color I feel like showing
through but this still gives me a little
bit of golden shine you so much for
taking time to watch and for updates and
pictures here and there make sure to
