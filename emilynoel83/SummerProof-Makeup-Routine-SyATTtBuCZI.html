this video um this is kind of based on
the request of a lot of people asking
what can I do how can i change my makeup
routine to make it more wearable for
summer basically we all know when you
get outside in the summertime or maybe
you just live in a climate that is
warmer year-round you're dealing with
more heat more humidity things that
basically all want to just tear down
your makeup so throughout this video I'm
going to take you step by step from the
face to the eyes to the lips talking
about some slight changes you can make
to your makeup routine to still look
really fresh and glowy but not overdone
and basically I'll try to give you your
best shot at a long wearing makeup look
for the summer months keep in mind i'm
not claiming that you can like you know
go spend a day under water and this all
comes out looking just like this but if
you thinking this is more for someone
who is going to just be spending a lot
of time outdoors or works outdoors and
just once that's the last as long as
possible if i knew i was going to be
outside swimming i probably would just
you know go nothing on I makeup wise and
maybe a little lip gloss and some tinted
moisturizer so this is a few more steps
for those who really do want a face of
makeup for the day but just want it to
last a long time so no more talk let's
go ahead and get into the tutorial
alright step one I would recommend using
a tinted moisturizer or something that's
lightweight that's not going to go on
very thick on your skin because while
you might think okay I want my makeup to
last a long time I'm just going to wear
more actually a thinner layer is going
to hold up better on your skin and be
less visible I guess if anything any
melting happens throughout the day now
you could mix with your tinted
moisturizer you can mix in a foundation
to give you a little more coverage I'm
just going to use my tinted moisturizer
as is this is the cover girl smoothers
it's SPF 15 its oil free and my shade is
light to medium so I'm just going to get
a little bit of that out here and just
start blending that in with my fingers
next I would say go ahead and use some
concealer on the areas where you need it
for me that's around my eye area and a
little bit around my nose today I'm
using my Bobby Brown creamy concealer
kit my shade is natural so I'm just
going to dot that around my under eye
area and you know if you want to make it
as quick as possible and really help
this kind of melt in with your skin just
go ahead and use your finger next go
ahead and apply a powder to any areas
where you tend to get oily so you don't
have to do this all over your face but
just kind of for me it's going to be my
t-zone area so i'm using maybelline
dream matte powder my shade is maybe
medium to dash two and a half beige and
so there's what it looks like they're so
i'm just going to take a brush with that
and just give myself some really light
coverage over those areas where i tend
to get a little oily and for being on
the go i would go ahead and take a
powder with me but also some oil
blotting tissues and you know that'll
help you kind of going under my eyes a
little bit to set a concealer as well
the taking those oil blind tissues you
know sometimes you can just do that to
get rid of your oil and it's kind of
gross when you have oily or sweaty skin
and then you just plop powder on top of
it so yeah that's a good tip for
on-the-go next you want to give your
skin that little bit of glow if you're
going to be outside you know you want to
kind of have that sunkissed look I'm
using a bronzer that has a slight bit of
shimmer to it but it's not going to make
you look like you got a really sparkly
face it's the Rimmel natural bronzer in
Sundance um sunlight is the one that
tends to be more matte more like NYC
sunny this one has a little bit of a
sheen to it but it's really pretty on so
I'm just going to take a fluffy brush
and just kind of lightly dust this on
the forehead think about the area it's
not so much contouring but like the
areas where the Sun would naturally hit
you and that's where this is going to
look the most natural so I'm kind of
going on the cheeks and kind of just
blend it down with the bronzer that's
really this light you can just kind of
do an all
for dusting and really will give you
that glowy since we're sticking with
this glow I'm going to go with a cream
blush I really like the NYC blush uble
cream sticks and the one I'm using is
pink flash which actually kind of
reminds me of a somewhat bright coral
shade actually so I'm diskin it the way
I do these I just get a little bit on my
finger and then smile and get this on
the outer part of the apple of your
cheeks so not in here you get close to
your nose you get that look of redness
nobody wants that so kind of go right
out here so that's where I'm going to
kind of put that and just start blending
lightly in circular motions and before
you know it that blush is going to be
all blended in I'm going to go back for
a little bit more now this last step for
the face is totally optional but if you
want an even longer wearing a look with
the cheeks their top off the cream blush
with a somewhat luminous powder blush so
you're still going to get that glowy
look but it is going to last you a
little longer lately i've been using a
whole lot I've been really using this
elf contouring blush and bronzer duo
this is part of the studio line and been
starting to use this blush more and more
why do people say it's a dupe for NARS
orgasm and it just has that hint of
sparkle I'm going to grab a blush brush
here and so just get a little bit on
there and kind of go right over what you
just did and you're just going to get
even more of a glow and it's going to
last you long alright guys the eye look
is super super easy and quick I'm going
to take my palladio herbal I shadow
primer that's available at sally beauty
supply and honestly works for me just as
well as the Too Faced shadow insurance
so I'm just applying that all over my
lid um anything you can do like this to
extend the wear of your eyeshadow i mean
that's going to really help even in hot
weather to just kind of put that layer
down there so go ahead and do that and
then i'm going to take a really light
eyeshadow trio i think if you get in
with lots of dark shades you're going to
be much more prone to notice creasing
because if you're sweating I mean I'm
think
about just different scenarios i've been
in and then i've looked at my make up
later and thought oh my gosh if I only
would have known it was gonna be like
this I wouldn't have worn any dark
eyeshadow because even if even if you've
got some long wearing primer on that
dark shadow is going to show signs of
wear more than a light look is so that
is why I am using this little trio from
physicians formula it's in baked
gingersnap and what you get is a it's I
think showing up a little more saturated
on camera than it really is but you got
like a dark brown a medium brown and a
light pink so I'm going to take my Sigma
SS 239 brush and I'm going to get it
right here on the pink so kind of loaded
up there and apply that all over the lid
and you're going to see a nice you know
light shimmery Sheen there but it's not
it's more like pearly it's not too
over-the-top shimmery and then go ahead
and just get a little bit of that same
shade up under the brow while we're at
it just for a light highlight here okay
I told you this was easy now flip your
brush over use the side you weren't
using for the pink and get some of the
deeper brown on there it's really not
that dark and wedge that right in your
crease and just kind of like your you're
just sticking the color in there got it
there take a fluffier brush like the 224
and blend it out you've got a really
really super soft shadow look next for
your liner you want to use just a small
amount of liner and really don't extend
it or go too overboard with winged
outlooks and like that just use what you
feel like you need to define your eye
area any sort of waterproof or long
wearing cream liner will be great and
one that I really like that I find is
super long wearing is the jet-set
waterproof eyeliner from Smashbox i'm
using a navy shade because i think it
really helps brown eyes pop even more
and the shade is midnight blue it just
shows up very dark and for as little as
we're using your on
not even going to notice the blue that
much but it's just a good way to define
your eyes I'm going to use the SS 266
which is a liner angled liner brush get
a little bit of that cream on there look
down and kind of start blending that
just on to the outer part here don't go
overboard with thickness engine and what
I kind of do is start on the outside and
then as you get less and less on your
brush you start working it towards the
inside and you just get that nice little
fade I'm not really weighing that out at
all and then I'll also take the leftover
and go just on the outer part of the
lower lash line as well and allow that
to be a little more smudged you have a
very small window of time to smudge this
before it does get to the point where
it's not going to smudge it now go ahead
and give your eyelashes a curl i'm using
my ELF eyelash curler it's my favorite
next grab your favorite long wearing
mascara I say long wearing because not
everyone likes waterproof including
myself so I like to use if I know I'm
going to be in a situation where um you
know my may be sweating or my makeup may
start to run and do things I don't want
it to do I like to use a good smudge
proof mascara I find that lash blast is
really good about being smudge proof and
also the XXL pro 24-hour bold from
Maybelline is really good and it also
gives your lashes I really boldly and
apply that before that gets dry use the
second step which is a little bit bigger
brush but this is supposed to kind of
lock in the mascara just go ahead and
don't put any mascara on the lower
lashes because regardless of what you do
I think you're just asking for under-eye
smudges with that so just lessen the
chance of it all together by keeping
that off of your lower lash line now for
the lips I would recommend some kind of
a lip balm that has SPF um just go ahead
and keep that with you throughout the
day because it's surprising how your
lips can burn and really start to feel
the effects of the Sun and then you get
this dryness and it's just not a fun
thing to deal with on your lips so the
EOS SPF 15 lip balm in lemon drop oh my
gosh
so my review on these you know how much
I love it but if you put that on this
actually has kind of a glove glossiness
to it just a little bit so i think my
lips look good just with that on there
alone plus it's got the SPF but i just
for this look I kind of threw on a coral
toned lip gloss so inexpensive and so
good the Jordana pretty shine lipgloss
in delightful you can see it's a pretty
kind of orange coral there comes off
like this on the lips and I love it so
um I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
of my quote summer proof makeup I mean I
think we all need to be realistic when
we think about going out in the water
you know this stuff is it going to
necessarily last through all that but if
you're gonna if you work outside if you
have an event outside for going to an
outdoor wedding or you know whatever the
case may be I think that makeup that is
lighter and you know just kind of
eliminates as much dark product on your
face as possible is really going to hold
up a lot better than maybe your typical
makeup looks so I hope you guys enjoyed
this thanks so much for taking the time
to watch and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
