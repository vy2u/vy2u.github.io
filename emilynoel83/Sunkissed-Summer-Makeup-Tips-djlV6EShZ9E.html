one to show you some summer beauty tips
because I know it's getting warmer
outside and you're probably spending
more time outside and you kind of have
to start adapting some of your makeup
that you've been wearing throughout the
year to make it more summer summer or
five before you you know so whether
that's your moisturizer or your
foundation I know I around year-round
use usually a tinted moisturizer I use
Neutrogena oil-free moisture sheer tint
or I sometimes use Olay complete
moisturizer but when it gets to be
summertime sometimes instead of even
putting a foundation over the top of
that you can darken up either your
original tinted moisturizer or just a
regular moisturizer with some different
gel products that will deepen the color
one of those is gel bronze from Bonnie
Bell and this is really cheap I think
it's only a few dollars and its sheer
translucent color it's oil-free this
color I have is called golden tan and if
you see see how it just kind of blends
to be the sheer wash of color you know
like you can blend it in and totally and
it's just really a light sheer tan color
but you mix that in with your with
whatever moisturizer you're using and it
gives you a nice deeper summery glow and
there's a new thing out that's really
really new I just saw it like last week
at Walgreens
it's the maybelline mineral power
natural bronzing liquid veil and this is
like a stain it says it's for face and
body and it says it's transfer proof but
it washes off so this is not a sunless
tanner but this is it's like a stain
basically it says to wash your hands
after you use it because it really will
like stay on your hands you know like
and
you can obviously wash it off but if you
didn't wash your hand she would have it
on your hands okay so this is just it's
about the same color as this you know
it's really concentrated and deep and it
comes in this nice big tube and at first
I wasn't quite sure how to use it
because they didn't really explain like
a certain way that it's designed to be
used so I had just like dotted it over
my face after I put my moisturizer on I
thought hey wouldn't even be easier to
just um squirt a little bit of this in
with my moisturizer and then you get
this nice rond look and plus this is
since it's like a stainless transfer
proof and that really does stay on and
another thing you can do which I've
tried this as well is take like whatever
foundation you're using if it might be a
little light for you like say this
Revlon Colorstay that I have add a
little bit of this or this in with it
and it just gives it I mean just as I
mean you can make sure like the that you
might use a little more of this a little
less of this or the other way around
depending on how dark you want it to be
but it just makes keeps your makeup
usable year-round and so I just wanted
to share that little tip with you just
these couple of products that I found
I'm sure other brands may have something
that does a similar function but I
really was impressed with the mineral
power bronzing veil stuff because it is
like a cheek stain only you can use it
all over your body like you could mix
this in with your body lotion and have
kind of a you know I can look all over
or you know on your neck that whole area
as well so just a tip you can on that
one other thing though that you can do
is like let's say you've got just this
plain old moisturizer you can take some
of your mineral powder like you've got a
mineral bronzing powder or a blush or
whatever you could also take some of
that loose powder and just like mix it
in your hand or on you know a flat
palate type
and mix it in and then put that on and
have give yourself a nice glow there as
well so there's lots and lots of options
but I just wanted to share that with you
all and I hope you have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
