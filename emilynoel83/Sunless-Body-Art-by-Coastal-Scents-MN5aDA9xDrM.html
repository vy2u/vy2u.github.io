stay with me throughout my review of
thon I've been trying a lot of products
lately haven't been posting a lot of
reviews so I thought it came time to do
another one of these massive bulk review
days and so next thing I'm going to be
talking about is a bronzer maybe you've
seen other people using it or seen it on
the Coastal Scents website it's this
it's called sunless body art and there
are three kinds of bronzers here you
have one that's like one that's medium
which happens to be this one and one
thats dark so these are all shimmery
bronzers they all have shimmer and
sparkle to them I will just kind of
swatch on my finger here is light okay
so light has the most golden appearance
medium is the one that I use the most
just in a general sense and that one has
as you can see just a little more of an
actual bronze tone and just a little bit
deeper and then the dark naturally is
the darkest and to show that next to it
because I kind of got like didn't get it
evenly on my finger there but there you
can see you know it has the most deep
colored pigment to it so basically kind
of go off your skin type if you're
trying to decide which one of these
categories you would fall into for me
light almost works as a bit of a
highlight shade medium is the one i will
use most often and dark is something i
may use with a really fluffy brush like
on my body if I want to use like a body
bronzer but basically here's what I have
to say about these I think they work
well but this would not be the only
bronzer I would use I would never want
to only use this as my bronzer here's
why I think it's very important to have
a matte bronzer because if you overall
want to just kind of deep in in for your
whole face if you just want to kind of
deep in your skin tone I really think
you're going to want to matte bronzer
because that's going to look more
natural you can even apply more matte
bronzer and make it look more net
troll then you can applying a lot of a
shimmery bronzer because as nice as the
initial application of a shimmery
bronzer may appear as the day goes on
honestly it's going to start to really
look problematic if you put a lot of
that on so you've got to really limit
yourself and how much you can apply and
I mean overall I think this works nice
it's it's got a certain softness to it
and that when you put your brush in this
you don't have to scrub you know you
feel like okay one tap of the brush and
you've got product on there that you can
that you can apply I also really like
how I could use a big fluffy kabuki
brush with this put it in there and it
looks great on the body on the shoulders
on the like decollete area if you're
trying to highlight you know your color
bone and and you know you wearing a
strappy dress wear a lot of your upper
body is showing it looks very pretty
like that and so I like the amount of
humor it gives I like there are three
different options so people with fair
skin can feel like they can you know
where a shimmery bronzer that works for
them there's probably nothing worse than
a fair skinned person who is be feeling
like they're forced to use a dark
shimmery bronzer that's way too dark for
their skin tone so that's the benefit to
this product just make sure that you
know if you are using this use it very
lightly and if you want an overall
deeper skin tone and you want your
bronzer to do that get a matte 1 and use
this more like I will use it mainly I'll
use the medium a lot and I'll do it kind
of you know dusted over the tops of my
cheeks real lightly you know across my
face but just one light layer and that's
it or on your body you can maybe be a
little more liberal with that just
because it's kind of all over here and
you're not going to look like really
that greasy you know what I mean so
basically that's what I have to say
about this product I think it's a good
bronzer I think if you're placing orders
on coastal scents it may be something
you want to look into along with your
other things if you had
been through the drug store and not
found a lot of success with good
bronzers there I like the tones of these
because they are not um they're not very
orangie they just give you a nice kind
of tan glow but just you can't go
overboard with these and you need to
just use them in moderation that's the
dark another look at the dark one there
for deeper skin tones I think that would
be really really pretty so thanks for
tuning in for this video guys there is
another review still become so keep on
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
