for this video this is a tutorial kind
of based off of a request I just had the
look that I was wearing in my best in
beauty video was they really blended out
I look using several different matte
shades and I thought it would recreate
that look with a little added warmth a
little bit of a fun kind of oranjee pop
using the Kat Von D ladybird palette
this is my first experience with Kat Von
D eyeshadows and I have to say I'm
liking them a lot and this is an overall
it's a matte palette it's got a lot of
neutral shades but also some fun little
ways to pop the look a little bit I was
really attracted to this orange e color
I'm loving the warm oranges now and so
I'll show you how layering some of these
different shades can give you a look
that turns out to be just really
seamless and blend it up through here
and it's a very similar strategy to what
I did in the best and beauty video so I
hope you enjoy the look and here's the
tutorial I'm first going to use a flat
brush and go to this matte white kind of
cream shade and I'm going to Pat that
all over the inner tear duct area and
also up onto the lid then I'm going to
go to this shade which is just slightly
deeper it's kind of a topi brown shade
and I'm just gonna Pat that on the outer
part of the lid still the same brush and
I'm going to this Brown and on the
outermost corner here still just working
on the lid then we're going to take that
same brown with a fluffier brush and
with that I'm going to work first in the
outer part of the crease and I'm kind of
just wedging the brush in there getting
the most concentration of color out in
the corner and then just pulling in
whatever might I'll still be on the
brush then I want to pull in just a
little bit deeper color and we're
actually gonna go to this plum shade it
might be coming off real purple as you
see it in the packaging but in the way
we're gonna use it it's just gonna add a
little bit of depth here and I'm gonna
get just a little bit of that with this
pencil brush on the outer corner
and just into the outer part of the
crease I'm also going to take that right
under the eye on the outer part next I'm
going to grab a smudge brush and go to
the brown I'm also using that under the
eye and that's what I'm gonna carry most
of the way under here to give it a
little bit softer look I'm going to this
shade that's right beside the brown it's
that kind of softer taupe Brown all on
top of everything I just did just just
soften it out you can go a little bit
below it if you want even more of a
smoky kind of look next we're going to
use pretty much my favorite shade in
this kit and it's this pretty kind of
burnt orange color using my Sigma e30 6
blending brush this is from the
performance collection you can see it's
just like a little wispy brush and it's
quite a bit smaller than the regular
blending brush you can still use a
blending brush for this step but I feel
like I get a really controlled
application with where I want this to go
so I'm going into that orange e shade
and then from inner to outer corner I'm
just dusting this orange shade it's kind
of our accent color right up above that
Brown so you can see there's definitely
still a gap between my eyebrow and where
the shadow is going next I'm just gonna
take a bare larger typical blending
brush and nothing on it
I'm just buffing over the edges of
everything that we've done I'm going
back to this matte creamy white shade
and this I am going to take closest to
the brow and it's going to be bordering
that orange color as well so the
overlapping we've got going on the
blending we've got happening here and
the fact that we're using matte shades
is what I think gives this a really
seamless blend right over this area next
I'm just taking a black liner all across
my upper lash line this is Maybelline
master drama and the shade is midnight
master and I'm also taking this black
and my waterline too next up I'm just
going to curl my lashes I'm using
essence I love extreme crazy volume
mascara on my
upper lashes and then I'm using my
Maybelline lash discovery mini brush
mascara on the lower lashes and then
I'll join you with the finished look so
as you can see that mascara is giving a
lot of great length and volume for this
look and it's just a little bit more you
know darker and smoky on the underneath
side but really nice and warm up time I
am really liking this palette I've worn
it a few times before doing this look
and I've noticed that the shadows have
really amazing staying power that like
they really end up looking the same way
at the end of the day as they do when
you put them on so that's great other
stuff I'm wearing I'm using my frat-boy
blush from the balm just to give that
kind of peachy pink glow to the cheeks
and then on my lips I'm using the Revlon
just bitten kissable balm stain and this
shade is precious that's kind of a nude
color a little bit of a peachy nude and
then over top of that I've got on this
Maybelline lip gloss and the shade is I
believe almond crush so thanks so much
to those who requested this kind of a
look and thanks for taking time to watch
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
