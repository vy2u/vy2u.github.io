where you're in such a rush you just
wish you could maybe reach for one
eyeshadow to create your whole look well
that's what I'm going to show you how to
do today I'm using a shimmery taupe
shade from covergirl called tapestry
taupe and it is so easy to take and
create a multi-dimensional eye look just
feet by using different applicators I'm
using a sponge tip a fine crease brush a
liner brush and a fluffier brush to use
this one shade all over and around my
eye and yet it looks like maybe I did a
little something more when it was super
quick and super easy so if you want to
see how I pull it off keep Honor's thing
you want to do is to prime your lid I'm
gonna use my ELF mineral eyeshadow
primer and just get a little bit on your
finger or just go directly from the wand
and just smooth that all over your lid
next i'm gonna take my covergirl
eyeshadow eyeshadow single in tapestry
taupe this is sort of a shimmery taupe
shade and we're going to apply this with
several different methods to sort of
bring out different sides of this color
so first I'm going to use my sponge tip
applicator that just comes with this and
pack that shadow right here on my lid
and the more of a dense application you
give this shadow the more shimmer is
going to show up so we're gonna get a
nice kind of shimmery look right here on
our lid
and you can also bring that down right
there around the tear duct area but
again we're just packing that on alright
next you can get sort of a even deeper
finish with that as well if you use a
fine crease brush that's really gonna
pack that in your crease and when you
put it in here in this area where we
have kind of a natural shadow you know
they're in our crease that's gonna just
make this shadow appear darker so it can
have well it can have its light and
shimmery moments on your lid where it's
hitting the light when you put it in an
area that's more oh that receives more
in your face like a crease like this you
can see that the darker side of this
shade is coming out so it's definitely
multi-purpose here so you can just work
that up and around as much as you want
but I'm just sort of making like a small
little like outer V with that and next
if you want a really really light
application if you use a fluffier brush
like the Sephora rounded crease brush
you're going to get more of just the
shimmer aspect of this and not so much
the color behind it so that can make
even a nice natural highlight just by
dusting that on getting hardly any on
the brush like just kind of tapping your
brush into it and then dusting it up
there you're not going to get all the
darkness of the shade but you will pick
up the shimmer and then lastly I'm just
taking whatever liner brush you want to
use I'm using my flat I believe this is
my taklon liner brush from Coastal
Scents and just dip into that kind of
packet on there and this makes a really
pretty sort of lower liner kind of lower
under the eye color I guess you'd say it
brings some light to the eye and but yet
as I said at times it can bring it can
have a darker side it's got a dark side
this shadow
so super easy just dust that right
around there I like to give just a
little bit of darkness right here along
the outer portion of the upper lashline
so I'm taking my elm a pencil liner and
just get a little bit of a line going
right here on the outer part of the lid
there and I'm just pressing a little
harder as I get toward the outside and
then you know going really light as I
get towards the middle and that's what's
gonna give you that nice kind of natural
fade if you want to smudge that out you
can totally do that with a smudge tip
applicator just like that then I would
say go ahead and curl your lashes then
I'm going to apply my L'Oreal extra
volume collet with collagen mascara and
since we've gone super natural you know
on our lid I'm gonna use this cuz this
is really really volumizing mascara so
it really kind of packs a punch when you
put it on and I would suggest just for
anyone who's asked in the past when
you're applying mascara and you wiggle
your brush from side to side a little
bit as you apply you're really gonna
coat each lash a little bit better so
just keep that in mind and then if you
want to just kind of define your lower
lashes you could use the same mascara
but I find that a really foolproof way
to do your lower lashes and not gunk
them up too much is to use a really mini
brush mascara like Maybelline lash
discovery and you can see you're making
them you're darkening their color but
you're not making them to you no spider
in thick all right here you go guys very
very natural very easy look and a total
time-saver look if you just have some
different applicators some different
kinds of brushes and one shadow that's
sort of a taupe shade that's kind of
somewhat shimmery I really recommend
tapestry taupe from covergirl because it
as you can see when the lights hitting
it it's very bright and shimmery when
the lights not hitting it you're
more of that deepers almost tones of
brown in there and so you really noticed
that when you use it as a contour like I
showed there in the video so on my lips
I mean you could do any kind of lip look
with this I mean you could go with a red
lip and this eye look would really be
great together because then those bold
lips are really gonna stand out but if
you want something natural I'm just
using my L'Oreal lipstick and fairest
nude just to give a little color to the
lips but not too much and I mean throw
on some bronzer a little bit of blush
and this is a totally quick doable look
whether you're going to school work or
wherever just running late so thank you
guys so much for watching this video and
have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
