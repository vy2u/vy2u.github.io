great to have you here and the
discussion today is all about some
high-end makeup that really surprised me
I mean sometimes going into buying a
product we think ok I know how this is
going to work I'm getting it because I
think I'm gonna like it but then you
know it kind of pulls a 180 on June it
does something unexpected and with a
couple of these there were situations
where I got the product and i swatched
it out and i thought oh no i'm going to
hate this and then it turned out to be a
really great thing once I applied it on
my skin so it's just funny how products
can surprise you and I've got both good
and bad surprises in this video so I
think I'm going to start off with the
things that were kind of happy surprises
and stuff that I was a little bit
questionable about but I turned out to
love it and these first couple of things
I had ordered for Mac I ordered them
because I really hoped I'd liked them
and then I remember getting one of these
home and swatching it out and thinking
oh dear Lord you know this is going to
be awful and it's this soft surf shadow
in the shade called bounce around and so
it's in this little glass jar it's
almost kind of like a Paint Pot but when
you look at the product in there it's
very like spongy and light seeming and
this color really does look beautiful
it's like a taupe maybe there's a hint
of a little bit of a lilac thing going
on in there
but it's just insanely sparkly right and
so I was looking up close to that and I
thought you know all the flecks appear I
was expecting it to be a little less on
the sparkle side and more of a full
color full bodied you know cream shadow
type thing so I did not have high hopes
of it once i swatched it but I have
applied this kind of like it's a little
bit of a lid pop with several different
looks and every time I have incorporated
this into a look I have loved it and the
staying power has been far better than
expected I have not had like little
fallout all over my cheeks at the end of
the day I mean it's really hung on there
and continue to look beautiful for a
full day like I said it's an interesting
texture it's kind of bouncy it reminds
me a little bit of one of those
Maybelline Dream bouncy blushes you know
it almost feels like there's hollowness
under there although I don't think there
is it's just the way that shadow feels
so the way I've applied this by the way
is just with my thing
another thing from Mac is this
mineralized blush in the shade warm soul
and I was just kind of browsing the
website one day and I remember laying
eyes on this and thinking you know I
couldn't remember specifically who I'd
heard talk about it but I felt like I'd
heard this name of a blush tossed around
quite a bit here on YouTube and so I
thought maybe it's worth a try you know
I'm interested in trying out some new
blushes and as soon as I got it home I
opened it up and I thought no you know
it's just gonna be one of those things
that's barely there barely showing up on
my cheeks I mean at a glance just seeing
it in person again I'm ordering this off
the website but seeing it in person I
just thought it was going to be one of
those do-nothing blushes but it is the
most surprising look on the cheeks I'm
wearing it on my cheeks today I mean
don't get me wrong it's not like it's a
really bright super bold blush but it
definitely is doing something for me
there you know it's really giving a
pretty glow first off but it's offering
quite a bit of color I feel like so I
love this shade and I wouldn't have
expected to like it as much as I do
let's talk NARS for a second this is a
product I did not choose for myself
because it was sent to me by NARS you
know PR whatever and it's the long hot
summer palette and I love it because I
love that Keith Urban song it's gonna be
a long have some I do love that song
but this eye palette really shocked me
because I think it's the first NARS
eyeshadow product that I've really
enjoyed that being said I have not tried
like just standard NARS singles and
duo's really that you would just pick up
at a Sephora or something like that
everything I've tried has been some sort
of a special palette I wasn't that
impressed with the big like narcissist
palette when that came out a few years
ago really did not like at all that dual
intensity eye pallidus thing though when
i swatched these shades and when I used
them I thought wow there's a softness to
these there's a really nice smoothness
and pigmentation and I actually really
like the color selection too so it was
really working on all accounts for me
there are four shades in here labeled
long hot summer one two three and four
so I'm guessing those are like limited
edition and created for
palate and then you've got bellisima -
and bengali but this was just a happy
little surprise because mainly it's been
a texture thing and a pigmentation thing
for me with NARS shadows and maybe
they're putting lesser quality stuff in
palettes I don't know some brands do
that but I've gotten a lot of just quick
and easy looks with this palette I'm
wearing this shade in the crease this
kind of matte cool greyish color and a
little bit of this on the outside this
on the lid I also blended both of these
shades kind of as a transition type
color there and I also smudge these two
on the lower lash line so my look today
is really a mix of all of these tones
but if you just glance at the palette
you can see you could get a very cool
look just using the top row or a warmer
brownish look on the bottom and these
are just really pretty shades here if
you're into the rose gold little bit
coppery type colors these are beautiful
another DARS thing that was sent to me
that I did not expect to like because as
I said I didn't like the dual intensity
eyeshadow palette but they've come out
with this narcissist dual intensity
cheek palette and this seems to work
quite well for me I mean just putting a
brush in now I will say I think
synthetic brushes for whatever reasons
seem to pick this product up a little
better or more dense brushes might be
the difference in what I was seeing
there but you got like a highlight shade
this soft kind of golden peach a really
pretty rich pink and then this deeper
neutral and it's like they've all got a
certain amount of Sheen but they don't
come off overboard on my cheeks even the
highlight doesn't seem like it's too
crazy but I don't know if it's just the
fact that these colors really suit me or
what but I've just been happy with them
quality wise you know how easily they go
on the cheeks
I don't feel like I have to work hard
with them but at the same time I don't
feel like I have to hold back big time
either it's not something I have to be
extremely careful with and it is nice
that it's a blush palette plus a
highlight but considering how much I
dislike the dual intensity eye palette I
was really shocked that I liked that as
much as I did another thing that I just
kind of bought on a whim I was really
curious about it I didn't know that I'd
love it because setting powders are
tricky let's just face it sometimes they
can make you look way too dry sometimes
there's too much thickness for what they
are you know just a light setting powder
on the skin and this thing seem to be a
nice happy medium and I like this a two
in one product and it's from
bareMinerals
and it's the translucent powder duo and
so in here you're getting two pressed
powders one is matte and one says glow
and you can kind of see that the matte
one is a completely flat white looking
powder and the glow has swirls of like a
peachy tone in there but these are
interesting because when I first again
swatch them and pass my judgment on the
product I thought I don't see a lot of
product coming off there what is this
really gonna do on my skin but it does
have a nice lightweight texture and so
just experimenting with this a time or
two and using the matte shade you know a
little bit on the under eye using the
glowy shade somewhat on top of the
cheeks I thought okay this can be kind
of perfecting and I really love having
both options in one and really if a
powder is looking all out white in a
compact you know I'm not gonna want that
to transfer off you know a whole lot
with a lot of white pigmented intensity
I'm going to want that to be light and
kind of like just a sheer pressed powder
and that's what that is it definitely
has the capability of mattifying but it
has the invisibility factor I guess on
the skin is what I'm trying to say and
the glow is really pretty too I've added
some of that like on top of my cheeks
today so this was kind of a cool product
and I wish more brands would maybe think
about doing that combo thing with a
setting powder where you've got two
finishes in one another thing where I I
nearly didn't buy this product okay I
thought I got enough to face palettes
you know this is just an another to base
palette throw it into the mix I don't
even think I'm interested but I went
ahead and did it and let me say it came
with stickers and so I went nuts with
the stickers this is the totally cute
palette you might think that's
straight-up junior high mode there but I
love it I don't care this was an online
order hadn't seen it in a store anywhere
so there always is kind of that element
of surprise when you order something
online but the shades in here are all
really really consistent very nice
quality you've got a row of just very
basic mattes
here buddy fufu chocolate donut double
scoop that makes a really pretty just on
its own neutral look but I love the
shades that should they chose to put in
here for the pops as well and I kind of
tend to like a palette that gives me
something a little bit unexpected or
might potentially make me go out of my
comfort zone this might be something
that you look at and you think well oh
I've already got green shadows or I've
already got pink shadows and I'm loaded
with neutrals so I don't need it that
was sort of my mentality and what almost
led me to not buy it but I am glad I did
because something about having them all
together in the convenience of a pallet
you know I've used the green in
different looks I've used the pink this
storm cloud shade is like a very deep
teal and that makes it really
interesting liner look and all of these
highlights this is really unique the
shade called unicorn because it's got
this sort of I don't know pinky
iridescent to it the mattes to face does
mattes really really well and so I
enjoyed that they had just some basic
mattes in this along with the fun pops
of color and the last thing that
surprised me in a positive way and I've
talked about this before in my best in
beauty video I've written a blog about
these it's the honest a sea of lip
glosses I mean I did not expect that I
would love these as much as I do I
didn't think I was going to totally
dislike them it was just a situation
where I hope they'd be decent and they
turned out to be like my new favorite
lip gloss formula pure it across the
board so I've been so happy with them
check out the blog post that's probably
the most informative thing I've done on
these because I tried them all on in
pictures there in a nutshell I think
it's a wonderful formula that feels
super comfortable on the lips yet it's
completely full color I love the
applicator and the precision I can get
even with bold shades wearing one of
these today this is in the shade called
caramel or caramel great neutrals in
this kit you've got a pink in here a
shade with some shimmer a couple of
berry colors but even just once this kid
is no longer available I just think this
is a solid lip gloss formula that I'm
going to want to buy more from and just
look into further okay how about the
things that surprised me in a bad way
things that I kind of had higher
expectation for maybe an assumption
that they would work so much better just
out for things here but I don't know I'm
gonna share them with you first up we
have this Make Up For Ever water blend
foundation this was sent to be my sent
to me by make up forever and I didn't
really have a lot of expectation going
in in terms of having heard a lot of
positive stuff about it I got it I think
very early on with their launch and I've
heard about more products coming out
these days that are a little bit more
concentrated like you think about the
cover FX custom cover drops that can be
added to a foundation they're like total
liquid but yet they're really
full-coverage concentrated type stuff
and I guess that's what I thought this
was gonna be like something that managed
to be really thin lightweight feel but a
very concentrated coverage level instead
I really should have taken that
waterward literally because this is so
thin it's so light on the skin it might
be what a perfect skinned person is
after just for a little added something
on there because it does kind of leave a
pretty finish it's not overly glowy it's
not a hundred percent matte either it's
kind of a beautiful middle ground where
that's concerned but if you've got any
discoloration on your skin
any problems you want to cover up like
you're just going to end up layering and
layering a lot of concealer on top of
this to take care of it because this
just does nothing coverage wise so so
much for thinking that it was going to
be some like power packed super
concentrated type liquid foundation
because it just didn't turn out to be
that way it's extremely extremely light
another kind of coverage disappointment
was this estee lauder double wear
waterproof all-day extreme wear
concealer if that doesn't sound like
something that's right up my alley I
don't know what is I love all things
double wear double wear products from
Estee water tend to have amazing
coverage wonderful staying power
I enjoy the different foundations but
this concealer which I have in the shade
to see light medium cool it didn't cover
enough for me and I can't really
critique the staying power so much
because I do feel that it lasted on me
but it's much more thin than I expected
and I almost think this needs just a
little more thickness to have that
double wear type coverage that I've come
to a
expect I think if you've got really dark
circles if you've got discolored you
know age spots sun spots on your skin
this is not the type of thing that can
really full-on tackle that it definitely
doesn't come anywhere close to having
the coverage of the just the Double Wear
maximum cover foundation that I've
talked about before that can take on
melasma with just you know brush it on
and boom you're good this it needs to be
worked with more it needs to be kind of
built up more to get the maximum out of
it and even then I'm not super satisfied
and another thing that surprised me so
much is that I have another concealer
from Estee Lauder that I purchased not
quite so recently and it's from their
perfectionist line and it's got like a
serum type almost concealer primer type
side to it and then a stick concealer on
the other end and I feel like this cover
is better than this and it's a
perfectionist product which the
perfectionist foundation seems to be
more lightweight lighter coverage on the
skin more natural-looking and I wouldn't
have thought that this concealer would
satisfy me so much more from a coverage
perspective than a double wear concealer
so that shocked me let's talk about this
random purchase that I had it's a dior
eyeshadow palette in amber nui and uit
it looks like shades that are just right
up my alley I think I was browsing
Nordstrom's website and I just thought
oh that looks beautiful you know I love
the packaging design I love that kind of
quilted look to the eyeshadows and
online I mean the shades struck me even
more I don't know if they look deeper
richer on there when I got it I kind of
thought okay I feel like I've got a ton
of things they look like this and then
when i swatched it i thought these are
weak shadows what's going on
this says Dior on it and I've tried
things from various drugstore brands
recently that could outperform this in
terms of a full coverage colorful shadow
so the situation is this I can I get a
good eye look with this palette
something that will look pretty
something that people would think oh
that looks nice sure did I expect way
way more for the money that was spent
absolutely and when I was thinking about
you know these
you Laurie a little quads that I had
reviewed last week thinking about the
texture of those and then these if there
was some kind of blind swatch test going
on I don't know how you pull that off
but just looking at the color payoff and
the texture just the softness and feel
those certainly impress me more than
this and they were just a fraction of
the price
so I just I don't know is there
something out there better from Dior
that I'm missing that I really should
have tried instead of this let me know
now benefit has launched a crap-ton of
brow products for every teeny tiny
purpose a person could need and there
are some things that I thought okay
that's probably gonna work for me
different pencils they've put out you
know I thought they'd work they did you
know they're nice products couple of
things that I thought would be very very
gimmicky and not too useful
yep that's kind of what they turned out
to be but something that did surprise me
from that line was this Ready Set brow
and that's just their clear brow gel I
thought you know okay that's a practical
need for the brows it's some kind of
clear gel that anybody you know
regardless of hair color or what they
need with their brows everyone can use
something clear to set them and keep
them in place all day but this gel like
it's supercharged and it's almost an
over-the-top kind of way first off when
you take the brush out like it's the
first brow gel I've seen where there is
a lot of excess on the wand and I think
you do need to kind of get rid of some
of that and then you can see there's two
flat sides if I hold it this way it
looks totally flat and then you've got
your bristles shorter bristles and
longer bristles and even when I have
really cleaned off the brush I feel like
my brows which there's a lot of hair in
these brows I feel like they are
overloaded with product and after about
5-10 minutes of this sitting on my brows
they feel hard and crusty and I
remembered being out one day and
randomly touched my brow and I thought
can people is there something on my brow
that people can see like what's
happening there it was just a stiffness
and I found myself picking out these
little chunks of the gel that had dried
in there and I thought I thought I
cleaned off my brush you know it
shouldn't take that much work please let
me do you a favor save you some money go
the next section look
for a product called control freak brow
gel the brush is never overloaded it
deposits just the perfect amount of brow
gel in your brows and it holds like none
other
with no unusual texture but this I
thought you know how are they gonna
screw up clear brow gel but this is just
not my style and that my friends wraps
up all of my high-end Beauty surprises
that I have encountered recently I was
really thinking I could probably do this
with some drugstore stuff too because
there have been some drugstore things
that really like whoa how did that work
out that way but I do want to make sure
you know none of the things in this
video were just a first impression type
thing I think it was kind of the anti
first impression because my first
impressions failed me on these products
the things I thought initially about
these items did not prove to be true and
it was after multiple uses of both the
things that I liked and I didn't like
that I really came to the realization
that I ended up with here so I hope this
helped you out thank you for watching
and I'll see you soon
