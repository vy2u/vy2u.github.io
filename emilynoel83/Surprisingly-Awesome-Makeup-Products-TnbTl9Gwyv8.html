for this video this is going to be all
about some surprisingly amazing makeup
products makeup products that you may
call underrated things that there's just
not a lot of hype about things you don't
hear about a lot for example if I were
doing this video maybe a couple of years
ago I would have said NYC sunny that
bronzer that I love so much matte
bronzer available for like a couple of
bucks in the drugstore but I feel like
since I mean I take some credit for
getting that out there because I felt
like nobody was talking it talking about
that I really started wrecking him in
recommending that across the boards and
then you know we started hearing about
more and more people using that product
so I'm not gonna really call that one
underrated anymore but there are some
other things that I feel like are kind
of off people's radar because either
it's a brand that nobody thinks is good
enough or it's so cheap how could it be
good and they just I feel like if kind
of big ignored you know like off
people's radar maybe you've heard me
talk about some of these things but I
just feel like I don't hear a lot about
them they're underrated they're kind of
undiscovered and I'm saying hey listen
up pay attention to these things because
they are awesome and please forgive me
because my makeup has kind of been
wearing down I had a story out at a
softball Dimond earlier and it's got a
hot outside so anyway I'm just like you
know I don't care I need to do this
video and by the way I put this actually
to a vote on my Facebook page on this
video I had this option or another one
and I'll just put it out there you know
let me know which video you want to see
today and I'll start doing that more and
more because I think it's fun and it
lets me know what you're actually
interested in so I don't know just check
back with the Facebook page every so
often and I may be kind of asking you
guys your opinion on a certain video so
let's get to it I don't want to spend
too much time on any one thing first
thing I would like to talk about in the
world where there are a zillion kinds of
brushes and I personally have tons of
them a makeup tool that is so great are
these sponge tip applicator 's
they come in you know your eyeshadow
palettes and I will hear people
sometimes say oh I just throw those out
you know like I don't even use that well
ok for you but you know there may be
some people that can't afford a big slew
of brushes or maybe they just don't want
to you know get into that much in depth
I don't want to use those million
brushes I want to keep it simple well
you know these things are actually quite
good for applying your eyeshadow whether
you buy like the packs of you know a
bunch of these kind of rounded tip ones
or the ones that like come with
covergirl the pointed tip is amazing
guys that gets right in there you know
this is really good for packing on
shadow you I mean do one eye with a flat
shadow brush and do the other eye
packing on your shadow with one of these
and I think you'll have more control
with this a and B it's gonna look the
same so it's like you know while there
may be some functions where it's like
you know you could use a brush and the
brush could make it look better and
easier
there are also some times where this
honestly people are just being snubbed
sometimes when they say they don't want
to ever use the sponge tip applicator 's
they can be great so I just don't ignore
those maybe try one out just the next
time you do an eye look and see if you
really think it looks that much
different from when you used a brush
just saying just an idea okay going to
eyeshadows talking about that and
eyeshadow a brand of eyeshadow that I
think is largely overlooked and just
kind of thrown in the clinic category by
many people as drugstore and not good
enough is covergirl covergirl oh my gosh
I have used covergirl ever since my very
beginnings in makeup so I have seen the
quality of those shadows go from here to
here you know I have seen a drastic
improvement in the quality the
pigmentation the smoothness the
creaminess I mean there are great great
covergirl shadows whether you're into
the quads or the singles for example
here's a single in mink this is a
gorgeous shade this is likely the dupe
of some
back shade I mean I think somebody has
told me the pigmentation is great you
put this on on top of a primary you're
not gonna have a problem with staying
power brown smolder rich deep matte
brown I mean just gorgeous shades and
they cost so little you get a nice large
amount of product in each one of these
they will last you so long and I just
can't get over the fact that I'm not
hearing more people say covergirl
eyeshadow is fantastic because it really
is so that's you know something I feel
like it's kind of underrated and maybe
surprising to some people another kind
of eyeshadow that may surprise you the
eyeshadow from Claire's yeah I mean
especially these if you see any palettes
that look like this and they've got like
10 colors of Circular you know shaped
shadows I had these you know back when I
was first doing videos and I was talking
about Claire's eyeshadow and how really
pretty and pigmented some of these
shades are and like I have a neutral
palette and I have a colorful palette
and I just find them to be so lovely and
I kind of haven't used these in a while
in my collection and I'm kind of
rediscovering them and surprising myself
all over again again with the fact that
these are just that good and I feel like
people will walk into Claire's and
probably disregard the cosmetics section
because well you know who who knows
about that stuff but these are good okay
if you want pigmented shadows and a lot
of variety and a lot of times they do
have like buy one get one or buy one get
the second one half off so something
worth looking into another specific
palette not just you know across the
board check out these eyeshadows but a
specific product available for one
dollar on eyes lips face comm that will
give you as good of a smoky eye as you
will get anywhere is this little quad
called drama okay if you go to the $1
section of the elf eyeshadow quads
sometimes these are in like little
triangles all the rest of mine are
except for this one I'm not sure why but
here you get a rich black you get a
charcoal shade
silver shade and a white shade and let
me tell you those are just about as good
as you would need to create a smoky you
know dark eye look at that black just
look at it come on now yeah people
should be raving about this where is
this on your radar you need to look into
this a dollar you will not be
disappointed I promise and hey there's a
sponge tip applicator here don't throw
it away okay next I wanted oh I do have
a couple of brushes while everybody
loves the Mac brushes the Sigma brushes
Coastal Scents
I love Coastal Scents and sigma2 but
there is a particular brush duo that it
surprised me that I have not come across
brushes like these in any set that I
have ever owned and I have a whole like
carousel of brushes here these two have
not been duplicated by any brand and I
cannot do without them I carry them
daily in my makeup bag I don't know what
I'd do without them they are from
essence of beauty which is available at
CVS stores they look like this they've
got this kind of like faux Lightwood
handle and they are the essence of
beauty crease brush duo one is a little
larger one is a little bit smaller I'll
use the larger ones in house you just
put a crease shade right here and the
smaller one is just perfect for creating
an outer V and I mean any set I've owned
even like there's smallish kind of
pencil type brushes but nothing has
duplicated what these can do these are
so amazing and I don't hear that many
people talking about these and I just
feel like these are undiscovered these
are underrated
and they are amazing surprisingly
awesome and that no other brand can come
up with that so I don't know I love
those next surprisingly awesome
item is a face powder something that I
have used for religiously for I'm gonna
say the past four years straight and it
is the loose powder from Mary Kay and my
shade is beige one
this is not mineral this is not you know
anything that's been dolled up with you
know a crazy name or claim it is simply
loose powder from Mary Kay great
coverage though not cakey it adds a
little color in my face it is a step I
will never like not do like this is a a
continually always do step you just get
you know a large amount of product has
kind of the shaker top I will like
sometimes just put a brush on top of it
and kind of like shake it like that get
some of my brush or tap some in the lid
and it's just wonderful wonderful
texture you know I like how I liken it
to the L'Oreal True Match powder if it
was in a loose powder form because
sometimes loose powder is nice because I
feel like you dust it on and it has this
effect of kind of setting a liquid
without having to press it on in a more
cakey manner with a sponge or anything
like that I just like the application
method of this I just I've always loved
this never hurt a soul other than myself
talked about this on YouTube even once
so I would really recommend the Mary Kay
loose powder I love it if you have
talked about that and I haven't seen you
talk about it hey we're on the same
wavelength I think it's really good next
I just want to run through some
surprisingly awesome lip products that
maybe you haven't taken the time to
check out in the store but you really
should because they're super cheap and
great one of the first things I would
probably recommend to someone who says
hey I've never tried elf before what
things should I use the super glossy lip
shines are so good these have an SPF 15
the texture is great and the one I have
on right now on my lips is called mauve
luxe it's this gorgeous shade right here
these are dollar products on eyes lips
face comm just gonna swatch a couple of
these for you so you can
see but the the I just love the texture
the shine the colors I like the colors
aren't like totally sheer like you
actually are getting a color out of
these there is the lighter shade as
candle light the deeper shade is mauve
looks really really pretty products and
I just think for a buck you know I like
them so much I have not had issues with
like the packaging breaking on me or
being cheap or anything like that so
those are great also Jordana the brand
that is in your Walgreens that maybe you
just walked past and you're like I don't
know I haven't really tried anything
from then the pretty shine lip gloss
this was borderline something I was
thinking I might not include this in the
video because I have talked about these
and blogged about these before but I
thought you know I think they need some
a little bit of coverage here but these
are typical wand applicator they smell
very pleasant they are just really good
quality lip glosses and they tend to
have a hint of shimmer to them this one
is called cute and this one is one of my
all-time favorite shades called lovely
all-time favorite shades as in of any
lip product I own that one lovely is the
name from Jordana they're called pretty
shine also think back to Bonnie Belle
when was the last time you tried some
Bonnie Belle the lip lights are so good
I mean I kind of like searching back
through my products you know some of
these I'll use I'll actually use spun
sugar quite frequently as a lower lip
highlight to kind of make my lips look
nice and full but they have some
fantastic light to neutral shades with
with some mouth watering since i'm
swatching caramel latte and spun sugar
caramel latte right there spun sugar
there they smell so good they have a
texture that reminds me a lot of those
other two I just spoke about which is
not too sticky you get full color it's
very good pigmentation really really
good stuff and another one NYC liquid
lip shine someone was asking me about a
good pigmented drugstore lipgloss on
Facebook and
this one I think the shade is sungold
pink and I just swatched it there it's
kind of a unique shade because it's got
so much gold in it but it also does look
pink and it also non sticky excuse me
it's non sticky but it has just a
phenomenal shine all of these do so I
really love them and finally underrated
product a wonderful red lipstick I mean
awesome and you're not gonna pay more
than two bucks for this
it's from NYC and it is the ultra moist
lip where the shade is called sheer red
this is going to be one of the most
wearable red lipsticks if you've never
tried red I encourage you to try this
red it is so wearable it is not like a
tomato kind of like orange e red it has
you know just the a slight hint of a
blueish undertone so it's gonna kind of
be the type of shade you put on and your
teeth look a little wider with it and
it's just so inexpensive so if you're
really like a neutral girl but you want
to try a red your only out like one
maybe two dollars if you tried that one
so okay that that's pretty much it
that's all I feel like I was kind of on
like a really long rant there almost
because it's just sometimes it boggles
my mind that people with as many
youtubers that are out there I feel like
sometimes we get so stuck on certain
brands certain products that have to be
the best stuff because maybe it's more
pricey or you know I got it from Sephora
it's got to be good or you know that
kind of thing and really I'm not
knocking any of that stuff because I got
plenty of high-end stuff that I love but
some of these items just do not get
enough love and I feel like you need to
know about them so that's why I did this
video thank you so much to those who
voted for this video if you enjoyed it I
guess you can thank your fellow viewers
