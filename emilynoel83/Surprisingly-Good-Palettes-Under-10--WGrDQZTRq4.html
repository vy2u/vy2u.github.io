like a massive video to-do list a bunch
of things I want to do videos on things
I'm really excited about but every so
often something just instantly jumps the
list because I am that pumped to share
it with you so that's the situation
today I have had my hands on these
products for a little over a week I've
had a chance to experiment and I am
really impressed and surprised with some
of the things I have so here's the deal
I ordered off of I Kate house.com
that's a website I've only ordered from
one time before and I had a good
experience so I'm like let's check this
out again and I ended up with some
pallets that I really freaking love like
that was most of what I got everything
was really inexpensive like under $10
for the most parts this is kind of like
a haul of what I ended up with but I
also wanted to point out a lot of things
from a review perspective too but one
more thing before I get started a couple
of things with makeup brands that I
think turn around and end up costing the
consumer more outside of just the
quality of the product itself can be the
packaging and also the advertising that
the company does those added costs I
think can come back to those of us who
are buying the products and here I'm
just putting it out there the packaging
is not great on all these things so
that's fine but you know it's not above
and beyond and number two these are not
the kinds of brands you're seeing like
on TV commercials and in magazines and
another point to be aware of is I don't
think these brands are known for using
any exceptionally expensive ingredients
in their products either just putting
that out there but I wanted to share
what I got some really excited about it
a first off this palette this is from a
brand called beauty treats
I've tried nothing from this brand until
just recently and when I saw this
palette online and it made me think of
two pallets in one the vies art neutral
matte palette and also the editorial
bright matte palette I don't own either
of those but I've stocked visor palettes
long enough to know that that's kind of
what they look like like I'm not saying
this is a shade for J dupe by any means
I'm not saying the quality is is good
but it seems like it's really been
fashioned after those pallets putting a
bunch of shades all in one though this
does feel like kind of a bulky palette
but I mean you are getting 24 shades and
they are pretty generously
it says 24 Matt I just want to point out
the shades that actually aren't right
Tim not everything is met this one has a
little shimmer these two right here
these bright so kind of a set and finish
it's a little bit of a satin finish in
this plum as well not that it's making a
huge difference with the finish on the
eyes and whatnot but just sharing that
and when I first got this and swatched
it out I thought uh you know I don't
know some of these things seemed a
little sheer I didn't know if I was
gonna like it I really had to use it on
the eyes first which I shared a look on
snapchat and I was so happy with the way
it turned out I love some of these matte
shades that are in here including these
kind of cool plummy Gray's and pairing
those with the more orange II colors I
think that was a gorgeous lid look and
then you know a lower lashline pop with
this blue was a lot of fun I also worked
in some of this shade you've got a
really solid beautiful orange in here
so this palette was $5.99 so I think
that's kind of ridiculous and I was
really happy with it not absolutely
everything I got was a slam dunk
let's be honest here so I've got a
couple more palettes from beauty treats
and these came in a duo so it was $9.99
to get both of them and I assume if you
wanted to get them separately they'd
probably be like about $5.99 like that
last palette but I have the heart love
blusher palette and then this is the
heart love correction palette so these
kind of look like play make up but you
know me if it works and it turns out to
be phenomenal i I'm not going to knock
the packaging or the style or whatever
but I have been playing with this color
correction palette and these creams are
so like rock hard and solid like you
can't get a lot off and you dip your
finger in or a brush and you just can't
get enough product off to actually do a
lot of coverage on your skin I don't
know I just I was not really impressed
the product I could lift off of this
palette seemed a little bit thin and
slippery and greasy blush palette with
those heart shapes this kind of looks
like play makeup too but this one who
this is this is some of the brightest
blush I have ever tried some of the
other most pigmented wildly bright blush
as I owner from a brand called la femme
they sell some blush singles that are
just knock your socks off bright
and these seem like that same formula
everything is bright in this palette you
think you're going to go for one of
these - and look subtle um no I was
messing around with these the other day
and I'm saying I kept into these I
capped off the excess I tapped it on my
hand I even brushed it off on my hand
and I felt like I still had a little too
much on my cheeks so if you want to go
there with your blushes this is intense
intense intense colors they're all
completely matte some of them as you can
see could go very very bright if you're
a deep skin tone and you struggle to
make blushes show up on your skin you
might fall in love with this for me it
almost requires a little bit too much
restraint and application to be
particularly enjoyable and I'm kind of I
don't know it's a risky one because if
you go into it and you are going to get
a lot of color on your cheeks I feel
like no matter what you do so I do think
this is the strength of this little duo
and I'm pretty sure they're available
individually if this idea does really
appeal to you but regardless of my
personal take on that palette I do think
it's very good quality and unexpectedly
pigmented palette for the price strobing
highlighter palette for 399 and these
are pretty generously sized pants they
look like about the size of the Mac
blush there and what it is is three
creams and three powders across the
bottom so varying tones you've got like
a little bit of a golden e cream this
one shows up a little bit pinky I know
it looks like straight-up white but it's
got a little bit of a pink tone and then
this one is the one I'm wearing today
and it's more peachy I took this and I
kind of just patted it on my cheeks and
then I took this middle shade which is
kind of a sunshiny warm highlight and
topped it off and I'm getting an awesome
glow there oh I put a little bit of this
on top as well super white highlights so
if you want to experiment with strobing
both cream and powder highlights it's
kind of convenient with it all-in-one
although a little part of me doesn't
love it when cream and powder are
combined in a palette because I always
worry about the powder drifting into the
creams but what did I tell you is $3.99
the packaging is not going to be like
next-level innovation here and one other
thing about these creams I really do
feel the need to kind of swirl my finger
in it a little
it get the product warmed up almost like
tap my fingers together and then just
take it onto my cheekbones with my
finger I do think these benefit from a
little bit of warmth like breaking the
product down a little bit but once you
get them on there I mean I think they
look great now I believe that's all I
had from this line everything else is
from City color and city color was the
stuff from this hall that I did have a
little bit of experience with and so I
expected it to be good and it did not
disappoint so that's the good news
and they have a barely exposed palette
I've talked about that before it looks
like this only it's a little bit darker
outer packaging and it's basically like
a dupe of The Naked 1 palette so I saw
when I was shopping online that they had
this barely exposed to so it's only
$5.99 you don't get massive amounts of
shadow in here and the outer packaging
is pretty solid I must say but I kind of
like how this one doesn't appear to be
fashioned after any one particular
palette like they have some rosy shades
it kind of in a few places makes you
think naked 3 but then there's this fun
like bronzy warmth in here as well that
I really like so I think this is a
gorgeous palette you aren't loaded with
mattes the two really matte shades in
here are this rose that deep kind of
raspberry rosy shade and this dark brown
but you've got a lot of shimmery pops
and something about the shimmery shades
in these various city color eyeshadow
palettes that I'm going to talk about
like they are downright creamy I don't
know if you've heard people talking
about the singles that city color has or
if you've tried them yourself and they
feel like a almost cream and powder mix
like there's some moisture in there very
smooth to the touch and any shimmers or
metallics that you see in these palettes
definitely have that feel the mattes or
the ones that are just like a little bit
of a satiny finish those while they're
still nicely pigmented they feel more
like a standard eyeshadow but I think
this is a beautiful palette because it
combines kind of the best of both worlds
to me because I love the bronzy colors
but with a lot of rows palettes you just
end up getting straight-up rosiness and
I like having those two worlds kind of
combined in one I love that there's a
dark plum in there too couple of other
City
our palates I got this one is called fig
tastic I had heard about this one before
and I was hoping I would run into it at
five below but I hadn't seen it there
and this the colors just absolutely
speak to me here this is not quite so
neutral as this and you see how
everything in here even though there are
rose colors it's still a little more
earth toned the stuff in here has some
more bright pops to it so you've got
those fabulous shimmery textures that
I've mentioned like with this raspberry
color that beautiful purple there's a
great gold in here so a really fun color
selection in this palette the packaging
it kind of annoys me because this this
is like a flexible it's not a solid
plastic right there and that concerns me
just because if I stacked something on
top of it if I was traveling and
something really bumped into that I
would kind of worry that it might mess
up the eyeshadows so not the greatest
packaging here but that was only $8.99
and then $9.99 the Harvest Moon palette
I thought it was a beautiful palette but
just a little little reason extra why I
got it was underneath the Harvest Moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
anytime I look at this I think of the
Sun heartbeat because of the Harvest
Moon Line but anyways neutral palette
it's more neutral it's more earthy
compared to the fig tastic I'm wearing
it today I've just got a lot of topi
bronzy goodness happening I've got these
two shades like a lot of this on the lid
this in the crease some of this below
the eye this shade too so just some of
the deeper taupe so I also did blend out
a little bit with the peachy colors just
above the crease it's a pretty look but
it doesn't go quite as deep and dark as
the fig tastic does and I think that
makes this palette even more versatile
plus it had some fun kind of brighter
purpley shades don't get me wrong this
is nice I think it's beautiful but if I
had to pick one I would probably go with
this one on this website a lot of times
you can buy things in kind of in bulk
you know you can buy every shade that
something's available in and these blush
quads
I paid $19.99 to have all of them but if
you want to buy them on their own
they're $5.99
and they are from city color and Penna
it's a blush lovers paradise I must say
this is the one collection one they're
labeled one through four so I'll go
through each of them for you everything
is really richly pigmented I would say
looking at each quad and there are more
like wearable easier to wear shades
compared to that heart-shaped palette
where almost everything was SuperDuper
bright so in this collection one it's
very cool toned pinky almost a little
bit on the berry side then in collection
too everything is much warmer you're
getting into some deep orange shades in
comparison to this one you can just see
how much warmer that is in this palette
by the way this one shade had a teeny
bit of shimmer to it and in this one you
know they're all so intense even though
I can see some varied finishes here it
doesn't really seem to affect like the
amount of color you see coming out of
these but this one has a little sheen
going on and there's a tiny hint of some
flex in these two shades this one is
totally matte now your most
natural-looking ones are collection 3
and 4 so you can see collection 3 more
pink this one straight-up peach you've
heard I mean if you guys had a dime for
every time you've heard someone on
YouTube say something is pinky peach
this is just 100% peach all the way but
talking about collection 3 for a second
I feel like you've got pink and peach
and then you've got a slightly deeper
take on those same two colors right next
to it over here so I think this is very
wearable and then if you're one of those
people who just knows you know peach
blush is my wheelhouse that's the kind
of color I want to wear all the time
this palette is really gorgeous and the
shades I'm wearing today are mostly this
one as far as my blush color goes I
mentioned I use the strobing palette but
I've got the blush right here and in
this shade and then I also blended a
little bit of this even softer peach
kind of just over the top of it blush
palettes are fun like that because you
can bounce around you can customize the
shades you don't always have to wear the
same thing day after day when all the
shades are of top-notch quality in each
of them you know it's a lot of fun and I
know I've raved about the B matte
blushes from City color they're round
you know like the full size individual
blushes but I think these are an even
bed
deal I mean for $5.99 getting for super
pigmented shades that it's unlikely
he'll run out of anytime soon I think
that's awesome so that's all I've got
for this video it felt like a lot but I
just kind of wanted to share my little
cheap pallet success stories with you
and let me know if you've tried any of
these brands or these pallets or others
that you would recommend from that
website I do have a few like individual
products that I got off the site too but
I haven't played with them enough to be
able to tell you much one thing though
that I'll point out is my lip color I
got this off of I Kate house and I
didn't buy the whole line I just bought
the one or two and it's by Absolut New
York it's called the velvet lippy it's
actually a pretty darn comfortable
liquid lipstick in the shade wrestle so
thank you guys so much for spending time
with me today I really appreciate it
I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
