joining me for this Valentine's Day
tutorial whether you have that special
someone or not I think this is just a
great feminine romantic look that you
can use on Valentine's Day or really any
occasion I tried to go for something a
little different really an eye makeup
look that is somewhat understated and
doesn't really look like you've spent
hours you know just slaving over your
eyes they just kind of have a naturally
beautiful look and basically if you're a
low effort I shadow person someone who
doesn't like to put a ton of time into
using a bunch of different colors you're
going to enjoy this we've used some
liner and some some false lashes half
strips that are very easy to use so if
you want to see how to put this whole
look together keep on watching first
step is to take your Too Faced shadow
insurance and just apply that all over
your lid then I'm going to be using the
Too Faced enchanted glamour land palette
and the first shade i'm using is boy toy
and it's a shimmery pink so take any
flat eyeshadow brush you like and just
Pat that all over your lid then you're
going to flip the brush over and just
kind of work that up into the crease a
little bit and then grab a fluffier
brush and just blend that out all across
the crease sort of a little bit up onto
the brow bone then we're going to move
into a very matte nude shade and that's
going to serve as our highlight you can
take that same fluffy brush and just
dust that directly under the brow and
put it around your tear duct moving on
we're going to take a deep brown ish
kind of plumbing maroon shade and take a
fluffy brush just with a tiny amount of
product on it and just ease that into
the crease with sort of that back and
forth motion there and just blend that
in just want a really really soft crease
shade there nothing to pronounce no
outer V and moving on to liner taking an
elf liquid liner in black this is sort
of moving toward that pin-up look
because the liner is more precise on the
upper lash line going all the way across
and winging it out and then for our
water line going to be using the Milani
liquify eyeliner in black just draw that
all the way from energy
outer corner and then we're going to
take the deepest richest shade in the
palette called stiletto it's a matte
black take a smudger brush and just
smudge that on the outer part of the
lower lash line and work it in probably
about halfway in on your lower lash line
we want a really smudged out effect and
then we're going back to boy toy the
pinky shade clean off your smudger brush
and just apply that on the inner half of
your lower lash line then grab that
eyelash curler and curl your lashes and
I'm going to be using the Rimmel lash
flirt mascara using a coat on the upper
lashes and then a little bit on the
bottom lashes as well just to define
those then I'm taking a half set of
lashes they throw a little bit longer
right on the outside very easy to just
pop on make sure they're pressed on and
you're good to go
alright guys here's the finished look I
hope you enjoy it I've got a couple
things on my lips that I want to tell
you about the first is a lipstick from
Rimmel and I just really wanted to go
pink pink and pink for this whole thing
and it's pink chic is this moisture
renew lipstick so it's just a nice nice
creamy pink and then over the top of
that for just a little gloss I used
Nick's mega shine lipgloss in baby rose
this it weren't alone this is extremely
sheer but it just gives that nice
shimmery layer on top of that lipstick
and then I would really suggest a pink
blush to pull the whole look together I
used my Malley 24 7 professional blush
and it's this gorgeous pink shade you
know you use the pink cream blush and
you top it with a powder you can really
use whatever method you want whatever
form but I just felt like that
particular color really worked well with
the pink tone on the eyes and lips so I
hope you all have a wonderful
Valentine's Day things a lot for
watching this video and have a great day
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
