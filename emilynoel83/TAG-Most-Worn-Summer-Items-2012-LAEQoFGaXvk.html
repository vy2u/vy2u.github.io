wanted to kick things off in this video
to let you know that you may not hear
anything from me on youtube for about
the next week or so I'm going to be out
of the country for the first time ever
I'm going to Germany I'm going to my
brother-in-law's wedding and going to be
able to check out the sights and sounds
around Frankfurt area so that's going to
be such an adventure because like I said
I mean it's not going to be my first
international flight and just you know
being in a completely different
environment it's gonna be super fun so I
wanted to get something posted before i
go and i was browsing around YouTube
yesterday and Miss crystal makeup had
actually tagged me in the most worn
summer items for 2012 video and so hers
was super fun to watch she is fun to
watch I hope you'll check out her
channel she's got this great southern
accent super cute and just easy to
listen to fun two wines really kind of
like a summer favorites video on taking
you through like accessories and fashion
and makeup and stuff so I thought I
would go ahead and do that first
question is most worn nail polish and I
really have been rocking my Mally gel
manicure for most of the summer i am
going to be comparing it to another gel
nail system by nailin it's the sensation
nails but the Mallee is definitely what
I've been wearing the most i love this
particular shade that i have on now I've
worn it several times it's called like a
virgin and it's just a wonderful like
light neutral it goes with anything it
looks really nice and clean so I love
that and then on my toes what I've been
wearing most of the summer actually I
just did the gel gel nails on my toes so
those are pink right now but for most of
the summer I've been using this polish
from Milani it's cold bridesmaid and
it's just a really pretty like metallic
it's got actually like a little bit of a
rosy tone to it but it just works nice
on the toes because once again it
matches everything so I've been going to
so many weddings lately what weddings
have been just non-stop and so it's nice
to just have something on your nails
that will match whatever you decide to
wear most use hair product is by far my
hairspray and my Tresemme trade to
hairspray this is my little can
I just took out in my purse I've always
got this with me pretty much and a big
can sitting in the bathroom in most
years bags this one from Isaac Mizrahi I
got this from TJ Maxx it's a nice large
size it fits my iPad in here it's all so
it kind of matches that nail polish it's
sort of a neutral metallic color that
just works with absolutely everything
and I think it'll work you know across
the seasons as well but I love this bag
and i think i'm going to do a what's in
my bag on my vlog channel i also get a
ton of use out of this little coach
clutch I got this is a great little gift
for doing makeup for my friend Katie's
wedding earlier in the spring and I just
find this so versatile sometimes this is
all you want to run into the store with
you know use yes once again I have to
have two answers for everything these
are my wedges from target and there's a
Massimo brand I have these in brown and
black and I wear them a lot if I'm
wearing a little dress I think they're
just perfect they're not overly strappy
so I find them to be kind of comfortable
actually and they weren't so comfortable
when I first bought them but I've broken
them in and I actually really like these
now with jeans too they're really cute
or the best flip-flops I've ever had and
these are from under armour and it's
kind of like a that memory foam idea
when you put your feet down on it like
these are better than going barefoot it
to me and I like going barefoot a lot
but these just are so comfortable and
you never completely like where that
part down you know it always springs
back up and become super cushiony once
again so yeah these are from under
armour I got them from dick's sporting
goods like more than a year ago probably
and they're still holding up great i
love most worn accessories I love a good
cuff bracelet this one that i got from
kato which is a great little clothing
store women's clothing and I wear this
one a lot article of clothing for me
it's got to be these great tops with the
shoulder cutouts you know what I mean
like your shoulder kind of pops out
there I've got several and a little bit
varying styles and stuff this one's from
jcpenney it's got a
tank top underneath there but I just
love these I think there a way to make
your shirt interesting without feeling
like you're revealing too much i wear
these not just foreplay but also to work
on the news I just think they're cute
most worn foundation for the summer has
probably been my colorstay whipped from
Revlon I love the texture of this I love
the staying power it's been a very hot
summer here and this has definitely
proven itself time and time again to be
a great long wearing foundation
texture-wise and I have a full review on
this but it just blends so easily onto
the skin it's just a pleasure to put on
you know foreign blush and bronzer I
kind of bounced around but one that I
always feel like I come back to is my
too faced chocolate soleil bronzer
always gotta smell it smells like
chocolate you got to enjoy that about it
any time you use it but it's a matte
bronzer it can be your all over like
light bronzer it can be your contour
powder it's just really quick and easy
your blush I've been loving the look of
like a fresh pink blush a lot and one of
the prettiest ones is from malli and
it's Malley's glow and a dupe for this
by the way which I also use that on and
off but it's from physicians formula and
it's the happy booster blush but this
has just a little bit of shimmer to it
I'm wearing it now I think it's just the
perfect pink blush worn mascara l may
get up and grow I think I mentioned this
in every video um it's a really nice
thick brush gorgeous nice rich black
lashes and I have repurchased this
recently and it's just kind of a go-to
we all have our go-to I shadows this is
probably one of the hardest ones for me
because I feel like I'm trying to switch
it up a lot I mean if you're like me and
you've got a lot of eyeshadow in your
collection like I try to make it
different almost every day what I do but
the ones that have probably been getting
mixed into the rotation the most have
been my palettes from the balm not just
the nude tude which you guys know I love
so much such a great neutral palette but
also on the shady lady palettes I think
are phenomenal and I recently came up
with the volume 2 this is the ball you
one and they're just nice groupings of
some deep rich colors that can make
pretty smoky looks or kind of nice like
one step looks like one shadow can kind
of do it all over like nice topes and
plum and pretty shades like that they're
also just very user-friendly I mean
they're small enough to where you can
just throw this in your bag not worry
whether or not it's gonna fit so that's
the most morn summer items of 2012 tag I
hope you guys liked it thank you so much
to crystal for tagging me anybody who's
interested in doing this consider
yourself tagged by me and definitely
post your video as a video response and
all be sure to add that so thanks so
much for watching guys see you next time
bike alright so i just sat down and
edited that whole video and realized i
left out the lip product so oops can't
forget that this is from it cosmetics
and this is the vitality lip flush I've
talked about these before I have like
three different colors they don't have a
lot of different colors period but this
shade in particular is called Jenna sick
walls like practically like it would be
transparent as you look at it there it
looks like a clear lip balm almost but
this is the color it gives you on the
lips it's gorgeous it stains your lips a
really pretty berry color and it's so
moisturizing and the moisture stays with
you your lips keep feeling soft this
color stays with me a long time a big
lip product person I rotate a lot I go
through and try to use a lot of
different things but this is definitely
like an outstanding outstanding lip
product and if you're going to check out
something from it cosmetics and I would
highly recommend this be one of the
first things you go for all right that
is really it I'm gonna miss you guys a
lot while I'm in Germany but I will be
back soon and bye for real now see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
