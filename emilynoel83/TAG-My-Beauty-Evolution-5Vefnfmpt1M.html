video because i love doing tag videos
and i think this one hopefully is the
start of the tag that people catch on to
and do and give me some video responses
on it's called my beauty evolution so
think of it as how has my beauty changed
over time or how is my like my makeup
routine or the way I've done my hair
skin care or anything like that what
caused me to even think about this was
somebody was asking me if I had a
certain kind of video and I was like oh
I did that but I did a long time ago and
I like looked back in my video list and
it was one of the first ones I ever did
now it was a poor quality camera and it
was bad lighting and it was you know a
lot of different things were wrong but
um the way I look the way I did my
makeup and everything then was a lot
different from how it is now and I
started my channel it'll be four years
next month so it's been a while and so
that's the time frame i'm gonna use i'm
gonna go back like you know for 25 years
thinking about how things have changed
and i'm just gonna pick five things so
this tag could be i mean you can make it
however you want to make it but I'm just
going to pick five ways that my beauty
routine has changed over about the last
five years I'm not here like beat myself
down for the way I was five years ago or
anything like that because I don't think
that's what we should be doing but I
guess what i want to point out is just
you know after you've tried a bunch of
products and you've learned new things
you know you can just see some change in
i will be the first to say that i'm
definitely you know a work in progress
like I'm just a normal person on here
just kind of sharing my findings about
makeup and what I like to do with it so
yeah I think it's fun to look at
yourself in that way and just kind of
see how things have gotten different
I'm gravitating more toward glowing skin
as opposed to that super matte look
always you know feeling like the desired
finish was always mad and that was
always kind of what I went for you know
flawless matte finish and now you know
not a day goes by that I don't use a
highlight you know and even on the news
I go for a look that involves you know a
little more glow to the skin and I feel
like it brings out my features better it
looks more natural ice makes you look
healthier i feel so I mean that's just
something where I kind of look back and
I think why wasn't i doing that more you
know so that's kind of where this came
from and throughout this video just
threw out some examples but like today I
used this highlight for Maui and like I
used on my cheeks and down my nose and
kind of center of the face here and I
love the look that it gives I feel like
at first like when I first was kind of
getting obsessed with makeup let's say
or skincare I just like I wouldn't
necessarily even moisturize before I
went to bed like I'd get all my makeup
off but then it was just kind of an
afterthought like whether or not I maybe
through some moisturizer on and nowadays
I feel like I concentrate on it so much
more and not just my face but my eye
area morning and night consistently
religiously because you know I want to
keep the aging process at bay as much as
possible so like a couple of
moisturizers that I've come to love and
I think are great during times when I've
had eczema on my face within the past
year I'd say and like a vino ultra
calming moisturizer was amazing for like
moisturizing my skin but not irritating
anything or positively radiant is
another great one they both have SPF so
those are awesome and for eye creams and
i've been using like this garnier
ultralift i don't know that it's the
best ever but it's moisturizing it's
hydrating and i'll use that like before
bed and then something that isn't quite
as emollient I guess you'd say that I
use during the daytime under my makeup
is the Dollar General revived I serum
it's just a dupe of Olay I serum
I used that cut in the morning I really
got into YouTube thing and vlogging and
that stuff I never wore false eyelashes
I went through all of college never put
on a pair of false eyelashes the clue
the-- the whole thing kind of
intimidated me and I just stayed away
from it and then I came to realize just
how fantastically wonderful false
eyelashes can you know make your eyes
look and how much of a transformation I
guess they can give you I now love
experimenting with really natural ones
or more dramatic ones you know switching
it up for different occasions and I just
think it's so fun and I've come to love
that and that's been a huge change you
know over the course of these past 45
years another thing has changed a lot
for me is my lower eyeliner I remember
looking back at past videos and seeing
how I was very I think obsessed with the
eyeliner on the lower lash line looking
very neat and i would use an actual
eyeliner and i would just you know give
myself a nice defined line but i didn't
want to be smudged concision work to go
anywhere it was kind of like being a
little bit of a control freak about your
high liner so like I didn't smudge it
out much I didn't soften it up much and
now I you know especially lately I have
just been using like shadow under my eye
and just really like smudging it out and
keeping it kind of like a soft like my
pencil brush and my smudger brush from
Sonia Kashuk like these brushes as
opposed to a teensy tiny like ankle
liner brush are like my best friends
because now I do a little bit you know
it might be a little bit thicker but
it's more smudgy and it's softer and I
like that look a lot more but that's
definitely not been the way I've always
remember when I kind of got into makeup
I never really saw the nude lip as
something I could wear like for some
reason I just couldn't get used to
seeing myself that way like putting it
on just like that was the risky lip for
me I was somewhat comfortable with going
with darker shades or medium shades or
berry shades but the nude lip was
something that was kind of hard for me
or just a really soft looking lip and so
that's something I feel like definitely
I've gotten more comfortable with and
just branching out as a whole for
example i anchored the news yesterday
with a pretty darn bright red lip you
know and it looked good and I like the
way it came off and but I'll go bury
I'll go you know light pink or just
straight up nude lip and I'm comfortable
with that now and I feel like you've
almost got to start getting used to
seeing yourself different ways instead
of just seeing yourself the same look
day after day after day and I think
that's what prompts us to change and try
new things and feel okay about it
instead of feeling scared or like who's
gonna look at me and what you know what
they going to think about the way way I
have things on and I feel like that kind
of sums up this whole thing in that um
you've got to branch out and try new
things and that lets your routine grow
and change over time because it should
you know I feel like we should all kind
of adjust as we age and as we learn new
things and I'm not big into beauty
related rules and stuff like that but I
think maybe the one rule is to just keep
an open mind and be okay with doing
something new every now and then or
trying a new product so thank you so
much for watching this I hope it was fun
and I hope you're inspired to do this
video as well an awesome day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
