joining me for this video and thanks to
everybody who tagged me for the my
makeup story tag
I love videos like this because I feel
like you're actually learning something
about the person that's making these
videos that you're watching and I mean I
feel like if anybody is new to my
channel I hope you take the time to
watch this because I think you'll learn
maybe some reasons why I am the way I am
from this video I tagged all of you to
do this if you want to I had the
questions down below so just copy and
paste and post a video response because
I don't know I just think this is a
great way to get to know people who
share this common interest that is
makeup so 10 questions so I'll try to
get through them concisely without
rambling if I can for one how old were
you when you started wearing makeup I
was probably about in the seventh grade
because that's when I remember starting
cheerleading in junior high and I think
it was kind of like a time when okay you
know I have a reason maybe to start
using makeup because I've got the you
know we're gonna be cheering at a game I
can wear some powder and lip gloss and
oh my goodness I'm gonna look so
glamorous not really but I think we
thought we were and so that was just
kind of what goddess started and I don't
know that I was wearing it consistently
at that time but that was sort of my
reason to begin and it was a Porsche
drugstore makeup that I used for a
really long time and obviously continue
to use but yeah it was nothing fancy by
any means number two how did you get
into makeup I don't think anybody really
came right out and told me um little
girl you need to be wearing makeup now
mom my sister people in my life you know
that I was close with we're wearing
makeup and it just seemed like the thing
that I was going to do as well and then
it just kind of grew from there I
remember about midway through high
school was when I was really like okay
I'm into makeup you know I loved trying
out new things from the drugstore and I
loved reading magazines and seeing like
the the makeup section of
Seventeen magazine was always like the
best thing for me because like you would
see the editors picks or you would see
you know different products that were in
your stores and you could try them out
and I just I mean that was like my first
time like now you watch you watch haul
videos from people and you're like oh
okay I want to try that now that they've
talked about how great it is but before
it was like he just had magazines it's
like I'm so old number three what are
some of your favorite brands need to
start off by saying whenever I get a
question like that what what is your
favorite brand or brands I feel like
every brand has hits and misses even if
it's a brand you love you're gonna have
some things in there that you don't like
and some things you know some things are
up here some things are down here some
brands have you know less of an extreme
but it's I feel like it's almost always
there so keep that in mind but to name a
few I mean brands that I like from the
drugstore I'm really liking um Nick so
I'm trying more and more things from
that brand and liking a lot of them
Revlon I got a lot of Revlon that I like
a lot of covergirl wet-and-wild
many elf things that I enjoy and then in
the high end it's so much fun to test
out different high-end products cuz if
we're getting close to Christmas and
that's kind of what I asked for more
high-end stuff it's like gifts but I'm
trying more and more Mac and I'm happy
with most of the things I've tried there
and I like Urban Decay I think to face
has adorable packaging and I'm always
excited to get a gift of Smashbox
products so yeah those are some of my
favorite brands I guess what does makeup
mean to you I think he's that start
thinking about makeup and it's like okay
makeup makes you look good makeup makes
you you know look pretty or whatever but
I think it also really affects the
inside as well it affects how you feel
about yourself you know we see time and
time again a person is made over or a
person uses makeup for the first time or
maybe the first time in a long time and
you know there's something happening
internally there as well when you see
yourself in a slightly different way and
times I think people say you know you
need to see yourself as this or that and
sometimes I think we just need that
physical way of truly seeing ourselves
not just like seeing ourselves if you
know what I mean and I've seen that so
much more through my youtube channel the
feedback that I've been given some of
the most powerful feedback has been a
person who maybe hasn't used makeup and
in a while or hasn't used it at all and
then his message me and said this has
opened up a whole new level of
confidence in my life that I never had I
am meeting people I'm getting out there
I'm not as scared to put my to put
myself out there and open myself up to
people that's fantastic that's a
wonderful thing and so makeup is having
a more profound meaning for me now than
it did in the past number five if you
could only wear four products on your
face what would they be I don't know I
wear a lot of different products on my
face I'm sorry I like sort this out man
let's go with concealer bronzer mascara
and a lip product a love a lipstick or a
lip gloss I would say because then I've
got my imperfections covered I've got
some color to my skin I've got something
accentuating my eyes a little bit and
something brightening up the lips and
therefore the face with a lipstick so
there you go what is your favorite thing
about makeup this I think this kind of
goes back to what does makeup mean to
you but um my favorite thing I think I
think my favorite thing about makeup is
the way it makes me feel I mean I kind
of am of the belief that we don't just
love things in life but we love the way
those things make us feel we love the
feeling we get from different things so
I love the feeling that makeup gives me
it's a feeling of confidence happiness
it brings about creativity in me it's
kind of like an art form it's a form of
expression and it's also been sort of a
means by which I teach people kind of
over YouTube
that's a very fulfilling thing so I mean
makeup just has been the avenue to so
many positive feelings for me I've
always I've always enjoyed any activity
that can give me like an unlimited
creative spectrum like in cheerleading I
did a lot of the choreography when I was
on squads whether it's high school or
college you know making up the routines
and it's just like you know your
imagination is the only thing holding
you back there and makeup is the same
way I mean you can do whatever you want
with that and also from the collector
sand standpoint like I like buying
makeup I like having a collection of it
and just trying new things number seven
what do you think about drugstore makeup
versus high-end makeup if you know my
channel well I think you kind of know
how I feel about this I think that there
is there are so many drugstore products
that are just as good if not better than
high-end but I feel like sometimes we
get so drawn into not um okay here's a
good way to put in perspective how many
talk shows have we seen where okay we
bring in a set of twins and we're going
to put drugstore makeup on one and
high-end makeup on the other and then
we're gonna send them out on the streets
and guess what nobody can tell the
difference this is the way these things
always work out it seems like and I
guess I what I take from that is that
sometimes we care too much about the
name on the outside of something you
know whether it be this brand or the
brand I just held up there we care about
that more than we do how it actually
looks on us
you know I'm gonna take a step back and
maybe one day do yourself up 100 percent
drugstore and see if you think you look
not as good as you might otherwise I
mean I just think application is so
important having the knowledge is like
is a priceless are there high-end
products that are better than some
drugstore products absolutely I mean I
feel like there's
no there's just no consistent this is
always better than that I just think
you've got to think about technique
learn how to use the products and you
will find that even many inexpensive
products can do amazing things for you
what is one tip of advice you can give
to a beginner um the first thing that
occurs to me when I hear that is
imagining a person who has barely used
makeup that is just now logging onto
YouTube discovering the whole beauty
community and frankly is they're
probably feeling kind of overwhelmed
because there are tutorials showing you
how to get the most elaborate glam look
for your New Year's Eve celebration it
involves you know everything under the
Sun on your face and it's like I imagine
that would feel pretty overwhelming so
I'd say if you're new to YouTube there's
so much to look at in terms of makeup I
would say just don't be overwhelmed and
don't feel like you have to try
absolutely everything you see or have
everything on your face or whatever you
know take it at your own pace and do
what you feel comfortable with and
definitely practice you will feel so
much more confident during those times
when you do have the Big Dance and you
know you're going getting ready for
homecoming and
instead of being in a situation where my
gosh I never wear makeup this is the one
of the only times I put it on inhale and
guess what I'm stressed you know go
ahead and take those times when you
don't have to be anywhere to really play
around and allow yourself to make
mistakes and continue to practice number
nine is what is one makeup trend you
never understood when I first looked at
this question I kind of thought I don't
really know if I were wearing this and
then I chose to take like a brown lip
pencil and go around it there was a time
when I guess people were doing that but
I don't I don't know I never really got
that there's not a lot I'm not a big
makeup Rules person I don't like to sit
out there and say you know you can do
this you can't do this I think that's
kind of ridiculous because makeup is
everyone's own individual form of
expression but I don't know that's
something I personally would never do
number ten what do you think about the
beauty community on YouTube
thankful for the beauty community on
YouTube it's provided a format for me to
share so much and take in so much so
many great things from it so it's been a
very give-and-take type thing I feel
like I'm putting out videos but I'm also
taking in so much advice from other
people who do videos and from people who
subscribe and leave great comments I
mean it's just a wonderful thing and you
think about in the world you know you
may be going to school and and maybe you
just love makeup or you have some
interest it's not makeup you have
something very specific that you really
enjoy but you don't you just don't have
a lot of people there at school maybe
that you can share that with I mean I
think we've all been there maybe with
one thing or another where you just
didn't have a lot of people around you
that that had that thing that passion in
common with you but thanks to YouTube
thanks to the Internet in general I mean
we we can connect I feel like sometimes
people stumble into the beauty community
and like will come across the video and
maybe they are not interested at all but
they found the video and they feel
compelled to leave like a negative
comment I mean you know there will be
negativity out there but I mean
especially to younger people who are
making videos now on YouTube consider
this an early newsflash that the world
is not perfect and in any anything you
get into in life not everybody's gonna
like everything you do or everything you
have to say
not everybody's gonna agree with you and
there will always be a person in your
life that's probably not gonna be all
that cracked up about you and so I think
the earlier in life you can realize that
learn how to deal with it inside the
better off you're going to be so
consider yourself this like a motive
prepper of life preparation if you're a
young person and you're making videos on
YouTube and you're taking in any critics
of you and you're dealing with that in a
good way you're definitely a step ahead
in life for dealing with these things
because it's not
gonna end I mean we're not we're not all
going to live in a happy perfect
Wonderland all all the time
but what we can be happy about is that
like there are so many there's such a
large amount of support going on in this
YouTube beauty community that we have a
lot to be thankful for and a lot of
people that are willing to leave kind
uplifting supportive comments and that's
great so thanks so much to everybody for
stopping by and listening to all this I
hope you found it somewhat interesting
or maybe just at least learned a thing
or two about me you didn't know before
so I hope you do this tag and if you do
post it as a video response and I will
see you next time have a great day hi hi

makeup story like when did you start
using makeup do you like drugstore or do
