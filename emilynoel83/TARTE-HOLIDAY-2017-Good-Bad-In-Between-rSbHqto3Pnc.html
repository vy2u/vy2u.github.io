holiday review huge amount of holiday
stuff heart goes big for the holidays
with pallets and gift sets there's so
many different configurations of things
they have sent me a lot of the stuff
that they are putting out for the
holidays I think nearly everything and
yeah I've been trying it out I have been
going back and forth with different ways
to put this video out at one point I
thought I'll just do two you know cheek
and lip stuff in one video pallets in
another video but then there's something
about it to me I think it's more
satisfying to like see it all laid out
all in one video because I think it's
easier for the viewer to then see what
I'm saying and make comparisons across
the board and be like okay it's any of
this worth my time or you know which
bits and pieces do I really like so I
decided I would wait until I got to the
point where I could talk about it all
and so that's where I am now and I want
to preface this by saying I don't think
we need to settle at all with any
holiday stuff
there are so many brands where they're
putting out a strong eye palette this
brands putting out great lip products
this brands got a great face thing you
know and there's so much good that comes
out this time of year I don't think you
have to go looking at one brands thing
and say okay what do I need to get from
this brand if none of it appeals to you
leave it alone the way I'm going to
approach this video is I've got like
three piles I've got a pile of yes a
pile of no and a pile of maybe kind of
in the middle my biggest pile is the no
pile ok so just keep that in mind I
don't think you have to settle for
anything I'm not doing these videos
thinking I have to come up with
something I like out of this you know if
I really didn't like any of it I tell
you that but in this big bunch of things
I'll be talking about there are I think
some really good finds and I think I'll
just start with the stuff I like best
cuz that's what I've got sitting up here
around me right now so we're gonna dive
in and do that first
now Tarte has come out with a couple of
brush sets one is exclusive to their
website and Sephora and the other is
exclusive to their website and Macy's
this is the Sephora set this is the
Macy's set I'm here to say these are
both really good brush sets definitely
without a doubt some of the best stuff
that Tarte has put out this holiday
season are
brushes now these little containers are
part of and there are little plastic
inserts here which I have kept in here
just so you can better see you know what
you're getting but that will come out
and these can turn into brush holders
that hold a number of other products but
each brush set is five brushes and the
one that I really like best is the one
that comes from Sephora and before I get
too ahead of myself the whole theme for
this year's Tarte Holiday Collection is
tart delight and it seems like kind of a
I don't know Moroccan inspired like you
can see on the back of this packaging
it's this kind of idea and what's
interesting about the brushes is like
each brush and they're so shiny it's
might even be hard to tell but each
brush has a different little design on
it but this set from Sephora that comes
in the gold tone container here
something that I noticed right away when
I started using these is that they feel
kind of light where I'm getting that
feeling from is the handle it's not a
big weighty handle and that really
doesn't bother me too much because where
it counts
I feel like this is classic you know
tart brush quality I think Tarte does
really good brushes I've been a fan of a
lot of the things they've done but it's
a really good ferrule and the brush
itself SuperDuper soft but it's just not
gonna feel super weighty in the hand
just FYI the set that I like the most
this is a great foundation brush a nice
full buffing foundation brush for liquid
or powder this largest brush I mean I
used it today for like bronzer and
contour I think it's really nice for
that because it's so pinched here toward
the top this next brush this really
spoke to me at first as being a
highlight brush but I love it for
concealer blending too this could be a
lot of things this could also easily
chisel out like a cheek contour very
multi-purpose there and then a couple of
eye brushes or you know I see this
little chunky guy as even a concealer
brush for more precise areas this
obviously and I blending brush excuse me
you know just blend out the edges these
are so soft so that's gonna really lend
itself to that type of knee but we're
talking $44 on each of these sets and I
think they are well worth it one for
Macy's is kind of like a cardboard box I
don't want to say like it's in a
cardboard box it feels more like the
exterior of one of their pallets let's
say and you got a big powder brush with
this one a blush brush which is really
nice
the foundation II brush that's in this
one is a little bit more dense like
there's not quite as much movement to it
across the skin as there is with the one
in the Sephora set and I kind of prefer
the Sephora one I think it blends out
just a bit easier you got a brush here
that's nearly identical to the Real
Techniques contour brush that I like so
much so this could definitely be contour
this could be highlighter this could
even be a pop of blush on the cheeks and
then you've got an eye brush that is
real similar in cut and designed to like
a Sigma e25 which you guys might know if
you watch a lot of my videos that's the
first thing that I kind of go to my
crease with you know to start building
up color there this is a little smaller
than that this could even get some color
on the lid too so I do think Tarte tends
to put out really nicely thought out
nicely designed brush collections and
they're definitely the strengths of
their holiday stuff this time around and
if you're just looking toward one I
think the one for Sephora is the most
like well-rounded meets every need
really nicely type of set Tarte had some
large pallets that I'll be talking about
here that they put out around the
holidays I'll just tell you now those
are not in my favorites stack the one
thing i shadow related that i really
liked that they put out for holiday is
this little palette right here it's
called buried treasure and it is
available at Sephora and I really enjoy
it I kind of glanced at it at first and
thought okay okay Tarte you know these
are kind of classic Tarte type colors
but they are a really really Pleasant
nice very soft texture to work with and
when we're thinking giftable palettes
like this is giftable this would be a
nice little thing to give somebody I
think the outer design is actually
really cute and then everything on the
inside is truly like nice wearable stuff
and for the holidays this kind of Ruby
shade that's happening down here this
deep burgundy red is so gorgeous the
shades that are purely matte are this
kind of like dusty topi gray lilac
you've also got a light soft brown here
which is great in the crease and then a
little cream right here these down here
are more of a satin finish they still
work really nicely in the crease and
then you've got several shades that
really are shiny including a golden
color down here so I used that for my
eye look today there's so much stuff
that I'm going to be talking about in
this video I did not shoot
demo of this but if you are interested
in a tutorial let me know it's just I
think a very basic easy pallet oh and
here's the other little thing this shade
right here okay my friend David he
watched my video about like blending
mistakes that I'm making and I was
talking about having trouble really
blending the inner part of my eye crease
area and he said to go back and forth
between a face powder and your eye
shadow and just keep kind of going back
and forth and getting it all nicely
buffed out that way I said that's a
great idea and I have done that and it
worked really well and then I saw this
shade in this palette and I thought
that's kind of like you know my skin
tone maybe just a little lighter and I
started using that method with that
color works so well because this is such
a rich and pigmented matte color and
then I thought oh I just want to take
that down a little bit more in like
brighten up my inner corners so that's
what I did actually with this brush out
of the Sephora set i dabbed into this
shade and i took it right around yes
this fully opaque eyeshadow sorry my
camera's struggling and I took it right
around my inner corner and even just
under the eye a little bit for
brightening and I thought that worked so
so well like I could not believe how
brightened and wonderful that was so
anyway I enjoy this palette I like the
kind of look that this is going to
create for me it's just very much my
style of eye look and I'm gonna get a
lot of use out of it there's one lip set
that I'm really loving from Tarte this
year and it's the pout pleasures it's a
set of five full-size lippy lingerie and
jumbo pencils and this lippy lingerie
idea I mean I think basically what
they've done is taken their old lip
surgence which was their jumbo lip
pencil and they did have a matte version
of those and this to me seems to be that
formula all over again and I really
liked that it was really easy to wear on
the lips non-drying just a comfortable
matte formula but I think this lippy
lingerie line might be a little more
focused on nudes and I just love the
color selection in here because we're
talking nude to deep neutral into berry
and I think that's what I find to be
really wearable really the type of shade
I'd like to reach for on a daily basis
like I do love a bright red here and
there or even an orange --red but these
are kind of those cozy nice colors that
it's like this time of year
I think they pair so well with the kinds
of eye looks that I want to do for fall
and winter and they make your lips just
feel like pillows my lips haven't even
been in especially like the best
condition I would say they're on the dry
side right now and I still can put on
one of these matte colors and they look
great today I'm wearing the most berry
it's like the deepest one and I've also
got a little thing added on with this
and it's this lipped top or hardest lip
paint in tinsel this is really cool at a
glance you think okay is that just a
champagne gold but then you look up
closely it's got this like pinky shift
to the shimmer that's in here and I
think this is dynamite paired with the
lippy lingeries so you can put this on
and sometimes with these I only like
putting them on the center of my lower
lip which is kind of what I've done
today but what I'm using I would say
like the three lightest shades in this
little collection I put this all over
the entire lip and it's so gorgeous I
mean I typically wouldn't go for this
sometimes when they put out just a
single product around the holidays I'm
like okay you know be better value if
this was part of a set or something but
this truly I keep coming back to it and
I think it's so special they've put this
awesome cap on it which I really think
is cute so guys that's it that is the
stuff that I would recommend from the
Tarte Holiday Collection and if that's
all you came for was the recommendation
thanks for being here I'll see you later
if you want to get the dirt on
everything else that was not so good
stay with me I have three things in my
kind of average pile like these are
things that I thought were pretty good
but I have one small gripe about them
all I believe this is called the posh
pouty lip set it's $36 at Sephora what
they're doing here is giving you two
boxes inside so like two things you
could gift separately one box contains
four mini sizes of the glossy lip paints
and one has four of the matte quick dry
lip paints if you wanted to mix them up
and give them to somebody I kind of go
half and half in here you could do that
because there's no real label of what
they are on the outside of the box but
there is a to and from on the back
here's my deal with these I actually
like both of these formulas I think the
glossy lip paints are opaque not too
sticky pretty easy to apply and for the
most part they go on evenly and with the
mattes there is a significant and rather
quick dry down with these and it's a
pretty complete dry down I feel they're
not gonna be as comfortable on your lips
as the bare minerals Jen nude you know
so that would kind of be my top pick
these aren't killing my lips in terms of
dryness but they are significantly drier
than the bare minerals just so you know
if you've never tried these you are
getting actually the exact same kinds of
shades in each granted they are
different finishes but I mean you're
getting the nude the mauve the warm red
and the berry and both of them I found
that everything applied really
consistently like with the glossy ones I
thought these first three were all
really nicely opaque and then I got to
the last one and it was streaky and it
was hard to get that full on even
application with the darkest color and
then I had that same issue with the
mattes which I thought was odd like I
put it on and I could eventually get to
a place where I was satisfied with it
but it took a lot more work and then the
other three shades did I like the
concept of this kit I like the thought
of to individually giftable items within
one box if you were gonna keep it all
for yourself keep in mind you're getting
two boxes of basically the same shades
just different finishes that might
appeal to some people might not appeal
to others I did struggle a bit with the
darkest shade in both sets couple of
blush items that are just in the middle
for me from Tarte the first
one is the set of five just individual
blushes I don't really have any
complaints about the quality of these in
terms of the pigmentation and the way
they blend down on the cheeks and stuff
like that I think they apply nicely the
thing that kind of was odd to me is that
they're all in a peachy coral color
scheme if that is your go-to blush shade
and you love the Amazonian clay blushes
then this might be right up your alley
I just thought it was a little bit odd
that everything had a varying amount of
peach in it except you know there is
this kind of mauve shade here but
everything else goes from dusty peach to
more of a pure peach to a soft coral to
a really deep coral this one the mauve
and then this kind of true peach shade
here they have a little bit of a satin
finish the rest or mattes yeah not
really a quality concern for me but I
just found it a little bit odd that
everything fell into kind of a peachy
look there the blush Bazaar palette $44
at Sephora so this thing
is about the size of their like
rainforest of the sea I think it's
called eyeshadow palettes and you open
it up and you've got two sides of blush
here just divided by a sheet but the
sheet is connected to the palette and
it's perforated if you wanted to get rid
of that eight blushes and two highlights
so eight blushes you know that's a lot
for one palette to have that many
different blushes and all but one of the
blushes seemed to be mad this one has a
little shimmer and of course your
highlights one more pinky tone one a
little more golden tone those have
shimmer but everything else is met and
some are more like berry moths summer a
little bit peachy I think got a really
pure pink up here a little bit more
neutral tone over here it's kind of a
nice variety but I guess the way I see
it is this is for the blush lover unless
you're absolutely nuts for tarts blushes
I think this is a lot of blush I think
blush palettes can be a little excessive
at times and I find myself wanting in
addition to the blushes if you're gonna
give me this much like product and a
compact can we just have one like sort
of face powder shade can we have one
color that's a bronzer or maybe
something that could function really
nicely as a contour it causes me to look
at that hourglass palette that they put
out this year and say
you know that's a multitasking pallet I
just I'm dying for a few more things to
be in here besides just the blush and
the two highlights the hourglass one you
know they put in a couple of blushes and
I found that to be totally adequate and
then you had a couple of different like
finishing powder type things the bronzer
the highlight and boom a lot was
happening all in one small space here
they could have cut the amount of blush
they gave you in half and done other
things with the other pans and I think
it would have been so much more useful
now I'm going to move on to the pile of
things that I just didn't go for that
Tarte put out for the holidays one of
those things is the goddess glow
highlighter $35 at Sephora comes in a
compact like this now this is the size
of that little eyeshadow palette that I
was talking about at the start that I
really like it's a pretty imprint
they're what's turning me off from this
is that it's kind of chunky and once it
sheers out on your cheeks the glitter is
very apparent in this it's a fine
glitter but it's totally there it's just
this big compact of it it doesn't appeal
to me enough for me to come anywhere
close to using that up like if this was
just a small sliver and a palette
somewhere I could maybe look past it you
know but I would not seek this out for
$35 on its own and say that's a
highlight I'm loving I just don't like
to get an up-close look at my skin and
see the flecks of glitter it takes a
highlight from looking beautiful and
possibly natural and possibly coming
from you know your own body instead of
being that it turns into a very
artificial look so I'm not into that
also there is a blush palette again with
the plushes this is gonna cost you $39
and it's an Ulta product here you can
see a pretty exterior on the palette and
they usually put out a blush palette
kind of like this every year for the
most part with one exception everything
in here is very bright this one shade
has some shimmer for whatever reason
it's always a coral shade that has a
little golden shimmer in any palette
that they put out of blushes it's just
okay for me it once again follows the
thought of it's all in a palette but do
I need four blushes in a palette or
would I have rather had a palette that
gave me one or two blushes and a couple
of other things that I could use in
other ways on my face I just glanced at
it and I
I've seen it over and over again tart
that's just that's my thought a lip set
that I really didn't go for this year is
their lips sculptor collection and they
have done some good sets of this type of
product before and what these are is a
half lipstick half lip gloss so with
this set you're getting five they're $34
and available at Ulta but it kind of
ticked me off about this set was that I
felt like they gave you two shades two
out of the five that are really really
close like these look so so similar you
see them swatched out you see them on
the lips they're a lot of like a five
piece set I don't want to see overlap so
you're basically getting too peachy
nudes then there's a pink and then there
are two shapes that I just would not
wear in this format one is a deep red
and one is more of a bright red I'm kind
of runnin from the glossy version of
these shades because the tendency to
drift is totally there and these are not
like thick really adhere to your lips
types of glosses if these drift they
will show and these are very creamy
lipsticks too so if those start to drift
outside your lip line it will be very
obvious in these shades if we're talking
dark berry and bright red give me a
matte in those and I will be happy now I
have three big palettes here one is the
Ulta exclusive palette 1 is the Macy's
exclusive and one is the Sephora
exclusive guys I'm just not I can't get
behind any of these Hart is just kind of
putting out the same holiday stuff every
year and it's getting kind of boring to
me and I find myself just looking at
these and sort of glazing over and I'm
sorry but that's just how I feel about
it here's something to keep in mind
Tarte has shown us what they can do with
eyeshadows they've put out the Tarte lip
palette tartlet in bloom now the tartlet
toasted and it's like that's where
they're gonna put their good quality
eyeshadows buttery smooth mattes very
pigmented very rich some nice shimmers
to work with as well and then holiday
season rolls around and it will be
blatantly obvious whether they
incorporated that type of formula into
their palette or whether they did not in
that little palette that I mentioned
toward the start of the video the buried
treasure one I thought those were soft
pigmented easy to work with easy to
blend
shadows it's like yes that's a small
palette we'll put those in there but
these big palettes you gotta watch him
because like this one from Ulta for
example the packaging is so cute guys
it's almost killing me to say like I
don't like this palette but we all know
Mike that'll draw us in but months later
are we still going to be using it it
opens up with this really cute design
you know there's these little sort of
petals that come out and then you've got
your big ipalo right there in the center
I also have complaints about the
construction of two of the three of
these pallets and it's because you're
going to have to keep track of this
clear sheet if you want to keep these
shades and these shades from
compromising one another because
otherwise they're going to be folding
into each other all the time
highlight up here blush blush sort of a
bronzer but a very light bronzer you
contour shade there's a TARDIS mascara
here's a matte lip paint a glossy lip
paint and a sex kitten eyeliner not mad
about all the extras they were willing
to throw in there because I think those
are very wearable shades in the lip
colors and it's nice to have an eyeliner
and a mini mascara sure why not although
that's not my favorite formula that they
make that's fine these eyeshadows though
very hit and miss you might recall last
year when I reviewed tarts collection
they put out a really nice palette for
Ulta if you still have that just dig
that out use that enjoy that don't waste
your time with this one it's not at all
what you would find in one of their tart
look palettes let's say and also last
year the colors in their Ulta palette
we're so like vibrant they have some
really nice shades here yes they're
giving you a copper they've got a little
bit of a greenish color scheme a little
bit of Plum I'm not completely against
everything they chose to put in here but
to me I see it and think it's close to
what they did last year but not quite as
good and then you touch the matte shades
it's like where's where's the intensity
these don't feel like they're mattes
that they put in there other nice
palettes and then this expect me to
travel somewhere and remember deodorant
toothpaste and a clear sheet I'm getting
too fired up about this next let's talk
about the Sephora thing not quite as
like cute in terms of what it looks like
on the outside but it's still you know
pretty but it opens up like this again
gonna have dark eyeshadows we're gonna
have a clear sheet that you must keep
track of if you want to keep those away
from these face products and of course
they put the face product side of this
door going right over your darkest
eyeshadows I mean at least maybe they
could have flip-flopped the sides that
these things are on over here is where
your extras will be it says hidden
treasures
well I found them got a lights camera
lashes mascara a TARDIS matte lip paint
in a very workable very nice shade and a
full-size of the sex kitten eyeliner
there's a plastic insert here that could
come out so you could put these items
and probably several more in there and
then there is a mirror on this side now
you tell me how I'm supposed to use that
mirror am i realistically gonna hold
this whole palette across my face and I
guess I could put that part in and then
do my shadow this way like no that's
just that's not realistic a shadow
selection is just not doing it for me I
mean I'm glancing at it and I'm thinking
okay we've got two maybe three really
dazzling options here
you know these shades are nice nice
metallics I also like this matte here in
this Burgundy matte but then everything
else it's like some of these mats are so
so dark you don't get to see the full
extent of what they can do on your eyes
because they're that dark like this blue
is so dark you can't really take
advantage of how blue it is these colors
down here just very very dusty plums not
purpley enough at all to even be able to
recognize that there's much purple
happening interestingly enough though
the quality of these shadows is much
better than the Ulta palette like these
do feel more like what they're putting
out in their Tarte lip palettes I just
can't really get behind the color scheme
I think part of its boredom and the
thought that this is the kind of thing
they put out every year this like here's
your little gradient you know to an
ultimately darkest shade even those
pretty shimmery statement shades in here
that I really like are not uncommon and
you guys know we're seeing dark reddish
Browns and burgandy's everywhere and
they did a nice condensed palette of the
kinds of colors that I would really like
to wear over here on this side you've
got two nice blushes no complaints
two nice deep bronzers actually these go
on very deep the highlight a real
big pan of it here like the size of a
standard powder compact and it's not
very good I really like dug into this
shade and I did not think it delivered
so allow me to replace my clear sheet
and put this one away finally the most
reasonably constructed pallet that
they've put out is the one for Macy's
there's no sheet it's just I shadow is
alone in its own little place here
doesn't need any roommates so it's all
by itself and then you've got this
mirror here where if you were to sit
this like on a table in front of you you
would feel like yeah I can look directly
into that and see my whole face so
that's cool quality of the shadows I
would put this somewhere in the middle
it's not as good and consistent as the
Sephora palette but it's not quite as
hit-and-miss as the Ulta one either it's
just sort of in-between for me you know
I'm kind of interested in these earthy
shades up here I like these light kind
of blush tones in the bottom row but I
just feel like Tarte has so much
repetition one holiday to the next and
if you've found recently like a palette
that they've done over the holidays that
you really like like for me it was the
ultimen that they put out last year keep
that enjoy that the outside of the
eyeshadow you do have a contour
highlight blush which is okay for me you
can multitask this highlight in here I
actually kind of enjoy I think a ton of
people would be able to wear that blush
and then on the other side three little
extras with an insert here that does
come out so you could use this different
ways but there's a glossy lip paint in
just a nice sort of neutral tan color
itar-tass lash paint in a mini sex
kitten eyeliner so I guess if I had to
pick a favorite of these three bigger
palettes I'd probably pick the Macy's
one if you're just dying for a large
palette from Tarte this season like even
though the shadow quality and the
Sephora one was the best the shade
selection kind of bothered me like so
much darkness and not a lot of
interesting shades worked in so guys
that's my take on tarte holiday this
year I've got some things I definitely
enjoyed but some things I really didn't
enjoy also and then of course those few
things in the middle let me know what
you think of this line in the comments
section also let me know what other
holiday releases you're interested in
seeing me review and I will talk to you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
