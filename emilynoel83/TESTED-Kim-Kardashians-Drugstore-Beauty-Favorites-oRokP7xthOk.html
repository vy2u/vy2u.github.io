to bring you a kind of different video
concept today I actually just stumbled
across an article online where Kim
Kardashian had mentioned some of her
favorite low-cost beauty products and I
thought well this is interesting because
it was coming from her personally she
was doing the interview I do follow her
main makeup artist Mario and he does
offer a lot of product information here
and there but I found this especially
interesting because it was coming from
her she was talking about the things
that she actually does work into her
daily beauty routine and some of the
things were pretty inexpensive I do
think it's very compelling when major
celebrities sort of divulge some of
those things that they see as must-haves
now I thought I would stick to the
bargain beauty products that were coming
up in these articles some of them I
already had some I needed to pick up and
I thought I just tried myself and give
you you know an everyday person's
perspective on how these things work
first thing that Kim says she loves are
the Neutrogena makeup removing cleansing
towelettes in this night calming version
and I had never tried this particular
kind before I am familiar with the
regular Neutrogena towelettes but there
really is I think a rather heavy
fragrance with these and it says ultra
soft nourishing cloths to gently
dissolve all traces of makeup even
waterproof mascara now while I was able
to remove a full face of rather heavy
makeup
it took me definitely longer than it
does with my Olay or equate daily
facials cleansing cloths the kinds that
are dry but that you add water to and
then they sets up so be style that was
really do an amazing job a quick job and
they don't irritate my eyes these maybe
it was just all the fragrance in here
that my face wasn't used to but when I
was using it around my eyes to remove
the eye makeup I found it to be a little
bit borderline irritating so I know
pre-moistened towelettes are very handy
to have around but probably not
something I'm going to repurchase
another Neutrogena product that Kim
mentioned liking to keep in her shower
is this Neutrogena fresh
foaming cleanser and so this is
something of course you could use to
remove makeup or just you know on clean
skin just to get sort of a fresh start
maybe at the start of the day it totally
does foam up a lot and when you rinse it
off your skin feels really really clean
and comparing this to my Holy Grail like
liquid cleanser the CeraVe hydrating
cleanser I don't know my skin has gotten
so accustomed to that and I feel like
that one is really good about not
stripping your skin too much and before
any moisturizer goes on my skin it just
tends to feel a lot more dry after I use
this and what I use the CeraVe it's just
a little more I don't know plumped up
feeling and supple I think people who
have more oily skin might really enjoy
this but for me it's again not one of
those products I'm going to swap into my
routine next thing is the drugstore hair
product that Kim says she likes and it's
the finesse moisturizing shampoo and
conditioner I was able to get my hands
on the moisturizing two-in-one shampoo
and conditioner and I got to say this
stuff is awesome it lathers up into
probably the richest lather that I have
ever experienced from a shampoo it's
crazy it just gets really really thick
and sudsy but it rinses very clean and I
do feel like my hair has been a little
bit more manageable in terms of styling
and maybe that's the moisturizing
element to this the smell on it very
old-school like takes me back to the
early days I think it reminds me of when
I was a kid I don't know my mom probably
had finesse in our shower but it's like
classic clean soapy no frills added but
still kind of strong it's kind of
refreshing actually it's very different
from anything else that's in my shower
so I gotta say I love that the next
thing talked about in a recent article
is the cheap body oil that Kim and Chloe
used every night and it is bio oil and I
did have just a little sample size
actually
and this says contains the breakthrough
ingredient pure sellin oil and in the
claims it says helps improve the
appearance of scars stretch marks uneven
skin tone aging skin and dehydrated skin
applied twice daily for a minimum of
three months or during pregnancy applied
twice daily from the start of the second
trimester so very specific there I have
used this all over my
skin and I do think it really really
hydrates and softens the skin I feel
like my skin comes away with the very
same feel I have if I use my tarte
maracuja oil or my josie maran argan oil
all over i was also glad to see that I
could use this even on my legs after I'd
shaved in the shower and there was no
irritation there and I haven't been
using this during a pregnancy I can't
really comment on you know how well it
did in a before and after since maybe
the next time around we'll be able to
test it that way but I'm a big scent
person and scent wise on this every time
I catch a whiff of it for some reason it
kind of reminds me of a doctor's office
kind of a like classic dial
antibacterial soap type scent nothing
super amazing in the scent Department
for me but I have a sense that people
are using this for many more practical
purposes besides the way it smells that
I really did like the way this made my
skin feel and it is something I would
pull out again and kind of keep in my
body moisturizer rotation now I'm sorry
I don't have more like actual makeup
things to talk about in this video but
there are a couple of low-cost slash
products that Kim's makeup artist does
talk about using on her all the time
apparently and it's a combination of
L'Oreal voluminous I just have the
regular version here and the Ardell
individuals the dural lashes in medium
and long lengths so let's talk about the
voluminous mascara first there's no
doubt about it this is a really
volumizing formula I think it's got a
great brush it adds a lot of thickness
to the lashes a couple of the
shortcomings for me would be that it's
not especially lengthening and also I'm
a straight lash person who really has to
curl my lashes every time and always
after I apply voluminous it kind of
straightens them out again the other
product here from ardell and I actually
have the starter kit of the individual
false lashes it comes with a clear glue
a remover there's pointed tip tweezers
and then short medium and long lengths
to the individual lashes individual
false lashes are something I never find
myself talking about first off I find
the application to be a lot more tedious
than strip lash I mean it only makes
sense that applying glue across a whole
band and then popping it on your eyes
getting instant
impact is easier than taking individual
lash bundles dipping them in glue and
then placing them all across your lash
line however you are going to get a much
more natural and undetectable look to
your lashes if you use this kind like I
think it will be much more likely that
someone will think oh you just have
really great lashes if you're wearing
something like this and so on my lash
line I did two mediums sort of in the
middle I actually placed a short on the
inner part and one long on the outside
and I actually think the long might be
even a little longer than necessary for
my lashes but the overall effect is very
wispy and lengthened I do think it's a
pretty look but it took me probably
three times longer than applying regular
false lashes but let me know in the
comments section do you wear individual
false lashes or under what circumstances
do you like to wear them I never see
questions about these so I kind of like
to open up the discussion but it is
something that I think right now I don't
feel extremely confident in my
application I think as time goes on I
would get better at it and faster at it
so there you go guys just an everyday
person testing out some of Kim
Kardashian's favorite low-cost beauty
products thank you so much for taking
time to watch you may see more videos
like this in the near future and I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
