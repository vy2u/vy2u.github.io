I am joining you with a full face of elf
an elf one brand tutorial I know I've
done an elf one brand but it was a long
time ago and a lot of those products may
or may not be around or there's so many
new things now that it's not quite so
relevant anymore and I have had a lot of
requests to do more one brand looks and
also reduce some of the ones that are
older and let me tell you we got some
new stuff in this video some weird stuff
some unusual products but I'm also gonna
mix those things in with some classic
elf products so it's just gonna be elf
madness and this video first thing on
the weird list is this water droplet
balm and this says this lightweight
moisturizer transforms from a balm to
water for a refreshing and cooling
sensation and you're supposed to apply
it to clean skin morning or night rub
into skin for optimal absorption this is
like solid you guys like there's a
little bit of moisture when you touch it
but that is like hard so you're gonna
kind of press into it kind of feels like
a hardened thing of Noxzema a little bit
if you've ever worked with that or
actually butter that's what it makes me
think of like it's kind of the color of
butter it's actually a little bit hard
to just put your finger in and pick it
up immediately but I'm gonna start
rubbing this into my skin and it's
immediately going to this super thin
like yeah then as water type of feel
well maybe just a teeny bit thicker than
water but not much
sent to this product but it's just it is
ultra-thin now like it's crazy so I've
got that on all over and I was wearing
this and the last couple days and I
don't feel like it's quite enough
moisture for me I'm a normal skin type
and it feels like fine now but I was
really keeping an eye on my face like as
I went throughout the day the other day
and I thought I actually felt a little
bit dry which was weird I had some
staying power issues with my makeup like
in the center of my face but overall I
felt more dry than I usually do but
today I think I used a little bit extra
so maybe that'll help and then I've also
got this this is a little bit strange
guys I mean it's a gel mist literally a
hydrating gel mist a gel to liquid mist
that plumps and hydrates and it says to
apply this to clean skin or after
moisturizer allowed to absorb into skin
prior to primer application and I'm just
gonna brace myself here because this
comes out with with some intensity it
just hits you Oh
it hits you with a lot of moisture it's
the amount of moisture that makes you
feel the need to go over it with your
hands you know how setting spray is just
kind of like fine mist and we're good
and you don't need to touch it yeah you
kind of feel like you need to touch this
I don't know what the point is I'm not
really sure why I bought it
I just thought Oh gel mist that's
different I mean it's just a thing of
gel it sprays out really like gel I mean
I don't know that it really went gel to
liquid this the texture of the product
literally transformed into something
different here I think they're just
pushing the gel out through a sprayer
and it's coming out what's so intense
like it feels like a lot I would never
throw this on like later in the day over
my makeup and yeah it did give me a
little added moisture my skin actually
feels kind of sticky now but that's
another one of the things that I have
worn alongside the water droplet balm
and it wasn't again the combination of
the two didn't leave me feeling super
hydrated all day long
pulling out a product that I've had for
a while now this is the elf hydrating
primer really do like this stuff I would
put this up against the Smashbox
photo-finish high
reading version it's so smoothing it
does offer a little extra moisture to
your skin I do not love the smell of it
it's not as though they went to great
efforts to like make this smell like I
don't know cotton candy or something but
it's just got kind of a natural sort of
I don't know crayon type natural and
crayons I don't think that even really
goes together but you might know what
I'm talking about if you've used that I
need another drink a coffee next up I've
got this funky foundation brush I got to
get you the close-up here so you can see
it's called the swirl foundation brush
do you see the cut it almost looks like
it's got little like Stairsteps it's
like a tiered makeup brush and then
there's this hole in the top it doesn't
go like super far down but they've cut
down in it it says this Rose shaped
brush oh that was the description it's a
rose shape brush it has a fluid
reservoir to swirl and blend liquid
foundation onto the skin for sheer to
full coverage based on how much
foundation is in the center of the brush
there is also a triangular handle here
and what's that supposed to do that's
supposed to provide ultimate control and
it says add product in the center of the
brush and applied to the face by buffing
onto the skin in a circular swirling
motion so the foundation that I have
here I don't know that I've ever really
talked about this foundation but it's
the flawless I think is called flawless
finish it doesn't say on the bottle but
it's the one with the pump in the
frosted bottle and I have it in sand
this is oil free has SPF 15 sunscreen i
repurchase this recently but I have had
this in my collection before I feel like
I've never really been able to hone in
on the right shade this shade will work
this sand color although it seems just a
hair light I ordered it online so I'm
going to pump my product down into the
hole the reservoir I did like a pump and
quarter or something there alright so I
think I will try to distribute this a
little bit first just so we don't start
buffing it all into one place the the
brush is super soft no question very
very soft
and coverage wise I would rate this
foundation at a straight-up light to
medium I think with the amount of
product that I'm using here I'm gonna
get medium
and I've had okay staying power with it
like it seemed to wear down completely
on my nose with very little setting
powder on top but we're pretty well
actually
all over the rest of my face although
the rest of my face did feel a little
dry but it's like okay product was still
there if you just handed me this brush
and I did not know that there was a
product reservoir in the center of it I
don't think I would know like the
experience of applying it and just
buffing it in feels like just about any
other dense brush but the coverage the
coverage is better today than it was
yesterday when I use the new sponge
they have a new blending sponge I'm just
gonna mention this real quick it's a
latex free sponge there's not really
anything uniquely different about this
one it's just you wet it down it's going
to get bigger it does get a little
softer my thing I don't like about this
is it feels very rubbery um when you use
a Beauty Blender like there's a softness
to that like when you bounce it on to
the skin you don't hear like a rubbery I
don't know here I can't feel like I was
pounding my skin with this even though
it was soft it was weird it's like the
outer texture of the sponge is what I'm
talking about it had kind of a rubbery I
feel like I'm totally failing at
describing this but it was soft the
sponge overall felt soft but the texture
hitting my skin felt hard too many other
good sponges out there to really like
waste your time on that but this brush
yes it did give me better coverage
although the reservoir idea I I feel
like I could have gotten just as good a
coverage with something had I not put
the product into the thing and it is
shedding on me I'm pulling out a few
hairs here I would say not a bad brush
and not a brush I would discontinue
using for sure I would keep that in the
rotation now for concealer this is
something I've had in my collection for
a little while I think I've talked about
it briefly it's the lightweight
concealer stick and fare to light I
believe this is from their beautifully
bare line a lot of that stuff has this
mirrored packaging and this concealer
feels quite a bit thicker than I would
have expected given the description like
what
as you can see I'm going to apply this
to the areas of my face where I really
want to brighten I don't have a lot of
elf concealers right now so this is kind
of what we've got to work with and since
this brush is not super big I think it
may work for blending out the bulk of
this concealer but I had a really hard
time blending this out yesterday with
that purple beauty blender or elf
blending sponge I should say I'm it just
like again it was the rubbery texture
there wasn't enough actual softness in
the sponge to easily blend out something
that's a little thicker like this and
normally you know when you've got a
concealer that goes on kind of thick a
sponge would tend to be the go-to right
at least that's my logic usually because
it has the moisture in it it kind of
breaks down the product just a bit and
makes it easier to move across the skin
but that sponge there's nothing more
frustrating than sponge you just can't
agree with you know I mean of course
there are more frustrating things in
life than that I'm not trying to be too
dramatic here in the makeup sense you
just want your sponges to work okay what
do we think there um I do feel
brightened I can still see you a little
bit dark circle in there pick them
through because I didn't really have
anything to go at those dark circles
really specifically with and then here's
a product I really like from ELF on this
finishing powder and fair to light I
think this might also be another
beautifully bare thing the texture of
this powder is good it reminds me so
much so much of L'Oreal True Match it's
super smooth really fabulous feel it
doesn't look heavy on the skin I don't
own True Match in a color this light and
I love this type of shade if you're
gonna like set the under eye because you
maintain some of that brightness that
you got from your concealer so I'm just
gonna get some of this this is my small
tapered brush from ELF which is a total
must by the way if you have not tried
this brush I use it all the time for
under eye setting powder I use it for
you can do highlight really well with
this powdering over targeted areas like
I'm just going to use this powder around
the t-zone a bit
winner great product and then I'm gonna
bronze the skin up with a little bit of
my warm bronzer and I've not used this
in quite some time but this is a great
bronzer it's one of those rediscovered
things where you like pull it out and
you're kicking yourself so I love this
it's so good so I'm using my ELF
complexion brush this is again I'm not
just pulling these elf brushes you guys
know this just for the sake of this
video I mean I use these a lot you see
these coming up in my videos often so
what I'm doing by the way to get the
color I'm mainly going between the two
bronzer II shades and just then giving
it a little swirl in the compact overall
like really pretty natural believable
warmth to the skin not doing an intense
contour but letting you know a little
bit of that product concentrate itself
right in here so I've hit the places I
would normally contour and then I'm just
gonna give this a little swirl and think
about like where the Sun naturally hits
give the skin a little more life here
where it got really light from the
concealer I love the texture of this
powder because it's pigmented but I'm
not like kicking up hardly anything when
I swear my brush in like it's just
picking up on the brush not having a ton
of excess I like that pardon my hair
it's getting a little spruce e up there
I'm gonna use some of this matte blush
duo in the shade soft and subtle there
are a couple of these one has a little
bit deeper rosier color in it I want to
use this and I've used this before
because I just it's fascinating this
does so much more on your skin than you
would ever believe so this neutral e
shade here this is my up and up blush
brush I don't have like an elf blush
brush on hand right now but I swirl some
of this on the outer part of the apple
of my cheek and you saw me like tap off
the excess so I have very little on my
brush but that shade is doing that
beautifulness to my cheek and it's matte
mmm I don't think there's any greater
satisfaction that I get applying makeup
than doing blush although maybe putting
on false eyelashes like just seeing that
instant
his change in the look of your skin mmm
love this color and then there's this
peachy shade right up here like really
golden a peach and so I'm gonna get a
little bit of that on my brush and just
kind of use it on the border like the
upper border of where I applied that
blush and it kind of softens stuff now
elf has some really interesting stick
highlighters what are they called
targeted natural glow sticks and I was
sent these they have one in pink pearl
glow one in champagne glow and then a
fresh morning dew fresh morning dew is
not like a traditional highlighter I'm
going to see if I can just kind of
demonstrate this for you when you put
this on it's basically just adding like
a dewy sort of Sheen to the skin it's
like if I sprayed Pam on my skin here
you know it just makes you a little
Gracie and that's the way you're getting
your Sheen you're not getting it through
shimmer and sparkle but just by like
adding a little do to your skin an old
school makeup artist would probably see
this and be like yeah I just Dad
Vaseline on the skin to get that kind of
look so I don't know whatever it's fine
but these sticks are really pretty I'm
using the pink pearl glow I think it
just adds an even brighter look on the
skin and I'm gonna just kind of give
myself a little streak of that here and
then blend over it with my small stipple
brush and contrary to what you might
think is coming given the texture of
that last stick I described these are
not overly sticky or greasy at all these
actually feel quite dry to the touch and
they're not hard to blend but they they
don't leave your skin feeling any
unusual texture but it's quite a pretty
glow I think you do a little on the
upper lip and then I'll show you a
little swatch here of the champagne one
this one I don't love so much just
because I feel like it has a real
yellowy look to it pink pearl definitely
a favorite and then I got a powder
highlight so we're layering it up here
this is the shimmer highlighting powder
in pearl glow brace yourselves
something's about to go down here look
at this highlight
here we're talking bold basically white
highlight if you're a fair skinned
person looking for something that will
show up on your skin and this does not
have glitter in it this particular shape
seems to be a lot more pigmented a lot
more like velvety smooth than another
shade that I tried I will have to look
up what that particular shade was but
like the first time I tried one of these
I wasn't blown away so this one I'm just
gonna get a little bit of product on my
brush tap it off and we are layering
directly on top of the cream product but
you look at this shine would you look at
that just look at it but we do have a
very like kind of matte base going on on
the skin so I don't feel bad about
having all this glow right now
I mean it's gorgeous I can't take
anything away from that highlight like
that is pronounced and it's still that
way even if you didn't layer it on top
of the cream it's just intense in its
own right and then I'm gonna use a
little bit of this makeup mist and set I
love this stuff this is a great little
setting spray it says with aloe green
tea cucumber and vitamins A C and E this
is just the regular one you best believe
I'm not gonna take that Jill this didn't
put it on top of this look at this point
in time
nice mist nice fine mist from that and I
am actually very very pleased with the
way my skin looks right now the
highlight is giving me glow the bronzer
looked great the blushes were nice the
foundation in terms of medium coverage
is okay you just kind of got to watch it
on the staying power if you're have any
tendency of being oily around the nose
but yeah good stuff I like it now I'm
gonna do brows and I have this little
two-dollar brow pencil that's actually
quite good it's in neutral Brown and
it's just a brow pencil on one end and
the spoolie on the other and the
thickness of the brow pencil I feel like
I've described this a lot of times
before but it's not as skinny as a brow
Wiz or an NYX micro brow or you know any
of those really skinny ones but it is
retractable very very workable color for
dark haired peeps
I feel like my Cupid's bow is shouting
at me right now there's so much eye
light there I'm gonna go through that
with the spoolie and I don't have an elf
brow gel so I'm just gonna have to take
something I'll take this covergirl and
just set them down because sometimes my
brows they just like to they like to
look fluffy you know
God decided to not give me a lot of
volume in my hair but instead apply all
that volume to my eyebrows no seriously
gone thank you for my brows I love my
brows now I appreciate my brows I'm not
that girl in high school who tweeze them
to nothingness yeah I totally did a bad
thing with my brows in high school part
of college I think it was to like I just
went way too thin how did I think it was
a good look why didn't somebody say hey
girlfriend you've been given decent
thick nice brows like look at your dad
look at your mom look at your sister and
brother these are the brows that run in
this family don't fight it I hope I
saved somebody there who was on the edge
of tweezing their brows way too thin let
me be the one to tell you since nobody
really told me here's what happened when
I was a little girl a little kid I
remember having like a lot of little you
call it peach fuzz it wasn't like I had
a visible unibrow but I had hair like a
bit of it growing here right between my
brows and I remember like family members
would like pet that area there and I
think that got in my head and then once
I became of age to wear makeup quite a
bit I did away with that in a hurry see
it's these childhood issues that we
internalize and take with us into
adulthood this is getting way too deep
um gl see how it's getting a little bit
light outside now so our friend the
cottonwood tree always accompanying us
as we do our makeup for eyes I got to
have a little chat with you as well
about what you will not see me use in
this video this aqua beauty island
breeze palette here I don't have the
outer packaging anymore but this is what
it looks like it's a pretty it's a
pretty selection of eyeshadow this
unusual greenish color a lot of
usual shades but I would like here but
the texture of these I feel like what
they've done is put a powder on top of
this on the surface of the product just
kind of for show and then when you
really get into it and start using it
it's most definitely a cream that can
make it tricky that can make it hard to
know what to expect as you put it on
your eyes sometimes you get the
pigmentation you expect out of a powder
and then not so much and they're not all
like the same identical feel either even
though I know there's a cream basis to
these like this one feels way more
powdery than this one and I've
definitely worked through the top layer
of both so it's kind of confusing and it
got very Creasy on my eyes by only you
know noontime the other day when I was
wearing it so needless to say not very
impressed by that product but they do
have a new mad format palette I love the
original mad format then they came out
with the one that had like the kind of
orange and purple sunset colors and now
they have this so I think I will use
this in this video this might be what
some of you are interested in it's
called holy smokes
alright so Milani eyeshadow primer I
don't think I have an elf primer
I think what I want to try to do is sort
of a warm and cool combo look here and I
work in some of these pretty rich jewel
tones but also like something like that
in the crease like this terra cotta
orange e brown i love the size of these
palettes by the way like they're compact
but you're really getting a good shade
range in all of them and you see they're
pigmented like I I have no struggle
picking up the color I don't tend to
have any problems blending these out I
mean this is my first time with this
particular one but just talking about my
history with the others the other med
formats I think they're good as I blend
it out I'm kind of sharing it up toward
the eyebrow and then I guess we'll take
the white you don't want this very heavy
on the skin but I'll use that kind of as
a highlight I'm not really one for super
thick under the brow highlights now what
do we want to do blue dark teal like a
mix of teal and forest green dang that
picked up a lot on the brush it's a very
dark shade so I think if you're wearing
this like at a glance I'm not sure how
much people would really notice it and
that's kind of the fun thing about rich
colors is that you can use them you can
switch up your look a little bit but
they're not screaming at people although
sometimes you want to scream at people
so there are other shadows for that
this color is beautiful though I was a
little worried that it would be so dark
that the color wouldn't really show but
you can see it I mean it's pretty it's
showing up true to color according to
what I see in the palette so as you can
see I'm putting that over about
two-thirds of the lid and I'm leaving
myself a little space and then I think I
want to play with this like dusty
sky-blue color right here is anybody
else intrigued by that it's a little
gray with a hint of blue in it
I feel like I want maybe a little more
Brown like a mix of browns maybe in the
crease like some of the dark brown and
some of this really warm shade just to
no transition out of the dark teal
I'm using a very small crease brush
right now by the way mua makeup academy
that I got from CVS I think it's the 310
I always try to link to my brushes and
the makeup products down below but
sometimes there are certain things like
this is one of those things sometimes I
can find it online sometimes I can't and
blend over that
and then I want to just reinforce the
teal just a bit more sometimes when you
blend you just lose things a little bit
just lose a little intensity so no shame
in going back and adding a little mole
I'm doing just a little bit more of the
Terracotta warmth like right in here I
don't always take stuff in quite so far
there but I'm just feeling compelled to
actually you know what I also think
would be pretty is if I went into that
shimmery highlight and just used a
little bit of this right up here overlap
that and then with a really small brush
get a little shine going right in here
as for what's happening under the eye I
think I'm going to do a little bit of
this wet-and-wild ultimate brow
highlight sorry I don't have anything
from elf to perform this function for me
right now but I like to lay that down in
my lower inner rim and then I'll use my
smudge brush and going to the warm color
here I'm going to use a lot of that on
the lower lash line today
can I tell you a quick story about
another product I'm not gonna be using
in this video
this elf waterproof liquid liner so
disappointing jet-black
it seems like it would be good and it
applied nicely with this little brush
tip but it's not waterproof it's just
not it was transferring up here I almost
never have that happen it was collecting
really weirdly and transferring onto my
lower lash line getting all gunked up in
the corner of my eye so I'm not gonna
use that today Jordana color Envy and
black Envy it's an amazing liner
I need a little more darkness on the
lower lashline I'm gonna use the dark
brown is what I do because for the shape
of my eye I like making sure the wing is
kind of connected to the lower lash line
in some way I tend to use the angled
brush it just very quickly puts the
shadow where it needs to be and I
apologize but I do not have an elf
mascara to use at this time I've not had
a very good history with different elf
mascaras I don't know that there's ever
been one that I've truly loved but I
will use a drugstore mascara I'll use
this covergirl total tease
I think I just nailed myself on the brow
bone there but nothing came off Oh
touched by an angel
looking up really close at my skin in
this mirror I think I went a little
overboard with the highlight the pearly
highlight the powder one could have done
less of that I'm seeing a little more
texture than I want to see on my skin
right now right up in this particular
area next I'm gonna just throw on some
lashes red cherry number 43's and I will
be right back I got my lashes on there
and I'm pretty happy with the eye load I
want to use their liquid matte lipstick
in wine tour this one was kind of
randomly sent to me and I've never tried
their matte liquid lipstick before
applicator is like a pointed doe foot
that has a little like hollow part in
the center okay note the color you're
seeing right now and we'll see if it
deepens a lot
I feel like it is deepening as its
drying but it feels super lightweight
and thin on my lips so I do like the
texture my lips can move and I don't
feel like the product is pulling just
the look overall I mean I kind of
stopped after I did the face stuff and
told you what I was thinking about it I
think those skincare things that I used
at the start the balm kind of balm -
water moisturizer and the gel spray were
a little gimmicky and honestly the times
I've used them they have not provided
enough like lasting moisture on my skin
this brush that holds the product I kind
of liked it I found it to be soft I
don't know that the whole putting the
product in the brush matters so much is
just the fact that it's a really soft
nice dense brush and it was kind of easy
to get you know to the areas where I
needed to blend and it even blend out my
concealer pretty good didn't love that
concealer by the way that I used on the
under eyes the texture there is a little
dry I loved the powder that I used to
set like the center of my face and my
under I loved the warm bronzer the matte
blush duo that I'm wearing is just
absolutely outstanding and I like the
shimmer highlight and pearl glow
although pace yourself a little bit the
targeted glow stick was nice that was in
the shade pink pearl glow I like that
pigmented cream highlight without being
sticky talks about the foundation a
little bit you know medium coverage kind
of average foundation doesn't quite have
the staying power for me that even like
Rimmel lasting finish does although this
isn't bad it's just I expect a little
better staying power on my skin the holy
smokes palette not a bad palette like
I'm fairly satisfied with the look but
this is probably third place in terms of
the other med formats I just want to
show you this is the part two I
absolutely loved that one I love that
there's plum in there there's a black
there are so many nice like transition
mid-tone shades this is the first one
and I really like this too for so many
reasons there's a nice mix of warm and
cool here and really good textures it's
really just a matter of shade preference
for some people this might be your
favorite the holy smokes with all the
cool tones that teal and blue are nice
shades if you are looking for a good
drugstore matte palette definitely look
at these so they
you guys so much for watching this video

lot of different elf products and I will
