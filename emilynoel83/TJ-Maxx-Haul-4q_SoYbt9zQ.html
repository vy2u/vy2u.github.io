don't think i've ever done one of these
before done one exclusively on TJ maxx
but i went there the other day and you
know sometimes you walk in there and
it's like oh there's like racks and
racks of clothes and sometimes i just
get overwhelmed then it's like I don't
feel like looking through all this and I
just go like over to the bags or I go
back to the home stuff or whatever but I
actually did come up with some really
cute stuff just a few like nice pieces
that I think I can either wear to work
or just wherever and then I got some
beauty stuff some accessories a random
like baking type fit a good day at TJ
maxx Tyler found under armour saw
absolutely loves them like I guess that
was just enough for him or mele he goes
in there in comes and finds more than I
do I almost always finds like a good
deal on a golf shirt or a dress shirt
and tie type thing but anyway here's
what I found this really cute little
cardigan sweater here I thought it was
adorable as you can see it's got like a
good deal of black kind of ribbing on
the bottom and on the sleeves it comes
to like a three-quarter sleeve for me
but this was from the clearance rack for
twenty dollars so it was marked down
from 2499 originally $68 so the brand is
joseph a and it just buttons up the
front I love that kind of like bright
corley orangie red with the purple it's
like something I wouldn't normally pair
together but I think it looks gorgeous
on this wet pattern goes all the way
around the back which is great so I just
thought you know what an easy outfit
with some black pants or a black skirt i
also got and it's probably not going to
show up real well because it is all
black but this is a neat little um maybe
i'll just put it on it's a little
cardigan it doesn't have any buttons or
anything just a real easy little extra
layer to add them it's got one of those
necks that just kind of folds back like
this like I have some other sweaters
that are kind of a wrap style that go
around like that this style really comes
up nice around your neck and it just
lays really nicely and just hangs
well like that even without any buttons
three-quarter sleeve love the
three-quarter sleeve because i feel like
it can go for any season we're all
slanted neck cardigan was 16 99 and then
i found this little guy for 1299 a cute
little stripy blue and black number here
when i tried this on and i had leggings
on it kind of like came down to a length
that covered my butt so i'm real sure so
that length can pretty much cover me
it's really really soft and comfortable
so kind of a nice casual look you could
layer a little blazer over this and
dress it up some more I also found a
couple of scarves that were each just
599 and I just had been wanting you know
some new scarves and I thought I love
pink and green together I think pink and
green is like phenomenal hence why i put
a little green black bag there in my
pink raven for the news I feel like I
could you know throw this on for the
news and look kind of cute and fresh and
it's nice if you just weren't a black
dress or something really simple and
then you pop a scarf like this over it
it looks really nice the other one I got
is again black and this is kind of a
black and pink with this kind of a
pattern on it I guess it's got a little
like a couple of shades of pink in there
but it's the same kind of length same
basic style but I thought that was
pretty cute as well now I knew skinny
girl made like the margaritas and the
pomegranate mojito whatever that you
could pick up but apparently she's also
doing some body stuff that is now at TJ
maxx this was just 3 99 and this is a
vitamin C a face scrub with shea butter
and cranberry so I thought I'd try that
I haven't even taken the seal off but
that just intrigued me and then oh hey
cupcake well I so much is happening
there's so much going on in here what do
you have I got this lip care this is 299
it says plumping pink sorbet tinted lip
gloss so I just thought for the price it
was something I wanted to check out and
see you know if it was any good I don't
know if the fact that it's a TJ maxx
means it's not being sold anymore
I'm sure somebody out there knows who
can fill me also god that's something
for my fall cupcakes that I like to make
and they are so cute I thought can you
imagine you know I'll bring these into
work and people will just flip for how
cute they are all the guys on my shift
yeah I'm sure what world am i living in
anyway um they have this adorable little
owl pattern and then the little owl
sticks let me see if I can move this so
you can see here's what they look like I
just think those are so cute and they
had another style as well but I thought
the owls were just adorable but what I
do and this was a recipe I found on
Pinterest like last year these were five
dollars by the way um but it's just a
can of pumpkin like just the can of
pumpkin that you might use to make a
pumpkin pie you get that and then you
take one cake mix you could use like a
spice cake mix or a yellow cake mix
whatever you want I like the spice just
stir them up and make them and it's that
easy they're really yummy they're moist
they're delicious and I thought you know
what cuter way to make the fall cupcakes
in the little owls so that's what I got
that's why got TJ maxx hope you guys
like this hall I'm running out of memory
card space so I will see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
