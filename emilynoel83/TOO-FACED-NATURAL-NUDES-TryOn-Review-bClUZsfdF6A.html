another lip color Tryon video today
we're talking about the Too Faced
natural nudes collection so these came
out alongside those new palettes that I
reviewed and I mentioned that I had all
the lipsticks and many of you were
interested in seeing a Tryon and I hope
it'll be helpful here because they are
all kind of in this nude neutral color
family so there's a lot of sort of
closeness between some of the shades so
maybe a Tryon will help you understand
the whole selection a little better ten
shades total and I've sort of split them
up into five and five like light nudes
and medium to deeper nudes the official
name for these is natural nudes intense
color coconut butter lipstick and they
sell for $22 a piece I had actually
purchased three of these I'd also
purchased the palettes as well before
realizing oh they're gonna send me a PR
package of these there are a couple of
things that I really enjoy about the
outer packaging number one I really tend
to like it when the color of a product
is sort of dictated on the outside
especially if it's really accurate to
the color on the inside you know that
we're able to create a pretty good match
which in most cases here I think they
did do that so it makes it really easy
to identify these shades in your
collection and think like I'm going for
a light nude I'm going for a deeper nude
and you can just grab for it and as you
can see they're they've worked in that
lacy detail that same aesthetic that
you're getting off of their palettes
it's translating to the lipsticks I
think really nicely now the lipstick
itself as you can see there is no really
formed or pointed tip to this and
there's something I want to point out
here about the actual shape of the
lipstick bullet instead of just being a
straight flat cut and it's kind of hard
to pick up on this because these have
been used you know I've been wearing
these so I've worn it down just a little
if there's a slight curve like this
little angle that it's been cut at so
you feel like you're applying the flat
surface of this that flat slant all to
your lips and I think your lips are
feeling where the outer edge is but then
there's this little slant and it goes
all the way around and I think that kind
of affects the precision of this and I
found it to be an especially big problem
with the darkest shade that lack of
precision plus the little angled cut
that they've given it so while these are
full-on lipstick opaque shades you know
they're kind of almost giving it to us
in the format of a
bomb which fortunately in a lot of these
cases they're natural kind of nude
shades it can work if this was a really
bold colorful line I think it would be
awful but by the time you get to like
the darkest shade in this collection I
think application from this kind of a
stick is a real problem but these are
the benefits that they list on ulties
website with these products highly
pigmented for intense color payoff yes I
would agree
balmy hydrating texture I definitely
wouldn't call these balmy I'll explain
what I think the texture is in a second
modern neutral shades yes there's a
great I think
Ranger there's something for everybody
in terms of the nude or neutral lip in
here bold nude colors infused with the
Too Faced coconut butter complex to help
keep lips soft and hydrated for me this
is really not a balmy feel like those
new L'Oreal color riche shine formula
lipsticks those feel balmy to me there's
a slip across the lips with these if you
watch really closely in my application
you're gonna see me kind of taking the
stick and sort of rubbing across the
same area a little bit now I'm not doing
that to build up the color because the
color is very full but I'm doing that to
create sort of a slip across the lips
because I think they pull just ever so
slightly and I think if I were to
describe what this formula is it feels
almost like a 60% matte lipstick mixed
in with 40% of a cream lipstick because
it's not just one of the slip across
your lips like Revlon Super Lustrous
creamy lipstick that's just gonna glide
on there's a little bit of a thickness
to these and it's almost as though
they've mixed a matte formula with the
cream formula and this is what you end
up what there's maybe a little shine and
I wouldn't say they're uncomfortable at
all but just in the process of
application they're not going to be
slippery slide on creamy and the
comparison to a lip balm I just don't
feel like really sets you up for what
you're gonna get here now I'm not really
criticizing the product for that texture
because I think if they were too
slippery if they were to just lighten
balmy I think we'd have a bunch of sheer
lipsticks and I feel like everything is
really true to color here even the
lightest of the light nudes and so if
that ended up sheer on your lips you
know you probably have this milky kind
of streaky application but they were
able to use this formula that does have
a little thickness sort of like a matte
and cream lipstick all stirred up
together and what you see is what you
get here so I'm going to
by these all on for you there are 10
again and I'll point out the shades that
I really like and you may like those too
or have your other favorites but there
are five that I think are distinctly
lighter and then we got five deeper
options so the first one here is called
send nudes and this is going to be the
lightest one of the bunch to me it feels
like a shade I could maybe use as a
concealer on my face it really wipes out
the lips I know some people really go
for that look for me I don't think it's
my most flattering look on my skin tone
what's important to note it's that it's
opaque it's not sheer at all and even
with this lightest of the light shade
it's applying very full color next up we
got skinny dipping and this is what I
call like a honey nude color it's got a
lot of warmth to it it's gonna show up
with a slight bit more depth than the
last shade but definitely a lot warmer
birthday suit I mean to me this is kind
of like a classic nude I feel like it's
got a hint of pink going on here it's
got enough depth to just seem right on
my face I don't know I just like a
little more contrast with my skin tone
than that first shade provided and this
one gives me that then with
strip-searched this is actually a pretty
light shade it's a little lighter
probably than the one you just saw on me
and this is kind of a peachy nude if you
like that peach tone in your nude
lipsticks that would be the one and then
the one I've been wearing throughout
this video is overexposed and I'm kind
of trying to warm myself up to the idea
of this shade because it's kind of a
topi dusty mauve it's definitely one of
those modern nude neutral lipsticks and
I kind of do think it's a fun shade I
think it's on the deep end of this
lighter five and it's definitely growing
on me I'll say that now we're gonna move
into the five deeper shades and we do
have varying tones here again varying
levels of warm and cool and the first
one is called nip-slip again this is a
shade that I would just describe as
peanut butter this is a very peanut
buttery shade it's very warm like
skinny-dippin was the honey nude this is
that plus a lot more richness and depth
next one is pout about it and this is
kind of like a rosy Brown this would be
one of my favorites I see this as being
good for everyday wear I see it looking
good with a lot of different
their tones in your makeup you know this
was one of the ones that I purchased
along with birthday suit and then the
next one that I'll be talking about and
I really did turn out to like that
now girlcode is kind of tough to
describe I call it maybe a brown berry
hint of taupe mixed in there there's
some coolness but there's definitely
some element of pinky berry rose thrown
in it reminds me of kind of a fall shade
I don't know there's definitely some
depth happening here I have mixed this
with birthday suit which is one of those
lighter news now throwing smoke this is
gonna be your cool Brown so the deeper
darker sister to the one that I'm
wearing which is overexposed this is
cool you know it's not full-on just
plain old taupe because I feel like
there is definitely some brown in there
but it's on the cool side for sure and
very deep and then your deepest darkest
shade here is Indecent Proposal and this
I call deep Brown with just a hint of
red thrown in and this is the one shade
where I really feel like precision is a
problem like this is hard to apply with
this rounded tip and then also the
slight angle that they've given it it's
very hard to know what part of the
product is reaching the outermost part
of your lips and with a dark shade
that's an issue and while everything is
full colored here you might think well
isn't that just a problem with
everything for some reason I feel like
all the other shades it's not too
concerning to me but this one it's like
woah where is the product going so again
my two biggest favorite shades would be
birthday suit which is going to be your
really classic nude with that hint of
pink not too light not too dark and then
from the deeper collection I really like
pout about it and that's that kind of
soft rosy Brown that I think is very
approachable if you've never worn like a
brown ish lipstick I think this is the
easiest way to ease into that but I hope
this Tryon kind of sorted out what these
colors are all about because at a glance
I mean a lot of these like look at these
lightest five they can seem like they
might be really really similar even
though they've done a good job on the
outer packaging and kind of sorting
things out its overall a collection of
one type of shade the neutrals again
they definitely came up with a formula
that could deliver on these shades and
make them really true to color really
what you see is what you get they're not
like a bomb they're not really like a
lip butter too
me they're very much a full-on lipstick
that feels like a may be mostly matte
lipstick mixed in with a cream and I
don't dislike that but that's just the
fact of what I understand this
collection to be and I don't feel like
they're drying because there is some
thickness to them they will hang on your
lips a decently long time for a cream
lipstick after you apply after you kind
of warm up that stick on your lips a
little bit as you sort of saw me do in
the try on a melts in they become a
little bit more won with the lips and it
feels really good and the wear is quite
comfortable so that's my take on this
collection guys I hope you enjoyed and I
will see you again very soon
