item that I'm going to be reviewing in
this video my thought was is it too good
to be true this initially appeared to me
as one of those palettes where they've
just packed in a ton of stuff you see it
all the time in lower cost or generic
brand items coming out you know around
the holidays in your drugstores and you
wonder is anything in there worthwhile
and even though this was it cosmetics
brand products I had to wonder did they
put lesser quality items in here because
many brands seem to do that around the
holidays what got me even more intrigued
and ultimately pushed me to buy this was
when I saw how the different products in
this palette were actually named you
know the same things claiming to be the
same product line as other things that
have been out individually for a while
like their hello light highlights and
sunshine and a compact bronzer bye-bye
under-eye correctors naturally pretty
eyeshadows bye bye pores blushes all
these things that I know to exist in
their line regularly are being put in
here so I just had to try it and see if
they measured up so I am wearing that
entire palette on my skin the only other
extra items that I am wearing today are
my CC cream my brow product and eyeliner
and a mascara so this is the entire face
that I'm just holding right here which
kind of blows my mind but there is a ton
packed in this palette from concealers
to eyeshadows to lipstick I got this
palette for just under $50 on QVC's
website I was on there getting some
completely unrelated items for Christmas
gifts for people and then I saw this and
I thought whoa let's check this out it
did come in like a silvery gift box with
a bow on it and a tag so it is
completely cute and gift ready if that's
what you want to do with it when you
open it up you've got a big mirror here
the mirror takes up the entire space of
this square on the lid and you've got
two forms of highlighters on top 18 eyes
shadows you open these doors
and you've got a bye-bye pores
translucent powder a bronzer four of the
bye-bye under-eye correctors and then
your little trapdoor underneath reveals
six of the blurred lines lipsticks and
three of the
i buy pours blushes so i'm going to be
comparing along the way just the quality
of these products compared to items in
their regular line that i have i don't
own like every single item in this
palette in an individual but when i do
have that kind of insight to share i
will share that with you lots of
swatches demos the whole nine yards in
this video and the way i want to talk
about this is just kind of in the order
of application so I'm going to start
with the buy buy under eye correctors so
this is different from the buy buy
under-eye concealers that come in a tube
the correctors are actually sold in
these little blue jars I've had the one
in medium for quite some time and it's
been a great go-to for covering melasma
covering dark circles especially when my
skin has been just a little bit darker
because like I said I had this in medium
so the four shades that you're getting
in this palette are light medium tan and
deep and while the formula the feel of
the product seems to be the same to me
the coverage level seems the same I feel
like the shades are just a little bit
off because you're getting that light
which is very very light and then the
next one is called medium but it's
definitely lighter than my medium that
I've got in the full-size my medium is
more comparable to the third shade in
this lineup called tan and to be most
accurate it's probably a mix of the two
it's kind of a mix of medium and tan
would get you the shade that I have in
the full-size and then the final shade
that's in here is called deep and you
might be thinking well why the heck do I
need four different corrector shades in
here and the answers that you probably
don't but if you think you're going to
give this to any random person you know
it is nice to have that little range in
there
plus I do find myself mixing them when I
was applying this today I already had my
CC cream on that was the only thing on
my skin and then I used the tan shade to
kind of overall you know correct my
under eye area and then I mixed in a
little bit of the shade labeled medium
to brighten a little bit and then I feel
like almost any skin tone could further
brighten and highlight themselves with
that lightest shade it's very very light
and eye cream contoured a couple days
ago with the darkest color that's pretty
warm on my skin for a cream
on tour but I'm just saying it can be
done it's a really good full-coverage
corrector type formula there's a lot of
peach tone in my medium and I feel like
I can't achieve that same color when I
mix the medium and tan shades in this
palette so like I said a little
inconsistency in shade there I don't
know if they tried to make an adjustment
to maybe broaden out their spectrum that
they were putting in here
but the formula the consistency the way
it goes on the skin the coverage level
that it has seems to be what I'm used to
in this guy and then after that I just
chose to set my under eye with the
bye-bye pores pressed that's in here and
that product was recently in there
Janice a koala that was my first
exposure to this item and I really do
like it seems to be the same kind of
feel from what I can tell I used it with
just my little elf small tapered brush
dabbed it on my under eye area dab it on
my t-zone as well because I really
wasn't pulling in any other kind of
powder just a nice lightweight very
smooth translucent powder that being
said I think you could apply too much of
this product and get a slightly whitish
look on the skin so I think as long as
you use that product with a light hand
you're going to be fine and enjoyed the
outcome with it then I decided to warm
up my skin with the product right next
door which is the Sun Shine and a
compact bronzer it's also appeared in
there's Jena say quoi local 4-piece
compact and in this palette this is
another inconsistency I've noticed it's
much deeper in here it's a little bit
softer more color picks up on your brush
when you just dab into it so that may
make that product a little bit more user
friendly for people who have deeper skin
tones and want a bronzer to show up a
bit more but I just use a light hand
with this product dab into it with my
ELF complexion brush use it a little bit
in the hollows of the cheeks around the
perimeter of the face anywhere I want to
use it now the next thing I would use in
my sequence of makeup application would
be a blush and so you've got three blush
choices in this palette one has some
shimmer and it's kind of the first
peachy one in the row called natural
flush and then you've got rose glow in
the center which is a soft matte pink
and then perfect plum is also matte and
it looks kind of light in the compact
but I feel like it applies just a hair
deeper and
little more rosy than you might expect
but I like that I like all three of
these blushes I've worn them all on my
face and there's not been one that's I
have any complaints about now I should
also point out I didn't have any of
these blushes in their regular like
full-size so I'm just kind of going with
what's in the palette here and I like
what I see so today I use my Milani
blush brush and I tapped into the plum
one and just applied that there on the
apples of the cheeks outer part of the
apple and I think it's just a beautiful
shade I really like all three of those
blushes so much and I like that the one
that has a little shimmer in it isn't
over-the-top glowy either speaking of
glow after that I moved on to the
highlights in this kit so you're getting
one that's cream and one that's powder
and they are each a little bit different
tones one is the hello light cream one
is called the hill o light powder as you
see the swatch side-by-side you can see
that the second swatch which is the
powder has a little bit more of a
buttery look to it a little more golden
tone like I'm using that term very very
loosely because it's not like it's a
gold highlight but it's just a little
bit warmer than the cream so I think
it's good to have two different
highlight tones I would say your
spectrum of highlighting is this for the
most subtle highlight you would wear the
cream alone for a little bit more
pronounced highlight the powder alone
and if you want like the biggest effect
layer them so first off I applied the
cream and I use my ELF small stipple
brush for that and I just kind of dabbed
it right along the top of my cheekbones
it's a very subtle glow it's really
pretty and I do own that product in the
full-size and it seems to be the same
tone the same feel same formula and then
I went into the powder which I used to
have but it broke and I use that with my
up and up highlight brush and just kind
of dabbed it right over the top and
something about going cream straight to
powder on top it really emphasizes that
glow now the cream is a really nice
formula because it does not stay tacky
it almost does feel a little bit cream
to powder as I rub it between my fingers
it's like it doesn't stay sticky
whatsoever you do feel a little bit of
dryness as it blends out so that makes
it easy to blend if you wanted to apply
that with your fingers I don't think
you'd have any
problem with it but you know me and my
ELF small stipple brush I think we're
like this so that's the way I used it
and I was really pleased with both of
those products so the next thing we're
going to move on to are the eye shadows
and we've got a lot to talk about here
because there are 18 eyes shadows in
this set four of the 18 aren't blatantly
you know metallic shimmery shades and
then there's one other that's just like
a barely there Sheen the rest are matte
so you are getting mostly mad in here
this was the part when I was first
watching this palette I was holding my
breath the most on the eyeshadows
because I just thought oh I know I like
the naturally pretty shadows that come
in the volume one and the volume two
palettes if it's not like that I'm going
to know instantly and I can tell you
that they do feel the same the
interesting thing is that I was just
expecting that these shades would be
taken directly from these since they're
all labeled as naturally pretty
eyeshadows but there's really only two
shadows that share the same names as
stuff in this palette one is the shade
called warmth and that's nearly the same
color as one in the first palette and
then there's one labeled desire and
that's the black and that's not anything
like the shade labeled desire in the
volume 2 palette it's like a soft pink
in this palette so what I see happening
here is the same eyeshadow formula
really the same feel of those mats and
as far as the shimmers go if you've got
any of those little it cosmetics trios
that contain some shimmers they feel
like those they feel like the shimmers
in the original it cosmetics eyeshadow
palette that came with little round
shadows like what was it wanting to you
if I'm remembering correctly it was like
a 12 shadow palette and it was a mix of
matte and shimmer and some of those
shades like the taupe and this kind of
bronzy gold remind me of that formula as
well I really don't see anything in here
that's lacking that disappointed me
there are certain ones that you know are
similar to things on the other palette a
dark brown a black you know a medium
brown light creamy colors are bordering
on light pinks you know those can kind
of be found in these palettes they're
maybe not swatching exactly the same
tone but they are the same kind of feel
and this is being marketed as a gift
type palette they're giving it to you in
a freaking gift box okay
so they're not going to throw in a lot
of off-the-wall colors I wouldn't have
expected that it's a lot of neutrals in
here and yeah they may be neutrals that
you find in other pallets but if you are
a fan of the naturally pretty eyeshadow
formula you're not going to be
disappointed with what's in here because
they feel very similar so I want to
swatch the first half of the palette the
left half there's a lot of great warmish
neutral type colors in there well I love
the tone of the center one in the top
row it's kind of like a light caramel II
camel type color it's really pretty it's
great in the crease but that one does
kick up a lot of Fallout probably
generates the most fallout out of any
shade that I've noticed when I first
stick my brush in so kind of be careful
with that one because it is side by side
with a cream highlight but I truly love
the range the light shades really show
up and that can help your blending
tremendously as you're going over the
border of darker things and in the
center shadow in the bottom row that
medium Brown has just a hint of rose in
it it's gorgeous I've used it in today's
look at dark brown I think is a must
then moving over to the other side of
this palette we've got a few soft rosy
shades some light lilac colors a
gorgeous shimmery taupe that has a hint
of lilac in it that great golden e
bronze you've got a matte black that I
think is another like eyeshadow palette
essential so I was very very pleased
with the shadows so for my look today I
prime my lids and then I used that
medium brown that has just the tedious
bit of a rosy tone in it I use that in
my crease with my Sigma e25 brush then I
used a light creamy color just over the
border of that as my highlight
I used a flat brush to pack on this
golden e bronze which it is a total
fusion of gold and bronze it's not too
bright and brassy and I padded that all
over my lids and then I cleaned off my
brush and brought in the matte black
just for a little added contrast right
there in my outer corner I also used a
pencil brush to bring the matte black
down onto the lower lash line a bit and
use the bronze there a little bit as
well I used the one light shimmery color
that you have in here right around my
innermost corner you could also use your
hello light highlight
as an eyeshadow easily and I finish off
my look with some black eyeliner on the
upper lash line and some demi wispies
false lashes and it's just a great easy
look I didn't do this look to create
something vastly different and amazing
from what I would normally do these are
number one very basic colors but number
two I just wanted to show you some of
the different tones and finishes I
wanted to work in one of the shimmers so
you could see that happening see some of
the darker shades see the lighter shades
so there's just one example of a look
that you can do and then the icing on
the cake for the look would be the lip
products and what you got in here are
six of the blurred lines lipsticks this
is what they look like in a full-size
and these are I think a real combination
of a lipstick and a lip balm they feel
just that comfortable on the lips it's a
really nice formula and especially worn
in kind of a mid tone to light shade
it's going to be very easy to wear if
you choose to wear the red in here I
would suggest giving it a little bit of
a blot because these are just so creamy
and so smooth that's just the one that
you would have to keep an eye on a bit
more everything else I think is super
super easy to work with and wear and I
was so pleased that I have all of these
shades in a full-size lipstick i
swatched them all side by side and with
one exception they all really match up
trying all these on for you I'm using
the lip brush that's provided in the
palette the first one is the shade
called love this is a perfect your lips
but better type of lipstick color and
it's just got a little bit of brown a
little bit of mauve it's the perfect mix
of tones that I think naturally occur in
my lips anyway so it really works for me
the next one is the genes-- a koala
blurred lines so that's going to be your
brightest pink pop but it's not a nun
wearable pink pop it's very fresh and I
like the color next up you got the shade
called perfect nude and this is a really
light kind of rich caramel e colored
nude I have enjoyed this lipstick shade
actually so I thought it was cool that
it was in here it's very buttery smooth
creamy next is the only shade that has
any sort of shimmer in this lineup and
that's the color believe and this is a
little bit plummy
like kind of a plummy mauve with a hint
of shimmer the shimmer does not bother
me in this
to formula because it is so smooth and
balm like it never really makes my lips
look dry now the color called it girl is
your red true red really pretty but like
I said you got to watch this one if
you're wearing it and it's full glossed
out kind of state you might want to blot
over it just for longer-term wear and
then the final shade is called naturally
pretty and this is the one I've been
wearing throughout the video my original
lipstick in that shade strikes me as a
true pinky mauve but it's a little more
deep with the hit more purple in the
palette and I like that but that's the
only inconsistency I noticed when you
look at all of the lipsticks full-size
versus what's in the palette this one in
the palette is just a little bit deeper
and I think it's gorgeous so I've
enjoyed wearing that and I want to show
you the full lineup the top row those
are swatches from the palette the bottom
row are all the lipsticks and I think
the main difference that will probably
stand out to you as it did to me is the
final shade called naturally pretty like
I said deeper in the palette but I like
I think it sets that color apart a
little bit more now one thing that I
haven't mentioned yet is there is a
little brush section up here okay you're
getting a small small little blush brush
I'm not a fan of tiny blush brushes I
mean I'll take your sponge dip I'll take
and use your sponge tip people but if
you give me those tiny blush brushes
you're just asking for streaky
application there so I don't really see
a lot of value in that you do get the
double-ended sponge tip and you do get
the lip brush it works fine and just
handy to have in there and use alongside
those lip products in the bottom tray
but realistically I'm going to use
probably my own eye brushes and my own
like face brushes for the other products
but they do give you something in there
overall for under $50 for everything
you're getting and the quality of
everything that's in here I think and
under $50 price tag is a fantastic value
for this I think you could give this to
someone and not everybody's analyzing
like oh is this exactly like the
full-size that I have a blah blah blah
but I wanted to go there for you in this
video in any way I could
and they really kept the quality in here
so I give major props to it cosmetics
for doing that and giving us what we
expect in these products again just to
point out the inconsistencies that I
know
just in the shade range of the under-eye
correctors you know it's a little bit
off there I own the shade called medium
and it's definitely deeper than the
medium that they give you the bronzer
seems to be a little bit darker and more
pigmented than the sunshine and a
compact that I already had and then
there was just that one lip product that
was a little bit off I don't own any of
the blushes like I said in full sizes so
I can't speak to those specifically but
I do love all the blushes that are in
here and I thought they did a great job
on the eyeshadows too and while there is
just a whole lot of convenience
associated with having that many
different products all in one compact
like I said I you pulled in a BB cream
and eye liner a mascara a brow product
and an eye primer I should have pointed
that out but those few other items Plus
this I mean is there a better travel
companion type palette out there it just
has so much in it and I think that's
great if you want to get really nitpicky
though which sometimes I do there are a
few cons to having this much packed in
one palette and that is having creams
right side by side with a powder that
may potentially kick up some fallout and
start to get in with your creams and
interfere with that whole thing so that
is a possibility I would say the biggest
issue is around these eyeshadows and
then your hello light cream highlight up
top because this particular shadow this
guy here gorgeous shade but one of the
biggest offenders in terms of kicking up
powder when you just stick your brush in
so you've got to be careful with that
I'm not really concerned about these
powders kicking up a whole lot into my
concealers because I feel like I'm just
barely dabbing into those anyway and
they're not too bad about having a lot
of fall out and then my lip products
down here you can actually when you're
using your blushes just keep the lip
products hidden and only pull out the
lip products when you're actually going
for them you know one other concern that
you might have is when you're sitting
this palette out you just got it all
opened up and open to the air and you're
just applying everything that's in here
how soon are these concealers going to
dry out how soon is this highlight going
to dry out and that's something I really
can't answer for you right now because
I've never had a palette from it
medics like this before so I'm really
not sure what the lifespan of these
creams is going to be like I will
certainly continue using it and I'll
update you down the road and let you
know but I know for those purchasing it
right now I can't be of a whole lot of
help but overall you guys I am beyond
pleased I love the eye shadows I love
having those correctors in here and
honestly the for shade range does give
you quite a bit of versatility and what
you can do with those I love the bottom
drawer all three blushes all of the lip
colors I think are super usable I love
that they kept with the same formula as
what their blurred line lipsticks
actually are I mean they feel identical
now this product is exclusive to QVC so
you're not going to be seeing it in an
Ulta or a Sephora or anything but thank
you guys so much for watching and thank
you to those of you who had kind of
inquired about this as well right at the
time I think I discovered that this was
on their website several of you tweeted
me and you're like is that worth it
should I get that so thank you for
watching again and I'll see you guys
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
