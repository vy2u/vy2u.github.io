being here and also thank you for
watching the Emily Awards I so
appreciate all the amazing feedback
you've given me I'm glad you like seeing
those happen every year and I'm really
glad I was able to get those pulled off
pre-baby like it's such a weight off my
shoulders but what's always interesting
year after year's that people seem to be
as much if not more interested in the
worst products of the year so that's
what I'm going to share with you in this
video I have put together a top 10 of
the products that over the course of the
past year I have tried and they have
really been the worst they are things
that I think across the board I do not
see myself recommending to anyone and I
did confine it to things that you know
I've come across in the past year so
we're not talking like all-time fails
like I do have a little drawer maybe one
day we'll go through that the drawer in
my closet where I put like fails from
the ages you know like things that are
the absolute worst and I keep them in
that little chore just to save them just
you know for comparison's sake maybe if
I'm doing a review maybe one day there
will have to be a biggest fails of all
time video but for right now you know
we're focusing on the year 2016 and what
things didn't work so again I think
they're all fails but we're going to be
working up to an ultimate worst and at
number 10 this was just a pointless
product to me benefit launched a bunch
of brow stuff many of the products ended
up being really good like I've enjoyed a
couple of the different brow pencils
I've tried I think they've got a decent
brow pomade but it was like they kind of
reached a point with their lineup where
I thought no we're just we're just
putting out products for the sake of
having you know a massive brow line and
so one of those things that I just felt
was so unnecessary was this Bravo
conditioning primer like do I need a
primer to go through my brows first it's
just this little rubbery tip and you've
got this liquid that comes out that
feels like moisturizer kind of if such a
thing was even necessary in the brows
couldn't I just like pick up any
moisturizer I have and kind of go
through them and lay them down I'm not
really sure what function this is
serving because it's not providing color
it's not providing
do I need a brow conditioning primer if
anybody wants to make the case for me in
the comments section that I need a brow
conditioning primer and be my guest but
it says nutrient-rich primer for fuller
looking brows I don't think this makes
the brows look fuller at all it just
makes them look wet number-9 such a
letdown
I felt like personally let down by this
broad because I really like multitasking
palettes I like finding a palette where
I feel like oh my gosh it does like
three different things and it does them
all well and you know this is such a gym
and I remember around the timeframe that
I had tried this particular item I have
been enjoying the Charlotte Tilbury
instant look in a palette and I thought
oh this is Revlon's answered that type
of a product and so they put out these
eyes cheeks and lips palettes I'm
holding up probably my least favorite
which is called berry in love but they
also have a nude and a smoky the smokey
you know basically the darker you go
with these the more chance you have of
getting a little more color off of them
but it's a real like just lack of
pigmentation across the board the blush
is in all of these it was like they're
barely there like you can hardly see
them the shadows were extremely hit and
miss and then of course something that
frustrates me and I'm sure many of you
as well is when you know you got lip
products kind of scattered in there and
not really protected from the powders in
any way I believe when I bought them
they were hovering around the $20 Mar
the price tag was way too high for the
low quality that I felt like they were
packing into these and yeah if you go
for your deepest darkest shadow you'll
see something you know this is why this
is not the absolute worst product I'm
going to mention today I really thought
Revlon could have done better and I was
just so hoping to see like a drugstore
palette come out that could do all the
different things and do them well and be
a nice alternative for those who didn't
want to spend the astronomical price tag
for a Charlotte Tilbury instant look in
a palette but it just sadly it didn't go
there for me didn't work number eight on
my lineup of products that didn't work
would be this NYX cream highlight and
contour palette the stiffness of these
creams they're just so hard to work with
there are a lot of nice cream contouring
things out there elf has some good cream
contour the mascara line mass
Kerra you know the blogger she's got
these great pallets that are such a nice
rich creamy texture I feel like I've
tried a lot of cream contour things this
next one to look at it which I'm holding
here in the shade light it looks like
they should be workable tones but it
just they're so stiff I'm pretty much
always going to be applying this stuff
over a foundation so it needs to be like
silky it needs to be something that I
can blend across the skin with very
little effort so that sadly is not what
this product was never seven on my list
of duds this I'm sorry the naked
illuminated trio like this is maybe the
third or fourth time I've mentioned this
as being a highlight palette that I just
could not get on board with they look
like these baked kind of domed up
highlights and all I see when I open up
this box is the glittery fallout that's
surrounding everything I've said it
before I'll say it again the market is
flooded with highlights right now it's
all about you know glowy products every
brand has put out something this thing
just can't hang with them some of this
yes is my personal preference I'm not
one who likes glittery highlights and
that's what these are the one that's
least glittery and seems to have the
most actual pigment to it is kind of
like a deeper Gold which maybe might be
an okay eyes shadow but that doesn't
really serve to highlight my skin tone
very well it's just one of those things
that came out around the holidays and it
could really you know intrigue some
people if you saw it online but I think
most anybody who would walk past a
display see it in person touch it you
think gosh this feel really dry number
one and number two there's so much like
glittery filler in these and number six
I kind of have two products that I want
to discuss in one just so I could keep
this a top ten you know I'm putting two
of them together same brand I bought
them at the same time and they just both
didn't work they're from Physicians
Formula these are from their eye booster
line which that is a specific area of
their brand where they happen to make a
product I love that eye booster pen you
know the pin format liner that actually
has a nice little super tapered brush
tip
really great across the upper lashline
nearly made it into my Emily awards for
eyes this year that products amazing
these newer things that they came out
with and they got on board the cushion
train and they put out this two and one
lash boosting cushion eyeliner plus
serum and then they also have this liner
which is another sort of pin style talk
about that in a second but the cushion
and this was something the first time I
used it I thought yes you know they're
onto something here this is really cool
for having the cushion there and then
when you put your little brush which
comes out of the top into it you don't
get any excess product on your brush you
know you just load up with what you need
and then you can go across well I was
just astonished with how quickly this
thing dried out there's just not enough
juice in the cushion I mean I talked
about this in a video where I was
reviewing some new stuff and I believe
it was by like the third or fourth use
it was too dry to like make it across my
lash line so that was not cool and then
a pet peeve of mine is when all these
brands are trying to come up with these
gimmicky felt-tip liners and they're
shaping the felt tip in some weird way
that does not do it doesn't make it any
easier for any of us look at this tip do
we need this like really do we need this
lumpy bumpy tip what I use one of these
pin style products are really when I use
any type of liquid liner maybe a very
traditional one like the Jordana color
envy I am generally not working straight
off the tip you know I'm kind of laying
it a little bit sideways as I go you lay
this one sideways you can figure out
what you're going to get there you're
going to get a little bit of a stamp of
this Ridge it got a little place for
your thumbprint here you know they're
trying to make it like it's an
ergonomically designed eyeliner it's
fine to hold on to but let's just make
it let's just make it one straight tip I
feel like I've seen so many messed up
tips that brands are coming out with
primarily these drugstore brands putting
out these weird felt-tip liners and
really what you want is just something
that's going to be tapered you know
nicely pointed number five on my
countdown of horse products elf came out
with some things that seem to be like
their take on nude sticks the products
the pencils that came in little tins and
some of them worked out I think the lip
stuff that they put out in that format
was decent and they had like some eye
colors like jumbo shadow stick type
things that were okay but the stuff for
face I'm really at a loss for how to
make this work because they've got like
a contour stick for example one side
says matte one says shimmer the matte
side is like a very warm bronzer a
looking shade and then the shimmer is a
full-on gold neither of these shades
blend if it's something that you're
going to be streaking across your face
you're going to be so frustrated because
odds are like I've said before you might
be putting that over some foundation and
when you've got a blend like heck to get
that smooth into your complexion and
make it no longer look like a tiny you
know pencil mark it's just not a good
situation so yes again there is your
streak of the contour and this is indeed
marketed as a contour type product and
then your highlight right beside it is a
total gold look even as I'm trying to
rub it away on my hand like I can't get
that line to go away it's so frustrating
at number four we've got the classic
cheap concealer stick this is from LA
Colors and I went back through some of
the dollar store like failed products I
did a big video reviewing just a whole
bunch of super cheap stuff and one of
the things I tried was an LA Colors
concealer stick I have it here in the
shade light and it is just the
stereotypical dry concealer stick you
know there are a lot of brands who have
put out really nice creamy concealer
sticks there's a lot of workable stuff
out there but this one is just like
everything that you might expect out of
a cheap concealer as I wave around here
the fragrance the fragrance is really
getting to me it's like a it's a floral
it's an old floral it's so dry I mean if
you're thinking about buying a stick
concealer like this putting it up on
your under eye area I hope you got a lot
of facial oils to like mix in with this
and thin it out
and make it somewhat workable but bottom
line it's thick cakey dry and smells
like old flowers coming in at number
three we've got a lip product here
it's from LA Colors again and this was
one of their little $1.00 things a new
thing they did this year at least in my
family dollar store I think was they had
a display of all kinds of little things
for a dollar and one of them was this
pout lip gloss the matte version so
they're taking their stab at matte
liquid lipsticks fine this color looks
gorgeous color is called let's kiss I
have multiple colors that I've also
tried there's actually a nice little
applicator on it too flattened out doe
foot nicely cleaned off along the edges
it's kind of setting up to give you some
hope right and you're thinking maybe
this could work the issue I have here
and it might frustrate me even more than
the liquid lipsticks that just get
SuperDuper dry and offer no moisture to
your lips what might be a little more
frustrating than that is the liquid
lipstick that stays really really sticky
and I'm talking like you put your lips
together and you all have to link to my
dollar store video because I actually
showed this trying to press my lips
together pull them apart and you could
just see the skin of my lips sticking
together that is so annoying like you
can't forget that this is on your lips
because it's just like sticky and thick
and heavy number two on my list would be
the worst sponge I was looking through
all of my Beauty Blender type sponges
and I thought what is the one that I
really just cannot find a purpose for
whatsoever there are a lot of
not-so-good ones that have come out I do
have a top 5 bottom 5 video on Blender
sponges but perhaps the least useful
ones that I own are these little guys
from up-and-up and I'll give it to them
they're cute here's what you do you
decorate a cake for your you know makeup
obsessed friend and you could use these
little Beauty blenders as like a little
bit of a decorative item maybe that's
the best use I've thought of so far for
these because you add water to these
they don't expand they stay really
really hard and stiff and for as small
as they are they're not serving any fun
for you and her members Sydney's a
target I was so excited because it was
like the first mini micro mini
potentially dupe that I was seeing out
in a store so I was so pumped and then I
got him home and I was like oh man these
just don't do anything the number one
product that I can't stand out of this
top 10 and I think this is the first
time I've talked about it doctor lit
bangs 100% natural lip phreak phreak
your lips out the strongest buzzing lip
balm in the whole world is what they
call this the flavour or shade yeah it's
just a flavor I guess the I have here is
called cinnamon si n o mint has a very
strong cinnamon ish smell but you can
tell something else is in there I got to
give this product credit I guess it does
do what it says it makes your lips feel
like they're like vibrating like there's
a teeny tiny motor in your lips and
they're going like a no big deal we just
got a car alarm going off downstairs I'm
sure there's nothing to that this to me
I mean I think this is the most
uncomfortable lip product ever like it's
a slow progression at least on me that's
what I know is I put it on I instantly
think okay decent feeling lip balm and
then we go into a slight tingle a little
bit of a burn and then it gives way like
over the course of I would say 10
minutes into a full-on like I need to
check in the mirror and make sure my
lips aren't actually moving it's just
like a weird sort of vibration I've
never tried anything like it it is not
enjoyable to me at all it will fade
after 20 minutes or so I knew this would
be in my fails video it's just kind of a
matter of where but as I looked at
absolutely everything that I laid out
here I thought this is the only thing
that really causes pain and discomfort
other products might look bad or might
be pointless or might just you know
whatever I've said about them but this
one
and I just really like I don't want to
pick it up at all and now I'm feeling
kind of bad because there might be a
type of person out there who loves a
product called lip freak freak your lips
out the strongest buzzing lip balm in
the whole world but it's not for me I
just can't handle it I cannot handle the
tingle the burning the buzzing I can't
keep out like what is happening with my
lips so that is my top ten worst of the
year the products that I just could not
get on board with this year thank you
guys so much for taking time to watch
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
