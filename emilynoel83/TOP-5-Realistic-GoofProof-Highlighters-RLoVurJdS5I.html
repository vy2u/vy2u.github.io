here the topic of today's video subtle
highlights it really is very
self-explanatory I think these are those
goof-proof highlights that you can apply
you don't really have to be careful with
them so to speak you know there are some
I could do a whole video on highlights
that are exceptionally glowy that look
really nice when you just barely get any
on your brush and dab them on but these
I think are truly the definition of goof
proof you can apply them you don't
really have to stop and think about it
and the end result looks really natural
I don't think it attracts any attention
to flaws I just like the fact that I can
see myself not only in this room with
these special lights around me but also
in broad daylight and feel like yeah
that's realistic you know that looks
like that could naturally be coming from
my skin itself so I like that feeling
and I thought I would share these
particular highlights with you I've got
a top 5 so I'm going to go from the
least glowy to the most glowy and I will
point out what brushes I like to use
with these also so as far as the least
glowy and this goes way back this has
been a long time favorite in my
collection it's my laura geller baked
french vanilla highlight so before
gilded honey was real hot they had baked
french vanilla and I loved how this
particular highlight actually is kind of
a combination coverage powder plus
highlight I love how it does that but I
always felt like whenever I put this
particular highlight on everything
looked so nicely evened out and still a
little bit brightened there's a little
bit of glow to this powder it's not like
100% matte or anything when you see it
in the swatch on my finger there it's
very concentrated yes but I kind of have
to do that so you can tell what I'm
talking about a little bit of Sheen but
it's subtle and I like to apply this
with my ELF small tapered brush it's a
small brush but it still can cover like
some decent surface area if you're just
too dab it like right over this entire
area and sometimes I'll use this
highlight just to overall brighten that
portion of my face and then you can go
on top of it with something more glowy
if you really want like
little added shine but I think if you've
got problem skin like fine lines uneven
texture and you feel like most shimmery
highlights only add to that this is a
good way to brighten your skin without
going too heavy on top of those areas
and attracting attention to the problems
next one I want to mention that's
definitely settled but a little more
glowy than what I was talking about
there with the laura geller is the elf
illuminating palette and this actually
was in my shot my stash drawer so kind
of a rediscovered gem here but you get
four tones of very very soft and subtle
highlights I will say anytime I dip a
brush into these I'm kind of like oh
it's sort of powdery like it kicks up a
little powder and sometimes when I'm
thinking about it I'll tap off the
excess but you don't even really have to
you can just slap this stuff on and it
still looks super natural on my skin so
what I'm wearing today I want to tell
you I've got a blush from my makeup
revolution hot spice palette it is this
one right down here so I wanted a blush
that would just give me some color but
not a glow that would interfere with the
highlight so you know where the glow is
coming from that's on my cheeks and then
I went over it with this kind of gold
any highlight and it's just barely there
shimmer and then on top of that I took
the lightest one right on top of the
cheeks and it's glow but it's so like
normal and it's there's no flecks of
ARCA Lin there you're not seeing glitter
anywhere there's nothing harsh about it
and what's cool is that every shave this
palette has that kind of quality for me
this one you know would be the brightest
this one most golden really beautiful
over a peachy tone blush this one has a
little bit more of a pink tone in it
still very brightening and this one down
here just has the slightest hint of
beige super super subtle but still a
little glow in there and these are just
dynamite I don't necessarily love the
way they look in a swatch because I just
don't think it does then justice it's
like it has to be applied where you
would put on highlight to see it on the
skin and be like okay yeah I get it
and the brush that I often use with
those I will use either use my ELF small
tapered brush or my little up-and-up
highlight brush if you want a little
more concentrated color out of any of
these the up and up brush kind of like I
don't know really dabs it on a specific
area and this came with a little set of
brushes the up-and-up Linus
at Target next up I've got a couple of
different textures to tell you about for
a subtle highlighted look one of them I
know I've talked about recently my next
bright ideas stick in the shade
Chardonnay shimmer so it's like this
chubby highlighter crayon you put it on
and just the nature of its color you
know it's a little bit like beige ep ch
mixed in with that glow and something
about that just looks very natural lit
from within on the skin I like to just
take my ELF small stipple brush kind of
graze it across the top of that and then
just dab it right on like the apple of
my cheek it gives just this
instantaneous natural glow again no
flecks of glitter particles here I could
call this video like highlights that
don't look like highlights I for some
reason I just infatuated with that
concept of products giving you a certain
function but not looking makeup beyond
the skin so that's definitely one of
those and then I want to mention my
Becca shimmering skin perfecter liquid
in the champagne pop color
first off I'm really surprised that this
has not gotten like as much if not more
attention than the champagne pop powder
highlight because that's beautiful and
everything but this is like undetectable
perfected skin I've always loved these
liquid highlights that Becca has put out
and so I've got the full size here I try
to pump out a little bit sometimes it's
hard that's the one downfall it's like
you try to just pump out barely any on
your hand and you still get more than
enough and there are other shimmering
skin perfecter liquids from this line
that are really nice but there is
something about the tone of this that
just brings it back to the skin like I
think opal is gorgeous
but this having that little bit of
golden peach happening it's so so pretty
and I've laid it on thick there but I
just want to show you I would use this
again with my ELF small stipple brush
get a little on my hand and you know
then just kind of buff it right on top
of the cheeks and I'm doing it super
lightly here but it's just the prettiest
look I love this stuff and maybe you're
thinking well why liquid highlight as
opposed to one of the powders you
mentioned I think there's a little added
versatility with a liquid highlight
because you can pump a little bit of
that out you can use it on your body
very easily mix it in like
to loot it a little bit with a body
lotion and that works really nice or
blended in with your moisturizer blended
in with a foundation that you want to
make a little more glowy or you know you
can strictly apply it as a highlight
it's a lot of product here you know if
you stick to just that one method so for
a high-end item I do feel like it's a
great value and just the perfect tone to
kind of mesh with your skin the final
one that I want to talk about I think is
the one capable of laying down the most
glow on your skin but I would still keep
it in this overall subtle category you
know and it's my L'Oreal True Match Lumi
powder highlight in the Rose tone and
I've worn this I'd actually split up
these four shades and I've worn those as
eye shadows before it's very pretty like
that or you know for the most part if
you want to rule out some of the
rosiness you can easily stick to the
larger part you know that kind of center
portion of the compact but blend it all
together or just kind of dabbing a brush
like patting it all over the surface of
this product you do get some of that
Mafi rose mixed in and sometimes I like
that and I think it especially looks
nice going right on top of where ever
you would apply blush like a little
blush topper coordinating thing it looks
so pretty but I know they have different
tones of these available this is the
only one I've tried and I've just really
loved it it's very pigmented it's really
really soft it's always given me a glow
that I've felt comfortable with and I
didn't feel like was too over-the-top or
too cheesy I hope this helped you guys
out if you're looking for that healthy
kind of realistic glow on top of your
makeup I know some people like a really
heavy highlight and if you do that's
fine there are tons of products that can
give you that but sometimes it's harder
to hone in on those things that are just
giving you the barely-there glow so
thank you so much for your time and I
will see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
