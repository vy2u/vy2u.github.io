video this was a requested video about
my favorite red lipsticks and when that
topic was brought up to me I thought
sure no problem this will be easy and
then I really started thinking I'm like
well you've got your brighter Reds and
then your deeper Reds matte ones and
shiny ones and all these things started
coming to mind I'm like I need to
confine this a little bit more I need to
narrow this down I'm going to navin top
5 and they're all going to be I think
very summer friendly Reds so I've got
several that I think go on very sheer
they're very comfortable to wear and I
think they can actually look really
appropriate with a very light
barely-there makeup look and I've got
different tones that I think might suit
different people's tastes some people
like the warmer Reds I really think warm
Reds are pretty and especially in the
summer they just give me a very summery
vibe but I've got some cooler more pinky
watermelon e-type Reds - a couple more
full color options and even a couple of
lip liners so let's jump in start
talking about some of my favorite Reds
that I think are really great for the
summer months the first one is one of
the almay smart shea butter kiss
lipsticks these are a really super
comfortable lip product I don't know how
many of you have gone out and actually
tried some of these since I've been
raving about them here and there over
the past I don't know maybe a year or so
but these are a really nice quality lip
product they remind me kind of of a
Revlon lip butter because they do have
some good color intensity but at the
same time I feel like they're even more
nourishing balm like there's a little
bit of thickness they have a nice like
light vanilla scent and they are
available and I think for different
color families so you've got the nudes
red berry pink and then within each of
those they've got light light/medium
medium so they've kind of split them up
into different depths and intensities so
the one I want to recommend here in this
video is the one called red light so
it's the lightest one in the red family
and I do think it has a really pretty
just fun brightness to the shade it's
kind of like a sheer neutral red to me
this swatch on my hand makes it look a
little more pinky but I do think this is
just a gorgeous low-maintenance summer
lip product it's not going to be
something that has like incredible
all-day staying power you are going to
want to reapply it definitely after you
eat something but it's probably the most
comfortable one that I'm going to
mention and it's really nice to sort of
soothe the lips that might be chapped
chapped lips definitely can happen I
think just as much in the summer months
as the colder months because you can get
sunburned it can really dry out your
lips this feels very nourishing now in
comparison to that I want to mention a
little bit warmer red and this is also a
shear option the Revlon Super Lustrous
line does have some sheer finish
lipsticks and this is the shade called
rich girl red and it's a definite warm
red it goes on with a lot softer color
than you might be accustomed to with
some of the other Revlon Super Lustrous
lipsticks and here's a swatch of it
right here beside the Almay you can see
it's much warmer I am actually wearing
this shade on my lips today but I paired
it with a lip liner that I think makes
it look even more finished if you're
into that kind of look this is the next
slide on lip pencil in summer tease so I
actually paired those two together but
you can see in my little Tryon I'm only
wearing the lipstick and it's just a
beautiful like wash of summery color if
you're a little scared to go full on
orange all over the lips I think kind of
an orange e red is a more subtle and
simple way to take advantage of that
warm look next I've got an option that's
still a little bit on the sheer side
maybe not quite as sheer as the last two
that I mentioned but it's from Mac and
it's one of their cream sheen lipsticks
which is definitely my favorite formula
that they create and this shade is
called nice to meet you and this is the
kind of color I would define as
watermelon whenever I see a sheer
pinkish red for whatever reason that's
what I think of so seeing it here in the
lineup because use quite a bit of pink
in this color all of these three shades
have a certain amount of shine to them I
just think this color is gorgeous and I
think paired with just a simple I look
poppin on this kind of a shade just
totally brightens up the whole face if
you're not into those orangie Reds you
want something a little more pinkish
this would be a great pick now some of
you are like okay I'm done with the
sheer stuff tell me about an awesome
full-on red well this recommendation
would be my 100% all-american red I
think it's gorgeous in the summer but
it's very light opaque and matte and I'm
very excited about this recommendation
because the shade I initially pulled out
that I wanted to tell you about is one
of the Gwen Stefani urban decay
lipsticks and the shades
seven one four I love this shade I think
this is just a glorious wonderful
full-on matte red and then I started
thinking I think that's limited edition
it's probably going to be on its way out
people will probably ask me for a dupe
so I just you know preemptively went
ahead and looked for a dupe and I found
an awesome dupe you guys and it is a
shade I've actually worn quite a bit uh
and it's my maybelline creamy matte
lipstick in the shade
I ran and Scarlett absolute perfect dupe
here's a little swatch comparison of
just these two on top is the urban decay
gwen stefani seven one four and then the
maybelline creamy matte siren and
scarlet right below it they are so so
similar yesterday I was wearing like one
on the top lip one on the bottom lip and
I really couldn't tell the difference
and then here's a big swatch of the
maybelline creamy mattes 100% true red
matte has really nice staying power I
think the creamy mattes line is very
comfortable on the lips I am interested
to see if there's a red from the loaded
bulbs collection which is brand new from
Maybelline I mean I've tried a deeper
red but you know see if there's
something brighter out there but overall
I think this is a fantastic formula and
you're really going to be happy with the
staying power now if I say the words NYC
sheer red does that mean anything to you
because if it does I know you've been
with me since like the very very
beginning because one of my earliest
like hardcore makeup recommendations
that I can remember on my channel is the
NYC lipstick and sheer red no this is
not the original one that you would have
recommended back in like 2008 or 2009 or
whenever I have repurchased it since
then this is actually repurchased within
probably the past year or so and I think
this is a great like any person's red
because it's a little bit deeper than a
true red like this one right here if you
see NYC sheer red swatched right beside
it you can see more depth and I think it
makes it a little bit easier to wear
that it's kind of a formal looking red
it really pulls together look looks very
classy but doesn't look too bold and
bright if that's not what you're into I
do think this shade on the lips comes
off a little bit softer than it appears
to be in the tube it's not a total like
full-on burgundy but it is a deep
take on red I still find it to be very
summer appropriate it definitely does
maintain a little bit of shine I find
that this doesn't drift outside my lip
line so just a nice option for anybody
to have in their collection and I think
this costs like less than two bucks now
I mentioned earlier a great lip liner
and to pair with a warm red I paired it
with the one I'm wearing today rich girl
red and it's the NYX summer tease
another great NYX liner just for a true
classic red this is the shade called red
tape so I really am in love with this
liner formula you could wear these alone
and have a totally budge proof like stay
in place matte lip if you wanted to but
they just go on incredibly smooth super
creamy they do seem to set to an extent
so there's the summer tease the warmer
one and then red tape is right kind of
above it right here so this is my lineup
of summer reds and I think they're just
a really diverse selection I see red in
all of these shades but some are a
little bit lighter and brighter some
have more depth I just think there's a
freshness to the look of a red lip in
the summer time I mean we might think
well we've got to go nude and bronzy
just because I don't know why but this
kind of a look especially for evening
you want to glam up your look a little
bit pop on any one of these shades if
you're interested most in staying power
best staying power from what I mentioned
is the creamy matte siren and scarlet
probably most comfortable most
conditioning type product would be the
almay smart shade and red light so thank
you guys so much for watching thanks for
requesting this video and I will see you
again in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
