something with my Beauty bargain hunters
out there the people who get a lot of
satisfaction out of finding something
for a lower price you know you know
there's a high-end alternative out there
but the lower cost thing is obviously
less expensive but also performs as well
if not better that's what I'm going to
be talking about in this video so
excited some of these things you've
heard me mention a lot and I thought it
would be nice to compile them into one
video because these are nice basics to
have in your collection that well
they're not an actual physical makeup
product there's still items that may
potentially get daily use so they are
very important kind of like unsung
heroes of makeup and the first thing
that I would like to say works better
than a more expensive option are these
elf one dollar tweezers okay you can buy
these on the website for only a buck and
they are the best tweezers out there I
have three pairs I believe right now I
used to use tweezer mints all the time
thought they were the best thought it
was basically as good as tweezers got
but then I got these and the tip the way
they meet their super precise I feel
like they just grabbed every hair
effortlessly when I'm tweezing my
eyebrows not only do I want them to be
you know the every morning thing that I
pick up before I start my makeup but I
also replace these in my travel bag
because I just I want this to be the
only kind of tweezer I use and for a
dollar it's just a ridiculously good
deal so if you need a nice little
stocking stuffer definitely grab those
for your crew next thing um if you've
spent any amount of time watching my
videos you may have realized that I do
see the value in a mini Beauty Blender I
don't think these little sponges are
just a gimmick I think they actually are
a very effective way to blend out
concealer around the eye area and do it
in the softest way possible not tugging
at the skin the way brushes or finger
tips do I mean in a pinch obviously you
can get away with those other methods
chances are you'll still make it look
good with those methods but these little
sponges are just so nice and soft what
I'm holding here is a freshly-cleaned
Beauty Blender brand micro mini
and those are a lot of times sold in
duo's sometimes you can find them in
larger packs and there was a period of
time where I really did not think
anything truly compared to this but
stuffs happening we've got this whispers
blending sponge duo this is available at
Walmart I know some of you have told me
you've had trouble finding it or it's
been out online so you've had to really
try to hunt it down in a store and I
know that's kind of a pain sometimes but
it is a nice little duo and in my local
store if you don't find it right where
like the brushes and beauty tools are
look more where the cotton pads cotton
rounds are that's where they were where
I live and I mean as you can see just
the size comparison to a regular beauty
blender it might pop up just a bit
bigger and not be quite as pointed at
the tip but texture wise I mean they
feel like they are made out of the
identical material they're both just
incredibly soft but if you are coming up
short in finding the Swiss purse kind
the Real Techniques sponges are really
cool too and they also have kind of a
different function because they do have
the flat side just like those real
techniques you know the larger sponges
which I love as well and I think those
are also a great you know drugstore
alternative the many ones are cut the
same way so you do get to take advantage
of a point but you've also got a flat
side you'll notice this is you know
significantly bigger than a
Beautyblender micro mini but it's still
very easy to actually make it around
those inner corners if you've got deep
set eyes and you've got kind of a
difficult to get to place there I think
by either this tip or this tip you'll be
able to make it happen and this is nice
for baking as well that little flat side
really lays down powder well so if
you've been wanting to dip your toe into
the mini sponge land see what they're
all about with a little less risk
financially than for a regular Beauty
Blender try these blotting papers can be
super handy super great to have on the
go I got some from Sephora and they
smell like rose they are the herbal rose
scent you open them up it's just like a
little cardboard folder here basically
and then you pull back this tab and one
is always going to be stuck to that tab
and then you just lay it back down and
close it up but yes they do smell nice
it's a nice experience to pull one of
those out
sense aside if we just really want
blotting papers to do what blotting
papers do you know absorb the oil this
little thing from elf is so so handy
it's a little plastic box and you open
it up you actually have a mirror to take
advantage of which i think is huge
because you actually can see you know
what you've lifted away see what your
skin's looking like and you have a
little puff here so you're just gonna
put your finger in that and every time
you lift it up you're gonna have a
blotting sheet and then go to town blot
it away and then when you're done take
it off put it down and you will pick up
the next sheet the next time you open it
so cool I think Sephora now does have
something that's kind of like this but
regular price it runs a few dollars more
but whatever brand you end up buying
from just know like this is now the best
blotting sheet method or container type
thing out there it's gonna be so much
more durable in your purse than a little
cardboard envelope is so I would highly
recommend that got all this stuff it
would be really great like stocking
stuffer material because it could work
for anybody
next thing I don't even know if I need
to say a word I'm just gonna hold this
here revlon presented live glue this is
what you want I definitely prefer it
over my Tarte tardes Pro lash glue now
this comes automatically in a dark tone
and some of you pros out there who are
ultra comfortable applying lashes maybe
you're all about that dark tone but I do
think it's riskier I apply a lot of
false lashes and I screw this up
irregularly you would have used this so
I always keep coming back to this guy
I've used so many other brands of these
wand applicator these bows have the
wands with the little brush tip and I've
tried kiss I've tried duo the formula is
really the best with Revlon it's the
quickest drying it's the best you know
just in terms of adhering to your lash
line if you're really big into your
false lashes I would recommend just
keeping one in your purse at all times
because it's so easy if you have an end
come up if you would have any sort of
issue you know you can dab it easily
straight from the tip over wherever your
problem area is on for me it's usually
like the inner core
and then I generally always have one
here on my vanity as well but this has
beat any formula any brand any price
range this is my favorite next tool is
something that's also associated with
false lashes and I think it makes it ten
times easier you're a false lash
beginner or you know someone who is or
you're just the slightest bit
intimidated by the process this
applicator tool by BH Cosmetics is about
the lowest priced one I've seen it's
fantastic I've seen higher priced ones
out there got to be upfront I haven't
tried them but I know like velour sells
one on Sephora's website but this is
truly everything unique kind of seems
like a little set of tweezers here but
you've got this little guide that's
going to actually hold on to the hairs
of your lashes and it's gonna hold it in
place for you so you can easily place it
right along your lash line and then Oh
what about pressing it down just turn
the dangling around and you've got this
little like kind of rubbery very stiff
tip right here and you can use that to
take your fingers totally out of the
equation if you want to and tap it all
down and what's the difference between
using something like this as opposed to
just a set of tweezers to apply the
lashes if we're talking a full strip of
lashes that goes all the way across the
lash line the neat thing about this is
that it kind of flattens it out just a
little bit sometimes lashes end up very
very curvy and the issue can be getting
them to straighten out enough to
actually fit onto a human lash line you
know and so that's why we end up going
in with both hands and really pulling at
them and with this the fact that this
little applicator is still wide when you
do clamp down on a set of lashes it kind
of straightens them out a little bit
more so you have that ease in
application and my last little thing
that I'm going to throw in here just a
little bonus item this tool this tool
rarely gets talked about except
sometimes in videos like this where I'm
specifically mentioning tools but this
is for real techniques and this is the
lash and brow groomer so on one side you
have this nice little brush now the
other side you've got a comb what's
special about this particular little
metal comb is that you will notice it
doesn't have any of those frustrating
little comb bookends
by that I mean thicker bits of comb that
actually prevent the comb from going
straight up through your lashes because
it's like it's got these little blockers
on the end a lot of plastic combs do
that so for this you just got the
straight up comb so you can go at your
lashes from any angle or get your lower
lashes I comb through my lower lashes so
much with something like this so that's
just an invaluable tool but then this
thicker brush can also be nice just
combing through your brows if you're in
a situation where you've ran out of lash
glue give a little spritz of hairspray
onto this kind of a brush and just take
it on through your brows and you've got
like hold in your brows again but yeah
those are kind of my beauty tool unsung
heroes some things do get talked about a
little bit more than others here and
there but there's certainly great
quality items and things that you can
get and integrate into your makeup
routine and cost you you know less than
five six bucks thank you guys so much
for your time I really appreciate it I
am so excited for my Saturday video
coming up very soon it's gonna be great
and I will see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
