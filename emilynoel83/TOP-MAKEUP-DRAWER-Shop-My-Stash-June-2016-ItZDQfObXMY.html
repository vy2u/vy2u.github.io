video is going to be a look inside my
top makeup drawer it's kind of a space
that I reserved for products that I want
to make a point to use and when you've
got a really big collection I do get a
lot of questions how do you make use of
everything how do you know what you have
and first off I think it's really
important to stay well organized
throughout your collection so you do
know what's there but secondly I do
think it's a really good idea to shop
your stash so to speak and have a basket
or have a drawer set aside where you can
put products that maybe you had
forgotten about a little bit or you just
kind of want to refresh your memory on
or you never did a review on them so you
want to learn more I use my drawer for
those kinds of things but also certain
new products that I just have recently
put into the mix and I want to make sure
to use those as well so my makeup usage
doesn't 100% come from this drawer over
the duration of the month I'll use
things from everywhere but sometimes you
know I'll be thinking what foundation am
I gonna use today oh I'll check the
drawer and see what things you know that
I want to make a point to be able to
have reviewed by the end of the month
you know on my face today I'm wearing
all products from that drawer so I'll
make a note of all those things in the
description box as I always do if you're
ever curious like what lipstick or what
eye products I'm wearing and I don't
mention it in the video it's always
listed below in the description box but
let's take a look inside okay here we
are here's my drawer you're probably
seeing a lot of these clear dividers
these are really great trays for these
long shallow drawers and I've gotten
many of those from places like TJ Maxx
or Ross I believe I also came up with a
few of those at Target too but I'm going
to start over here with some face
products and this Smashbox primer oil
has lived in this drawer before but now
I kind of want to use it with a
different purpose I want to try mixing
this with some more things I've seen
some little video clips showing that
being mixed in with different concealers
and foundations not just strictly using
it as
a priming face oil so I'm excited to try
that also I recently got my hands on
this L'Oreal sublime bronze wash off
face bronzer cream I've had a product
kind of like this before and I really
liked it so I thought I could either use
this alone like a cream bronzer or I
could mix it in with foundations a
couple of concealers that I just haven't
been using a lot of lately I've got my
Mac Pro Longwear there and then this NYX
gotcha Covered
which reminds me a lot of the it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye it's a very
very creamy thick like a lot of dewy
texture to that concealer but I just
hadn't used it a whole lot so I want to
make sure to use it now and then here if
I can turn them so you can see I've got
several foundations that I really want
to like by the end of this month have
come to a conclusion on so I've got the
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer the Bhoots number seven
stay perfect Charlotte Tilbury magic
foundation and a couple of more
lightweight things this new covergirl
matte clean BB and the burst B's BB so
that's my goal is to really you know
figure these out I've been wearing them
a decent amount but like with the
Charlotte Tilbury it's the claims are so
high for that product I just can't
decide if it's magical you know what I'm
saying is it that great I don't know
over here I've got some blush bronzer
highlight type things this is from ELF I
had talked about in a haul video these
aqua Beauty blushes and bronzers they're
a little different texture than the old
blush bronzer duos which were just
straight-up powders these are kind of
like a little bit of a cream powder
hybrid in here this one that I'm wearing
today is called bronzed peach and then
there are some more pinky options too I
pulled out my balm desert which I
absolutely loved this product and it
just kind of got off the radar a little
bit but this is really cool as a bronzer
but also a really pretty like neutral
blush I've loved using that as blush Too
Faced has their candle light glow and
more recently they came out with the
warm glow version which is a little more
golden e peachy instead of having like
the pinky shade over there on the right
so I got this out the warm glow to use
makeup revolution vivid baked bronzer
and shade is called golden days and it
seems to be a very very subtle kind of
like all-over bronzy highlight type
product so I'm gonna try that and this
thing this was such a hidden gem that I
hadn't been using it's from City color
timeless beauty it says and it's like
for sort of highlight slash bronzer type
products but really interesting tones
you can see one's more rosy ones a
little bit more of a deeper brownish
bronze you got kind of a traditional
bronze and then an actual golden color
that I highlighted with today so the
textures on these are divine very creamy
very soft so I'm excited to get use out
of that now I've got three loose powders
floating around in here I've got this
one from Clinique the invisible blend
I've got the Estee Lauder Double Wear
mineral loose powder and this Fiona
Styles loose powder as well so I'm going
to be kind of comparing these comparing
coverage levels trying different ones
for baking here or there although not
every shade will be ideal for that but I
just am kind of into loose powders these
days I've got this hard candy brow ink
which you've maybe heard me talk about
before it's got a teeny tiny brush and
it's just like a tinted brow gel but
it's not very goopy at all it's just a
very fine brush and I had talked about
how much I enjoyed it but I just hadn't
used it much so now this drawer is
really the ideal place for a product
like that want to make sure I use it
it's really good stuff and then you see
here I had gotten a bunch of these
double ended pencils from elf basically
they've come out with their own version
of nude sticks is what it seems to be so
they've got lip pencils you might see
some darker ones on there like eyeliner
eye shadow pencils brightener type
pencils and I really want to use those
try them out compare them to any of the
nude sticks that I have see if they're
creamy enough to realistically use like
as blushes or cheek products or all the
multitasking ability they claim to have
so sort of smallish individual eye
product
I had gotten this trio from Almay which
I thought looked really interesting the
color payoff on this I'm wearing it
today it's not really what I hoped it
would be I mean I don't see the purple
or the gold really standing out as much
as I would have liked but it's one of
those products the texture seems
actually kind of decent so I'm willing
to work with a few other things remember
that two-faced Vegas nay Stardust
palette it came with like a really loose
shimmery eyeshadow and I thought that
might be fun to work into some looks
because I really hadn't used that very
much I've got a great gorgeous single
here from Kat Von D this is called Iggy
is the shading it's a very pigmented
shimmery metallic emerald green and I've
just kind of got a vision in my head for
how I want to use that so pulled that
aside not this random Maybelline single
and earthly taupe file this away under
products I purchased but barely used so
that might be a nice kind of crease or
blended out color and then a couple of
these pretty NYX prismatic eyeshadows
these are gorgeous when it comes to
shiny shimmery metallic finish shades
the lighter one is called golden peach
and that dark green is called jaded I've
got several color pop highlights pulled
in here because I just have a really
hard time remembering to use these this
light white pearly one is called fanny
pack then this one is called lunch money
I believe yet this one kind of reminds
me of mary lou manizer from the balm and
then i have a more bronze e one this is
called butterfly beach and the texture
on these is just fantastic
really really soft they go on nice with
your fingers you could use like a
stipple brush or any kind of brush you
like to use with creams because these
are kind of that cream powder mix my wet
and wild contouring palette caramel
toffee fabulous contouring product
really affordable very simplified I need
to be using that more and then I've got
this NYX ultimate palette err the warm
neutrals a variety of finishes I think
summertime would be a great time to get
use out of this palette I also recently
discovered a cool Pacifica palette kind
of that all in one palette with the
highlights and blush and eyeshadow
really enjoyed that and wanted to try
more eyeshadows so I got this natural
minerals eyeshadow palette love
and gold I really think purple and gold
look pretty together also purple and
peach and all of those combos are
available in this palette these are
really exceptionally soft lightweight
eyeshadows so I'm pumped to use that
I've also been fortunate to have been
gifted some really cool makeup items and
these are from Lisa J and she sent me
some great products from Kryolan which
is a like a professional makeup brand I
know a lot of makeup artists are very
familiar with that and there's this all
matte palette and then this one that has
some shimmer as well and I really
enjoyed these these are nice quality
very smooth eyes shadow this one is
called Kuwait City
this one is Muscat this all matte so I
haven't used the all matte yet but I've
put these in my drawer so I will
definitely remember to do that and then
my girl Erica Jones here on YouTube sent
me this cool palette this I believe is
by makeup revolution and it's called
chocolate vise I think it is makeup
revolutions take on sweet peach so yeah
behold the similarity is if you're
familiar with the Too Faced sweet peach
palette I am pumped to dig into this
there are some gorgeous looking colors
in here lastly in here as far as lip
products I had gotten this lip scrub I
got it off of Beauty lish it's one of
the jeffree star lip scrub lip scrubs
lip scrub it's the root beer scent and
it is just one of those sugar scrubs
feels like there's a ton of product in
here and I am just always more prone
these days to reaching for one of my ELF
exfoliating lip scrub sticks so this is
a little more trouble you know you got
to dip your finger into the stuff and
mush it around on your lips but it does
smell fantastic so I want to make sure I
use that I've got a few newer shades of
the ball meet Matt Hughes which is their
liquid lipsticks and I think these are
some of the better liquid lipsticks on
the market and this shade is actually
the one I'm wearing today it's called
doting and it's a pretty peach color I
don't think they're overly drying and
they smell exactly like Thin Mint Girl
Scout cookies so added bonus I've got a
few Mac lip products including this
huggable
this is in the shade sweet persuasion
it's a nice creamy nude I think it would
be good layered on top of different nude
lip looks so I want to set that aside
and a couple of MAC lipsticks that's
whirl on the Left which is a matte and
lickable from the cream Sheen line which
is a really gorgeous brighter pink that
one's a little bit more new to me and I
think it's just a great summertime shade
so I don't want to miss out using it
this time of year a perfect summer lip
gloss shade this is a buxom lip cream in
the shade cherry flip and it's the lip
creams are more opaque than their
glosses are their lip polishes I think
they're called
and I had gotten a big set of these
around the holidays so this shade I
remembered thinking gosh that is a great
summer kind of watermelon e-type red so
I want to use this also these products
from ELF I think these might have been
called like got a glow lip tints or am i
pulling that name out of thin air I'm
not sure but this is like called perfect
berry and then perfect peach and I have
one that's like it looks almost
transparent but it's a pink and it's
kind of like the idea of the it
cosmetics vitality lip flush in Shanna
say quoi and these products go on
feeling like lip balms but they do stain
and they don't stain exactly like the
colors you see in the tubes like that
looks like a really dark purple and that
looks like a bright orange it will be
more like a light berry stain and a soft
peach looking stain but I've barely used
these so far I really want to try them
out more lastly the brand glossier is
something I have enjoyed for their rose
water mists they've got some cool
skincare products here and there and
they're doing it seems like a few more
makeup type items because I've got a
concealer a brow product and like kind
of a tinted lip balm type product here
called stretch concealer I've got that
in the shade medium 20 boy brow is like
a tinted brow gel type product I've got
that in brown and then this lip product
in Jam which I said tinted lip balm it's
got a little more color to it than that
but it's a nice deep berry shade also
talked about an old and underused
product this is a heated lash curler
from japanesse
and is anyone tried a lash curler like
this and how did it work
I got it I may have used it a couple
times I don't even remember what my
experience was like like it's been years
so I am really pumped to give this a go
again I have forgotten I even had it so
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope that was interesting and these are
definitely some products you can expect
to see in upcoming tutorials and reviews
so thanks for your time and I'll see you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
