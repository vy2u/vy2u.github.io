me I hope you all had a wonderful
Thanksgiving I definitely did a plenty
of food play leftovers play pie so here
I am back home and I wanted to share
with you some things that I took with me
as I travel we went back to my hometown
if you saw my Instagram or snapchat
stories I shared quite a few things on
there but it was a lot of fun and I
always feel like whenever I go somewhere
for a few days I take some makeup with
me I come back with a whole new kind of
idea about the things that I'm using
because I think the deal is you're
confined to using just the things that
you packed when that short span of time
is over you feel like you've really come
to some conclusions about things and so
that's what I wanted to do in this video
is give you some sort of mini reviews on
some of the things that I took with me
and I feel so festive today because I've
got the Santa mug out I believe I got
this from Hobby Lobby actually first
thing I'll mention is kind of skincare
makeup removal related I recently ran
out of my stash of the equate daily
facials cleansing cloths and those are
dry cloths that like suds up when you
get water on them and they are a
fantastic travel thing because you can
just you know grab out as many as you
think you're gonna need toss them in the
bag there's no mess you just toss them
when you're done but I recently ran out
of those and with my boot on you know
with him a broken foot which I'm so
hoping I get to take the boot off this
week I'm going back to the doctor
because it will have been for weeks
exactly on Wednesday so I'll go back and
they'll react srei me and maybe I'll be
able to take it off but anyway because
of the boot you know I don't necessarily
get out to shop as frequently as I might
otherwise so that does kind of cause me
to look around at the stuff I already
have so when I run out of something you
know what else could I use and I've
realized I really like this Urban Decay
meltdown makeup remover cleansing oil
stick and I realize this isn't
necessarily a really different thing
from say the it cosmetics bye bye makeup
or Clinique's I think it's called take
the day off you know there's different
products that come in tubs but this is a
stick so I'm not really gooping my
fingers into it there's just some kind
of special ease in using a stick and
just using it all over your face this by
the way does smell really good smells a
little bit fruity to me actually it
doesn't taste good
if you can happen to get any on your
lips and doesn't taste great but here's
what I'm finding when I use this and
then i pair it with some type of wet
wipe which generally for me like
pre-moistened towelettes just don't get
the job done of removing everything so
well particularly eye makeup and so I
can take this stick all over my face and
so I just rub rub rub everywhere even
straight over my eyelids mascara you
name it and then I just get a little bit
of water on my fingers and sort of blend
the product around and you might even
see this it says oil to micro foam it
doesn't foam other ton but I mean I just
add a little water to it and I feel like
it starts breaking everything down just
let it sit on your skin that way for not
even a minute you know just give it a
little time then you grab out a wipe and
I swear everything just goes off so
easily all the eye makeup everything
just 100% completely removes from the
face and the wipe that I've been using
is the Garnier skin active my seller
makeup removing towelettes this is just
the sensitive one you know its
equivalent to the formula that's being
sold with the pink cap they also have
the waterproof kind which I haven't
tried yet but I've already used one
pouch of these and I think they're
pretty darn good I like them because
they're very gentle and they don't leave
residues I'm not saying I don't like my
equate daily facials anymore it's just a
situation where I ran out I came up with
a new thing and one thing that I do like
about this technique though is that it
really doesn't dry me out at all and
this time of year everything's getting
more dry I got the heat running in your
home in your car I think my skin is
maybe more prone to being a little dry
right now and so I feel like using the
oil stick and then one of these is just
super gentle and doesn't strip the skin
at all but it really fully removes
everything which I'm happy with long
story to simply explain that sometimes
when you pair one of those cleansing
balm type products with your wet wipes
and just kind of prep your skin with
that a little bit first
everything can slide off a lot more
easily a little foundation follow up for
you here the maybelline superstay which
I used in that makeup playtime video
that I did I've got this in the shade
warm nude I would say if there's one
thing I could change about this I would
get a little bit lighter shade I might
do that and since
shooting that video I've used this
several times and I'm very happy to
report that I have had very consistent
results with this very similar to what
you saw at the end of that video where I
did the check-ins like there might have
been a little bit of shine around the
nose area I think that's a pretty
standard result with this foundation but
the coverage is awesome really full
coverage and I don't just toss that word
around lightly because I think so many
things claim full coverage that aren't
this was very good in the coverage
Department and very matte so I really
continue to enjoy that and something
that I've been using even like a little
bit before that foundation and just
trying on and off is this LA Colors
truly matte so I traveled with this as
well so I could very closely compare to
this other one and like use one one day
one the next I'm always doing my
homework y'all even when I'm on the road
so this says long wearing high pigment
foundation I'm wearing it in the shade
natural and I'm wearing that today as
well this is I believe the second
lightest shade that they have and I was
so surprised like I have a whole PR box
of this stuff and so I was going through
different shades and the ones that I
initially picked for myself were like
way too dark or way too yellow this one
really does suit me but I'm not like the
lightest of the light skin so if you are
like SuperDuper fair there may not be a
lot of options for you in this line I
like this foundation it has worn very
well for me
however it's less coverage a little less
coverage than the super stay and it's
also not as mat as this one which is
kind of funny because mattes in the name
but it's not like incredibly matte on
the skin I think it's giving me a very
pretty look I don't always need the
fullest coverage and so this can
definitely be adequate for me and the
staying power I find to be really good
but I just think it's more of like a
natural maybe semi matte type finish
because this bad boy in comparison is
bringing the coverage hardcore bringing
the madness and this one's just not
quite going that far it's just a little
bit lighter foundation all around
however I'm also testing the LA Colors
translucent setting powder and their
mineral pressed powder these are the
steps that end up making this look matte
if you pair it all together because in
the days that I've been
I've been using these products as well
and I'll come away from the whoops
saying wow I'm so mad but then I kind of
remind myself no right after you put
this foundation on it really wasn't that
mad it's the powder that's making it
that way if you want to go that route
you know
so the translucent setting powder this
really reminds me a lot of the it
cosmetics bye bye pores I mean it works
really well as a light under eye setting
powder I've got that on my under eye
area today and around my nose too and I
do think it kind of disguises the look
of pores it makes you super duper mat
just like instantaneously so if you're
looking for a good low-cost mattifying
translucent powder there's that but I
would say what I'm even more impressed
with perhaps is the mineral pressed
powder and I have this in fair again I
think everything in this line is running
a little dark the smoothness of this
powder it's got a feeling that's kind of
on par with L'Oreal True Match but maybe
even a little more coverage than that
kind of reminding me of the Milani
multitasker powder actually just one
like swirl in the compact it feels very
rich this is also pretty mattifying too
but if I've got both of these I'm gonna
be more likely to maybe use this on the
under eye because it doesn't give me any
added darkness or any added color you
know to that area and then I put this
everywhere else and when you do that
with this foundation you end up with a
super duper matte look but I was pretty
pleasantly surprised by those powders I
think this one especially the texture is
awesome good I need to check the price
point and see how it compares to some of
those other drugstore ones that if it's
lower cost than those I think it might
be worth seeking this one out and I'm
really surprised to see that coming from
LA Colors because their skin products
their complexion things have
traditionally not been that good for me
so I'm happy to see that oh I also
wanted to mention I've been using the
master prime to just regardless with
anything and I love the added hydration
that this gives pretty remarkable primer
I think dry skin folks would love to
have a nice layer of this underneath
their foundations particularly when
you're going for something like the
super stay that can set sort of quickly
on the skin it's very matte it's very
full coverage a primer like that is your
friend by the way can we just appreciate
again the beautiful sky behind
this morning I need to just position
myself off to the side a little bit more
so if you're tired of looking at my face
you can just look out the window the eye
palette I took with me I said I was
gonna take the it cosmetics beauty book
but then I was like now you already
pretty much know what you think about
that thing you need to take something
new and like I said do your homework and
figure out what you think of something
else so I took this palette this is the
Too Faced clover palette and this is
named after the founders dog there he is
right there I mean if I had a makeup
line I would totally make a cupcake
palette and when they launched this I
believe they donated like a quarter of a
million dollars to and some sort of
animal related organization Best Friends
Animal Society it was what it was so
that was nice to see as well but this is
what the palette looks like I mean just
the outside can we just look at this for
a moment it's complete nonsense I mean
we've got like a whale with a unicorn
horn there's doughnuts chocolate bars
cats dogs bunnies peaches ice cream I
like when Too Faced has a concept they
they really fully commit to it I like
and this is the color palette guys I
like this one a lot I really enjoyed
this and I thought the quality was
spectacular actually
the mattes are great I love the shimmery
shades this purple is just sorry about
the chipped nail but this purple is
awesome that peachy shimmer right above
it is great to these three mats in this
row are like my best friends it's truly
such a fun palette and you can do so
many different things with it and after
thinking only like the reddish or warm
neutral Brown possibly the purple shade
appeals to you then you're falling into
that sunset color scheme that I
personally really like but if those are
the only kinds of shades that appeal to
you I would once again direct you toward
the lorac unzipped desert sunset because
it's kind of got all of that type of
shade into one condensed really nice
quality palette but if the thought of
going beyond that color scheme appeals
to you and you want the yellow and you
want like the blue up here and this
green and then you've got this duochrome
color down here
he's like brownish mathy mattes here are
just awesome I really like those wish I
would have taken more pictures of the
different looks that I've done with
and but I know I got one when I did the
purple but I'm not really saying this is
everyone's dream palette or this is
something absolutely everyone out there
needs but if this whole color scheme
appeals to you which I would overall
describe as neutral with quite a few
different pops if you like that idea but
you were wondering about the quality or
on the fence about what this was like
quality wise I think it's really really
nice
and as I said the outer packaging
complete nonsense going on here like a
nonsense parade but I love it the face
thing that I took with me as much as I
wanted to like take something brand new
and different I couldn't hold back from
taking my hourglass palette I'm wearing
all of the stuff today as well I just
love this so much I think the mixture of
things in here is just perfect and I've
become so accustomed to like having my
little routine with this and I go to
each different shade and I have a
certain way that I like to put it on and
I just I love that okay I promise I'm
almost done just a few more things here
I have found a liquid eyeliner that I'm
really enjoying and guys has maybe been
years since I've brought a new liquid
eyeliner into the conversation because
you know I love the Jordana color Envy
but I've got so many liquid eyeliners
that I need to be using that I kind of
decided the last one that I ran out of I
was gonna try to dig into what I already
had and I used the NYX matte I actually
used that whole one up I was not happy
with the brush tip the formula itself
was fine but I didn't like the way their
brush was kind of like a little bit flat
and not so much just a pointed tip ran
out of that one kiss that one goodbye
and now I've moved on to this L'Oreal
infallible super slim and I have it in
black and this is not a fully waterproof
liner okay I gotta get that out of the
way first because I really like using
waterproof liquid liners particularly
this time of year even more than summer
like I'm not the type who's gonna wear
full or partial makeup to a pool and
then jump in and hope it all lasts no
get all the makeup off just put
sunscreen on me so I can swim you know
that's what I'm about at this time of
year I think I can use the waterproof
even more because the air is drier and I
think I'm more prone to watery eyes
especially sitting in a car I don't know
how many times I look you know doing
that little daddy thing hoping that
nothing was smudging and I've done
winged liner
with this and it still hasn't gone
anywhere I guess is the point I'm trying
to come to here it's not a waterproof
formula because like when I swatch it on
my hand I can pretty easily get this off
with water but it seems to still
withstand regular wear and even a little
bit of watery eyes so it's been okay for
me in that respect I love the shape of
the tip this is crucial for me I love
the length and the taper of that because
I can pretty much lay that down across
my lash line and get a very easy very
quick application also it's juicy enough
I've been using this on and off for a
few weeks now and it's definitely plenty
of juice going across I don't like a dry
felt tip also it's very black and very
matte I don't want any shine coming
across when I'm using something like
this for the purpose of you know lining
my upper lash line doing a wing having a
nice clean black line there I want it
matte and so this one definitely is
checking all the boxes for me it also
doesn't flake off or do anything weird
in terms of wear and pensar always easy
I've never really been an type in but
it's just so many of them aren't juicy
enough and you use them for just a
couple of weeks and they become so dry
that it's more of a hassle to use them
than it is help so good product really
enjoyed that and then this mascara that
I've been trying out is the Marc Jacobs
it's the Emily here you can see it's got
my name no it's not actually called the
Emily but that was very sweet of them to
put that on there and send that in the
PR package that's very fun to see my
name on something thank you this is the
velvet noir major Volume Mascara hey
it's tiny print and I could actually
read digging the hexagon-shaped
packaging there and the brush is a
really nice size it's really not very
big at all the bristles are rather short
it's a very shallow hourglass which is
fine because it can get in touch with
all my lashes if it's gonna be an
hourglass it really needs to be that way
it can't dip too deep or else the depth
of that's never gonna touch your lashes
I really like the blackness of this I
like the ability to lengthen out when I
first used it I thought wow it's pretty
wet now after about a week's time using
it on and off it's not quite as wet but
it's still a little too heavy it builds
on itself really nicely it's just not
ideal for holding the curl and that's
than the amass care has really got to do
for me so I don't see myself
repurchasing this one I do see myself
saving this tube because again it's got
my name on it that's awesome it doesn't
fall into my worst mascaras ever pile it
just falls into my medium mascara pile
that L'Oreal lash paradise I gotta say
it holds the curl it builds up quickly
it just does so many things great for me
and this one just not quite as good and
I took quite a few litte products with
me I took the little best bite kit the
set of four lipsticks because I thought
there's a great range and I'll have
whatever shades I need I also took my
bare minerals set that I talked about as
well in the gift guide video because I
loved that formula and those are great
nudes and I got a new renaissance
lipstick well fairly recently from
makeup revolution and this is the shade
rebirth and I just I think this is kind
of a unique shade I wanted to share with
you it's not what I'm wearing right now
it really is just pumpkin I think it's
so pretty and someone was asking me I
think it was after I'd mentioned the Too
Faced gingerbread man shade like what's
comparable to that I'm not really
calling this comparable to that because
that's a got a little more red in it
it's a little bit deeper but I was
starting to realize that I just don't
have a lot of things in my collections
that are this sort of dusty burnt orange
like I'd call this a little bit dustier
than a University of Texas Longhorn
burnt orange you know but this is a
super creamy very pleasant to wear
formula and I like this color in it very
much so guys that is it for this video I
hope this was somewhat interesting I
just felt like I came away from my
travels with so many like little ideas
that I wanted to pass along about these
different products as always thank you
so much for your time thank you for
subscribing and for your kind comments I
appreciate them more than you know and I
will see you very soon in my next video
