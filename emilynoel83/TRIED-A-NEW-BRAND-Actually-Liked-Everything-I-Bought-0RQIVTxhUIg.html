this video I really felt like I just had
to sit down and do this video because
something happened in my little makeup
world it just does not seem to happen
ever and the situation was I did an
order on Ulta and I saw this brand
called Lottie London and I'm completely
unfamiliar with this line never tried a
thing from it haven't watched any videos
on it you know just haven't really
sought out any information but I thought
I'm going to randomly just try some of
these things I didn't have super high
hopes honestly I didn't like go and
purchase everything in the line but I
thought just get a random assortment and
just get a taste I bought 5 things and
no lie I really enjoy all five items and
that just doesn't seem to happen these
days like just trying a random new
drugstore brand and I feel like there
are lots there's so many things coming
to Ulta in particular different lines
here and there and a lot of stuff I feel
like it's kind of entering into the
drugstore marketplace at a higher price
point than a lot of people are used to
paying I mean you guys know it's not
unheard of to see a 1516 dollar
foundation in the quote-unquote
drugstore so when I saw this stuff
coming in it like $7.99 for a foundation
6 bucks for a bronzer a $12 a shadow
palette was kind of exciting for me to
see so I got to stuff home and like I
said I really enjoy every product and
that surprised me a lot because I'm just
used to a lot of hits and misses you
know something's working in
consistencies here and there with
whatever kind of line it might be might
need drugstore might be high-end so in
this video nothing super fancy I'm just
going to go through each of the 5 things
that I try I've got them all on my face
right now so I'll show you you know how
they apply and stuff and I just thought
this was definitely worth sharing
because this was kind of an exciting
thing and it does lead me to what to try
more from this brand first thing that I
have here is a foundation and it's
really exciting when you get a
foundation shopping solely off of ulties
website and it turns out to be the right
shade because sometimes things are
really off there as you're trying to
like look at their shades and figure it
all out but this is a selfie ready
medium coverage matte foundation it says
water-based foundation enriched with
vitamin C this little packaging here by
the way I just realizing and totally
matching when I have this in the shade
golden the cap twists off and it's
squeezy but it's kind of a
hard-plastic that's maybe one thing I
don't love because it's working fine now
but as you start to run out of this
product like it's a pretty firm bottle
and you might have trouble squeezing it
out when you get toward the end to
texture on this foundation it's not as
liquidy and say a Maybelline fit me
matte in Portland a little more thick
than that and I think that does help
this product coverage wise I just kind
of spot it across my skin and then I
just chose to blend it out this time
with my Sigma f80 brush and the coverage
is really quite good they call this a
medium coverage foundation I first off
like that they are just saying that I
feel like sometimes coverage only gets
talked about with foundations in terms
of the marketing of them when it's like
super full coverage and they try to call
it that and a lot of times it falls
short
this claims to be medium coverage and I
think it's definitely on the fullest end
of medium coverage like it's close to
full and it's a matte finish
yes but it's such a natural medicine
it's just staying power what this has
been good for me as well but I don't
know it's just so exciting it's a really
low price tag for a drugstore foundation
these days you know seven dollars and
change so it's giving me coverage it's
evening out the skin it's matte but not
too matte you know not to the point of
looking drying at all I just think it
has a really fresh appearance on the
skin brand turns out a good foundation
you know I'm listening I'm here I want
to see what else you got so now I really
wish I would have gotten a concealer
from this line I didn't do that this
round but I will no doubt be picking up
a concealer in the future in terms of
the order of products and the next thing
that I would put on after just some
concealer and maybe a little bit of
powder is this tan time bronzer I got it
in the shade light to medium it's really
cute it's got little stars on the
product and the bronzer itself is super
soft just very pigmented very smooth
it's completely matte and I would say
this is probably about as warm as I
would go for a bronzer but I'm really
liking what it does for my skin I think
it warmed up my skin tone just how I
would want a bronzer to do I used my
soft angled contour brush from Sigma and
I went around my hairline I went in the
hollow of the cheek I went down under
the chin neck area and I didn't have to
use a lot of the product I don't know if
you could see on video but I was just
like blotting my brush into this and
again the price points of the stuff
makes it all the more impressive it's
$6.99
and I mean it was just very easy to use
I don't know that a super fair like cool
tone person would love this shade
they're here around my skin tone which
is kind of light to medium I thought
this worked really well and it is called
light to medium the blush from this
brand is so good so want to try more of
these shades
it's the blush crush blush and I have it
in the shade Drake I know a lot of
people roll their eyes at this
description but this is truly peachy
pink right here it's a peachy pink blush
it's not too light not too dark it's the
perfect amount of like just a gentle
flush to the cheeks I just again blot my
brush into this product you don't have
to stir it up scrub into it whatsoever
it would appear as you look at this guys
that it's a baked blush because it is
that kind of rounded and domed up design
but really it doesn't have any of the
characteristics of a baked blush it's
not dry it actually feels borderline
creamy to the touch and this is a satin
finish so it's got just a little hint of
the glow to it and if you use this alone
and don't top with any highlight like
you still have a really fresh pretty
look to the cheeks absolutely love this
blush it's a total home run - thumbs up
pigmented amazing blush for five dollars
and change next thing that I got from
this line is the shadow swatch eyeshadow
palette in the rough so this is a
twelfth color palette $12.99 for this
palette I think that's completely
reasonable thinking about something
similar in size it's out in the
drugstore right now like L'Oreal's
palettes they've got some longer
palettes like this but I believe this
amount of shades in it and they're
charging close to 20 bucks for those so
it's called the rest and yeah it's going
to be primarily a warm color tone
palette here you've got a mix of mint
and shimmer which is really nice to see
and it's in all the right places really
you've got like your light match cream
shade up here you've got a couple of
different kind of mid-tone match to play
with and down in this end we've got a
nice deep berry color and like a black
brown shade in the midst of that you've
got some metallic shades you've got some
shades with a hint of shimmer
we've got colors that are no doubt super
warm but also some kind of topi shades
the interesting thing about this palette
as I look at it and you could completely
bypass the warm shades at times and give
yourself a totally cool
look you know you can focus in on like
maybe this shimmery color put it a
little taupe with that mix in some of
the dark brown and no one would know
that you used a palette called rust if I
look at this I am getting some Urban
Decay Naked heat vibes so I'm just going
to hold them up here for you can see
there's a lot more richness I think in
The Naked heat palette just deeper tones
a little just heavier on the orange
stuff happening there and the ladi
London palette has some more light
shades for cool shades it's just not a
strictly 100% warm palette like naked
heat quality wise I found these shapes
to be pretty consistent pretty easy to
work with I would say maybe my favorites
in the palette are actually the matte
colors which is sometimes surprising I
think it can at times be easier for
brands to turn out like a really good
shimmery shadow maybe it's just because
you get pickier with mess like they
contend to be dry they can tend to apply
a little bit patchy or whatever and
these seem just really smooth and easy
to work with speaking of doing a warmer
cool look you could also do an all
shimmer or all matte look with this
palette pretty easily as well just
thinking quality wise what I would
compare these shadows to I mean there is
a nice softness to the texture but it's
not as soft or as may be super intense
as like a wet and wild comfort zone
palette those if you've tried that you
know what I'm talking about it's a tiny
dip into the product it's a use as
little as possible because you could go
too far with it this I think might be a
little bit more beginner friendly
because while the shapes are pigmented
and you're not going to be in a struggle
to make them show up they're not
something I feel like I have to be
incredibly careful with and part of that
might also be the color scheme you know
you've only got a few shades in this
palette that I would call really on the
dark end of the spectrum and those are
those three right down here otherwise
you've got a pretty good sized chunk of
mid-tones and then some light shades so
I guess I'm trying to say is I'm not
scared of any of these colors and I do
think they work nicely together for the
look that I did today I actually tried
to work in a little bit of a cooler tone
just to show you how a taupe works in
with some of these warmer shades so I
first put on Milani eyeshadow primer
which I paired with basically any
eyeshadow that I use I patted the center
taupe shimmery shade all over my lids
for
and I kind of work that up into my
creases Wells is the kind of shadow that
I would definitely consider for a one
shadow look because it gives you just
the slightest amount of Sheen but also a
little bit of depth and definition too
then I decided to work some of the berry
color into this look it's kind of a
burgundy berry shade definitely see the
red in this color as I shear it out but
I work that kind of into the outside of
my crease area then I kind of wanted to
go above that and warm things up a bit
more with one of these matte neutral I
use the warmest of the two and just with
a light wispy brush here I use this just
kind of like a transition shade then I
use the lightest shade in this palette
under my brow just closest to my brow
and then also around the inner corner of
the eye now we're going to jump away
from the palette for just a second
because in the scope of this little eye
look I use the eyeliner that I have this
is the a.m. to p.m. Kohl eyeliner pencil
in black so I'll just show you this
going on right away it goes on
SuperDuper smooth and so I want to cross
the upper lash line and I actually
winged this out and I felt I had the
control to do so the reason why I really
wanted to go shimmery on my lids today
was to show you how a pencil liner can
go on top of it and still maintain full
color because a lot of times going over
a shimmer can lessen or kind of weaken
the intensity of a black eyeliner or any
colored eyeliner that you're trying to
layer on top so this performed really
well in that way and I'll get back some
more details on that liner in a second
and very much keeping this a look that's
on the upper part of the eye I need all
the lifts and awakeness that I can get
today with this so I curled my lashes I
applied some L'Oreal voluminous lash
paradise to the upper lashes just a
little bit of covergirl clump crusher
water resistant on the lower lashes and
then put on some false lashes I think
these are my Koko lashes in the style
called Soho and really just love the
finished look I think it's a great
everyday look this is a really good
everyday palette I think it could take
you to a dramatic place if that's where
you want to go but it's not going to
keep you super confined in terms of tone
at all times and actually I do feel that
way about naked heat I feel like it's a
very predictable palette and you're
going to just stay in that same color
zone pretty much all the time if you
love love love your warm shades that's
maybe not a problem for you but here
I think it's fun to work in you know a
couple of these taupe colors this one
even has just the slightest bit of lilac
to it which I thought is an interesting
twist you've got a good gold in here
kind of an old gold type shade your
shimmery champagne all the mattes that
you'd really want or need thrown into
the mix so I think this is pretty darn
good little $12 a drugstore eye palette
back to this liner I want to show you I
think this is a great test of a liner if
you ever trying to decide how creamy it
is and how easily it can transfer just
barely hold on to the products with just
a couple of fingers and let it
absolutely graze your skin just in a
swatch and see what you pick up there
and if you feel like you're picking up a
good intensity of product by barely
holding onto the liner I think you're
onto something there so I feel as though
I am with this product it just transfers
SuperDuper easily it's just as easy on
the eyes you know what this eye look I
didn't struggle whatsoever I was not
applying a ton of pressure and I was
able to top off a shimmery shade and
still have maximum intensity out of this
product now yesterday I had this not
only on my upper lash line but also in
my waterline lower inner rim and on my
lower lash line and I'm not going to
beat around the bush here I cried
yesterday ma man was not easy yesterday
and part of what comes into that might
be having a couple kids that are sick
and I'm sick and houses just sick right
now and my mascara which I'll probably
talk about this in a different video but
my mascara was flaking off but the liner
really didn't move it faded a little bit
from the lower inner rim but was not
completely absent from the inner rim at
the end of the day and what was on my
lower lash line actually had to be
removed with remover this is one of
those liners that sets and just doesn't
leave and I bought this for less than
five dollars five for five on products
here from a brand I was completely
unfamiliar with did not research a bit
and I'm liking everything that I got so
I'm excited to try some more from this
Lottie London line I would say two
things that I'm especially intrigued
about would be I got to see how the
concealer works from this line and I've
got to try a lip product the lip product
I've been wearing throughout this video
is Mac's
velvet teddy lipstick where is this
lipstick been all my life is that not a
perfect
color yeah this might blow love that but
thank you guys for watching if you tried
anything from this brand that I should
know about let me know in the comments
section and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
