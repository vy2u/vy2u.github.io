tuning in today's topic is the clinic
tiny temptation set I showed this in my
big haul video that I did recently and I
asked if you guys would be interested in
seeing you know like a full on lip
swatch video of all of these and a lot
of you are very interested in that and I
kind of wanted to do it too because I
thought it would be nice to sort of hone
in on the different color categories and
figure out which ones I really liked the
best
I believe it's available at Sephora and
Ulta maybe some other retailers also and
it's just under $50 49 50 for the set of
20 itty-bitty clinic chubby sticks so
this is the way it comes at top and come
off it's a nice metal tray and you can
just put that on the underside and
there's a little insert here as well
that looks like it would come out so if
you wanted to use this for some other
type of storage you totally could I
can't quite tell if that pictures in
focus I'm just kind of creeped in here
in the background but that is a quick
look at the full spectrum of the 20
chubby sticks that you get it is a mix
of chubby stick regulars and the intense
variety and so for my own ability to
just see this at a glance I turned all
the chubby stick intense ones upside
down it looks like 12 regular chubby
sticks and then eight of the chubby
stick intense variety I'm going to try
all of them on for you I'm going to do
it sort of rapid-fire style in terms of
like the color families and then I'll
stop after each color family and sort of
talk about the ones that I like the best
just to talk a little bit about these
formula wise first chubby sticks are
really like a tinted lip balm to me the
color payoff is light in most cases in a
lot of situations with these sticks I
feel like they can be builds up a little
bit like there's a small range but
they're definitely not going to take you
to the point that you get to with a
standard cream lipstick you know it's
going to be somewhat sheer now one thing
that you run into a lot in the overall
tinted lip-balm marketplace which I've
tried a lot I'm a bit of an expert with
the tinted lip balms and a lot of them
are very heavily scented and flavored
it's like brand see
tinted lip balms is their opportunity to
load in all the flavor all the fun stuff
probably to appeal to a younger
demographic who's going to be looking
for a more lightweight product on the
lips but from Clinique you're not going
to get all of that scent all of the
overwhelming extras if you've got a lot
of sensitivities to different products
that probably sounds really good to you
you might also be interested to know
that these are formulated without
parabens sulfates and phthalates and I
can also say that I tried on all 20 of
these back to back to back back no real
breaks in-between no need to pull in
something like some kind of crazy balm
to just really moisturize my lips and
I'm still standing collect right on all
20 and my lips really feel fine so I
think that's definitely saying something
about the comfort of these formulas and
these just aren't drying lip products
whether they are the chubby sticks or
the intense ones there's a lot of
smoothness there is a lot of
moisturization that you feel I would say
I feel the most balm like kind of
smoothness with the regular chubby
sticks and then the texture of the
chubby stick intense is more like a
cream lipstick for those while they do
have a moisturizing feel it's kind of
dialed back a little bit and I feel like
as I apply them I'm getting sort of an
instantaneous color intensity it's not
something where I've got a really work
to build it up to its fullest extent
it's just kind of showing up on the lips
automatically and there's not a lot of
shine with those which sort of surprises
made but I like it because I think it
gives you a lot of variety especially
within a set like this to have some of
those shades that aren't overly shiny
that are very colorful and honestly with
just a little bit of wear time on the
chubby stick intense or even just a
quick blot right after applying you can
have kind of a matte finish I'm wearing
one of the intense ones right now I'm
throughout this video it's the roundest
or no roomiest Rose I love all of the
little descriptive words with the names
of these but you can see there I mean
it's a full color shade that remains
very comfortable very moisturizing on
the lips I mean I can't even describe
how nice and creamy it feels to rub my
lips together it feels so good but yet
you're not seeing a ton of shine so on
the whole I would say I'm most impressed
with the chubby stick intense just
because I feel like I get the most
colour payoff they feel great it's a
great look on the lips there are a lot
of really beautiful shades that have
been thrown in here at the same time I
still see the value in the regular
chubby sticks you know those are ultra
comfortable I could see myself applying
a lot of those in a pinch in the car
maybe with or without a mirror some of
them can build up to sort of an
unexpected place color wise which I like
little surprises like that so I'm really
happy with this set I think this is a
samplers dream if you really like to
sample different colors you're getting a
fantastic range in here but don't get to
like totally wrapped up in what I'm
saying here my love for this because you
might not be the same kind of person I
am in terms of liking to just grab for
anything sample a different kind of
shade every single day and if that's not
you
you might find yourself like clinging to
just a couple of these colors and then
maybe getting kind of disappointed for
the fact that there's not a lot in there
I mean we're not talking like this whole
stick is filled it's not you're getting
basically the tip here now given the
amount that I've used some of these
already I can already tell that it's
going to be kind of a slow wear down
these aren't like SuperDuper soft like a
quarter of the sticks going to transfer
onto your lips and you're going to feel
like you wore it down really quickly
they're not really that way so I think
you are going to find yourself with a
surprising amount of uses per stick I
can't really nail that down for each
individual person out there but I'm just
saying this if you're only planning to
stick to two or three shades you'll
obviously find yourself running out of
these faster than if you're constantly
bouncing around but these are colors
that you could like go to a Clinique
counter go to a website and you know you
could order certain ones individually
and so that's another reason why I
wanted to show them all because I
thought you know maybe somebody's just
truly interested in one or two colors
that they see me apply in this video
hopefully this video gives you some
information you can see it sort of
within a spectrum of similar shades and
figure out what ones you like the best
but let's start with the trying on I
have divided it up into four groups of
five I've got neutrals quarrels and Reds
pinks and
then berries and plums so you're going
to see five of them applied at a time
and then I'll kind of come back and chat
with you about what I thought
I have a couple of favorites from the
neutral set one of them that sort of
surprised me is the color called grape
DUP and in a swatch I don't feel like
it's necessarily that impressive
whatsoever it but it does build up a
little bit on the lips and it's kind of
like the ultimate your lips but better
shade to me it gives my lips a little
bit of extra shine but it's still super
low-maintenance that's one of just the
regular formulas right there and then
the other one that I love from this set
is curviest caramel that is one of the
chubby stick intense varieties it's a
beautiful warm nude this is probably one
of the ones that so far in this set I've
worn the most it's like I just reached
for it immediately and kept wanting to
go back now we're going to move on to
the corals and reds
one of my favorites from this set was
mega melon and that was the second one
of the five that you saw me try on and I
think it's a really nice soft coral I
think it's wearable for any time really
you know sometimes you think of corals
is that's a spring or that's a summer
shade because it's so bold but this one
it's a little bit softer I think very
easy and then my other favorite you guys
probably knew I liked this one is the
chub you stick intense in Mightiest
maraschino this is just a great red this
is one that I might use a little bit
more of a blotting technique with um
just to get more staying power and also
to ensure that it stays in place a bit
more I would probably do the double blob
where I apply it give it a blot apply a
little more give it one more blot and
then I think you've got much more locked
in color with any kind of creamy
lipstick formula like this now the next
group we're going to look at are the
pinks
I feel like I have one clear favorite in
this group and it's the one called
roomiest rose that's when you've seen me
in throughout the video absolutely love
this shape because I feel like it's
colorful you know it has some boldness
to it yet it is super wearable it's like
the easiest borderline bright shade to
wear I think it has that little bit of
depth that some of the other pinks in
this category didn't quite have not that
I didn't enjoy some of them but I think
this one is a definite favorite and now
we move on to the berries and plums
okay I've got three undeniable favorites
in this section and I tried to really
think about which one do I like the best
but I just I like all three of the
intense varieties Broadus berry was the
first one of this five that I tried on
and I loved that one so much because
it's kind of like a berry / neutral mix
really wearable if you don't like your
berries to go too close to that purpley
place that might look a little wild or
just push the envelope a little bit this
is a very safe and easy berry the one
called broadest berry but at the same
time I love that roundest raspberry that
I'm feeling that shade so much I'm an
equal-opportunity berry lover and this
is one that contains some of that pretty
violet purplish tone and then I think
the deepest shade in the entire bunch is
the one called grandest grape that's
also an intense one and it's a nice deep
plum not quite as much bright purple
comes out of that one as the last one I
was talking about but I loved it just
the same so if you think you're going to
get a set of chubby sticks and it's just
going to be a bunch of you know natural
barely-there stuff absolutely not you
are getting a lot of the intense ones
and even so some of the regular ones are
quite pigmented in their own right as
well but it's totally two distinct
formulas one that's like a tinted lip
balm but is kind of buildable to an
extent and then one that's like a creamy
lipstick that can very quickly go to a
matte finish as it starts to wear a
little but it still feels really
moisturizing so I give this set two
thumbs up this was a fantastic gift from
my mom and dad so if you enjoyed this
video thank mom and dad they made it
possible and thank you guys so so much
for watching I'd love to hear which
shades are your favorite if you've been
a longtime fan of the chubby sticks
which ones do you swear by maybe there
are some that aren't in this collection
that you'd like to tell everybody about
so thank you again and I'll see you next
time
