all about the newest collection of
lipstick from Maybelline it's the color
sensational line and it's called the
loaded bulbs and I have not actually run
into this line in a store yet where I
live but I did find them on ulties
website and when I stumbled across this
line of lipstick I got so excited about
the color variety first off I like the
color sensational lipstick formula
overall anyway I think the lipsticks
just from the regular collection have a
really nice creamy feel a lot of pigment
to them I was really happy about the
introduction of the creamy mattes
collection I've definitely got some
favorites there and so with this line
what I'm seeing on altas website is an
introduction of 20 new colors the whole
packaging style is right along the lines
of the regular Maybelline Color
sensational lipsticks with the long cap
only everything in this collection is
going to have this pretty like sapphire
blue cap and then boom there's your
lipstick and I got five of them to try I
really tried to spread my range a little
bit as you can see and try you know
something that was right a couple that
were maybe a little more neutral or
normal and what I really like about the
way this whole grouping of lipsticks has
been designed is that it's not just
about bold bright colors I think it's
more being bold in terms of the way
their formula goes on because they've
got some nudes as well and just a few of
the claims real quick that I'm finding
here on their website it says they
deliver one stroke intensity with hyper
color pigments and an opaque creamy clay
base and I do think that one stroke
concept does hold true you can
definitely get a lot of color with one
stroke I end up and you'll see this in
the demo I end up kind of going over
certain areas a little bit more simply
just to neaten up the outer line because
some of these shades are so bold you
really have to be careful with you know
staying inside the lip line or just
getting it as even as you want it to be
and that says sumptuous honey nectar
leaves a creamy finish and that's the
interesting thing about the finish of
these I think it's totally the best of
both worlds if you like a matte finish
on the lips but you don't like the feel
of hardly any matte lip products out
there and these seem even more
comfortable than the creamy mats and I
really like the creamy mats I have no
complaints about the way those feel on
the lips but with these I can tell
there's a little more moisture there
they really do feel like a classic cream
lipstick going on and as you can see on
my lips right now this is very
representative of the way all of these
shades wear on me you're not seeing a
lot of shine it's not like one of those
lipsticks that leaves behind kind of a
glossy finish I really feel like they
overall look matte but completely have
the feel of a cream lipstick very
impressed with that so they've got the
color variety here they've got a great
formula the price is going to be around
$7 which is not unusual for a drugstore
lipstick these days I don't want to
delay too much before the big try on
here but I just want to let you know
staying power this might be kind of the
thing to be aware of because if you've
grown accustomed to a lot of the matte
liquid lipsticks that really stay in
place and don't budge outside the lip
line that's not what these are these can
move around I mean the other night while
I felt like I had very long lasting
intensity I was wearing a mauve shade
that I have here I thought the intensity
of the color stayed for hours and hours
like these are so pigmented that wasn't
really so much a concern but I did
somehow inadvertently like get some lip
product up in here I don't know if I
touched my lips and forgot I was wearing
anything and I had a couple smudges
there so it's not going to be one of
those transfer-resistant like you know
stays on at all costs type of lip
product but I will say all of the shades
I have are so strongly pigmented that
it's very apparent that they are staying
on my lips for a good long period of
time and I think I can actually lose
some of the color and still keep a lot
of intensity and toward the end of the
video I'll do some kind of follow-ups
throughout the day and just show you how
this shade wears but I'm really excited
to talk about each of the shades that I
chose I think I made some really good
choices because I'm very happy with the
variety and just really pleased with the
way the colors went on so I'm going to
start with orange danger and this shade
really looks like a true orange in the
tube and as I put it on you know I do
see a lot of red in
shade which i think helps deepen it up
just a little bit makes it in my eyes
very wearable I really love this kind of
shade this time of year and the
intensity is just so satisfying it looks
like a matte finish but the real texture
the feel on my lips is like a cream best
of both worlds absolutely next up the
one you've been seeing on my lips
throughout the video is violet vixen so
I don't have a lot of purple lipsticks
but you know I have busted them out on
occasion and I've gotten good feedback
from you guys you know if it's on
snapchat or Instagram or whatever but
this is a really fun shade and it's just
straight-up purple I think you know my
one tip maybe for pulling off a shade
like this I always like the way a bright
or unusual lip color looks on me when my
hair is more simple when my eye look
doesn't really add any color to the
equation either everything is very clean
and then you've got that fun pop of
color that in my eyes is the best way to
try to pull off a really bright shade if
you're not so comfortable with it I
don't like to lay out makeup rules do
whatever you absolutely like the look of
and maybe you're fully comfortable with
a super rainbow eye and a crazy look for
me the most realistic way I would wear
this is how you're seeing it on me today
and I love the tone of purple I think
it's beautiful I'm just really glad I
went ahead and went with that one then I
went even more out of my comfort zone
with color selection and I went for the
sapphire siren shade it's a blue it's a
full-on freakin royal blue I'm not
thinking there's a lot of occasions
where I'm going to wear this but I could
certainly use your support you would
like to see me in this shade more often
and want to peer pressure me into
wearing something like this more it
certainly could be swayed to do so
because I think it's gorgeous if you are
wanting a true beautiful blue lipstick
that feels great on the lips has a matte
finish this would be the drugstore line
to look into I think the last two shades
that I chose are more of like what you
might expect to see lipstick wise in the
drugstore or in any product line and so
I got the shade called mob it or move it
I just can't make myself say nope I'm
but and this is what the color looks
like a really kind of deep dusty pink
shade adore this color it really makes
me think full but I would totally wear
it this time of year too I see this as
being a really popular shade in this
line because I know a lot of people are
digging that more muted take on pink
I find this shade to be a little bit
unique because it's quite a bit deeper
than a lot of the mauve type shades that
I have and this was the shade that I was
kind of wearing throughout the day
yesterday really trying to get a feel
for the way it would wear and I mean I
got say these shades are so so pigmented
some can wear off here and there and
you're still going to have a lot of
color left behind and then I went for a
deep red in this line I got the shade
called smoking red a really nice vampy
rich red I also love pairing a really
dark lipstick kind of like I said with
the brights I like pairing it with a
very simple hairdo and I look that's
maybe got some lashes or a little drama
going on but nothing too colorful and
then boom you're really bold rich deep
lip color I mean every bit as satisfying
as applying the brighter shades this
goes on with a completely full color the
only reason why I took any extra swipes
on my lips was just kind of neaten up
the lip line and you could certainly
apply these with a lip brush if you
wanted maybe a little bit more
controlled application but I do like the
fact that they have the pointed bullet
because you really can get right in
there in your Cupid's bow area and get
the product exactly where you want it
all right so I've just had lunch it was
a pretty big chicken sandwich wasn't it
yes it was so it's a little bit messy
but the lip product really has kind of
faded into this berry type shade which I
don't really mind it hasn't gotten too
sloppy and yeah it's been on for a
little over five hours now so I think
all things considered we're doing well
one thing though that I can definitely
see is that exactly there is a lot more
color I'm hanging around on the top lip
compared to the bottom lip and and it's
not like in real life I probably would
go ahead and touch
it up but I'm just kind of giving you a
sense of the where with no touch-ups
what do you think Oh kisses hmm all
righty eight hours of wear no touch-ups
not the greatest look happening at this
point you can see a color that's really
worn off on the inner part of both the
top and bottom lip lock color remaining
on the outside so definitely a lip
product I think you're going to want to
touch up at least by midday but just in
terms of the feel of my lips wearing
this all day my lips don't feel overly
dry it's definitely a different kind of
feel going throughout the day than if it
were a totally matte lipstick which a
lot of matte formulas right out of the
gate feel dry and they just get drier
this is not a product that seemed to
have any big staying power claims anyway
but I just wanted you to see how the
intensity wore on as the day went on so
just scrolling through some of the
selection here on ulties website they've
got a shade called pitch black they've
got nudes and kind of brownish colors
they've got some hot pinks they even
have a shade here that looks like it's
called wickedly white so a huge huge
variety in this line really excited
about the color range really really
happy also with the formula I think
those of you who are completely turned
off by the feel of matte lipstick but
you still kind of like the way that
finish looks definitely look into these
because they feel like a cream but with
the overall finish of a matte I know
this is coming off like rave rave rave
review but that's just my true personal
opinion it's not sponsored I'm not tied
to Maybelline in any way I don't do
sponsored videos so this is just my true
honest opinion I would say when you see
these in stores definitely give them a
good look maybe get out of your comfort
zone like I did and try a shade or two
that are a little bit different but even
if you go for a shade like the mauve or
the deep red or whatever is your normal
I think you'll be really satisfied and
pleased with the formula so thank you
for watching guys I'd love to hear your
shade recommendations if you've gotten
your hands on any of these yet and I
will see you soon in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
