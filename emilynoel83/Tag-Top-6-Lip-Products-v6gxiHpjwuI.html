top 6 favorite lip products it is a tag
video and I just kind of it's one of
those things that I just saw and I
couldn't resist and realizing more and
more like this is all like after I've
done videos like your top must have what
evers that I've made in the past those
really boil down to being current
favorites because looking back you know
there are some you know though I think
I'm always going to have the a high
opinion of those products but over time
you discover new things there's always
new makeup products coming out out there
and then you realize oh well I really
like this too and it was really hard to
boil this down to just six as well
because I think there's really a lot
more products that I do like so um you
know this list goes on and on basically
but add to pick six right now that I
think our current favorites um I went
ahead and did that and I want to share
those with you today and they are in no
particular order but the first one is a
balm and I just really like this because
i think there's hardly anything that
smells better than this and by the way i
am wearing my robe because it's cold
it's cold in my apartment right now but
this is raspberry lemonade blast from
blistex and this is a lip balm oh it
smells so good it smells like exactly
what the description is you know don't
you love that one it actually turns out
to smell just like what you're hoping
for and the it not only has the scent
but it has the flavor too and it's
blistex it has an SPF 15 so now it's a
really good time you're hearing this and
you wanted a good lip balm for the
winter time this would be a really good
one and especially if you're into like
the free sense and flavors and as you
can see it's just white you know but
it's just a really good good lip balm
it's really good too if you just wanted
something to put on before your lip
liner to make your lip liner going more
smoothly well before your lipstick to or
even before your lip gloss so um
I just think this is this is a highly
recommended product in my opinion so
that that's what I want to talk about
another one is another sort of bone /
lip gloss and it's the l'oreal hit jelly
balls i have these in two flavors i
think this is plush and then i have
succulent too i think that's what it's
called but these have the nicest set
that's like cotton candy a lot of people
that are in the know with Mac would
compare these two tender tone lip gloss
and they do have a subtle pad tint of
the color that you're seeing there like
this would be a light pink shade doing
the nicest little packaging this is like
a little glass container that it's in
and it's just I just like them a lot I
think they are they have a great feel on
your lips it's not like a sticky gloss
it's instead like a bone / you know a
nice little amount of shine handsome
color so it's like the best you could
create out of a poem and I know some
people say it I guess after one of my
question of the day surveys people were
like um I don't really like lip gloss in
the pots in fact one person said it was
their favorite form of lip gloss but
keep in mind guys if you don't like
using your finger you can use a lip
brush in this stuff so that you know if
you're anti finger on your lip then you
can use that too so just a hint and I'm
going to try to get the cap on where it
is um ok next one is a lip liner I kind
of wanted to include a variety in here
this liner is from Rimmel it is the
exaggerated lip liner I think I've
probably talked about these several
products and other videos too so maybe
they are proving to be an all-time
favorite so this is number 57 and ravish
and it's Jessie it was from rental yes
it is and this is like for news this is
like my daily lip liner
it's a nice reddish shade it's not like
too dark it looks good with red tone
lipstick which I tend to wear a lot
sometimes like a more of a brick red or
a deeper red that I wear but either way
this works i find myself even wearing
this under like more maybe a coppery
tone or a brownish tone it just gives
some nice life to your lips and it
doesn't lead outside your lip line it
lasts a long time it easily goes in like
all the way inside your lips so you know
you don't want like just to have the
line around your lips and then
everything else works off and you can
only see the line we've all been there
done that so this is has enough moisture
in it to where it can easily line inside
your lips and it is exaggerated full
color lip liner from Rimmel in number 57
ravish I would really recommend that and
hey we are three for three on drug store
items here so that's awesome but I don't
know what you guys consider Mary Kay to
beating like specialty store item but
that's my next product here it is Mary
Kay lipstick and as you can see I don't
have a whole lot left but I think maybe
you're going to be getting that's a
pretty good idea of what color this is
the color is amber suede let me do like
a swatch if I can on my hand there the
color is like a brownish red sorta the
kind of deep this was like the color
that I wore my my wedding day it's just
like it's got red in it and it comes off
like you can make it come off more sheer
and it's just like a natural red it's
like if you like the look of red
lipstick but you don't always want that
punch of like red like my fingernails
red is this is just so wearable from day
to day it looks so good on a medium
complexion i think i could see this
looking good on dark tones skin too now
my question is I don't know if this is
still available I from Mary Kay
is managed to last me a long time
another good thing about this is that
last for long but if you are a Mary Kay
guru out there maybe you could tell me
and others because if people see this in
like this they may want to purchase it
but I don't want to sear people down a
path of a discontinued product but it's
amber suede still available and if it's
not is there a another lipstick shade
that is comparable to amber suede is
there another suggested shade that
you're telling people hey if you like
that you can still get this i know Mary
Kay makeup kind of change their
packaging up a little bit but that's
what it looks like and yeah another
here's a little kid but for you that you
may not have known about me I actually
sold Mary Kay makeup before when Tyler
and I moved down here and before I got
my job in the news I wanted something
that I could do while he was starting
out law school as I was doing the TV
news job search thing and that was where
I actually started doing I had a family
member that helped me do it and I had a
couple struggles with it first off like
the number one reason why I couldn't do
any more ways because I did get the full
time news job and I just did not have
time to carry that out and do it to its
fullest not I couldn't do it justice to
really do that and give it my all um but
secondly I I was still being makeup guru
then that I am now and I love a lot of
different brands and it is very hard to
promote one brand when there are so many
things you like although I love a lot of
stuff in Mary Kay I think it's very high
quality i really like it a lot but i
like i said i don't know if this still
is if this particular amber suede
lipstick is still in existence so you
guys are always good about let me know
if i have a question so thank you in
advance my next lipstick item and by the
way so far is with the exception of the
hip lip balm this can be warned you this
is like step one call on your
exaggerated lip liner put on your amber
suede lipstick this stuff all works
together and
and put on your super lustrous lip gloss
I love this shade and I really hate to
do this because i know this is
discontinued its get ready it was
available at Big Lots a while back and
it's the most gorgeous red lip gloss
ever if i could find this I mean and
just you have this forever that would be
great because this is the excuse me this
is the best red lip gloss ever and I the
reason why i thought well i'm still
going to mention it is because i like a
lot of the revlon super lustrous lip
glosses so you know just because this
one particular one may not be available
and it works great with those other
products i just mentioned there are lots
of other colors nude shades bronzy
shades other ones that are great and
then last but not least on nyx goddess
of the night lip gloss i love this lip
gloss brand in general but chestnut
that's the color that i'm wearing on my
lips right now it's just a nice nude
shade it's kind of like a pearly your
rope that's really accurate as to what
the color is what you're seeing right
there but i love it i love all these
products these six products so I thanks
to whoever actually originated this tag
video because I think it's a great idea
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
