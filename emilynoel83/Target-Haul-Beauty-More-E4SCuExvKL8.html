Target which we all know you can kind of
go into target for like one or two
things and then you come out and you're
like where did all this stuff come from
but I had tweeted or actually I posted a
little video on this new website called
tout and I don't know how many of you
are on it there are a lot of celebrities
on there actually and I just started
posting my co-anchor told me about this
and it's like you post little like
15-second video updates it's like a
tweet only in video and you can connect
it to your Twitter or your facebook so
it shows up there but I had posted the
other day that I was heading to Target
and a lot of people said do a haul on
what you got and I really didn't get a
ton of makeup stuff there's some makeup
related but I'm gonna show just some
random things - I gots a couple of cute
accessory type items I got this little
bracelet this was on sale for two
dollars and 80 cents and it kind of
looks like it has wooden beads and black
and like some little gold beads and I
just thought that was cute and it seemed
like with the brown and the little gold
pieces and the black eye Baker if you
want to get up oh now she's gone I
thought just with the different things
that had on there cute kind of layered
with maybe some other bracelets but it
is stretchy and I just thought that was
cute and for $4.99 I got this one is
like a pink sort of it's got like little
pink maybe like faux quartz lookin it's
there I don't know if I'm right I'm
better looking for something that
incorporated light pink and so I thought
that was cute and then these are just
kind of a classic gold sort of dangly
earring I don't have a ton of gold in my
jewelry wardrobe and that just really
caught my eyes so I look forward to
where it's so kind of in the accessories
department I got a new wallet and this
was another sale by I've got my receipt
here so I can tell you this was on sale
for 648 and I think it was originally
like twelve or fifteen but I got a new
purse recently which I think I may have
had in my last haul and so I kind of
wanted a new wallet type thing and I
just thought this is cute I like the
reptile I like the
sort of fuchsia print and then it is
blue on the inside got you know kind of
a slot for money and then a place for
all your cards so it's just it's pretty
basic but I thought it was just cute
makeup area I was actually looking for a
new kind of brush cleanser and so in the
Sonia Kashuk line she has a brush and
sponge cleanser had been using Mac brush
cleanser when I do my brushes like at
the sink like deep cleaning them and I
was kind of running low on that I didn't
really want to repurchase it again and I
thought if I can find something else
that's good you know that I can spend
less on that be great and I know Sonia
Kashuk has great brushes so I thought
I'd give this a try I've washed a whole
bunch of my brushes the other day and
the way I do it is I just spritz this on
the brush you know if it's a large brush
maybe a couple two three sprays and then
just kind of move the brush around in
the palm of my hand and then take it
under the sink and really get it rinsed
out if that was on the brushes just kind
of like really came out well it came out
quickly I mean I felt like this got the
brushes clean as well if not better than
the Matt kind I mean I don't think this
one which I use a lot of like
long-wearing foundations with has looked
white like this again until I've used
this the way the Mac one comes out it
comes out almost like little drops and I
find that I was getting too much at
times and I felt like I was wasting it
but with this you know you can spray it
it's coming out in a fine mist you're
only getting what you need right on the
brush and then rinse it off it rinses
really clean really quickly to get five
point one fluid ounces with this very
happy with that also got a little brush
that just caught my eye and this is
called the small eyeshadow brush there's
a nice nice size I like smaller brushes
for you know doing stuff on your lid or
you just have a little more control
that's one of the number one things that
I bring up to people when they say you
know my eye makeup always looks sloppy
I'm using brushes what am I doing wrong
and I say sometimes maybe the brush is
too big for your eye and you know it's
getting your overlapping products that
you don't want to be overlapping maybe
or is just you know going everywhere and
like a small little eyeshadow brush is
good small little good you can just like
Pat it all over your lid you can get it
up into the crease if you want but
that's a good size and I just wanted to
mention a couple other Sonia brushes
that I have that I really like I have
the larger one as well so you can see
how those compare size-wise so this is a
little bit more like an average flat
eyeshadow brush so that one's good and I
also love the smudger this one is quite
small as you can see and this is what I
like to use a lot of times when I'm
putting any kind of product powder
product under my eye and I want it a
little bit smudgy I don't want it to be
a distinct line that works super well
also I saw makeup by Tiffany D talking
about something in her favourites video
that kind of caused my ears to perk up
when I heard her talk about this
drugstore mascara she compared to a
high-end version that she loves and it's
the voluminous full definition as many
times as I've tried voluminous carbon
black I'd never tried this kind brush
looks really similar I'm guessing
there's just maybe a little more a
little a little bit more of an arrow
stopper that it's coming out of maybe to
pull off more product I'm not sure but
anyway Tiffany has naturally like
amazing lashes and I don't so I was like
well if it works for her maybe it won't
have quite the same effect on me and I
do like it I won't say I'm in love with
this mascara yet sometimes it takes me a
while to figure it out I've only used it
a couple of times so far so good I guess
I'd give it just kind of a good rating
at this point but it did kind of
lengthen it didn't hold the curl real
well price on that - I think it was
right around five dollars I'm looking
for a little organizer for the bathroom
and I don't like always you know sitting
a bag out like I had that unsightly
little bag full of the cotton pads just
laying out there I'm like wouldn't it be
nice to have it all contained so I found
this little thing at Target I'm not
really proud of the deal I got on this
because I don't know that it's worth ten
dollars but this was the cutest I guess
little storage container that I found
and I didn't find it near the make found
it back in like just with the other
organization like little mini storage
bins and stuff like that it was in that
area but I've got cotton pads in there
I've got q-tips and Tyler always needs
his little floss or pick thingies at all
times so I thought there we go
putting it all like that and this is out
on our bathroom counter I'm kind of
obsessed with like hair conditioning
treatments and stuff and so I got this
Tresemme nourishing rituals I haven't
seen anything from this line anywhere
else before but this is called the
liquid gold shine therapy silk ins hair
for multi-dimensional shimmery shine and
so what it looks like is just kind of a
creamy sort of like I don't know
off-white color cream there and you
actually use this in the shower you
shampoo your hair and then you pick some
of this and then on like the length of
your hair like from midway down to the
ends you put this on and you leave it on
for I think I said three to five yeah
three to five minutes and then you rinse
it all out and your hair supposed to be
a lot shinier I was trying so hard
because I used it not my last shower but
the one before and I was like trying to
get a look at my hair out in the Sun and
just see you know okay what did this
really do and I'm not totally sure yet I
mean my hair definitely feels nice and
soft but it did with my other
conditioner too so I'm gonna have to use
this some more to let you know what I
think but that was definitely a new new
line of products that I saw there from
Tresemme you had to get some new contact
fluid I used this bio troop stuff
it says inspired by the biology of your
eyes so it's got to be good right and
last but not least I am trying to drink
more water always and I I always feel
like I check out the you know the water
bottles and stuff like that in the
stores and they always seem like way too
expensive for what they are it's like I
don't want to pay 25 bucks for a water
thing by rubbermaid and this is a 20
ounce
I think it's they said it's BPA free a
little water thingy and it's got
something here so you can like you know
where it is a necklace no I'm you also
have the nice little thing there you can
stick a straw down in there
don't want to get your lipstick all over
it but it's nice to have it's easy to
take - this was less than six dollars it
was 579 I think so
plus it's pink it looks great in this
room thanks a lot for watching don't
forget to find me on tout fun new video
web stuff you follow me there you'll
probably see me before my next video but
if not I will see you back on here on
beauty broadcast next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
