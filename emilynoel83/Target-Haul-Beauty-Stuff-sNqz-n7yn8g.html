with you I had tweeted over the weekend
or on Friday that I ran into some really
good beauty deals there so I'll share
the makeup stuff there was some random
stuff as well I got like some leggings
and some plastic spoons a couple of cute
baby things as well which we shared and
talked about in our 16 week vlog which
should be have already gone up at the
time of posting this video by the way we
know if it's a boy or a girl now so that
was my last video on here so if you want
to check that out I won't spoil it for
you is the beauty related stuff I was so
excited you guys to find this after I
saw somebody pinned this on Pinterest
this particular kind of dove body wash
it's the purely pampering pistachio
cream with Magnolia how good does that
sound first stuff smells so good it's
like a really mild scent though and very
unique you know I I definitely sense the
pistachio and that little bit of floral
but it's so different from like any body
wash I have at least like give it a
whiff when you're going down the aisles
whether or not you decide to buy this I
really like the texture of these dove
body washes they're a little bit thicker
I feel like they don't really strip your
skin as much of its moisture as this
once in the shower so far I loved it
Tyler's used it too and he's like yeah I
got to admit that's pretty good stuff so
I repurchased for like the third or
fourth time my covergirl clump crusher
mascara I meant to get the water
resistant that what I didn't I just got
the regular I really like using the
water resistant on my lower lash line
although pretty much any LashBlast
version that I've tried has been good
about not flaking down below my eyes so
this would probably be fine as well I'll
definitely use it just a good separating
mascara it doesn't overload the lashes
so got another one of those also I
always like to keep tabs on the up and
up which is targets store brand makeup
brushes because I've definitely run into
some really good ones a couple of great
eye brushes they've got a nice crease
brush and a smudge brush and then I
this one which is described as a
foundation brush on the little packet
here but it's like um the best way to
describe this is that it's the middle
child between Sigma's and f-86 and P 86
those kind of you know pointed type
synthetic brushes even though the says
foundation brush just the size of it
made me think concealer and today I used
it for the first time just under eye
area a little bit of like creamy
highlighter stuff as well and it worked
really nicely it's just very nicely
shaped really dense very soft as well
the oven up brushes at Target definitely
a nice little diamond in the rough
drugstore brush a brand if you're
looking for some affordable ones and a
lot of them were marked down this one
wasn't I think it was only like three
bucks two or three bucks anyway now for
my really good deals that I found and
these are from pixie if you're not
familiar it's one of the higher price
makeup brands that target carry I have
found some really good things from this
line the correction concentrate and
brightening peach is a great under eye
corrector really helps cancel out like
the bluish under eye circles I've got a
palette that I think I actually bought
when it was on HauteLook
and it seems to have been on there
multiple times since but it's called the
soft focus fresh palette I blogged about
it it's a gorgeous Pat when it's on
HauteLook it gets marked down to like
eight or nine bucks or something it's
worth around thirty I just are some
really nice quality products in the line
and on beauty broadcast live this past
Thursday several people said that they
noticed pixie Mart down in their stores
one person said like the whole line was
marked down in their store in my local
Target it was just select products but
there was still quite a bit I would say
it was like eye shadow quads eyeshadows
singles some different palettes here and
there the Foundation's blushes maybe
more things that I didn't spot but it
was a good amount of stuff marked down
not sure if that's happening in every
target but if you're already there and
you're in the makeup area give it a look
one thing that I definitely wanted to
try because one of my viewers had raved
about this
this is the flawless beauty fluid
foundation is originally 30 bucks and it
was marked down to nine and the thing
about it was that they're only like
three shade options and I ended up with
the lightest one which is called cream
really nice packaging kind of a frosted
glass jar with a bump yay no like just
judging by what I saw there I was
somewhere between this shade and the
second shade or the second darker color
I'm wearing this today mixed in with a
little bit of another deeper liquid
foundation but it says oil-free matte
finish long wearing real skin look water
based fluid feels lightweight conceals
imperfections and on and on and on I
would say this is a medium coverage
foundation does feel really lightweight
on the skin and it definitely does have
a matte finish I've got some glow
happening on my face from some other
products this is definitely a matte
foundation it had really good staying
power the first time when I just use
this on its own and today I mixed it
with a little bit of Estee Lauder Double
Wear and it blended in really great and
I liked the finish a lot so I'll keep
you posted on that I got this all-over
bronzer and blush trio this was
originally $28 down to 840 so exciting
and the shade is called bronze bloom
trio number one bronzer so it's a cute
little face disc like this don't you
love the light green packaging by the
way this mint green really big mirror
and then you've got like a bronzer and
two blushed shades in there's bronzer
it's like a very light cool bronzer with
a little bit of a satiny finish so not
incredibly shimmery but more glowy than
your average matte bronzer of course but
it has just that kind of cool tone to it
so I contoured with my Milani bronzer XL
today and then I use just a little bit
of this lightly all over the face but as
my blush and what's giving me a lot of
this glow on my cheeks is this pretty
pink color which i think is just
beautiful and these are really really
soft textures on these but as you can
see it's it's highly glow in this peach
shade
right here it's a very soft peach
doesn't show up with a lot of color on
my cheeks it's a nice quality blush I
mean it feels nice to the touch it just
doesn't show up very bold on my face I
haven't been using this for long to give
like tons of opinions on it but I do
like little combination palettes like
this and if you like a little more glow
to your bronzers or blushes you might
really enjoy my favorite part about it
is probably the glowy pink blush but
I'll continue using this as we get into
spring and summer it really gives a nice
finish on the skin next I got the eye
glow cube this is originally $28 marked
down to 840 so yeah $20 off now is the
time because I've been eyeing this
during quite a few Target visit I just
kind of thought am not sure about it I
don't know if I want to go there
but I went there this time and I am glad
I did this probably like my favorite
thing that I picked up and I was really
excited about it because I knew that
pixie had good quality shadows because
in the soft focus fresh palette I really
liked what I had there and these though
seemed you know a little bit different
you know they're not your typical flat
shadows see how they're shaped a little
differently so I didn't know if the
formula might be different is you've got
16 shadows here if you love bronze and
taupe oMG the first shade that I went
toward for this palette was this
gorgeous taupe right here I mean it's so
so pigmented these shadows feel really
creamy to the touch I think you're going
to be so satisfied with the textures
today I'm wearing this shade which looks
creamy but it's actually like a light
gold I'm wearing that with this pretty
like cross between periwinkle and lilac
on my eyes for something a little bit
lighter more springy love the look these
blend out very easily but what's also
interesting is that underneath it they
refer to these on the packaging as what
they column I base powders and I think
they're just great little blending
shades you know this one's got more of a
pearl finish this one is matte so the
only matte thing going on in this
palette is this and
it's kind of a soft peachy color I put
that around the border of where my
purple is it's kind of acting as a
really soft highlight but gave a nice
finished border to my deeper color there
so I'm glad these colors are in there I
know some people will probably be
completely turned off but there's no
mattes up in here I won't say everything
looks SuperDuper metallic as far as
these shades go but some really do the
texture is really nice and like I said
if you're into the bronzes and topes I
think this would really be your kind of
palette it also came with a couple of
applicators I was having trouble
shutting this door with the applicators
in there so I took them out and then the
last pixie thing that I got and this one
I've yet to try but it was originally
$22 see this stuff ain't cheap normally
and it's down to six dollars and sixty
cents it says seasonal reflection kit
face palette and this is in warm wonder
can see some pretty bronzy colors roses
greens and there's a soft peachy blush
in the middle I have not used this yet
but judging by the swatches these seem
like the same texture of the eyeshadows
and the other palette I was mentioning
they're just not like kind of domed up
and shaped that way but they really feel
very much the same but again you're
getting kind of like shimmers and satin
finishes in there so be aware of that
some pretty good bargains if I do say so
myself and your target might have more
things marked down or less but there's
definitely some bargains to be had there
so check them out and one other thing
that I got and this was clearance but
kind of in one of those clearance
baskets at the end of an aisle I just
laid my eyes on these aisle or natural
lights lengthening they were originally
$7.99 down to 398 and these are a nice
natural lash style you can see they're
not super thick but they are kind of
long so I popped those on today to give
you a look at how they come off but I
really like this line of false lashes
I'll or makes some great ones tell you
the truth I've been a little miffed with
our Dells lashes lately I feel like
anything I've bought recently from
ardell the band seems flimsier
harder to control and they don't keep
their shape as well like it's harder for
me to get tons of uses out of them like
I feel like I used to they're not a huge
hull but I just wanted to share real
quick some of those deals that I came up
with and I do have a new tutorial coming
I've had a request for an all drugstore
prom look which I'm very excited to put
together for you so keep an eye out for
that and I'll talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
