super fun video why because I am
combining a review a tutorial and
basically it's all centering around a
really awesome product that i got from
QVC this is all from Tarte and this is
called the 8th world wonder best of the
Amazon 7 piece collection plus this cute
little clutch here so I'm going to be
going through all these products
applying them giving you my thoughts on
when sorting out which parts of the set
i like best in which i think maybe we're
mrs. and just kind of tell you what I
think also while we're kind of covering
new business here I want to tell you
about a giveaway that's coming up on my
friend Abby's channel her channel as
color swept beauty and she is doing a
big springtime giveaway she's got three
big prizes and it's going to cover
everything from some high-end brands to
drugstore brands there's gonna really be
something for everybody there she has
great ideas for videos great tutorials
reviews things like that so if you want
to check out her Channel and subscribe
that would be awesome and definitely
consider entering this contest because
she was just talking to me we're talking
back and forth about some of the things
she was including in it and I'm like man
this is I mean she's going to have lush
stuff in there high-end stuff from
Smashbox and benefit and a bunch of
drugstore brands like elf wet'n'wild
Rimmel so maybe if you haven't you know
had the opportunity to try some of these
brands you might want to check out her
channel and get in on that giveaway so
always want to give you the heads up on
something that I think is a really good
deal and back to this kit that I'm going
to be talking about today a lot of
people had asked in my um video it was
good too long good to the last swipe
makeup what products was I wearing on my
eyes well I was wearing the you know
little eye shadow palette from this tart
kit on my eyes there it's kind of a
natural palette and right now I'm going
to just run you through real briefly
what all is included in there stop it
all does come in this really super cute
little um you know makeup bag or I
really would consider this an awesome
little clutch it has kind of like this
almost braided you know like basket
weave type I
via there so that's really cute and also
you thrown into this where is it sitting
here tart has this new thing called Mary
kuja L maracuja oil not quite sure but
you get a little sample of that they
didn't even mention this on QVC that
this is going to be part of this but
that's a decent amount of the product
there and this is something you can like
smooth on your skin and your neck and
it's a very softening very moisturizing
feel I'll keep you posted on like the
long-term effects that I notice from
this but I've used it just a few times
so far and it's super softening as for
the rest of the product which I have
placed in this cute little like parfait
dish here you are getting a full
coverage Amazonian clay full coverage
balancing foundation spf15 this Plus
this brush that is designed to you know
be used with that foundation we're
probably the main reason why I picked
this up because for the price I mean
getting this this would basically be
covered but you're getting a lot of
other things too but I was super excited
about that so I just kind of that was
like the tipping point I wasn't going to
buy it wasn't going to buy it and I'm
like okay I really want to try that
foundation out and then it comes with a
blush which is the Amazonian clay long
wear blush which is this get into that
more in a moment you're also getting an
eyeshadow set a quad which comes in
adorable packaging all shades are
shimmery i'll show you how i applied
these but as you can see judging from
these colors you can apply this in a
neutral way or you can work in a little
bit of the purples like I did today
you're also getting a full-size lights
camera lashes mascara getting an
eyeliner which is the Amazonian clay
waterproof eyeliner this is kind of like
a burgundy golden purpley shade and
you're getting a full-size lipgloss so
part of what i love about what QVC does
with these like today's special value
items is they're giving you full size
stuff and you're getting a really great
deal so i will walk you through
everything and how I put it on I mean
I've moisturised I've applied a primer
and now i'm going to use this Tarte
Amazonian clay full coverage balancing
Foundation it has
PF 15 cute cute packaging there and tart
is known for being a very pure natural
makeup line so this is without mineral
oil phthalates sodium lauryl sulfate
synthetic dye and synthetic friend go
ahead and kind of squirt some out here
on my hand and the shade I have what is
the shade I have medium so I'm going to
take this brush that also came with the
kit which was something that I was
really interested in really intrigued by
the size of this brush and the fact that
this is what's used it's designed to be
used with this foundation so I'll kind
of tap on some of the foundation there
on the brush and then kind of dot it on
my face and then sort of blend it in in
a circular type motion I love how this
foundation I mean the shade works really
well for my skin because it's like it's
got it's slightly brightening if you
look at this side of my face in my chin
which is all I've done so far I mean I
just feel like it is that when they say
full coverage you know I expect a
certain thing when I think full coverage
and I mean it's taking little spots
little freckles and stuff on my face and
it's really functioning to UM provide
coverage for that so you don't see it
anymore you see flawless skin and that
was something that was very evident
during the QVC presentation because I
saw a girl with you know basically half
of her face undone with this and then
she put it on and I was like okay
there's something to this I feel like it
leaves sort of this flawless even tone
without giving you that dewy look so if
you fight oil this might actually be a
really good foundation to try big brush
is super soft the only downfall might be
as you try to get it around your eye
area I mean that's a really big brush to
try to fit right in there so i might go
in with my fingers a little bit more I
don't feel that intense need to you know
set it with powder so basically all I
did I applied a little bit of concealer
just to brighten my eye area a little
bit kind of around
inner corner and I dusted a little bit
of my too faced chocolate soleil bronzer
all over and I just kind of used that as
a powder step but I didn't really feel
the need for any kind of powder over the
top of this really happy with the finish
and it covers better I mean when they
say full coverage I feel like that's
truly what you get so very happy with
that and the next step would be a blush
and the blush that comes with this kit
is called glisten and it's an Amazonian
clay long wear blush again this whole
set is infused with that Amazonian clay
products so this is what it looks like
you get a nice big mirror here on the
brush or on the blush and then as you
can see the product is a gorgeous pink
with kind of a golden actually is
giving off a decent amount of color and
frankly with the mattifying effect of
that foundation you may want a little
bit of glow now on your cheeks so I'm
really liking the way this goes on I do
think the staying power is good I've
worn this before and it is it's pretty I
mean if you want a little extra glow all
over your face i'm using the laura
geller technique here because she likes
to go around the temple a little bit and
onto the cheek but it's really pretty
and I can see this is being flattering
on a lot of skin tones too so it's time
for eyes now I applied a primer to my
lid and then we're going to take this
adorable little eye palette I love the
kind of wood finish on some of the stuff
and it has a little magnet that actually
holds it down there so it's not just
going to fly open on you nice large
mirror and the names of each shade
believe this is shimmering sand
shimmering Coco shimmering plum and
shimmering bronze so obviously all have
shimmer in them so if you are an anti
shimmer I person be aware there is
shimmer in this so I'm just going to
start off and take that lightest shade
shimmering sand in this quad and I'm
going to apply that around my inner
corner I just like to have little added
brightness right there so um and you'll
recall if you're curious about like
other shades that tart offers an eye
shadow I did that big review on the
jewelry box kit which had a ton of
full-size eye shadows in it so I did a
lot of swatches there
if you want to know how like matte
shades like half the half of the thing
was matte eyeshadows and the other half
was shimmer so if you're curious check
that out but this is definitely a
shimmery look here so I applied the
lightest shade right there then that my
probably my favorite shade in this kit
is this gorgeous shimmery bronze because
it's kind of like a light to medium
brown with a golden undertone it's such
a pretty all-purpose like if you only
wanted to wear one shadow in this kit
this is really pretty so I'm kind of
overlapping a little bit padding that in
on mailing the outer part of the lid
then with a larger brush taking a little
bit more of the shimmering bronze and
just kind of running that up into the
crease all these shades you know there's
nothing super dark or super smoky in it
so you're gonna find that these are
fairly well suited for the lighter i
looks you might be after for spring and
summer and that kind of thing great for
everyday you don't have to use all the
colors all at once but I'm just kind of
trying to give you my best demonstration
here so I really blended that shade
really buff that bronze shade out all
the way up here are actually that
shimmering cocoa I think I've been
calling it the wrong thing this is
shimmering cocoa that's probably my
favorite shade under that is shimmering
bronze and that one has a real golden
tone and I put some of that on my larger
brush I'm going to like kind of blend
that out up here as well just really
diffuse it and then maybe I'll take some
of the lighter shade this is why I love
palettes because I'm always like
layering and mixing and messing with it
but so I kind of went light and then
blended it up with the other and then
maybe just for fun we take this purple
color and to get a little color worked
into this maybe I'll take that a little
bit over the outer outer part here so
we'll come back to shadow in a minute
but first we're going to work in some
liner and this is the Amazonian clay
waterproof eyeliner so this is a really
long wearing liner and it really is the
color that it appears here in the
package this is actually a
exclusive to QVC it's Golden plum and so
this is different from most liner shades
I would use it's um it kind of has a
burgundy look to it so it glides on
super easily so I'm just going to kind
of start on my upper lash line here and
it has kind of a metallic feel too now
I'm applying it on the lower lash line
as well and I'm just kind of dotting it
in between my lashes you can see on this
I I've got a little bit of a smudged
outlook going on so I'm just getting it
right in there and then I'm going to
line my waterline with this shade this
liner is really long wearing so if you
want to go in and smudge it you kind of
have to smudge it soon after you put it
on because right now it's barely wanting
to smudge for me um what I put on the
lower lash line I'm going to go back to
the purple with a pencil brush and just
kind of go over the top of that and it
provides kind of just this smokey kind
of purply burgundy look next I'm going
to curl my eyelashes now this kit comes
with a full-sized lights camera lashes
mascara however shortly before i got
this kit I got the mini size lights
camera lashes and so just for the
purpose of not having to open up that
new one yet i'm going to keep using up
the small one that i have but the brush
and size and all that are still the same
so this is a look at the time to brush
you get it's a traditional brush and
it's typically the kind that I tend to
like a lot because the bristles are
somewhat short and really thick and
dense on not a naturally thick lashed
girl so I'm just kind of working this
through there you can see it's not it's
not very clumpy and but it is giving me
thickness that I don't normally have I'm
also going to apply this on the lower
lash line I have done this multiple
times before and have not had issues
with it smudging on mander there in the
final product and this kit is this tart
pure optic lip gloss and the shade is
golden pink I've never tried one of the
tart lip glosses before
it's definitely similar to a Stila lip
gloss or like the lip glosses Malley
makes that have this sort of built-in
brush thing going on so I'm going to
twist up the product it has almost a
little bit of a minty scent to it yeah
little just a little bit it's not it's
not overboard at all it's almost a
little hard to identify pretty sheer as
you if you really look at this you could
probably tell that this is going to be
kind of a sheer gel type gloss and it
definitely has gold glitter in this that
I can see as I look up close that you
probably couldn't see it an average
distance away it feels smooth it has
maybe a slight bit of stickiness to it
but that's probably going to help
staying power wise but there's look
so bottom line how do I feel about this
product I feel like the value is
tremendous and there are some things in
the kid that I like better than others
one of the things that I was most
intrigued about and fortunately most
impressed about what this kit was the
Amazonian clay full coverage foundation
I love the delivery method with this
brush I think it just really blends in
well doesn't over blend if that makes
sense so I think it maintains that full
coverage look oftentimes I go on and on
and I feel like I'm Sid so many times
recently oh this this foundation would
be good if you have dry skin but this is
something that I think is really good
could be good for all skin types so
really really like the blush I think
this is a gorgeous shade again full size
really gorgeous color great to get that
glow on top of what I call a velvety
finish on that foundation love the tart
I shadows I like this particular
configuration here a lot of times I
would complain that there wasn't a
darker shade although I'm kind of liking
the little bit lighter look especially
as we change seasons here lights camera
lashes found a foundation lights camera
lashes mascara I think it's great for
thick and he's not going to feel hard
and rigid once you put it on and its
natural ingredients and all this stuff
too so keep that in mind the things that
I maybe wasn't so gung-ho about with
this I probably wouldn't have picked out
this particular shade of liner on my own
I would have probably reached for
something darker however I mean benefit
of a kit like this is that you can work
in your own stuff if you want to put in
put on liquid liner with this kit you
absolutely can this is nice to have in
my collection I like the formulation of
this liner although I would be
interested to try a darker shade like a
black brown or a black gloss I was a
little disappointed that this seems so
sheer it seemed basically like a clear
lip gloss with some sparkle in it so i
would have liked something that was more
pigmented more color in it because I
mean let's face it i don't really like
just putting on clear lip gloss i like
to have color in some way if its sheer
pink that's fine but this is basically
like clear so
I like the feel of it though and I think
it's going to be somewhat long wearing
maybe put it over like a lipstick or a
line I've ordered a decent amount of
things off of QVC lately and i must say
that there are a couple reasons why i
enjoy this and i am not being paid to
say this I have no affiliation with QVC
whatsoever i'm just a customer but i do
want to advise you of a couple things i
think watching the beauty programs i
mean you can get a demonstration on you
can watch these products go on someone's
face and well and like i was able to
watch this foundation go on and you know
what it went on me about the exact same
way I saw it go on the model that was
applying it on herself on the
demonstration so seeing the
demonstrations that's one reason why I
enjoy the products and also oftentimes
QVC is putting together big kits of
products they're usually full-size stuff
in those kits which is awesome and not
only that but they throw in a lot of
stuff for the price of maybe just a
couple products regular size so that's
what I'm trying to tell you is if you
regularly order from Sephora or you just
pick up products here and there if
you're really curious about a certain
line of makeup check and see like QVC
calm and see if they have a kit together
because usually it's full size and
usually it's a lot of products and you
so much for watching don't forget about
Abby's contest which I mentioned at the
start of this video have a wonderful day
and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
