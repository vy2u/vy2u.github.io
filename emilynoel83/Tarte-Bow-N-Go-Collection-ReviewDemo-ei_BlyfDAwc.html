demo using the Tarte TSV this is the
today's special value on QVC the Tarte
bow and go gift set and the cost on this
is 49 96 you can see three different
boxes it even came with the bow and
using this for a couple weeks now I'm
tarte sent this to me so I could try it
and review it for you but I have boxed
it all up so you can see the overall
presentation if you were wanting to give
it to somebody this way you've got three
separate boxes that of course you could
give to someone altogether or you could
just give them individually so in this
video we're going to go through what's
in each one of these boxes what I think
of the kid is a hole it's a little demos
you know trying stuff on along the way
box the smallest box this has four
full-sized lip surgence
lip colors in it medium sized box has
some eye products it has two full-sized
lights camera lashes mascaras and two
full-size smolder eyes pencils and the
bottom kit has the big palette this is a
palette of sixteen different eyeshadows
and also these boxes have inserts so if
you want to take the products out you
continue to have just a little box here
that could be used for anything the
packaging isn't really holiday specific
so it could become a little storage
option for you let's urgence is the lip
product in this kit and these are the
lip creams that's actually a new formula
that is exclusive to this kit and
they've got the lip tints the Luster's
the matte ones and so these are the lip
creams notice with the lip creams is
that they have like a slightly pearly
finish to them so they're not
straight-up creamy no shimmer just the
tiniest amount they are not quite as
shiny or as moisturizing feeling as the
lip tints but they are very full color
so the shades you're getting here the
lightest one is precious and that's
gonna be a light pink it's the least
intense shade and I don't find that it
hangs around as long on my lips as these
other ones you got wonder this is kind
of like a deeper pink tone again very
creamy just the slightest bit of a pearl
going on there
thoughtful is probably the most neutral
of the bunch I seen this is kind of like
a deep caramel e tone shade there's
maybe a hint of mauve in this color as
well I think it's really pretty but my
favorite as you might guess and I'm
wearing this now is the shade promise
and I think this is just like the
essential holiday color so not a classic
cherry red not an orange you read either
it's got a lot of berry tone in there so
if you like that kind of red you're
really gonna like this color there's not
a ton of shine as you can see but if you
get up really close you can see that
slightly pearly quality that these have
and they are really long-lasting like
even if I were to you know blot my lips
off onto a tissue not a ton of color
comes off and I've still got you know
really full color on my lip surgence is
definitely like my chosen lip product
from Tarte and some of my top lip
products as I'm really really pleased
that these were included in this kit and
they're all full-size and then you've
also got the smolder eyes these are in
the shades Brown which is a matte Brown
and then the shade fig which is kind of
like a dusty plum sort of color not
all-out purple you might even notice
that there's like a bit of a burgundy
type feel coming through this our shadow
sticks that do set to a completely budge
free stage Lee I think these are best
used as like a smudgy liner if you want
to put them on your lower lash line and
then bust out the little smudgy tip
that's on the opposite and I think they
work really well like that because
you're getting a softer liner look but
you're getting something that's really
really long wearing and won't drift
downward you know throughout the day you
want to put these all over your lids as
a base I think you can totally do that
I mean I did do that with this look I
actually used the more purpley shade
kind of on the inner part of the eye and
deepened it up a little bit on the
outside I think that the brown is dark
enough to where if you wanted to use it
as a really soft smudgy liner even on
your upper lash line you could get
enough definition with it and perhaps
you may feel that way about the fig.2 so
a couple of good options there in this
case give in to the big bucks because
just in the sequence of the way I
explained what I did with my look here
it'll make most sense if I go
the snacks there's a little sheet giving
you the shade names which I've taken out
and set aside but here's the palette
really skinny right not over packaged
one bit it's got 16 shadows in it no
mirror there I'm gonna be honest I don't
always feel like tarts eyes shadows
ranked among the best in my mind when I
think about high-end eyeshadows I just
feel like they've been in the past kind
of hit and miss I think I talked about
this with last year's holiday kit from
Tarte but sometimes the issue is the
configuration of the kit like not enough
balance in light and dark shades to give
you all the different looks you might
want sometimes the issue has been kind
of inconsistent pigmentation I've
thought with some of the matte shades or
some of the light shades yes however I
feel like they did a fabulous job with
the color selection in this the mix of
matte and shimmer there's a lot of matte
in this palette there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 matte shades out of this whole
button they're great basics you're
getting a lot of earth tones in this kit
and that's what you're gonna see in a
lot of tarts kits whereas maybe Urban
Decay Too Faced are gonna put out some
more vibrant colorful really sparkly
shiny type colors kits seem to go a
little more neutral more earth tone all
the shades are very wearable and these
are all full-size and they're all the
Amazonian clay formula I think there is
a fantastic balance in this kit of dark
medium and like I said basics shades
like this and like this and this that
are gonna be great for helping you blend
out your looks and helping your shadow
look really mesh in with your skin tone
you know and then highlight wise we're
not at a loss there either because
you've got things that work for that I
even use the peach as a highlight today
but you've got you know a shimmery
option and also a light matte option to
not just Brown you've got some greens to
work with you've got some plums burgundy
toy I've been trying a lot and I still
have more to review from them but from
what I've tried this is probably my
favorite eyeshadow palette of the
holiday season that they've put out and
plus you cannot beat this compact
packaging I mean that can slip in anyway
into a purse into a travel bag into
probably whatever your storage at home
might be a drawer of vanity you know
this is a great-sized real quickly the
way I use this for this kit after I did
the smolder eyes is sort of a base I
went all over my lid with the taupe
shade I just patted that on to build up
kind of that grayish smoky color then I
used the matte purple or the matte plum
and I patted that on the outer part of
my lid I blended that up into my crease
as well this is really really richly
pigmented yet it's very easy to blend
out so I use that up into my crease some
as well and also smudge that shade under
my eye to just soften the look a little
bit then I took this kind of shimmery
Burgundy I'm always intrigued by shapes
like this so I took my light wispy brush
and I just blended that it's kind of a
transition type color around the border
of the plum and then for my highlight I
brought out this peach this is a great
shade to make any look mesh more with
your skin tone if you're light to medium
skin it's gonna be awesome for that and
then I finished off the eyes with some
liner in my inner rim a black liner and
then a plum liner on my upper lash line
got two full-sized lights camera lashes
mascaras this is a mascara that I'm very
familiar with I've used it going back
years I think it's one of the best
mascaras that Tarte has the Amazonian
clay gifted mascara just kind of edged
this out a little bit for me I just feel
like that formula I don't know it just
makes the lashes even a little bit
bigger but this is still an awesome
mascara I'm in love with the brush it's
kind of short bristles but a lot of them
and a tapered tip very easy to maneuver
as you put it on it builds on itself
really nicely no I feel like Tarte did a
heck of a job with this holiday a lot of
reasons why I like it but in a nutshell
there's a lot of full-size in this
instead of having you know half a dozen
mini lip glosses or something like that
you're getting 4 full-size lip surgence
which are my chosen Tarte lip product I
love those you're getting two full-size
mascaras two full-size jumbo eyeshadow
sticks 16 different eye shadow
and it's all for like just under fifty
bucks made it very easy to just gift one
product or another or to give the whole
thing altogether I think it makes a very
impressive kit and think about it like
you give it to somebody and they're
taking apart one box at a time
ooh for lip products yay oh hey these
mascaras and these I think that's cool
and then you get to the end it's like oh
yeah the Big Daddy palette I got that
too so I feel like any critiques I may
have had on tart kits in the past have
really been I don't know corrected with
this so a great grouping of eyeshadows
and a nice consistent quality formula I
love the lip surgence
I'm glad they went back to basics and
gave us the lights camera lashes as
opposed to the lights camera flashes
which I don't love as much so just a lot
of high points for this kit I would
really recommend it it's at a great deal
and just in case you're not familiar
with the way today's special values work
on QVC each day there's a today's
special value a TSV a product that's at
you know a really special price for that
day and then in the following days like
after that 24 hour period is up it the
price usually goes up on it a little bit
and that's if the thing is still
available sell out so there's not always
that guarantee that you're going to be
able to get to it after that TSV day but
a lot of times you can I know with
beauty kits I've gone back to the
website and still seen them around so
that's my take on this set of course
more on holiday 2013 reviews coming on
my Express channel and I do plan to do
kind of an all encompassing holiday
palette type video on this channel too
so stay tuned for that and thank you so
much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
