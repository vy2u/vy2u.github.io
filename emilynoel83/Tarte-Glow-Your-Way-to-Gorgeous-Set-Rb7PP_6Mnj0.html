everybody thanks a lot for tuning in for
this video this is going to be all about
a new collection of makeup I recently
got I got it on QVC and it's all from
Tarte and it's called the glow you're
way too gorgeous eight-piece collection
however as you see as I kind of talk
through this they thrown in a couple
bonus items too which is really cool and
it all comes in this little bag it opens
kind of like a book and as you can see
there are a couple of compartments here
you've got a little sort of pocket on
the side that holds some of the products
and some of the other products are right
here in this little opening flattened to
go through what everything is in this
kit and exactly how to use it as well so
it's going to be more than just a
description but I'm going to be actually
showing you how I apply these things
this is a kit that is going to give you
a glow and it's kind of also low
maintenance it's easy and effort a lot
of us is makeup lovers like for example
on eyes you know we will take the time
to use five different shadows and blend
them all in a really intricate way and
oh my gosh isn't that beautiful but I
think there's another angle to make up
and it's kind of taking a more modern
effortless twist on the eye look I mean
you'll notice by the eyes that I have
going on now I mean it looks very I mean
it's kind of like smudged out with your
finger and go kind of look and I think
that's beautiful too if you're and
makeup minimalist this could be all you
use on your face because you do get the
concealer and I mean if you really want
to go bare minimum you could get by with
just this kit but if you are one of
those people that wants to use the
foundation has different little steps
that you just always work in to your
makeup no matter what you may want to
add to this like for example my face
right now the only things that are not
from this kit are my foundation a little
bit of a contour bronzing contour that I
used on my cheeks and a couple of little
I steps that I will show you in this
video of how i made the eye look just a
bit more dramatic but beyond that is all
this kit
you do get a couple of brushes you get
this brush that's designed to be for the
the cream eyeshadow product and then you
also get this brush for the blush you
get a mascara which is tart lights
camera lashes you get the mark who Jack
Reese less concealer in a rather large
tube there you get a smolder eyes
Amazonian clay waterproof liner it's
like a jumbo pencil with a smudger tip
you get the lip surgeons natural lip
lustre so that's like a jumbo pencil for
lips a blush which is in the shape
peaceful this is one of those long
wearing Amazonian clay 12-hour blushes
get a sharpener for your jumbo pencil
that emphasized waterproof Amazonian
clay cream eyeshadow and this is in the
shimmering taupe shade and then there
are a couple of little bonus items
thrown in you do get on and they didn't
even mention this on the show but you
get a pure maracuja oil so you get what
the actual you know in its purest form
you talked about it in the concealer but
this is the actual oil you won't see me
use this in the video because this is
actually what i've been using as a night
cream i mean it's kind of like an oil or
serum sort of thing but i've been using
this before bed every night and it's
been softening up my skin quite nicely
and they also give you in a rather
elaborate packaging i must say for a
little free gift they give you a mineral
bronzer to again this wasn't even
mentioned during the on-air presentation
on QVC's so you're getting technically
you know it's an 8a piece kit you're
getting 10 pieces in this really so i
think it's awesome that you get to try
so many things
I'm going to kind of take you
chronologically through how I put this
stuff on and review it as I go basically
I put on moisturizer and primer and my
foundation I use this mark hooja
creaseless concealer and this is really
nice because if you're familiar with the
way that maracuja oil is it's extremely
hydrating and I think so often I mean
one of the biggest complaints about
under eye concealers by far is that it
looks dry and cakey and just emphasizes
the look of you know the fine lines on
your eyes so when you put this on you're
going to find that it is really a unique
texture unique to anything I've used
feel like that I area is hydrated and i
personally know after using the maracuja
oil and using that all over my face and
around my eye area because they've
talked about the anti-aging effects of
that I know I like having that around my
eyes so I love having it built into the
concealer and so my thought sort of was
the first time I used it is this going
to last you know what I mean like it
with this oil built-in is this just
going to break down everything around my
eye area and it didn't so I'm very happy
with that and I put this stuff through a
concert last night I went to a concert
it was outside I was sweating my butt
off at that concert and so I was able to
really see the state power of some of
this stuff but I want to let you see I
mean I feel like the area is brightened
and I can't see the emphasis on like
little lines and things like apply this
I mean I just dotted it on and you can
see as I sort of press it into the skin
you can just see it starting to mask
some of the problem areas that are there
not take a lot it really spreads for you
is one of my top products in this whole
kit very happy with the way that
performance the Park Avenue princess
mineral bronzer and again it's packaged
really cute and I guess this is just
like a sample size kind of dusted this
all over for a little over all glows
it's a little bit of a luminous bronzer
it does have some color to it but I
wouldn't use this as a primary contour
because of the shimmer so like I use my
ELF con
wearing blush and bronzer a little bit
right here but yeah I just dusted this
all over and it gave a nice little globe
in for the blush I love this blush i
really do it's called peaceful it's the
Amazonian clay 12-hour blush this is
really long wearing like I say it was
very long wearing in my experience with
it too what you're getting I want to
give you a good look at the product
because this is a blush that's going to
give you a lot of kind of peachy pigment
but it does give you also if you can see
that swatch there on my pinky you know
as it catches the light there's a bit of
a glow to this as well this is a huge
part of this glow you're way too
gorgeous you know this blush is a big
key to it and i also really like the
blush brush they give you okay this is a
full-size blush brush it's extremely
pinched so you're getting a flatter a
flatter brush it's nicely tapered and
you'll see it tapers up to the tip as
well this is different from other blush
brushes because well with others you
feel like you can kind of get that
circular action going with this brush
you'll see in the application you know
it's practically like you're smoothing
it on you know or eyes you get this
awesome waterproof Amazonian clay cream
eyeshadow and it comes in a little you
know twist off the top here and here
you've got your Amazonian clay shadow it
is shimmering it is borderline metallic
taupe is a great shade to have I think
in something like this because it is the
type of thing that you could use as a
base for other I they don't give you a
brush that they say to apply it with
however I think it really transfers on
much better with your fingers and I used
this again I use this without any powder
setting it the other day and when I went
to this concert and I kind of dabbed it
on my lid I pulled it up through to the
crease a little bit and I mean it gives
you such a pretty look I'm really really
love the color and it didn't go anywhere
I mean
I was looking out for this to go
somewhere and it didn't and another
thing to note about this is that if you
add a little bit more like say you put
on your initial application then you
want to build it up a bit more like give
it a little pop sort of in the center of
your lid it will become even more
metallic you're getting here is the
smolder eyes Amazonian clay waterproof
liner and I have a swatch here on my
hand I'm really pressing hard on this
and it's not moving on me there so long
wearing for sure lemme brown kind of
shade and so I initially just kind of
put some of this color on the outer part
of my lid and kind of blended that in I
also used it to go under my eye and
above my eye just kind of surrounding my
eye in that sort of smoldering effect
and then you can use the smudger tip at
the other end to keep it a little more
blended out hood where this alone you
don't have to top it off with shadow but
there are a few steps that I used to
take this look and make it just a little
bit more dramatic just the things i
would do i'm just taking a plum shadow
that i have any will work this is from
Victoria's Secret beauty brush it's
called plum crazy and I'm just taking a
flat brush this one's from sigma and
just get a little bit of the product on
there and then I'm just overlapping like
what I did shut up with that jumbo stick
then you can take you know any kind of
crease brush you like to use and use a
little bit more of that just to kind of
deepen the crease and give it a little
more blended look and still using that
same shadow I'm going to use a pencil
brush get a little bit of the color just
on the tip and then use that to kind of
blend it right over that plummy Brown
kind of smoldering eye pin in the final
step for adding a little bit of drama
take any black eyeliner you like to use
in your waterline I have a few that i
like but today I'm using my malli ever
color starlight waterproof liner and
this isn't
just gently pull down and sorry if I'm
covering up the screen with my mirror
but I have to see this and just apply
that liner all across your waterline
you'll have an even deeper more intense
since i am doing at going to be adding a
strip of false eyelashes as well i'm
going to just kind of dot some of that
this black will make it look even more
natural when the lashes are coming out
and the mascara that you get I've talked
about lights camera lashes as being one
of my ultimate favorite mascaras when I
talked about favorite mascaras it was in
there so the one you get in this kit has
they're really cute packaging on it I
haven't busted into this one yet because
I still have this one that i'm working
on so obviously i'm not going to lose
open up a new one I'll throw it on the
ground but yeah the brush is really nice
with this it's got very short bristles
this is a buildable mascara it's not
going to dry too fast on you so you can
build it up with multiple coats kind of
wiggle it toward the base of your lashes
and then comb it on through you can use
this on the bottom lashes as well it
claims to increase / volume by four
hundred and twenty four percent I
general day-to-day experience I've never
had this smudge underneath and this is
not the waterproof which I believe is
called lights camera splashes how cute
is that but so this is not waterproof
still didn't smudge on me however last
night as I told you I was sweating and I
was at a concert and I believe it was
since i put a decent amount of this on
my lower lashes a little bit of this
came down and smudged on me so once
again it didn't claim to be waterproof
so i don't necessarily expect that it
wouldn't right now but that's the only
thing i can say about this i love the
way it works and i did add some extra
lashes to this just to add to the drama
of the landline we've got a jumbo pencil
called sweet and it's one of the
lipsurgence natural lip luster G pink
with shimmer it has that minty feel it's
a jumbo pencil it feels like a lip balm
going on
you guys know I've talked up Jimbo lip
pencils so much because i love the
control how quickly it can go on i feel
like i'm wearing just a lip balm right
now but i feel like i have really pretty
color so there are other cheaper
products out there what sets this one
apart might be the fact that it's a
little more conditioning it has you know
it also has that minty feel like I said
so my overall impressions of this kit
are as you could kind of see that I
didn't have a lot bad to say about and
appreciate the fact they given you some
free things thrown in and everything
else is full-size so that's really cool
it's a really low maintenance kind of
look you know it's very modern it's kind
of like the updated kind of smudgy I
that doesn't take a whole lot of steps
and a whole lot of tools and stuff to
make it go a big fan of this concealer
I'm saying my standout products from the
whole kit are probably this concealer
the blush waterproof shimmering taupe
cream shadow because I'm not used to a
lot of cream shadows that can do what
this does the Mallee ever color shadow
sticks can do it and they were pretty
much the only ones for a while and this
one can do it as well on its own give
you a glossy kind of look to the lids
without feeling like you have to top it
off with powder so yay very very pleased
thank you so much for watching this
video I know it was a lot of description
and a lot of talk but I wanted to show
you exactly how you can use these
products to get the look so thanks again
have a great day guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
