a brand new makeup kit from Tarte it's
called the starlet and check it out it
is whoops it's a jewelry box actually
this thing once you take the makeup out
of it it can be a jewelry box in a sense
this is a really practical makeup kit
because once you're done using it for
makeup you can use it in other ways and
it obviously looks really cute in I
think probably anyone's day cord and the
travel sense this is not really
practical because these drawers will
just come open there's no locking
mechanism to keep them shut the top can
come open as well saying you can't come
up with a good way to take this with you
but it's definitely designed to sit on
your vanity on your bathroom sink and
just use it from home so keep that in
mind it opens up from the top and as you
can see you've got another great mirror
we're getting here are four full-sized i
shadow quads basically I mean they did
not skimp on prod I feel out the next
drawer and hey there's two more so
you've got a total of six eyeshadow
quads you've got a lash primer called
multiply you've got tart lights camera
lashes mascara and then in the bottom
drawer you've got face products so it's
a bronzer two of the Amazonian clay
blushes and then aluminized to describe
the eyeshadows a little bit again I'm
really glad that they gave full sizes
but when I first saw this at Sephora
that's where this is exclusively being
sold I noticed that they weren't the
typical like tart eyeshadow look that
most of the other tart palettes have you
know where their little squares and I
say tart in the center and so that
instantly made me think maybe these are
a different formulation or not as good
of a formulation as most of their
shadows are but once I started swatching
them I realized no these are the same
great texture that a lot of the tart
shadows hey don't have a lot of fallout
when you put your brush in them so I
mean you feel like you're getting that
great pigmentation you're getting a mix
of matte and shimmer sparkly in some
cases metallic so it's a nice variety
and it is very user friendly because
again they are all divided up so just
going you know section by section you're
getting you know that great kit that you
could use for a smokey eye we're talking
you know Gray's Silver's are really
pearly white and your classic Matt for
example I use the matte black with the
look I'm wearing today which is the kit
with the kind of corals and greens right
next door so for that kit it's kind of a
shimmery coral that makes me think of a
blush or maybe a highlight then you've
got a couple of matte shades and then
you've got an awesome awesome like dark
forest green with sparkle talk about a
great holiday got a great selection
of some soft plum color not getting you
know bold purple you're not getting
anything super bright you got kind of a
smoky gray shade a matte pink then
you've got satiny finish on the deepest
shade they're kind of a plum and then a
slightly shimmery lavender cut Luke it
is really nice because you've got that
rich Navy that can function as your
liner shade and it's just so pretty
you've got a super light blue and then a
very metallic kind of silvery icy blue
may just hint of blue in that color and
then a light peach that is also very
shimmer even to the second drawer you've
got your neutral palette so neutral
girls who love Browns and bronze a kind
of a shimmery champagne color your
deeper brown a great metallic bronze and
then you've got a kind of skin tone
peachy type color very difficult to
swatch but it's definitely a matte shade
that could tone down any of the other
shades if you wanted to and then this
was the first kit that I used the one
right next door here which is a kind of
pinks and browns and it just struck me
as something very wearable and very
pretty a matte pink a kind of medium
brown to other shades on the side here
as shimmery nude and then a pink that
has Sun just the slightest bit of goals
are all divided into their own color
families so if you often get palettes
and wonder how do I use that or how do I
put together the color combinations the
fact that they are divided like they are
I think allows you to have some
action and have a sense of kind of
what's going on here but you can
definitely you know mix and match you've
got a couple of I products here one is
the multiply this is a white formula
here that you will put on your lashes
before you put on masks I think it
provides great length and I could see
this being a neat little thing to use
with different mascaras one thing I
noticed was that my curl where whereas
when I used lights camera lashes which
is the other product in here I have this
in full size and I this is one of my
all-time favorite mascaras and I felt
like when I've used this my normally
straight lashes you know I curl them
with the lash curler and I put this on
and they don't have a problem holding
that curl but when I added this into the
equation they seemed to straighten out
just a little bit more I don't know if
it's just the weight of having double
the product on there or you know what
this was doing it gave great length but
again what's length if it's not kind of
curved up so everybody can see it you
know what I mean love lights camera
lashes mascara this is great you're
going to definitely enjoy this sample
size if you've never tried it before and
you're probably going to want to buy the
full size after this just a warning
you've been warned the bottom you've got
four face products the bronze are the
two blushes in the highlight and just to
show you size-wise they are not you know
full-size products here's the size of a
normal Tarte Amazonian clay blush we'll
see if I can hold this up here without
losing it all but so there's this size
comparison so just so you're aware of
Park Avenue princess bronzer some of you
may have tried that before it's a
bronzer with a little bit of shimmer to
it the next blush is a light peach and
it has kind of a satiny finish it's not
like a lot of sparkle each one is called
glory the berry one is called starlet
this does have some shimmer to it I'm
wearing both actually today one layered
on top of the other I did starlet kind
of right here and I used glory on top of
that in you also have a highlight which
is in rows so I don't know it doesn't
strike me as a particularly rosy shade
it's just kind of shimmery and show you
what you lift the products out of here
there in like a
plastic pan basically so obviously it's
been finished with this sort of sparkly
board I have a feeling that if you
wanted too deep on these so to speak you
can see they're just metal backed on
there they are apparently glued in so
maybe you could pry those out if you
wanted to put them in your Z palette or
something but you have a really nice
satiny it reminds me of kind of a satiny
finish on the interior in the pros of
this palette is that you're getting six
full-size eye shadow quads in here
you're also getting to sample some of
the tart face products and you get a
couple of lash products as well
including one of my all-time favorite
mascaras I like that it's a mix of matte
and shimmer colors are pre organized so
if you're confused on how to put shades
together you've got kind of a starting
point the downsides to this palette are
that it's not something that's travel
friendly at all it's really designed to
sit on a vanity and not really be moon
I'm just wanted to let you know what
it's all about thank you so much for
watching and keep an eye out for some
tutorials using this palette in the near
future hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
