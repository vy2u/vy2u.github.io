tutorial using a couple of fairly new
drugstore products this is actually
really similar to the look I had on in
my video where I was doing the three in
one review on new Revlon products it's
using the Revlon Colorstay smokey shadow
stick and one of the new quads from
covergirl is that neither of these
products I really think are absolutely
amazing on their own but they work
really well together the shadow stick
needs the bit of powder on top for
staying power and the powder can use the
cream product to add some intensity it
really comes together nicely for a nice
teal look I think it's dramatic enough
for like a night out but I still think
you can you know go about your
day-to-day business with it on too so
and every single thing on my face is
actually drugstore I'll mention all
those products down below in the extra
info box and I'll mention a few key
things at the end but for now here's the
eyes I just applied my ELF $1 eyeprimer
just to give my shadow a little bit of a
base and I'm gonna have a color base as
well it's the Revlon Colorstay smokey
shadow stick this shade is called
smolder and one end is kind of a deep
teal and the other is sort of a light
silvery blue so I'm gonna use the
lighter side first and I'm just going to
basically draw this all over my lid I'm
also gonna bring it around the inner
corner I'm just putting a little bit of
the darker color on the outer part of my
lid and then I'm taking it a little bit
under the outer part of my lower lash
next I'm going to my covergirl quad in
sugar-coated this is one of their it's
in the new displays it's kind of a
different packaging from the older quads
and I'm gonna go to this teal color here
and just use the sponge tip applicator
I like the tapered end and you're just
gonna Pat right over what you just did
there with the shadow stick I'm taking
it not only on my lid but also up
through the crease a little
I'm also taking this right around the
tear duct and it's gonna cling to the
shadow stick we put there as well then
you can just flip over your sponge tip
and use this darker color this kinda has
sort of a nice dark teal that's almost
exactly like the dark teal in the shadow
sticks get a nice little contrast of
color there on the outer part and you
can kind of pull that up as well then
I'm just using this brush from Coastal
Scents with that darker shade using a
brush in the crease tends to just help
it diffuse a little bit more easily but
just take that kind of back and forth in
the career looking to go too deep and
dark because we are gonna have kind of a
dramatic lash as you can see but you
know just a little bit and there is kind
of a plummy brown color here so I'm
gonna lightly Pat into that with that
same brush and I'm kind of warming up
even though it's still a dark shade it
just kind of warms up all these blues
we've got going on so just go along the
border and then there is a peachy kind
of shade here with a little bit of a
metallic tone so get a little bit of
that and we're gonna take that right
under the brow not a lot it just gives a
nice little shine to that area next I'm
using my wet and wild make a liner in
black this is just a really nice rich
black liquid liner with a very fine tip
it's a little brush tip and I'm gonna
take that from the innermost corner all
the way across to the outer sometimes
Center I find I draw a little bit above
my lash line almost like an outline of
what I'm gonna do and then you can
really get in there and get close close
to the lashes and I'm gonna widen my
line just a little bit toward the
outside but not doing any big wing with
this look I'm gonna take my Maybelline
master drama liner and midnight master
it's blast you know we're kind of
connecting to the liquid and then just
getting it right kind of right between
the lashes on the lower lash line this
is my favorite part I'm not
it's just I think I like this itty-bitty
brush I'm using my Real Techniques
little accent brush you can just put the
shadow exactly where you want it you're
not gonna mess it up you know so I'm
going to take the darkest teal color
with that little brush and that's gonna
top off our pencil liner here and we're
actually going to just carry that all
the way and going now into this shade
the bright kind of turquoise teal and
then going kind of underneath what we
just did just a little bit kind of
overlapping kind of underneath and it
just brightens it up a bit
roll the lashes then I'm going to use my
covergirl LashBlast and even though this
is the white tube for the olympics it's
still regular lash blast and I'm gonna
apply a coat of that to the top lashes
and a very careful coat to the bottom
lashes as well lashes I'm using are from
ardell and they are the demi wispies and
they really make your lashes look nice
and full and they're a little bit longer
on the outside so it's gonna give you a
little bit of an upswept upturned look
even without doing anything fancy to
your eyeliner so I'm using this kiss
premium lash glue it's a nice glue with
a little wand so just put that along the
lash band after you let that get just a
little bit tacky I like to put my
fingers in the middle of the lash band
and then kind of Center that with the
middle of my eye place it on there and
then just press the lash on really close
to your lash line both on the outer and
the inner corner and then just kind of
make sure the whole band is down and
then kind of bump it up so the lashes
are kind of resting in a nice upturned
away and then just to make sure
everything's really nice and bonded
there I do a very light coat sort of if
you want to call it that of mascara
there you go guys a very simple take on
a teal I look I got a lot of requests
for this after that Revlon review where
I was wearing this sort of a look so
thanks for asking for it on my cheeks
just a few key things here I'm using the
one dollar elf blush in flushed so
that's what's giving me almost a little
bit of a berry pink look to the to the
cheeks and then I wanted to keep the
lips pretty simple there you can see
they're not super colorful but they do
have some shine so I'm using the
Neutrogena revitalizing lip balm in
petal glows so this is just sort of you
know your lips but kind of amped up a
little bit little more shimmery so I
like that a lot I like the way it feels
on too so thanks a lot for watching guys
I hope you have a wonderful day and I
will see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
