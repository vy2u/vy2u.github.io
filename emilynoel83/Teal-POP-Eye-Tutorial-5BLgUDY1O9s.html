tutorial using a palette that I've
gotten a lot of requests to do a look
with and it is from wet-and-wild it's
one of those new 8 color palettes and
it's called blue had me at hello
so this palette I want to say first off
that this is a palette that could create
a great you know just kind of black
white silver sort of smoky eye look if
that's what you want but today we're
going to show you and kind of how to use
pops of color in your eye looks so we
are going to incorporate some blue some
of that great teal color which is kind
of underneath the eye here so it's very
easy and what I like about this look is
that I think it looks very easy very
effortless it doesn't look like one of
those sort of work of art eye looks that
appears like you know you walk out in
house and somebody probably thinks you
spent like hour sweeping over your eye
makeup this is very carefree very easy
to do great for some a really easy look
I'll take you through it so keep on
watching I'm going to take my palette
from wet and wild here called blue had
me at hello and I'm going to go for this
shape that says eyelid and that's a
silvery color so just get some of that
on a flat eyeshadow brush and we're
basically just gonna Pat this on mainly
we're kind of going to go over the whole
lid but really concentrated on the inner
part and just use that patting approach
and that's gonna really concentrate the
color on your lid without tossing it all
over your face and I'm just gonna flip
my brush over for this next step so I
can use the same brush without really
cleaning it off too much but I'm going
to go for this shade here that says
crease it's kind of a nice metallic
cobalt blue shade and so just again get
some of that on your brush and a little
bit of this shade goes a long way but
we're going to Pat that on the outer
part of the lid here and you can see it
you overlap a lighter shade you're not
going to get quite as much intensity as
if you just went in with the dark shade
at the from the start but I'm just
patting it on there first and I'm also
thinking as I'm patting it out here then
I'm going to start to work it into a
little bit of an outer V here for a
little more drama on the outside same
color just a different brush now this is
from Sigma it's the SS 217 and I'm going
to just take some of this shade this
darker blue and this is a nice brush to
get that color in our crease to get it
exactly where we want it give us the
control we want but without getting it
in it's still making it diffused and
still making it look very buffed out
again you can just use this brush to
further shape the outside and blend it
in your crease there and what you're
getting is not really a distinct blue
color when you really blend it out
you're getting more of just you know a
really nice just deeper tone there in
the crease then I'm going to take a
fluffier brush this is my SS 224 brush
I'm going to go to this shade that says
brow bone and it's a white shimmery
shade and just get a little bit of that
on there and then that's going to become
a nice highlight shade just sort of
overlap those other colors you've been
using for a flawless blend next step I'm
going to take a little pencil brush like
this a lot of different brands make a
brush like this the thing we're looking
for is that it's not only a small brush
but it's very stiff if you can see how
you know it keeps that that really tight
form as we use it so just going to use
that same blue shade just so we have a
lot of continuity with this look it's
going to be you know kind of bringing
the upper lid and our lower lid together
here so yep just the tip of that in that
crease shade and we're just gonna use
that to further deepen up just this
outer outer portion there of the of the
upper eyelid and kind of take it out and
then we're going to blend it just
underneath as well don't go any further
in then I would
say 1/3 so if you're splitting your eye
into thirds there the outer third is
what we're looking to keep dark this
next part is the most fun and it is
really easy to love this shade this is
the shade when you glance at this
palette I don't know my eye really goes
to this turquoise color and so I'm going
to take this great brush from Sonia
Kashuk it is a smudge brush and it's
great it's very stiff but it's not as
fine and precise as say an angled liner
brush so get some of that shade on there
and then we're just going to take this
kind of overlap that darker color just a
bit and then it's just going to
transition into this gorgeous teal
turquoise I love it love using you know
just that pump of color in the look that
doesn't look too overdone but just
enough you know to really get some
attention there on the eyes this is a
look where I want to line the waterline
to give it just that kind of mysterious
edge I think it really makes the lot
lower lashes look thick when I'm doing a
look that involves a lot of lower lashes
like this one will I think it's kind of
nice to have it really deep and dark
right up there on the waterline so gonna
line my upper lash line with the Mallee
ever color automatic waterproof remember
all the parts of this name but it's a
black eyeliner pencil that's really long
wearing you can use whatever whatever
black pencil you like I'm just kind of
using short strokes and connecting them
as I go
using that pencil brush again with some
navy blue to just go over the top of
that and get it a little more blended
looking next I'm going to apply some
mascara and then some false eyelashes as
you can see it really finishes off the
look and eyelashes can really help shape
the look you've created with your
eyeshadows so we've got the outer V
going so you
you know a set of eyelashes that maybe
gives you a little more drama towards
the outside like this and one thing I
would advise you to do with your lower
mascara that's something that I like in
this look to be a little bit thicker and
I went like one coat all across with my
Maybelline lash discovery and I went two
coats then I did a second coat on the
outer part right there so you've got
even more thickness toward the outside
of the eye it's really going to give you
all of that cat eye effect without going
doing any you know heavy cat eye liner
so I'll be right back with the finished
look alright guys here's the finished
look as you can see the lashes really
top this off and frame the whole look of
the eyeshadow and everything I just like
that you know it's a pop of color
without looking like a total work of art
on your eyes you know like you spent
hours slaving over your eye makeup it
just kind of looks like a bright
cheerful way to switch up your eye
makeup so I do have a few key products
that I used on the rest of my face that
I'll tell you about I used my hard candy
baked bronzer in heatwave this has a
little shimmer to it but I think what
applied with a big brush it really
diffuses it and gives you a nice glow
and then if you want a contour again one
of my favorite contours is from ELF the
contouring brush and breath blush and
bronzer and then for the blush that I
used today loving this blush from NYX in
mocha it's just a great great pink blush
my lips I used one of the one dollar
lipsticks from ELF in classy and so
that's where this sort of pink look is
coming from this all I have on my lips
and to make it look really natural put
it on and then kind of press it in with
your finger and you get just a really
almost like a lip balm type effect there
if you know what I mean it doesn't look
too thick like a lipstick sometimes does
so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
thanks for taking the time to watch let
me know if there are certain other ways
that you like to use this palette
because I think it has a lot of
versatility
and it's a lot of fun so thanks again
guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
