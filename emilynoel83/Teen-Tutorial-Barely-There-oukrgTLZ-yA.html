tutorials I'm going to show you how to
do a barely-there makeup look from start
to finish from foundation to the last
bit of mascara I apply I'm going to show
you how to create a less-is-more look
basically I'm using some very affordable
products and I hope you guys enjoy this
let me know if you have any questions
and let's get started alright guys the
first step is to moisturize your skin
which I've just done and then I'm gonna
take my ELF chute yielding hydro tint
it's like a light light coverage
foundation
I am tone 2 and I'm just gonna apply
this with my fingers all over my face so
just squirt a little bit out on your
finger and then I like to just kind of
dot it around a few places and then just
blend it in and like I said this is
light coverage so that's sort of the
along the lines of this barely-there
look you know just not not overdoing it
with the makeup kind of letting your
natural skin shine through so I'm just
continuing to dot this around and blend
it in blending it right up under my eyes
because while it is light coverage it
does provide some coverage so you know
it still put it around your eyes kind of
treat it like you would a regular family
now that you've applied the shield and
hydroton all over your face which also
happens to have an SPF of 15 so that's
nice in case your moisturizer doesn't
have sunscreen in it then we're gonna
reach for our nyx concealer in a jar my
color is light and it's just you know a
nice little pot form of concealer and
I'm using my concealer brush from
essence of beauty that's available at
CVS and this is just going to do a
really good job of going around our eye
area and if you watched my other teen
tutorial you may have noticed that I did
this step before I applied the mineral
foundation and that is because I was
using minerals so I just think you know
I'll put down the creamy step before the
powdery step and that that you know
loose powder
foundation function to set this right
now we went ahead and did the foundation
first and so I for some reason just like
to do the concealer after generally
because that foundation sometimes can
cover a little bit for you and then you
can truly see how much work you have
left to do with your concealer after you
put your foundation on so there's the
logic behind that alright guys now that
we have put some concealer around our
trouble spots I'm gonna grab my NYC
smooth skin loose face powder my shade
is naturally beige and I'm just going to
use my kind of fluffier kabuki brush for
this and just dip it into the powder and
sort of treat it like a mineral makeup
kind of you know dip into the lid and
just apply this powder all over my face
especially setting that concealer on my
under eye area and loose powder is very
important because it helps set your
entire look so just keep that in mind
whenever you're doing makeup that loose
powder or some form of powder that
you're you know applying after any
liquid step is very important okay guys
now it's time to do a little bit of
bronzing I'm going to use my Wet n Wild
mega glow in starlight bronze it's kind
of it has some shimmer to it and it has
a variety of different tones as you can
see and that could be used as an
eyeshadow palette to really so I'm gonna
use my nice big fluffy brush the
fluffier the better is really good for
bronzers because it helps diffuse that
coverage you don't want full coverage
with a bronzer you want that to be nice
and light so I'm just gonna go over my
forehead and just kind of around those
areas where the Sun might naturally hit
now we're gonna follow that up with some
blush I'm gonna be using my Milani
mineral powder blush in my tie and I
must say this is like a peachy pink
shade and I have to tell you guys that
in many of my videos if
someone asked me if I get lots of
comments like what blush are you wearing
usually the one you're asking about is
this one so just to clear that up I mean
I sometimes you know I'm able to answer
that comment but not everybody goes back
and sees it so anyway Milani mineral
blush in my Thai it's a gorgeous shade
on so many skin tones I think because
peach generally looks good on a lot of
people but the added pink here just
really works well and I'm just swirling
that on the apples of my cheeks and kind
of blending back we're not gonna do it
like that I said this is a barely there
look so we're not gonna do any major
major contour alright guys it's time to
move on to our eyes and lips and on my
lips I'm using the elf plumping lip
glaze and the shade is oasis so to do
that you use this light side here that's
kind of like the plumping stuff and then
this is the color that you put on top of
it so kind of a pretty just like golden
a peachy pink shade really natural and
moving on to our eyes what we're going
to go ahead and do is put a base down
I'm gonna use my ELF duo shadow cream in
butter pecan and I'm going to use this
lighter peach shade I'm just going to
very lightly very sparingly apply that
all over the lid and this will just give
our shadows something to stick to and
it'll make it a little stand out just a
bit more and then we're going to reach
for a covergirl quad I know when I
brought this topic up on my blog that I
was going to do teen makeup everybody
kind of referenced or a lot of people
did referenced using covergirl makeup to
start with and I definitely did and
continue to for some things but this is
the quad in country woods so it's a nice
you know group of really neutral light
shades even the darker shades are still
pretty light so I thought for my
barely-there look this would be a great
choice so I'm gonna start with the
lightest shade right here use my eye
shadow brush and just pack this on my
lid it's just a nice creamy sort of
match
actually yeah just Pat that all over
just like so alright and then I'm going
to use my essence of beauty crease brush
not my fine crease brush but the one
that's a size up from that and I'm going
to grab this shade here on the end
I guess these actually have names and
this one would be mocha so it's not the
darkest shade but it's probably the
second darkest it's a little bit warmer
than the darker shade and I'm going to
just apply this in my crease it's not
gonna you can see like a little bit of
color coming off of it but it's really
pretty light and the main reason why I'm
putting this down is so when I put the
darker shade over it it'll blend even
easier there so now we've got that now
we're gonna move on to the darkest shade
in the group which is coffee right here
and it's just kind of a nice matte brown
a little cooler than that other shade
and we're just gonna deepen the crease
just a little bit more as you can see
we're not getting too dark with anything
here if you have a look you want to call
barely-there you can't really go too
much further but just kind of applying
that real lightly it's a really really
natural look like if you don't
necessarily want anyone to know you have
eye makeup on this would be one of the
looks to go with and then we're gonna
use this shade right here it's a
shimmery color called got to turn it
around
mink vision right here it's just a light
it's really the only shimmery shade in
this group and it's just got like it's
kind of a pretty champagne light taupe
shade and we're gonna use that as our
highlight because that shimmer will
catch the light a little bit and just
apply that up there now for our liner
the liner is gonna be really subtle and
it will involve some smudging so get out
your smudge tip and I'm going to use a
brown liner it's gonna be Maybelline
unstoppable in cinnabar any brown liner
you're comfortable with will do
and basically I'm going to put a very
light amount of this on the outer half
of my eyelid that's a good strategy
anytime you kind of want to make your
eyes look bigger but not um you know
have a harsh liner look just go on the
outer half it'll kind of you know leave
this part open and not won't be so
closed off with a dark line of eyeliner
and then I'm gonna go under the bottom
here just lightly connecting it thick at
the corner I'm going underneath and I'm
just barely applying any pressure at all
I'm really barely touching the skin
there with that okay and then I'm gonna
grab my smudge tip and this is going to
be intensify this a little bit more you
know just gonna smudge it out make it so
there's not necessarily a line there at
all just a little bit of you know
darkness all right guys I just curled my
lashes and I'm gonna apply a coat of
l'oréal's lash out mascara just to give
me some nice length here alright guys I
hope you enjoyed this barely-there
makeup look I hope you find it easy to
duplicate it really it's not that
difficult than chances are many of you
have some neutral shades like this in
your collection somewhere that you can
use and but I think it just goes to show
that you don't need to wear a lot of
makeup but just a little bit just to
kind of you know even out the skin tone
and enhance your eyes a little bit can
go really a long way so thanks guys so
much for watching and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
