this edition of teen tutorials for this
video it's multi-purpose pink and what I
mean by that is we're going to be taking
a product that is a sort of face
highlight palette but it also its
individual stripes of color it's the
Milani glimmer stripes if i can get it
open here and show you you these can
also be used for eyeshadow too so that's
exactly what we're going to do we're
going to use it on our face also on our
eyes kind of a monochromatic pink look
we've got going on here so i'll show you
how i did that and really what prompted
me to do this i have another one of
these glimmer stripes palettes as well
in a bronzy sort of tone and i was
looking at them and feeling the texture
of these colors and they remind me a lot
of the Milani singles and a lot of
people rave about how those singles are
so pigmented at such great quality
they're often compared to Mac shades and
but the thing that I the problem I have
is that they don't have a huge selection
of color and so I thought well they are
very similar like this for example in
this palette this orange shade um is
just like Milani flare the single this
shade above it is like Sun Goddess so I
mean it's it's like they've they're very
very similar in texture and color I mean
if I swatch them side-by-side you
wouldn't know the difference and so I
thought this shade is really pretty too
with the pinks and they don't have a lot
of pinks you know just single so I
thought if this is comparable quality
this is a great thing for people who
love Milani shadows and what more color
selection just pick up one of these and
you've got like what so five different
shades to choose from in terms of
something that can be used as a shadow
so anyway if you want to see how I
achieve this whole look on my whole face
from foundation to mascara keep watch
boy stur eyes and put on a primer for
this look I used rimmel's fix and
perfect primer a lot of people like this
and you can just pick that up at the
drugstore I'm going to apply a
foundation and I do get a lot of
questions from people in the teen age
range about something that can help
control shine
and you know oiliness and things like
that and the Rimmel stay matte
foundation my shade is 200 soft beige
and its oil free and it's supposed to
help your skin really stay shine-free
throughout the day so I found that it
works for me like I said I can't
guarantee that this you know won't you
know react in a certain way to different
skin types i just you know nobody can
say that for sure through a
recommendation but um I just wanted to
let you know that chances are this may
be a good pick for you and I'm just
applying that with my fingers all over
my face I'm paying special attention to
around my eye area because whatever this
covers up a concealer won't have to
cover up later so you know just dot it
on everywhere you think you need it and
blend it in once you're done with
foundation we aren't going to do a
little concealing around the under eye
area you can see kind of a little
redness and just a little discoloration
and so to combat that I'm going to use
my NYX concealer in a jar my shade is
light this is available at cherry
culture calm I believe for around five
dollars somewhere in that ballpark and
i'm just applying it on right up to my
lash line I think I've stressed this
before in other videos but it's amazing
the you know sometimes a little bit of
redness that is going on right there
right close to your eye and if you can
kind of erase that your eye look will
stand out a lot more all right guys
since we've just applied our foundation
in our concealer we definitely want to
put on some powder to set the look and
I'm going to be using a product I really
haven't mentioned I'm not sure if I
mentioned it at all it's from flirt and
that's a brand available at kohls most
of the stuff is at a pretty reasonable
price and this little compact pier it
like slides open like that and then
opens up and it's a powder it's a
oops just lost the sponge it's called
love and madness oil-free pressed powder
my shade is nude Envy in warm and so
this is just a good oil control type
powder and I'm going to use this blush
it's kind of brush it's a fluffy angled
brush that you could use for blush but I
also like to use it if I want to apply
powder just you know get it more
concentrated in certain areas like
around my eye and stuff like that it's
just good for that so um if you want
your powder to go on more sheer you know
consider using a brush instead of those
you know sponges or puffs that come in
your powder compact because this is
instantly getting me the effect of a
loose powder which is more sheer so just
keep that in for our bronzer and sort of
contour shade I'm going to use my Milani
sunset duo's in sunset breeze and we're
just going to be using that nice matte
bronzer here first and just go go ahead
and put it you know wherever the Sun
would naturally hit you that's usually
you know your forehead temples area and
then when you get down here think about
contouring contouring your cheekbone
area a little bit that's just you know
apply more color there under your jaw
line as well it's just kind of a face
slimming a step here and then consider a
light wash over your cheeks too and down
your no pop of blush i'm going to use
that kind of shimmery plum shade and
just go ahead and apply that right there
on the apples of my cheeks so convenient
how they have both steps here in this
little bronzer palette
okay and then here's where our kind of
multi-purpose pink is going to come in
i'm going to pull out my Milani glimmer
stripes and the shade is Barry glimmer
and so it's got a lot of nice pinks and
Barry tones to it and we're going to use
this kind of as a highlight um what I'm
going to do is take my my blush brush
here and just kind of Pat it all over
the palette and use it right on top of
my cheekbones to get myself a little bit
of like a a pinky glow there just Pat it
all over the palette shake it off and go
right on top of your cheekbones another
good place for that is like all over the
eye area and a little bit across the
forehead all right guys it's time to get
started on the eye look what we're going
to do is start with on a pink cream
shadow to use as our base and I'm going
to be using this shade out of my revlon
cream shadow set in mystical magics it's
just a nice pink shade you don't have to
have this exact set I found mine I
believe I found it in big lots um not
too long ago so I mean they still have
revlon cream shadow sets in stores i'm
not sure if they have this exact one but
just any you know pinkish tone cream
shadow will work just make sure you keep
it light don't apply too much or else
that will affect the staying power the
part I've been looking forward to
getting out this Milani glimmer stripes
in berry glimmer and messing with some
of these pink shades to get a pretty
pink look on the eyes so the first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to take
this shade right here in the middle just
a pretty medium pink shade and with my
eyeshadow brush I'm just going to put
that all over the lid
and this will be like a really shimmery
eye so get ready and now that you've got
that I'm going to dot a little bit of
this white shade at the top I'm going to
just put some of that right here in the
inner corner just like that okay and
then we're going to start getting some
color worked into the crease area and
there's a pretty almost brick red
looking shade right here towards the
bottom and then take Milo Cornell one
quarter Maxine's Mont brush and just get
a little bit on there and apply that to
like the outer part of your lid and then
kind of we're going to start working it
up into the outer half of the crease
this little brush is also very easy to
use in this palette where it's narrow
stripes of color and it's just a very
small brush so you can easily get in
there with this all right so now we've
got this pretty sort of red shade there
on the outside and what we're going to
do to kind of top that off we're going
to take that same brush and there is a
gorgeous gorgeous shade at the bottom
here probably my favorite color and the
whole thing and it's kind of a bright on
almost a purpley pink shade and just
going to kind of overlap that color with
that a little bit just kind of making
our own sort of deep purple a pink shade
there and then last but not least we're
going to kind of fade up to our
highlight with this shade that's second
from the top kind of a really light rose
shade not a lot of pink to this shade
but we're going to use that up here i'm
using this is Milo Cornell three eighths
I'm just using that to apply that all
the way up to my eyebrow and if you want
one last little pop of color go back to
the white shade and come up right under
your brow okay so before I put that
pallet away I'm going to go back to the
really tiny brush that little low
Cornell one quarter brush back to that
brick red shade and we're going to just
dot this this is going to be our only
thing that's on our lower liner trying
to kind of keep this simple and basic
whoops whoa sorry guys i said as i was
saying i'm trying to keep it kind of
simple and basic for these two teen
tutorials geared towards anybody who may
be a beginner to make up so and this
this is such an easy technique to just
take this little brush put it in
whatever coordinating shadow you're
using and just use it to kind of smudge
that color right in your lower lashline
so easy you still get some depth down
there but it's really subtle and I mean
if you have dark eyelashes like me it
almost looks like you might have lower
liner on but really you get up close and
it's just kind of a light wash of color
their next I wanted to demonstrate the
technique for a gel liner using my jane
be pure mineral gel liner in black and
this I've heard some people say that
this can be easier for them then a
liquid liner so I have another brush
from my goodness I've rubbed off the
logo but it was a it's a round CP 85 but
I couldn't tell you the brand i just
found this at walmart they have plenty
of these little tiny brushes that look
about like that and they're so great i
mean i got this for about a dollar maybe
and um these are great for applying
liquid liner or I mean cream base liner
so I'm just going to start in the corner
like I normally would and then just
start dragging it out and I mean the
beauty of this is that the liquid can
kind of be like once you once you touch
your eye with it it's kind of going to
look how it how you did it you know but
this has a little more of a smudging
ability so that can be nice for folks
who want to go back and kind of smudge
it out a little bit so I'm not weighing
this out whatsoever I'm just drawing the
line right to the corner they're gonna
curl my eyelashes I'm going to hold it
for about 15 seconds with my ELF eyelash
then I'm going to use my maybelline lash
stiletto mascara and this is kind of
growing on me a little bit sometimes
with a lot of mascaras I try like I try
them out once and it's kind of like I
don't know and then you know I keep
working with it and all and sometimes I
turn out to like them and I do love this
brush I like how its narrow at the tip
and a little bit thicker towards the
other opposite end and it does create
really nice hey guys there is the
finished look a nice soft pink shimmer
and it's really nice because that's that
shimmery palette that we used on our
eyes we also used as a cheek highlight
and it just gives a really pretty glow
and on my lips I used my covergirl
outlast lipstain and the color is 400 it
doesn't have a shade name on this but
it's a neat little like felt tip pen
sort of thing and I just drew it on
there basically and that's a pretty long
time so that can be nice you know for
school or whatever when you don't maybe
have a lot of chances to touch up
through the day so anyway guys I hope
you like this look and thank you for
tuning it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
