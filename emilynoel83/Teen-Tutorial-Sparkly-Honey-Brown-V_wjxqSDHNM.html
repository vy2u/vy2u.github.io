this teen tutorial as you can see this
look is just a little more glam than
some of my other teen looks it's sort of
a chocolaty Brown honey kind of look and
it's just really warm I think would be
really appropriate for a night out or a
banquet or any kind of sort of you know
date or something that you're going to
have where you want to just amp up the
look a little bit we are going to be
using some liquid foundation I'll take
you through all the steps so if you want
to see how to achieve this look keep on
watch hey guys the look is going to
start with our maybelline mineral power
liquid foundation my shade is medium one
this is another liquid foundation I like
as kind of a substitute in case I want a
little change from the Rimmel lasting
finish or Revlon Colorstay and this is
another good one in my opinion so I'm
just going to go ahead and use my
fingers to blend this all over just
trying to keep it simple you know in
case you don't have a stippling brush
you don't need one to get a good
foundation look next I'm going to do a
little bit of under eye concealer and
I'm going to use my Revlon Colorstay
under-eye concealer pen i guess and my
shade is light and this also has an SPF
in it so i just kind of like click it
out of this thing and then you could
apply it with a brush or your fingertips
whichever i just make sure i blend it
right up to this you know lower lashline
area really does make a difference the
next step is to set our foundation in
our concealer with a light powder i'm
going to use my jane be pure mineral
powder in colorless and it's the mineral
sheer powder it's not like the
straight-up mineral foundation so it is
really light it has a very light and
fine texture to it and that's going to
work for us that's kind of what we're
looking for is to keep the coverage
fairly light here
and I'm just swirling it all over my
face with a big fluffy kabuki brush so
we're keeping it nice and light now
we're going to do a little bit of
bronzing and since this is going to
shape up to be kind of a glam look I'm
going to use my physicians formula baked
bronze and I guess oh it's baked bronzer
and my shade is baked bronzer so it what
it is if you can see they're kind of
swirls in some more sparkly shimmery
colors but yet the bronzer itself is not
all that dark so I think it's going to
be good for our purposes here so I'm
just going to use that all over the face
just be aware it does have some sparkle
to it so this isn't maybe like an
everyday bronzer and this is what sort
of look that I'm doing is something that
you could maybe do for a special
occasion or a night out or something
like that and we're going to use a
couple of blush shades in this video the
first one is my Rimmel blush in peach
and it's just a nice warm peachy shade
not a lot of shimmer to it really and
that's going to be what goes on the
apples of our cheeks the next shape
we're going to use is our covergirl
cheekers blush and golden pink as sort
of a contour shade here I use this
almost daily as my contour color that's
why I'm about to run out and I just kind
of start back towards my ear a little
bit and just work it forward really just
contouring that area right there the
last step is optional but if you want to
do it you can set the whole look what
sort of a translucent powder I'm going
to use my maybelline mineral power
finishing veil in light this is usually
something I used to like set my under
eye concealer or on set this area after
I apply eyeliner there but I'm just
going to go over my whole face with that
for now and the shade i use is like okay
guys it's time to move on to this i look
and it's something
that's really not over the top but i'm
calling it kind of a glam I because it's
just a little more advanced I guess in
technique then my so my other team
tutorials have been and I still think
it's very teen appropriate maybe for a
night out you know just using a little
bit deeper colors and some kind of
sparkly shades too so this might not be
an everyday look necessarily or it could
be just depends on kind of what you do
but I want to go ahead and show you how
to do it okay first step we're going to
use our NYC jumbo pencil in iced mocha
and it's a nice and kind of shimmery
taupe shade and I'm going to just put
that all over my eyelid here
and I'm kind of working it up to my
crease just a little bit since this is a
little bit of a darker shade and I'm
going to just kind of blend that part
out with my finger just around that edge
then I'm going to take um an eyeshadow
kit that i think was my first ever a
shadow kit when i started doing makeup
it's the covergirl trio obviously I've
repurchased since then but it's this
covergirl trio and shimmering sands and
I'm going to use the center shade which
is just like sort of a shimmery
borderline gold shade and I'm just going
to Pat that over the ice mocha it's sort
of like a lighter version of the iced
mocha shade so I'm going to put that all
over the lid you can see this gives off
almost a dewy appearance but it really
is just kind of shimmery and sparkly and
nice okay okay so once you've done that
we're going to go for some elf mineral
shadow and that is a loose shadow and
the shade on using is called wild and if
you see there this has a lot of sparkle
to it a lot of shimmer it's a shimmery
sparkly brown and the sparkles are gold
so it kind of plays off this look pretty
nicely and I'm going to use my low
cornell one quarter brush so it's a very
small brush and you want to use see how
it's flat like that you've got to be
careful and use flat brushes like that
when you're dealing with loose shadows
because they can go everywhere you can't
use the same back and forth back and
forth motion you have to kind of Pat it
on and so you'll see that technique here
I'm going to Pat it on the outer portion
of my lid here and I'm going to Pat it
up to my crease and continue going
outward a little bit and we're going to
develop that outer V here sorry
okay we'll go back and blend out the
edge a little bit that's a little
different you can once you've got it on
your eye then you can deal with your
blending process but see how that's all
kind of diffused we'll get there just
continue sort of applying the color in
the general shape and then we'll blend
it out and so that's a nice it comes off
nice and warm with the gold any
undertones but still a nice brown shade
that we can work with and the beauty of
this kind of thing as you'll see here is
that this can really blend out quite a
bit so I'm going to use my Sephora
rounded crease rest just use any crease
brush you like and just I'm putting a
very very light touch on this and just
very lightly go around the edge and see
how we're getting more towards the look
we have on the other I there okay there
you go and so then the last step here is
to just do a highlight so I'm going to
go back to that shade in my covergirl
trio the shimmering sands this Center
color and I'm just going to use that
pretty much from our darker shadow all
the way up to the eyebrow and you can
just use your rounded crease brush again
if you want just kind of a fluffy brush
that can cover a lot of surface area
just go right up to the brown with that
and then we're going to go ahead and
continue just well we've got our shadow
handy here we're going to continue with
that on the lower lash line here we're
going to grab that jumbo pencil and this
is going to seem a little bulky to go in
here so if you want you can use like a
small liner brush and actually go like
that off of the UM this pencil and use
it like that but for me I'm just going
to be careful with it and just kind of
just dot it a little bit this is this is
still a pretty light pencil so I'm just
going to sort of apply that like so just
under there because I want to give my
powder something to cling to we're not
actually going in with a liner pencil
underneath this we're going to go back
to the elf shadow the mineral shadow in
wild dip in that low cornell brush once
again dip it in like straight down
because we only want to really utilize
the tip of this brush here for what
we're doing because we're wanting to
kind of just pack that shadow right on
top and we wind up with kind of a
shimmery look you the reason why I'd say
use only the tip is because there is
some sparkle in this and unless you want
fallout all over your cheek you don't
want to kind of go do the back and forth
thing
okay so we got that little bit more
depth down there and if you want to you
can go ahead and take like a concealer
brush in a some light powder and go
under that to kind of ensure that
everything stays put for our upper liner
I'm going to be using my femme Couture
liquid liner in brown if you're not
comfortable using a liquid liner you can
use a a brown pencil liner whatever
you're comfortable with the idea here is
just to make it a very fine line we want
to we want to really show off the shadow
that's on our lid not cover it up with a
big thick line of of eyeliner so I'm
keeping mine thin if you have a gel
liner that you'd like to use here that
would work too I just curled my lashes
real quick and then I'm going to take my
L'Oreal telescopic mascara and do a
quick coat of this on my lashes here
then I'm just going to use a small
amount on my lower lashes alright guys
that is look it's kind of a glam brown
eye and on the lips i used my L'Oreal
lipstick in Eva's caramel it's the Eva
Longoria signature lipstick it's kind of
a brownish tone with a little bit of red
to it and then over the top I used my
Jordana lip gloss and the shade is
lovely so I just thought that kind of
topped off the look going not quite so
nude but keeping with I mean this is a
look that you could do dressy if you had
like a banquet to go to or a date or
party or something like that I think
this look would really work well because
it's it's a slightly more dramatic but
not too over the top so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
