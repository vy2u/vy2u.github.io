first teen tutorial this is going to be
a series where I do different looks that
are definitely appropriate for teens I'm
going to go through the entire look not
just the eyes but also what I did for
the face give you some suggested
products but please keep in mind that
there are only suggestions if you have
other products that are similar in your
collection that you'd rather use by all
means go ahead and use them but I'd like
to also say that though these are team
tutorials they are I think appropriate
for anyone so if you you know are
interested in learning about a subtle
look that uses a little bit of light
pink and purple on the eyes and some
mineral makeup if you'd like to see that
I think it would be you know very
wearable for anyone but I wanted to give
teens something that they thought could
really work for them not be quite so
dramatic on the eyes for example and
just done used some products that are
definitely very affordable so thank you
guys so much for tuning in and I hope
you enjoy the site guys so the first
step in this look would be to moisturize
and prime your skin so just go ahead and
use the products of your choice and then
since we're going to be using mineral
makeup here I think mineral makeup is a
really um team friendly form of makeup
so since we're doing that and um we
really want to still get that flawless
look I'm going to do some concealer
first which is if I'm ever using mineral
makeup I would put on concealer first
and then go on with the makeup I'm going
to be using um Nick's concealer in a jar
and my color is light and it's just a
nice concealer comparable of an
affordable comparison to the Bobby Brown
um creamy concealer kit and basically
I'm just using a little concealer brush
and I'm going to put this around my eye
area in places where there's any um
redness or discoloration or dark circles
just simply applying some of this there
will bring some light to the area and
make us all look a little more awake and
another thing you want to think about
when you're using this concealer is if
you really want a good result go all the
way up to your lower lash line with it
it's amazing how much
you know there's a little bit of
discoloration right there right under
your eye and that can really detract
from a pretty I look so just make sure
you're getting the concealer all the way
up to you know right in there it'll
really help you and I think you'll
notice a difference when I started doing
that I noticed a big diff I'm going to
be applying my foundation and this is
maybelline mineral power foundations
available at your local drugstore my
color is sandy beige medium one and so
I'm just going to tap a little bit of
the product into the lid just like that
so you got about that much and then take
a kabuki brush and just kind of swirl it
in the product get make it so like the
product is getting into your brush and
then we're just going to swirl this all
over our face I like the coverage of
this mineral foundation i know i've
posted reviews in the past and i think
this is a little better coverage than
bare minerals and it doesn't make you
quite as i don't want to say shiny but
that's not really like that dewy finish
you know it's a little more matte so i'm
just going up right under my eyes sort
of functioning to apply my foundation
but also set that concealer we just did
and just continue to swirl it all over
your face until you've got the cover do
you want so after foundation I'm going
to put on some bronzer you can use
whatever bronzer you like I'm going to
just stick with the maybelline mineral
power line and this bronzer is in
sunkissed and you can use whatever
fluffy brush you like I'm just going to
use a kabuki brush that's a little
fluffier than the last one I used and
just swirl it in the product again just
putting it in the lid and just
concentrated on your forehead down your
nose your chin and your cheeks just
think where would the Sun hit me where
would I start to get a tan if I was out
in the Sun so I'm just gonna get the
product on and this is really easy to
apply the process goes by really quick
when you're using a nice big brush and
this gives you that little bit of
shimmer too but it's not really over the
top
all right now that you've got your
bronzer on we're gonna go for some blush
and I'm just gonna stick with the
mineral Bauer steps still I'm going to
use the mineral power blush and true
peach I really really like this color I
would just recommend for this look for
um you know the the eye look that's
going to be coming here even if you
don't have this exact product just go
with a peachy pink pink blush those
generally look good on just about
everyone so once again for this product
i'm just going to be swirling it in the
lid and applying it right there to my
cheeks such a pretty color alright guys
I went ahead and applied some lip color
it's revlon colorstay mineral lip glaze
in eternal blossom it's a light pink
shade and I also before I put that on I
lined with my eggs rimmel exaggerated
lip liner in East End snob totally
optional you wouldn't need to do that
it's just some a new product I got so I
wanted to test it out but anyway for the
eye as you can see we've got sort of a
light pink and a little bit of like
lilac look going on so it's really
wearable in light and I think it's a
good teen look so what we're going to
first do is put use our NYX jumbo pencil
in cottage cheese it's just like a white
creamy pencil that you can put all over
your lid to sort of make whatever color
you're putting on their stand out more
so like I said all these products are
suggest suggestions they're not you know
what you have to use if you have
something similar that you like then by
all means you can do it but otherwise
this is just may be given you some ideas
so after putting that all over my lid
I've assembled this little Sally girl
quad now these are each 99 cents apiece
or 89 cents if you have a Sally card and
basically they just hook together ok
they slide in like this and you can put
together you know however many you want
i made like this little quad and I've
got my colors that I have our eggplant
it's like a deep purple rose is a pretty
pink lilac like purple and then
champagne
is a frosty white shade so I'm going to
be using these colors to create this
look and I'm going to start off with
lilac a light purple shade and I'm gonna
grab my see my elf shadow brush just dip
into that it's got a little bit of
sparkle to it and we're just going to
put that all over the lid and this is
not going to be a super bold look
because that was sort of what's been
requested and you know among these teen
tutorials as you know not too crazy I
want something I can wear to class or
more where you know out to the mall or
whatever so that's kind of the range I'm
keeping this in so putting that all over
your lid then we're going to move on to
this champagne shade and using that same
brush just dip into it with the tip and
then I'm going to use this just on the
inner portion here of the I see how
we've got this like little shimmer
around the tear duct really makes you
look alive and awake so I'm just going
to do the same thing here okay next
we're going to move on to the eggplant
shade this is going to be our crease
color the darker purple use I'm going to
use my crease brush this is not my fine
crease brush this is one that's a little
step bigger from essence of beauty
that's another drugstore brand at CVS
and just lightly dip into that purple
and we're going to apply that to our
crease and we're not worrying about an
outer V we're just putting it on on our
crease just to deepen that up a little
bit and work it up you know if you've
got if you're like me and you've got
kind of a lot of space between your brow
and your I you know maybe work it up
just a little higher okay so we just got
a little depth there and if you can see
this in person you can see that it's
coming off pretty you know like a like a
very subtle purpley look so I like that
and then we're going to take this rose
shade and that's just
nice light pink with a little bit of
Sheen to it maybe you just use the same
brush and we're going to just go around
the border of that darker purple and
it's going to create a really pretty
effect here it's just going to like kind
of fade it right up you know so get some
on your brush and just go right along
the border of what you've done there
okay and then take a fluffier I shadow
brush and go back to the champagne and
this is going to be our highlight all
right so easy as that guys that's the
eyeshadow look now for eyeliner I'm
going to be using my Revlon Colorstay in
blackberry it's a pretty deep plum shade
and we're going to do about the on the
outer half of our upper lid here with
this it helps me sometimes to look down
into a mirror as I do this step
and so I'm just going about halfway in
and just really using kind of white
strokes with it not applying too much
pressure just a little bit there and go
right out to the edge and then we're
going to go to the bottom as well just
connect on the outer corner and then go
in just about halfway with that okay and
then to kind of set this we're going to
go back to our eggplant shade that dark
purple grab a liner brush and just top
off that color or that liner that you
put on this is going to help make it a
little more seamless around the corner
of your eye to just going over it like
we are right now and then if you want
some color kind of all the way
underneath like I do I'm just going to
lightly take that powder and blend it
right up to the liner so this is a
really soft look it's not a harsh harsh
liner look it's just kind of defining
your eye without being too you know over
the definitely need to curl our lashes
I'm going to be using my ELF eyelash
curler available for only a dollar at
islip space.com then for my mascara I'm
going to be using L'Oreal telescopic
mascara it's a rubber brush mascara
that's fairly new to me right now so I'm
still kind of deciding how well I like
it but obviously it's really really nice
and lengthen its look for this teen
tutorial I hope you like it i tried to
work in a little bit of color but still
keep it really subtle and appropriate
for you know whatever occasion you might
be taking part in so thank you so much
for watching and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
