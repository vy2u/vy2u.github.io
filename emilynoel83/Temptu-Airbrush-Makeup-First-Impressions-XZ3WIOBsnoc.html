I'm going to be going through a bunch of
different reviews today just talking
about different products I'm gonna try
to keep them somewhat short this one is
probably going to be a little longer
because I'm actually trying something
and giving you my first impression of it
and it is the temptu airbrush makeup
system this is something that's I know
is available at Sephora it's something I
have never tried before like in this
video this is the very first time I am
even picking up the little airbrush gun
here so I want to put it out there first
that I am NOT trying to instruct you on
how to use this particular product I may
do that down the road once I'm more
familiar with it but right now I mean
this is totally like my first shot at
this so don't be too hard on me
if I'm not doing it exactly right but
again I'm not really showing you how to
do it I'm just kind of going by the
instructions trying to do it the best I
can and giving you my first impression
of it so down the road I am gonna do
more videos with this talking about
maybe some different techniques as I
learn them but yeah just this is just my
first take it's gonna be the foundation
the blush and the highlight so besides
bronzer everything on my face is the
airbrush stuff so I'll show you how I
want about it some people online
everyone I am videotaping my first
experience with the airbrush makeup
system here you can see I've got
everything set up the setup was pretty
minimal in terms of putting it all
together I just had to plug this cord
back here and attach it to the airbrush
up here and then there was a there's an
air pod with my foundation in it and so
you have to kind of puncture the hole in
that so it can I guess work with the air
and actually be airbrushed on so setup
was really easy I didn't have a problem
with that and the instruction manual
walks you through it and there's also a
DVD that I watched the other day that
really took you through the application
but I'm just kind of reading it on paper
first to make sure I'm doing it the way
they say to do it
it says start toward the outside of your
face and move the airbrush in a quick in
a smooth quick circular pattern over
your entire face the circular pattern
gives you even coverage they say the
foundation will be hard to see as it's
coming out of the airbrush but as you
are applying it you will start to see
the coverage build and it said like the
trigger on this airbrush is what gives
you there's that little trigger and
that's going to give you more or less
control it's going to determine how much
product comes out and also there's a
dial back here that you turn to control
how much of the product comes out and
they said for foundation have it set
right in the middle there so that's what
I have because I'm doing foundation
right now so I'm going to turn it on I
guess turning the power on will make the
air come out
okay I'm feeling air
you can probably hear that now so yes
air is coming out and I'm going to pull
back on the trigger a little bit and
just kind of start working it on for the
very first time
moving it about four to six inches from
my face
I've been applying this all over my face
hopefully in the manner they say too I
can tell there is something on my face
but it feels extremely light and it is
really hard to tell like if this and as
it said the instructions it's hard to
tell like if it's getting under her face
like it's very sheer and very light if I
wanted to up the coverage a lot I guess
I could adjust that dial on the back but
for this first I'm gonna keep it where
they say - I feel like I've gone all
over my face but I'm going to try to do
a little bit more and just see if I can
notice anymore cuz I can still like I'm
kind of using my freckles as a gauge and
I'm still I guess going to probably be
able to see those through this but I'm
going to do a little more at location
right now you do feel like it has kind
of covered some places around my nose a
little bit it was sort of hard to figure
out with under-eye coverage just how
much I could get there how close I
should get so it'll definitely take some
practice to decide just how much is
enough and how long I need to spend
going all over my face and stuff like
got all the foundation on the next thing
I did just because I wanted more
coverage around my eye area I applied
some of my Maybelline Dream mousse
concealer there and once I did that I
got a lot more pleased I guess with the
way the makeup looked on my face I mean
that was kind of one area that I really
need to correct and then you know the
rest of the phase seems somewhat normal
then this set did not come with any
bronzer or anything so I just took some
of my own bronzer I used my Too Faced
chocolate Soleil and just kind of went
all over my face with that and by the
way my foundation shade is natural and
now I'm going to do blush which came
with this and it is in sheer berry so
I've gone through the process again to
connect this to the system and now I'm
going to turn it on
I guess I am ready to go so we will see
if we can see this showing up on my
cheek sill
I'm just doing circular motions
and I can see that for sure
I can definitely see that
yeah so there that is the blushes is
very visible the highlighter hooked up
and this shade is in bronze so I wonder
if maybe that can act as like a bronzer
as well there should be some shimmer to
this and it says the trick to the
perfect application of highlighter is to
apply in a C pattern from above your
brow bone and curve down to your cheek
bone repeat the process to build color
and shimmer the bolt the more you apply
the bolder the highlight and they say
you can apply it to your collarbone area
as well so let's turn it on and I'm
going to go instead of the just in the
middle with this I'm going to go a
little bit
for a little wider application because I
don't want to be too shimmery and I am
going to start up at the temple
until there's a little more glow to my
skin a little more shimmer they're just
kind of tried to apply it in the pattern
they said which was sort of from above
the brow under the or to the cheekbone I
guess so that's what I did guys I guess
this is my finished application I feel
like this would probably go a lot faster
if this wasn't my first time and I
noticed just in terms of assembling the
air pod and getting those hooked up that
went faster after the first one after
the initial foundation application since
the foundation is the closest thing to
your skin I guess that's kind of hot
maybe the hardest one to detect going on
but the blush you know you could
definitely tell that that was going on
and I might have even set that to a
lighter setting had I known but yeah
this is definitely something that's
going to take some practice something
I'm going to continue to work with and
work into my makeup routine
so there you go everyone much many more
videos to come on the attempt to
airbrush system I hope to learn more
learn more techniques and just you know
the best ways to use it as time goes on
I'm also definitely going to use this
when I go on the air for news because we
are expecting to go HD our station is in
the next few months so I think it's
going to be especially important to have
this knowledge of airbrush makeup just
because and and all of us at the station
we all do our own makeup so it's kind of
every man for themselves but I feel like
knowing how to use the airbrush is going
to help me because when you would think
air okay HD you're going to see a whole
lot more you would think well man I want
a lot of makeup I want really good
coverage but you're gonna see the makeup
more as well so that's why airbrush is
really caught on I think at a lot of TV
stations just because it is so sheer but
it does have coverage to it as well so
I'll see how that works I mean it's it's
really in the in the makeup industry in
the TV industry I've heard of a lot of
people saying you know oh a brush is
great and then others saying you know
traditional makeup is just as good when
I was
that's like different people on Twitter
like I Bobbi Brown had her makeup team
answers questions and they said you know
using traditional makeup is just fine
for HD and then others have said
airbrush so I will definitely be doing
many more in depths of in-depth reviews
on the airbrush versus traditional
makeup for TV if you're interested in
that so thanks so much stay tuned for
more videos you can head to my blog
beauty broadcast net for a full rundown
of the videos I'm planning for today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
