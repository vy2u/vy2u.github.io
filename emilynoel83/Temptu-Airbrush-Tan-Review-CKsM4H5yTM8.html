this video this is gonna be all about a
method of sunless tanning that might be
new to many of you and it's through
using the temptu airbrush systems so
there's actually a new three-step
process that they've come out with for
this that the company did send me these
samples to try and so I'm going to be
passing along my honest review to you
about how I like them and so this video
is going to be basically number one what
is this product number two a video
tutorial of exactly how it works
number three what I think of it and then
finally I'll be basically just kind of
summing up my overall impressions of
temp2
I know probably a year or so ago I shot
a video my very first time ever like
applying the temptu foundation and that
kind of thing so this is sort of like a
overall reaction you know how old do I
think it goes on how do I like the
overall finish and things like that
because I have gotten some follow-up
questions about them first off starting
with this system I mentioned it's a
3-step system it can be purchased all
together or separately and I've got to
say the prices are I mean rather high
you know compared to what you might
spend on a typical sunless tanner for
the end you got to keep in mind you
can't just use these things on your face
you have to also have the temptu unit
the compressor and the airbrush you know
what I mean so that's of course an added
expense on top of this so I just want to
put that out there that's what this runs
now the first thing that you do is the
prep and this is designed to smooth out
your skin to act as an exfoliant
actually on your skin which I'm guessing
it's through the chemicals and the
products that are in here but act to
exfoliate and smooth out your skin and
give you that even canvas before doing
your sunless
Tanning so you will definitely see how
that goes on this is colorless and it
has no real scent to it either you feel
a very cool effect on your face when you
put it on then you've got the sunless
tanner and this is a gradual tanner and
this has no tint to it so when it goes
on it goes on without any color at all
over the course of a couple of hours it
builds to be the color you will have and
that color will last for 48 hours now if
you're doing it every day it's gonna
obviously overlap and you're gonna have
that tan long final step is going to be
a bronzer a lot of times sunless tanners
have the bronzer built in this is
actually going to be a separate step
with this product so before I get to my
actual review of this product I do want
to show you exactly how it works so here
you go now this is what one of the air
pumps looks like so it's got this cap on
there which is really easy to remove and
then you can see this is the part that's
going to attach to your airbrush with
the prep step and the sunless tanner
step there's actually a little piece
there that you open up and that is going
to attach right on to the airbrush so
the product can come out in other Tim to
products it'll just be a little area
that you poked through with a stopper
and it doesn't continue to have the plug
on there but these two products I guess
for the nature of what the product is
has to have that little stopper on there
you've got that little stopper removed
out of the way so the airbrush can
attach you just simply attach it just
like this and you'll hear it kind of
snap forward like that then you can turn
the unit on you can hear the gist airs
coming out right now and
I adjust it I just have it set right in
the middle so I'm gonna pull back on
this trigger I can feel the coolness of
the product coming out on my face and
I'm just working in circular motions
and there we go so you're supposed to
let about half a minute to a minute has
to let the tan prep sink in and then if
there's any excess you just blot it off
with the tips we've got the unit off I
can just press this button here to kind
of eject the tan prep then the next step
is the sunless tanner itself so I would
shake these up I'm not even sure if
you're really supposed to you're gonna
find once you take the cap off there is
another one of those little plugs that
you kind of got to figure out what to do
with before you tan because if that plug
is not off it won't and they recommend
doing kind of small circles working from
the outside of your face in so that's
what I'm going to do and you gotta keep
in mind you don't need to linger on this
for a long time once it's on it's on the
first time I did it I felt like I kept
going over it too much and that's not
what you want to do so you've got to
really get a feel for where is it
hitting my face and if I've already been
over that area I don't need to go over
it again so knowing that you're stoked
going from outside in kind of helps you
keep track so I'm going to start up on
my forehead I can feel the product
coming out small circular motions all
the way around going just under the
jawline and back up now I'm going a
little bit more in
there you go it says I need to let this
wait five to 10 minutes before applying
any serums lotions moisturizers or
makeup and if you got any of the sunless
tanner on your hands you do need to wash
your hand you want to get the whole kit
you get a bronzer as a separate step you
could go ahead and put it on right now
you know right after you do your sunless
tanner and you've waited just a little
bit or you could go ahead and do your
foundation and then just use this
bronzer as another step within your
makeup routine so it's up to you even if
I go ahead and put the bronzer on now I
would treat this just kind of like any
other sunless tanner that includes
bronzer on my face you know I let it dry
for a bit and then I go ahead and do my
makeup over it I just kind of ingest my
makeup for the fact that my skin is
already a bit darker so and another note
that I want to make is when you're doing
the sunless tanner step the prep step is
said to actually act as a bit of an
exfoliant on your skin so they say if
you want to get a deep dark tan don't
use the prep step every single time like
use it when you start the routine and if
I were going to use this throughout the
rest of the week I wouldn't use the prep
step anymore so if the color could
develop a little bit more that makes
sense so anyway I'm going to shake up my
bronzer here
in just circular motions all around this
one has kind of a smell to it so you can
kind of smell kind of a fresh scent with
this product
and I just swirl it all the way around
my things may be concentrated a little
bit more in areas where the Sun might
naturally hit but it's very very subtle
this bronzer is just I mean you can tell
by the color here it's this but it's
coming out extremely diffused and if I
could go more obviously you can make
more come out of the airbrush but just
for a light dusting dusting light spray
of the airbrush this is what you get so
overall impressions of this product
first off the first thing that kind of
occurs to me is I think about this is
the prize it worth the price tag that's
on it and does it function better than
other sunless tanners I already have for
a lower cost and I've got to say that I
actually prefer probably my alpha-beta
globe as from dr. Dennis gross ivory
purchased those I also like using the
bare minerals botan all over my face I'm
not uh it's not that the quality of this
tan is is bad but because I think that
it does give you a nice look I feel like
I've got a nice natural glow now for
doing one application here late I do
think it looks nice and I'm not upset
with the way it goes on but one thing
that I think will make this could make
it more user friendly is if the airbrush
sunless tanner actually had that bronzer
in it instead of being two separate
steps you know what I mean because then
you could see where it goes because it's
one thing when you put sunless tanner on
your face I think a lot of people are a
little hesitant to do that anyway
because they're like it's on my face you
know if it's on you know the back of my
arm I can figure out a way to hide it I
can put on long sleeves you know but if
it's on my face it's gonna show and it's
I feel like I'm you're so used to
putting lotions and things like that
that are a sunless tanner on my face and
I could feel exactly where it's going
and in most cases it's tinted so I can
see it too
but with this not only is it an airbrush
that's being held out from your face and
then being sunless hand on you but it
doesn't show up you know so it's a
challenge and the first time I used it I
actually got too much on I got
no streaking on my forehead but since
then I've realized that you go outside
in in circular motions like I
demonstrated and it works much better
haven't had any issues with that sense
think it's a pretty look and I'm I mean
it's it's a natural look too real plus -
this is how fast it works like you saw I
mean in real time it took no time at all
for me to get this on my face so speed
wise that was nice there wasn't a long
waiting period before you could go ahead
and put your other makeup on stuff so
that was really nice and I think if you
already enjoy temptu or airbrush makeup
and you have the temptu unit already and
you just think man you know I love doing
my foundation with temptu I want to do
my sunless tanner with temptu then go
for it you know I think you will enjoy
this the quality of this product is nice
I also want to share what I think you
know after you having used temptu
airbrush foundation for some time I want
to share what I think about that you
guys know I do news in high definition
five days a week so I am under some very
bright lights I want great coverage from
my makeup and I feel like with the
temptu foundation it is the sheerest
possible foundation I feel like I still
can achieve great coverage with liquid
foundations and sometimes even better
coverage if I'm having a bad skin day if
I'm having some kind of blotch on my
skin or a blemish or something like that
I'm going to feel more confident in
picking up my liquid foundation and
applying that with a brush or a sponge
than I am with this particular unit just
because it is so sheer I'm having a
pretty good skin day right now and that
sheer level of coverage is just about
perfect and I love it for summertime too
because it's so lightweight and I'm a
big advocate of light layers of
foundation in the summer because it does
last longer so um you know if you
generally want light all the time on
your foundation I think you're gonna
like it it does take some getting used
to there's a learning curve with this
this isn't just you know oh I can figure
out how to put a liquid foundation on my
face you know remember you know put it
up on whole over this takes some getting
used to because you're not touching your
face so it's got a level of you know it
it's sanitary it's very sanitary for
that purpose because you're not touching
it and it's coming straight from the
airbrush every time I would say what I
like best in terms of makeup application
from the airbrush I love the way the
blush and the highlights apply I have
the airbrush blush on right now and I'm
loving the glow it's giving me I also
have the highlight on right around here
and I actually went kind of up on to the
brow bone kind of right in there so I
love the glow it's a fresh natural glow
that is beautiful in the summer time and
beautiful if you've got pretty decent
skin but if you've got a lot of problems
to cover you might not be as satisfied
with the coverage that it gives your
skin so I hope that kind of lays it out
for you guys as far as what I think
about temptu as a whole what I think
about the new sunless tanning system I
just I want to be as honest as I can be
and that's what you expect from me so
thank you very much for watching and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
