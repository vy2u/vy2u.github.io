here I'm gonna be sharing a Thanksgiving
look with you today or really a look
that I think would be appropriate for
any sort of family gathering and I was
thinking I wanted to look that would be
long wearing you know good coverage and
look nice and pictures but also
something that to see it in person and
being face to face with a lot of people
would look kind of natural definitely
working in some berry with this look and
I also loved doing kind of a lighter
take on a deep berry lip so I'll show
you how I did that with this video so
thanks in advance for spending a little
time with me today and I hope you
enjoyed this look starting out with my
ELF poreless face primer this was
something I mentioned in the elf
products worth trying video and I really
in liking this primer a lot I feel like
it's good for adding you know just a
little bit of hydration to the skin
which is kind of rare with this kind of
primer but it also just makes the whole
texture of my skin very silky soft and
then for Thanksgiving I'm going to want
good coverage in my foundation I want
something that's going to look good in
pictures but you're gonna be seeing a
lot of people in person so you want it
to look natural on the skin and you want
to have good staying power so you're not
worrying about touching up so Rimmel
lasting finish is the one that kind of
fits that criteria for me right now and
just in terms of the shade in my
collection that's really suiting my skin
tone soft beige is perfect at the moment
so as I do I kind of patched this around
on my skin real quick
and I'm kind of returning to my love for
flat top brushes for buffing and
Foundation this one's from Sonia Kashuk
it's the number four it's not super big
but it does do a really nice job of
blending in the foundation so I'm just
gonna buff that in all over and where I
want a little bit better coverage I'm
not gonna do so much buffing I'll do
more kind of like a stipple or tap over
the skin like around the under eye oh
man I can still see a sheet mark or ad
mark from my pillow case of sleep and
hard which is good because I was not
sleeping her in the night before then I
need to do a little brightening around
the under eyes so I'm going to use my
pixie correction concentrate the one
with the green cap like that this is
just a really nice peachy tone corrector
so you want to use this over the areas
where you've got like the bluish tone
discoloration or you know age spots
sunspots it works well on top of that
type of thing also but I kind of use
interchangeably benefit erase paste my
Bobbi Brown corrector in bisque any of
those seem to do a similar job just
slightly different consistencies and
honestly when I'm in kind of a hurry I
just throw that on and then I put my
skin tone concealer directly on top of
that and I find that the combination of
the two just really gives the coverage
that I'm after and I just blend them all
together so I'm gonna use my Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer that I mentioned in
my whole this is in the shade light and
I'm not gonna use a ton of this since
the corrector really is pretty good
coverage wise but just a few little dots
around here and I need a little coverage
around the nose and then continuing to
experiment with more Sonia Kashuk
brushes this is the number two and I
believe it's actually like an eye
blender type brush but I actually really
think it's great for concealer so I'm
just tapping over where I applied the
product here oh thank you concealer
instantly noticing so much more
brightness
though I kind of maintain the coverage
just by tapping this around the nose
well and then I'm just gonna do a little
light under eye setting powder I'm
actually using this powder from my Sonia
Kashuk hidden agenda compact I guess I
could have used that concealer if I was
thinking but just dabbing that around
this is my own stash box brush number
ten and much like with that Sonia Kashuk
brush if you've got like oversized eye
brushes try them for your concealer or
your under eye setting powder chances
are they could be a perfect size for you
there if you feel like they're too large
for eyeshadow and then I'm just gonna
lightly set all over the face with my
L'Oreal True Match powder in buff beige
elf Studio complexion brush I've been
reaching for this powder all the dang
time since I purchased it it's just I
don't know it's just a great all-purpose
lightweight powder it's nice for
touch-ups as well but just to set your
foundation and this foundation doesn't
need a whole heck of a lot of help but
it's just a quality powder what can I
say I love it so liking the look but I'm
feeling very flat and matte all over my
face so I'm going to bring in a little
bit of a glowy bronzer this is two-faced
Sun bunny to sides you know you can use
both sides if you want to I'm just gonna
lightly take this around my forehead and
I'm just taking a teeny bit of that
darker side and just kind of taking it
right there under the cheekbone for a
soft contour
and then while I'm on the two-faced
train I'm gonna use my pink leopard this
is actually a bronzer but I think it's a
blush definitely no it's called blushing
bronzer if I want to be accurate and I
do feel like this gives kind of rosy
bronzed glow kind of a neutral type
blush but you can definitely see that
hint of rosiness coming through it so
it's perfect for this kind of a look
where we're going to go with a darker
lip
now when I was doing my haul video on
brands I haven't tried before I had
mentioned a couple of Charlotte Tilbury
lipsticks one was the Bond girl shade
which I love the other is Glastonbury
and this is that one that has the
potential to be very very deep and dark
and a lot of you said I want to see that
on so this is one of the matte lipsticks
I think this is a great formula and I am
actually going to apply a little bit of
this with a lip brush and I'm doing this
now because I think it kind of helps set
the tone for the eye look but these feel
so velvety on the lips and you know a
little bit drier obviously than a cream
lipstick since they are matte but a very
lightweight easy to wear matte and I
wouldn't normally consider wearing a
dark lip to a big eating fest but
honestly the staying power on this is
really good I'm wearing it a little bit
lighter you know I'm not really putting
it full on thick color and it's matte
not shiny so it really does kind of
adhere to the lips I don't worry about
it drifting outside the lip line the
shade is so beautiful I love the amount
of purple in this berry shade it makes
it different from a lot of the reddish
berries that I own which are the vast
majority of the excuse me concealed burb
there's another Thanksgiving tip by the
way how to burp in a subtle way I am
spending a long time on this but I'm
enjoying every moment of it this is a
pleasure to put on but I am keeping it
just a little lighter in the center of
the lower lip but I'm loving this effect
deeper shades worn sheer it's a
beautiful look on the lips then I'm just
gonna do a bit of a brow fill in with my
Maybelline what is this called brow
satin the labels totally wearing off I'm
just using the pencil side here to even
things out a bit
and then the other end is a little like
sponge tip that goes into some powder I
just tend to add a little bit of powder
toward the outside part of the brow not
too much I love this brow product though
I feel like this is one of those brown
things that I'm going to completely use
up and speaking of used up I feel like
my NYX control-freak brow gel is on its
last legs and I found that I had one of
these elf wet bloss lash and brow so I
think either side you could pretty much
use for your brow I'm not doing a whole
lot of clear mascara on the lashes these
days but this is actually a quality
little clear gel if you need one it's
only two bucks doesn't have quite as
much hold as my control freak but it'll
do I wonder if this amount of lip color
would even transfer off on my mug you
know hardly at all
just barely transfers off that's nice to
know too for eyes doing a little primer
here little sample size Urban Decay
primer potion because I haven't gotten
my Milani repurchased yet sometimes when
I'm editing I look back on my like
tutorials and like wow during the
tutorial you sounded kind of tired and
then I'm thinking well you've probably
only had a few sips of coffee so far and
are going on about five hours of sleep
so makes sense right I'm also going to
take this opportunity to apply a little
bit of a light shade to my lower inner
rim this is my Milani almond cream I
feel like they're looking especially
pink today and I really don't want my
eyes to be too crazy intense I say that
before I start well see how it ends up
but I knew I wanted to pull in my visor
dark matte palette because you know the
berry shades but I also want something a
little lighter as well and I just have
my it cosmetics the naturally pretty
travel palette must haves right here so
what I think I'll do is just use a
little bit of this lightest shade and
just kind of whoa man I just totally
stamped that whole palette on my black
pants I'm gonna take a picture of this
so you can see yep that happened heck
I'm gonna snap
that I don't want anybody to take
offence but I don't wear my nice black
pants for these occasions nobody sees
them anyway right so okay that light
shade who going all over the lid this is
just my Sonia Kashuk medium shadow brush
that I'm using here and then for just a
light crease color I'm going to use this
shade called inspire and my e25 a nice
mauve crease color don't mind if I do
then I'm using my little makeup Academy
crease brush I got this from CVS and I
loved it and this shade was my plan
right here and I'm just gonna put that
shade here in the crease and just deepen
up the berry you know kind of picturing
a hint of winged liner coming up under
this so I think this will look nice
guess the lighter application you do
with this kind of a shade the more
reddish tone comes out of it so just
keep that in mind now just above that
I'm gonna go crazy with a little bit of
this orange actually I'm not gonna go
crazy I'm just gonna use it lightly just
right over the border a little bit of
some orange shades and dang it's hard to
go settle with that I'm blending over it
now with a bear brush over here just up
over the border of the berry but I'm
gonna use this nice little in-betweener
brush my ELF blending brush go back to
my light shade here and just kind of
place this up under the brow make it a
little blended border between that and
the orange I'm gonna do a little bit of
Milani or Jordana color Envy liquid
liner this is in black envy this is the
shade I purchased like three of its so
annoying like at first they were selling
this in Walgreens and so they sucked me
in got me to love the product and then
when I want more no more Walgreens I got
to go to Jordana cosmetics calm so
little wing here just kind of want it to
fall in line with the shape of the
shadow
do you ever take a picture of your
eyeshadow in progress looking down and
see like okay is everything blended
properly like how does that all come
together just a little better blend in
the crease right over here and then
we're gonna curl the lashes just had a
slight little panic there when I
couldn't find my super sizer I loved my
covergirl super sizer mascara apply that
here to the upper lashes ahh love this
mascara this is a fresh tube this is one
of those mascaras that I like right off
the bat you know there are a lot that
just get a little bit better with time
you know this is one where it's good the
whole way through Oh running out of
memory card space lovely I guess that's
the price you pay for being a video
shooting machine
I really could be happy with just the
coat of mascara there but because I want
to be fancy I'm gonna put on lashes I
got a fresh set of my Coco - oh ones
which I love they're a great kind of
everyday lash so I'm gonna put those on
and then join you with the finished look
all right now we got lashes on I did do
a little bit of lower lash mascara just
to kind of balance things out there but
I'm really happy with the finished look
and this is my first time doing any sort
of curl on my shorter hair I used my
wand my Remington T Studio pearl the
smaller of the two ones that I have and
just kind of went all over I don't know
I think it works and my little sweater
by the way it's a longer sweater so it
works great with leggings and it's got
these buttons down the sleeve I've had
this for a few years and I have loved it
so much but I hope you guys like this
look I hope you all have a wonderful
Thanksgiving and safe travels if your
gonna be going somewhere I love you guys
so much I'm so thankful for your
viewership and I will see you again soon
