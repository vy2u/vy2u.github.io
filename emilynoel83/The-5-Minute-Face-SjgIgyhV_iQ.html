joining us for this video now Tyler and
I have just woken up
so we're a bit groggy I am very tired
actually and so this is gonna be
interesting because we are creating a
five-minute face here in this video and
this is a day when I might actually take
a little extra time because I feel like
my eyes this look kind of tired and you
know whatever but we are going to
recreate this look this is out of the
book that I recently got it's by
Carmindy and she is the makeup artist
for TLC's What Not to Wear I don't know
if you've ever seen that that's one of
Tyler's favorite oh it's not ok but she
gives a lot of different makeup tips in
here just a lot of basic application
tips and she'll break down some looks
that might seem more complicated to you
but she'll kind of share an easy way to
do them she even gets gives product
suggestions with a which I believe I
will talk about in another video but the
basis for this book is the 5-minute plan
and she actually outlines this right
down to the second guys like between one
zero and one minute and you know one in
1:20 and right one through five so I
thought you know what better way to know
if I'm actually doing this right then
having Tyler with his trusty stopwatch
time me out through every step tell me
when to move on and basically we're
gonna see if this is a look that I would
really want to use on a regular basis
you know I mean I've got work to do
like work to do I've got work at it on a
morning TV station so I mean I'm in
front of cameras and what I even want to
use this for that purpose so yeah I'm a
little skeptical I must say but I have
read through her breakdown of each step
and she has some different little
suggestions for how you do things so I'm
going to be following that and be where
I'm at now might not be describing
everything as much as I normally do
because I've got a stay on task here so
Tyler I'm gonna hand over the book to
you I'm going to get my foundation in
hand since that is step 1 I've already
put my moisturizer on I guess that was
not
in the 5-minute plan and all right let's
get started when you go okay what is
this step Tyler smooth on foundation or
tinted moisturizer and how long do I
have you have a minute okay I'm using my
all may smart shade it's supposed to
adjust to your skin I'm gonna have a
review comparing shade adjusting
foundations in the future okay how much
my dad did okay awesome
I'm doing good make sure to get it
around my eyes gosh 20 seconds left
I appreciate the countdown by the letter
obviously we don't all have anybody
counting us down but 10 seconds you know
it like it'll help for the purpose of
this is it happens all right I got that
all right that concealer under your eyes
with your ring finger how long do I have
for this for weeks only 20 seconds I'm
using this smart shade concealer to with
my ring finger under my eyes oh my gosh
I feel like this is holy cow I normally
this is one step that I take a lot
longer on mm-hmm
spot conceal any redness from the tiny
veins or breakouts you have about 35
second
that would be just around my nose pretty
much I have some little visible veins
okay I'm not gonna move on though until
it's time to move on to the next step
even if I'm a little ahead okay ten
seconds he'll use powder to set your
makeup use powder to set yeah you'll
have 20 seconds to do that
okay I'm using my Mary Kay loose powder
beige one and Carmindy suggested using a
blush brush to do this step and only
applying the powder like under the eyes
around the nose and anywhere you just
might get oily things okay sweet bone
highlighter thirty Seconds highlighter
she had three places she said this
should go I'm using my Physicians
Formula shimmer strips and Waikiki strip
she said on the cheekbones so I'm just
using the lighter part was that Eon yeah
and also under the brows ten seconds
she said use a shadow brush to get it
right in the inner corners of your eyes
okay apply blush okay I'm using my
Milani minerals in my Thai blush brush
using Sigma brushes today by the way you
got five seconds left apples of cheeks
bingo
line your lines for how long go ahead
within a minute for this oh geez oh gosh
I can't find the line okay Maybelline
define a line she said to line your top
lash line and smudge it with a q-tip and
then use that q-tip the residue that's
on it on your bottom lash line that
seems like a lot for a minute how much
time do we have
you have 30 seconds you might need to
talk a little louder so they can 36
thank you okay so I've got both top lash
lines line she says take a q-tip smudge
15 seconds
10 seconds I'm gonna need like ten four
three two one time brush on mascara did
she say to curl just says brush no okay
45 seconds MA baleen colossal I hate not
curling my lashes I'm not fan that step
all right you got five minutes
god make some sacrifices well this is it
I mean curling earlier lashes IRA and I
read in the description now that I think
about she did not say to curl ten
seconds and she said don't put it on
your bottom lash line just more time
left dealing with okay slip on lip color
and you have ten second five three two
one alright five-minute face time to
assess there we go Oh Tyler thank you so
much for tightening me out on that
um alright basically this is a lot
different from what I would normally do
I do feel like um I feel like I'm
presentable I feel like I would go to
the grocery store like this it was odd
not using any eyeshadow did you notice
how there wasn't an eyeshadow stem there
I I thought there was ample time for the
foundation I thought there was not quite
as much time as I would normally take on
the under eye concealer but obviously
five-minute face you know you're gonna
have to cut it down a little bit I kind
of liked her eyeliner technique although
I felt like I did it kind of sloppy like
I don't know if you guys can see but
like I put on the liner and then she
said to smudge it out with a q-tip and
then use the q-tip to kind of smudge it
down under
so um I don't know I didn't do anything
to my eyebrows I didn't I usually fill
in like a little scar that I have there
I didn't get to do that I used a
lipstick the lipstick I have on is
Maybelline 201 and sweet honey and
that's kind of like gives a little more
color to your face the highlighter step
before the blush was different for me I
would normally do that as a last step
but that's okay she had like maybe as
opposed to doing the eye shadow she said
put the highlighter right up here and in
here um I guess that helps a little bit
but overall I mean yeah I could do this
on a day that I was I was rushing around
but I would not do this for for news I
feel like it's just - I I couldn't be
I'm much more careful about that you're
obviously gonna be careful when you have
you know thousands of people viewing you
every day but if I like overslept for
the for a news day I think I can do this
and I think I could pull it off but the
thing is is everybody being able to kind
of keep themselves down to those
benchmarks on the time that's kind of
hard if you don't have somebody there
timing you but what do you think Tyler
what do you think about the five-minute
face mm-hmm I could be hard to do if I
wasn't there telling you the deadlines
yeah yeah I don't know if I could have
stuck to it as well but um overall yeah
I think this is doable and I again the
book would you hold that up for us Tyler
that is the five-minute face by Carmindy
I got this at my local Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
for $16.99 and I'm still kind of reading
through it and figuring out some four
techniques and strategies I was going
there the other day and Tyler and I were
there and I'm like what another Bobby
Brown book but I couldn't find one and
so I had to go with the new makeup
artist this time but she seems like
she's got some really sound techniques
and some interesting strategies for just
quick everyday makeup so I hope you guys
like this video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
