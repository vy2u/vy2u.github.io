joining us for this video now Tyler and
I have just woken up so we're a bit
groggy I'm I am very tired actually and
so this is going to be interesting
because we are creating a five-minute
face here in this video and this is a
day when I might actually take a little
extra time because I feel like my eyes
this look kind of tired and you know
whatever but we are going to recreate
this look this is out of the book that I
recently got its by car Mindy and she is
the makeup artist for TLC's What Not to
Wear I don't know if you've ever seen
that that's one of Tyler's favorite oh
it's not okay um but she gives a lot of
different makeup tips in here just a lot
of basic application tips and she'll
break down some looks that might seem
more complicated to you but she'll kind
of share an easy way to do them she even
gets gives product suggestions with a
which I believe I will talk about in
another video but the basis for this
book is the five-minute plan and she
actually outlines this right down to the
second guys like between 10 and one
minute and you know one in 120 and write
one through five so I thought um you
know what better way to know if I'm
actually doing this right then having
Tyler with his trusty stopwatch time me
out through every step tell me when to
move on and basically we're going to see
if this is a look that I would really
want to use on a regular basis you know
I mean I've got work to do like work to
do I've got work at a on a morning TV
station so I mean I'm in front of
cameras and what I even want to use this
for that purpose so um yeah I'm a little
skeptical i must say but i have read
through her breakdown of each step and
she has some different little
suggestions for how you do things so i'm
going to be following that and be where
i might might not be describing
everything as much as I normally do
because I've gotta stay on task here so
Tyler I'm gonna hand over the book to
you I'm going to get my foundation in
hands since that is step 1 i've already
put my moisturizer on I guess that was
not included in the five-minute plan and
all right let's
get started right I'll go when you go
okay what is this step Tyler smooth on
foundation or tinted moisturizer and how
long do I have you have a minute okay
i'm using my um a smart shade it's
supposed to adjust to your skin I'm
gonna have a review comparing shade
adjusting foundations in the future okay
how much my dad did a 30 second okay
awesome i'm doing good making sure to
get it around my eyes gosh 20 seconds
left I appreciate the countdown by the
letter obviously we don't all have
anybody counting us down but 10 seconds
you know it like it'll help for the
purpose of this is it hello seconds all
right I got that all right Pat concealer
under your eyes with your ring finger
how long do I have for this week sir
only 20 seconds I'm using the smart
shade concealer to with my ring finger
under my eyes oh my gosh I feel like
this is closer holy cow i normally this
is one step that I take a lot longer on
move on spot conceal any redness from
the tiny veins or breakouts you have
about 35 sec um okay I would be just
around my nose pretty much I have some a
little visible veins right around there
okay I'm not gonna move on though until
it's time to move on to the next step
even if I'm a little head okay in 10
seconds he'll you use powder to set your
makeup just powder to set yeah you'll
have 20 seconds to do that
okay i'm using my mary kay loose powder
beige one and Carmindy suggested using a
blush brush to do this step and only
applying the powder like under the eyes
around the nose and anywhere you just
might get oily five seconds okay sweep
on highlighter 30 seconds highlighter
she had three places she said this
should go i'm using my physicians
formula of shimmer strips and waikiki
strip she said on the cheekbones so i'm
just using a lighter part was that he on
yeah and also under the brows 10 seconds
she said use a shadow brush to get it
right in the inner corners of your eyes
ok apply blush black no but 30 seconds
20 seconds to do it ok i'm using my
Milani minerals in my tie blush brush
using Sigma brushes today by the way
better than else we got five seconds
left apples of cheeks bingo line your
liners for how long go ahead within a
minute for this oh geez no 50 seconds oh
gosh I can't find the line ok Maybelline
define a line she said to line your top
lash line and smudge it with a q-tip and
then use that q-tip the residue that's
on it on your bottom lash line that
seems like a lot for a minute how much
time do we have you have 30 seconds you
might need to talk a little louder so
they can gain 36 thank you hmm ok so
I've got both top lash lines line she
says take a q-tip smudge 15 seconds
ten seconds I'm gonna need like 10
Michigan count four three two one time
brush on mascara did she say to curl
this says pressure okay 45 seconds
maybelline colossal I hate not curling
my lashes I'm not fan in that step but
alright hey you got five minutes you got
to make some sacrifice God make some
sacrifices well this is I mean curling
early lashes IRA and I read in the
description now that i think about she
did not say to curl 10 seconds and she
said don't put it on your bottom lash
line just more time left dealing with
okay now slip on lip color and you have
ten seconds nine eight seven seven five
three two one all right five-minute face
time to assess there we go Oh Tyler
thank you so much for timing me out on
that um all right basically um this is a
lot different from what I would normally
do i do feel like um I feel like I'm
Prince edible I feel like I would go to
the grocery store like this um it was
odd not using any eyeshadow did you
notice how there wasn't an eyeshadow
Stender and I did not take notice I I
thought there was ample time for the
foundation I thought there was not quite
as much time as I would normally take on
the under eye concealer but obviously
five-minute face you know you're gonna
have to cut it down a little bit um I
kind of liked her eyeliner technique
although I felt like I did it kind of
sloppy like I don't know if you guys can
see but like I put on the liner and then
she said to smudge it out with a q-tip
and then use the q-tip to kind of smudge
it down underneath so
I don't know I didn't do anything to my
eyebrows I didn't I usually fill in like
a little scar that I have there I didn't
get to do that um I used a lipstick the
lipstick i have on is Maybelline 201 and
sweet honey and that's kind of like
gives a little more color to your face
the highlighter step before the blush
was different for me I would normally do
that as a last step but that's okay she
had like maybe as opposed to doing the
eyeshadow she said put the highlighter
right up here and in here um I guess
that helps a little bit um but overall I
mean yeah i could do this on a day that
i was i was rushing around but i would
not do this for 4 News um I feel like
it's just too I couldn't be I'm much
more careful about that you're obviously
gonna be careful when you have you know
thousands of people viewing you every
day um but if I like overslept for the
for a news day I think I can do this and
I think I could pull it off um but the
thing is is everybody being able to kind
of keep themselves down to those
benchmarks on the time that's kind of
hard if you don't have somebody there
time you but what do you think Tyler
what do you think about the five-minute
face mm-hmm they could be hard to do if
I was in there telling you the deadlines
yeah yeah I don't know if I could have
stuck to it as well but um overall yeah
I think this is doable and I again the
book would you hold that up for us Tyler
recover their that is um the five-minute
face by Carmindy I got this at my local
barnes &amp;amp; noble for 1699 and I'm still
kind of reading through it and figuring
out some for techniques and strategies
um I was going there the other day Tyler
and I were there and I'm like I want
another bobby brown book but I couldn't
find one and so I had to go with the new
makeup artist this time but she seems
like she's got some really sound
techniques and some interesting
strategies for just quick everyday
makeup so I hope you guys like this
video and have a great day I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
