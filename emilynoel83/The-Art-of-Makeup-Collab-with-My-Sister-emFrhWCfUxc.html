kind of video today and I'm really
excited about it it's a collaboration
with my sister my sister's name is Kelly
she has a channel called art food Kitty
here on YouTube he is a phenomenal
award-winning watercolor artist to the
rest of the world she has Kelly to be
she is pup that has been my big name
high fat for her for a long long time
has been doing some great speed painting
videos on her channel where she actually
will take an eye or the lips and paint
it right there for you but do it in a
lot less time than it actually took her
so cuz she's sped it up on video we
thought it might be kind of fun to
combine our worlds of makeup and art and
so I would do a video you know doing my
makeup it's gonna be just kind of sped
through kind of like the format she does
for her videos and then she will do a
watercolor portrait of my finished face
from a picture that I take I hope after
you watch this little makeup run-through
of you'll check out her video and see
the different techniques it takes to
paint a face but actually to paint it on
pay so here we go starting out with
Tarte smart Kuja miracle foundation just
patching it all over the skin and then
really blending it out with my Sigma f80
brush then I'm using Estee Lauder Double
Wear concealer in areas where I need
more coverage like the under eyes and a
blemish here and there then for some
real brightness I'm using Maybelline
instant age rewind using that on areas
but I really want to kind of pop from
the face like the cheekbones top of the
nose Center the forehead
and then I'm setting the undereyes with
bare minerals summer bisque this gives a
nice flawless matte appearance to the
under eye area and then I'm using makeup
Forever's Pro finished powder to set the
rest of the face makeup and help it last
all day for some contouring i'm using
laura Geller's bronze and brighten you
can see the cheekbones start to pop out
a bit more they're also using it around
my hairline and on the decollete then
the balms down boy blush for a nice pink
glow on the cheeks wet and wild to
reserve your cabana always gets a nice
flawless finishing touch to the skin and
then I'm highlighting my Cupid's bow
with a very shimmery highlight called
mary lou manizer and setting it with
Urban Decay's all nighter setting spray
then we're moving on to the eyebrows and
I'm using my ELF studio brow kit and
this is just helping me even out my
brows as much as possible and then I'm
going to set the brows with a little
great lash clear and just brush through
them to get the shape that I master and
I'm using Milani eyeshadow primer as a
base for my powder shadows it's gonna
help them cling last longer look
brighter and then for the first time I'm
using Sigma's creme de Couture palette
we're gonna be using purples and pinks
so these are all matte shades and I'm
first putting the light lilac around the
inner corner then this really pretty
purpley pink shade on the rest of the
lid I love how its kind of pastel but
still sort of bright and then I'm taking
a blueish purple shade with that small
brush and patting that on the outer
corner pulling it slightly up into my
crease as well
then I'm gonna go into that same shade
with a fluffier brush and use that to
get a more diffused look in my crease
then with the small brush going into the
deepest plum and layering that on top of
the other colors on the outer corner I
love the effect we're starting to see
here with all these shades layered on
top and buffing it out with a bear brush
then I wanted to see what would happen
if I took some of this mob color and
buffed out the border with that just to
warm up the look a bit and then I went
under the brow with the light pink as a
highlight under the eye I used this dark
plum shade as well as the bluish purple
color and if there's hot pink in a
palette I kind of have to juice it so I
just wanted to see what that would be
like blended around the border of the
purple I think it's really pretty
and then I'm using my Milani itag
extreme with woods pen to go across my
upper lashline and winged out my
eyeliner a little bit at the outer
corners
and on my inner rim I'm using the Rimmel
scandaleyes in new to brighten things up
curl the lashes and I'm applying my
L'Oreal telescopic extensions mascara
and then to add a little drama to the
look I'm putting on some false lashes I
put glue on the lash band and then pop
them on my upper lash line that glue
desk dried clear by the way and I would
let it get tacky before placing them on
there but it's all set up for your
viewing enjoyment here and then I put a
little bit of mascara on the lower
lashes on my lips I'm using my Malley -
wicked lipstick in blossom and that's
the finished look
so I hope you enjoyed my little speed
makeup session guys I just wanted this
to fall in line with the same format my
sister does for her speed painting since
that's the next video you need to go
watches her painting this finished face
which I think will be a lot of fun to
watch all her videos these speed
painting things are like hypnotic
because you just can't step away you
can't look away from it because you just
see all these little teeny tiny details
that you didn't even know existed so I
can't wait to see it thanks buck for
collaborating with me and I'll talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
