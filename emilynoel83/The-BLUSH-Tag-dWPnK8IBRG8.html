is the blush tag I was tagged by my girl
Erica Jones so check out her channel I
think I mentioned that I was going to do
this a few videos back when I was doing
the perfect palate to tags so there have
been some really cool tags going around
and I thought it's time to do the blush
tag and as I was kind of digging through
my collection and thinking about how I
was going to answer these questions I
was just thinking like I really like
these tags there are some tags that are
so fun and so thought-provoking and I
just like the concept that you can watch
one youtuber and see how they answer the
questions and then you can jump around
to someone else and see how someone
different answers the very same thing
and I also like tags because especially
with this one certain questions may be
answering the exact question or the
exact kind of product a viewer might be
wondering about so I think they can be
very informative in that way too
so number one first question is best
packaging I'm going to have to give that
to the balm
I love the balms line of blushes and I
really like how each blush kind of takes
on its own personality so you've got hot
mama it looks like this frat boy has its
own kind of look I love that there's a
little bit of a retro twist to a lot of
their concepts and then I really like
the whole line of insane blushes that
kind of looked like the covers of
magazines so there's that and then the
more I look through my collection I
didn't want to leave out Milan E's rose
blushes and this might not be so much of
a packaging thing but just a design of
the blush itself but I mean does it get
more gorgeous than that that big
beautiful rose design we go from that
softball question to like the hardest
one of the whole thing which is
prettiest color how does one answer that
I mean somebody who's got a zillion
blushes is going to give you an answer
that's like well I love this one and
this one this one so that's sorry that's
kind of what I'm going to do here is
I've got several that I think are the
absolute prettiest color and I just
couldn't narrow it down any further so
one is the Too Faced sweethearts blush
in peach Beach I've talked about this
often and this was one of those blushes
that when I first got it I thought it's
going to be too understated it's just
going to be you know a glittery
highlight on the cheeks but I love using
these two shades together kind of as a
blush and this is the highlight so it's
sort of a two and one little blush thing
there but these are gorgeous they offer
so much life to the cheeks without being
a really bold color then I've got
another color that I just think for
whatever reason it really looks good on
my skin tone whenever I wear this I kind
of like them taken aback by how
beautiful it is and it's this Estee
Lauder blush in the color wild sunset
look at that shade it's it's coral but
it's kind of deep it's got that little
bit of shimmer going on in there I think
that's a gorgeous shade but I can't stop
there because I have to mention just a
general tone of blush that I think looks
so vibrant and so pretty on so many
people and it's not because the color
literally looks like exactly what you
see in the pan but it sheers out to be
just the freshest most kind of sunkissed
unexpectedly sunkissed look and I'm
talking about any book I'm talking about
any blush that might be bright pink like
this this is elfs pink passion and any
blush that you see on the market that
looks almost like a hot pink but kind of
light just one general color that you
might not instantly think to reach for
that always looks great think of the hot
pinks or most pigmented this was a
pretty easy one I'm going with kind of a
more recent find in my collection and
it's the city color intense blush quads
particularly the collection one and two
I have all four of them and the other
two in this line are a little bit
lighter you know ones very peachy ones
got you know maybe more wearable light
pinks but these are so so bold like this
color right here it's just such a loud
vibrant shade if you're going to wear
that you're going to like just barely
tap your brush into it on a totally
different like color tone playing field
you've got these more oranjee shapes
here in the collection too so I love
those they really are a lot of bang for
your buck and now my hands just got
really really messy after that number
four is everyday blush and I'm going to
take this question very literally and
say you could get away with wearing this
blush every day with any lip color
any I look going on and it would just
really complement the look without
detracting from anything else on your
face
so I think it's benefit Dallas and this
is a newly rediscovered thing I
rediscover this blush on like a I don't
know couple times a year basis I don't
know what it is Hank maybe it's the
packaging like the way it's kind of
situated in my collection it's not
always right out there where I'm
reaching for it all the time but it
looks so blah what keep glances that you
think okay what is that but I was
wearing this in a recent video and it's
just like a little bit of depth a little
bit of dusty plummy goodness going on on
the cheek sometimes I'll pair it with
another blush and just wear it a little
bit lower on the cheek I'm not wearing
it today but that is kind of a way I
like to do it and then pop something
else on the apple of the cheek but even
just worn alone such a good as this
question says everyday blush it's
definitely more on the neutral side of
things has a little bit of a satiny
finish to it but I think that is a
beautiful blush and kind of underrated
in the whole scheme of blushes and one
that's kind of like that is that Milani
romantic rose that I mentioned toward
the start of the video number five is
party blush and this could go in a lot
of different directions but I think when
I think about if I'm going to do a
makeup look for a party type occasion
I'm probably going to do a pretty strong
eye because then I think I can do a
softer lip that's not going to need to
be worried about and touched up as much
and as a result my blush will probably
be not too loud either so I am actually
wearing my party blush for this video
number one because I thought it suited
this I look really well and number two
it's a really hard blush to describe so
here you can just see it on and see what
I'm talking about but it's two-faced
pink leopard and so if I've got a smoky
type I look big lashes you know just a
big eye look going on I may not want as
loud or as colorful of a blush on the
cheeks and so this is pinky bronze and
you might be like does that what color
is that what does she mean by that there
are kind of brighter fresh pink pops in
this blush mixed in with bronzer type
colors and when you mix that all in with
your
you still get a little bit of pink on
the cheeks that's what you're seeing
here but it has this kind of soft bronzy
sheen mixed in and when I swatch this a
swatch does nothing for it because it
looks like just kind of a soft golden
bronzer and the pink you know just
swirling your finger over and over in
this the pink doesn't shine through but
when you just tap a brush directly into
it and make sure you're tapping on one
of the pink areas you get this kind of a
look and there's definitely some Sheen
to it so I love this blush it's just
really hard to describe and it would be
something that's great paired with a
more intense I regret purchasing this is
an interesting question because I just
recently decluttered a lot of things out
of my blush collection and so things
that I didn't like kind of are going by
the wayside now and on top of that being
Who I am being a beauty youtuber who is
always reviewing things and finding use
in reviews whether they're positive or
negative I oftentimes don't regret even
if it's something that didn't work for
me if I can pass along useful
information to you guys as a result then
I don't regret it so I'm going to talk
about a blush that I regret doing
something too and that is this Melba
blush from Mac that I tried to deep pot
and it failed I used the little
straightener method to try to heat up
the product I didn't let it go long
enough and so I started just prying it
out and I started getting impatient and
I really cracked it badly and then I
used alcohol to try to mesh it all back
together and I just I don't know I'm
still seeing the right color here I
guess but it's not as good as it once
was
so I really regret trying to be puck and
least used blush that would have to be
this little sample of benefit dandelion
because this blush is just too light to
show up as anything on my cheeks in fact
I think my cheeks like look worse as a
result of having this on because even
any natural color that might be coming
through that my cheeks might have or any
color coming through from a bronzer that
I'd already put on I put this blush on
top of it and it's like it just waters
everything down
and it's maybe for the fairest fairest
of the fair this might show up a little
bit more for me it just doesn't do
enough and what's interesting is benefit
is kind of going through this phase
right now where they're putting out new
versions of hula and dandelion like some
different types of products different
formats and some of those I really like
but I just have never been able to rally
around the powder dandelion version let
me know if you want to see the more
reviews and stuff on those benefit
things by the way and number eight is
most-used slash never let go of and this
would have to be frat boy from the balm
for me looking like very long-term
big-scale over my collection what over
time do I reach for again and again what
do I think of as a no-brainer blush
what is one that I almost always travel
with it's this one and this shade is
just it's pinky peach it's kind of what
it is it's a very warm pink and it's
matte and it doesn't take up a lot of
space just from a practical sense this
is very easy to take with you type blush
it's always that kind of shade that you
can throw on with very little effort
very little product needed and you just
look healthier for wearing it so I would
say this is one of my most used blushes
of all time
and that question rolls right into
favorite blush brand and for me it's got
to be the balm I mean and it's for a lot
of reasons the most important and most
practical would be how on the quality is
so great the pigmentation is always
great with blushes from the balm and I
love how they've really put out some
iconic blushes that you just know like
hot mama yes people know that name frat
boy the in stain blushes and we're just
I think groundbreaking in terms of an
awesome formula that really really lasts
definitely is like a staining type of
powder blush and if you're really
wanting to sample a lot of different
things I've said this many times but get
the in the balm of your hand palette
where they've downsized and several
different blush products that they make
the packaging is always like spot-on
love their concepts it's like people
really sat down and put their heads
together and came up with super fun
creative ideas greatest blush discovery
last year this is question number 10 I
would say it was the Beca afterglow
palette and so this is a blush and
highlight palette it has several of
Becca shimmering skin perfectors here
moonstone rose gold topaz and then the
blushes in wild honey and flower child
so I love the blushes in here but I also
love the ability to layer these
beautiful highlights with those blushes
get different looks get varying levels
of glow on the skin all within one
palette and I like when brands just like
I mentioned with the balm I like when
they put out palettes that actually
contain products that aren't
limited-edition that are regular
fixtures in their lines so people can
try them and see if they like them and
if they do you know they'll still be
around to purchase in a full size number
eleven is most practical one is the
Becca Beach tint and so this is a kind
of liquid gel stain type thing and I
think it's most practical because first
off it's very small doesn't take up a
lot of room you can use it on both
cheeks and lips and also it truly does
stain it lasts a long time you're not
going to be going back to reapply it
really frequently it's just a really
nice kind of low maintenance very
practical blush type product and one
that I think has the most impact is the
shade called raspberry the least
practical blush I'm going to say is my
Physicians Formula ultra nourishing
argan oil blush I have it in the shade
natural and I don't know if you can see
if you get a close-up look here this
blush was once coated with a glitter
over spray over sprays are one of the
biggest annoyances in the makeup world
in my mind because they're there
strictly to draw you in as a consumer
you see it on the shelf you're like oh
my gosh that looks so beautiful
that's not even designed to stay on the
product it's like if you're going to
dress it up dress up the packaging dress
up the box that it's in but don't like
put something that's only expected to be
temporary on here and it's also really
annoying like the glittery flecks I
still have some here I made an effort to
rub a lot of it off but I can't think of
anything less practical than putting a
temper
very glittery sheen on top of a product
that's not even meant to be there for
the long haul I just don't get it my
most expensive blush I wasn't quite sure
one that I know was on the high end was
my Estee Lauder limited-edition Mad Men
collection blush get a load of this
packaging is that not just amazing this
compact I love everything about it and
the shade is called light show in here
it's a really pretty blush I've used it
minimally because I'm just like that
with legends that I think a really
expensive or really special it's like I
don't know I want to preserve it I will
never get rid of this first off because
just for the beauty of the packaging
it's gonna stay least expensive I don't
think I've spent less than a dollar on a
blush unless I got something through
some kind of sale but one blush that I
did get for a dollar
was from that shop miss a website which
everything's a dollar on there and this
blush called Malibu glitz and it just
says blusher on the back I can't
remember what shade this is but it's
actually a really pretty very pigmented
blush right there it's kind of a deep
rosy shade and yet that was only a
dollar this always cracks me up I think
of the name like Malibu glitz it's
either you know something from the 80s
or it's like the brand of makeup Barbie
would have you stir something like that
now there was a special request when I
mentioned that I was going to do this
tag in the perfect palette to video I
noticed people in the comment section
saying when you do the blush tag will
you add a category for longest lasting
blood in my opinion the longest lasting
blushes that I have are the balm in
stain blushes which they're a powder
blush but they actually do kind of stain
in other words if you're to swatch these
blushes on your skin and you would have
a hard time fully removing that swatch
like you can rub over it the powder
actually stains the skin it's crazy and
more recently when Kristen game gifted
me several of the Clinique cheek pop
blushes I realized oh my goodness it's
the same kind of thing going on here
it's a powder blush and I mean these are
should win a packaging award - they're
not a rose but they're like a daisy and
they're I love that
this is the cola pop shade i like the
berry one i have kind of a peachy coral
one too but these do the very same thing
in that they're very pigmented powders
but when you go to rub over them you
know you candy ten safai it a little bit
but overall that powder blush is staying
in place so if you're looking for really
great long wear blushes regardless of
your skin type I think the ball or
Clinique would be great brands to look
too and then I wanted to add even one
more category to this because I think
blush palettes are just growing more and
more brands are putting them out a
couple of my favorites that I wanted to
talk about first off the becca afterglow
as I mentioned earlier this was a great
great find over the past year but
another awesome blush palette that I'm
loving and actually a whole line of
blush palettes that I think are really
good or from makeup revolution
I've got like the hot spice the sugar
and spice I think those are really good
and more recently I came across this one
it's called golden sugar - rose gold and
it's got like all these shimmery blushes
and then a couple of really neutral
almost contour type shades and these are
big blush palettes with a nice mirror
really nice quality but they're ten
dollars or so and the other day I was
wearing this shade and I just it's so
shimmery is so glowy but yet beautiful
colors so if you're down for some
shimmery blushes this is a great option
but like I said look into some of the
other blush palettes that makeup
revolution makes as well because they
are good quality nicely pigmented
blushes and I enjoy how they include
some variety in the palettes like you
won't just find all matte or all shimmer
they will do sometimes a couple of
really shimmery ones and then a couple
of matte and a couple of almost satin
finish I love how I sit down and I think
oh this is going to be quick video I
have a way of making a quick video a
really day long video but I'm glad you
enjoy these tags thank you so much for
watching check out Erica's video I'll
link to that and have an awesome day
I'll see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
