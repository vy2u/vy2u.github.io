blush it's some new blushes from the
balm they're known as insane blushes so
these are powder blushes that are really
long wearing and have sort of a staining
quality on your cheeks and so there are
six of them so in this video I'm going
to tell you all about them show you what
they look like and I will point out
which ones are my favourite it comes to
the blushes from the balm they were my
high-end Emilie award winner this past
year for favorite blush I mean their
regular line of blushes is just awesome
so I was very excited when they put out
something that kind of had that same
kind of quality that you expect from
their blushes but even more staying
power even more intensity these costs
$22 a piece and with any individual
product that costs that amount I'm kind
of like oh this better be good you know
it's got to be offering something unique
it's got to be doing more than the
average you know blush is going to do
each blush I see as kind of a range of
several different shades depending on
how how much you apply if you do a
really light application you get one
look if you apply more it can they can
be very very intense it's very hard to
explain okay this is a powder it's a
stain typically when you hear about
stains it's some sort of liquid product
or maybe a cream product but yeah these
are powders that actually have a
noticeable staying power and for example
with let's say you swatch an eyeshadow
on your hand and really quickly it's
like you could rub it almost totally
away some of them you know there's such
a light powdery finish it's like just
with your hand you could rub it right
off with these if I were to swatch these
this is the one I'm wearing today and
there's a look at the intensity there as
I swatch it on my hand I want you to get
a really close look at what that looks
like okay we're seeing a lot of intense
color your may be seeing a little bit of
powder and I can maybe rub a little bit
of that powder off but really I can keep
rubbing over this blush and it's still
there like the color is actually it has
so much saturated pigment that it's
really like getting in contact with your
skin and really kind of becoming one
with the skin so that's what makes these
different to me not a light flaky you
know powder with a lot of filler in fact
there are only two of these blushes that
have a little bit of a satiny finish the
rest are matte so it's really
concentrated color and I just feel like
it's it's so much more pigment and
that's what's making it really kind of
adhere to the skin a little bit more
it's not as soft and loose as a lot of
powder so really when you put it on you
do get a lot of color I really like
these blushes you're going to hear a lot
of pros you know about these but if
there's a con it's probably that you can
go overboard with these it's not
foolproof it's not goof proof I mean
you've got to kind of know how to manage
the blush and how to wear it a little
bit lighter if you want to and I need to
give some suggestions I'll put my
brushes out here so I don't forget a
couple of good ways to apply these so
you don't get too much but it's
something
you know you've got to be aware of order
that I'm going to go in when I tell you
about these is sort of like least two
most intense so kind of lightest to
deepest sort of thing the packaging on
all of these is really cute it looks
like the cover of a magazine
size-wise it's the same size as a lot of
the other blushes from the balm it's
kind of like a cardboard packaging and a
magnetic closure and a mirror inside but
probably the most natural seeming blush
out of this whole collection is Argyle
it's kind of a soft pink with a little
bit of warmth to it in a minute you're
gonna I'm going to go back to lace the
one that I was demoing the swatch with
but that's you know much brighter cooler
pink this one is probably the most basic
is matte as I've worn this one
throughout the day I don't know that
I've noticed quite the staying power on
this one maybe it's just cuz it's
lighter to begin with the whole rest of
the munch I'm going to talk about have a
lot of intensity and I really feel like
it's apparent that I know that that
blush is hung around all day this one is
a little bit lighter but it is very
natural and it's very pretty this next
one is called toile and this one is so
beautiful and talked about rich a lot of
pink a lot of coral tone and this is
well though like if we compare it to the
one I just showed you see how much more
sort of vibrancy and depth this has this
is one of my favorite shades I mean it's
it's the epitome of peachy pink but with
a lot of richness to it so again it's a
matte color and show up just as intense
as it looks really here in the packaging
or a lot lighter if you apply it more
sheer next one is Swiss dot and this one
is definitely your peach color peachy
orange compared to 12 which I just
showed you see how much more orange is
in this and how much more pink is in
this one so again a nice vibrant matte
color is dot is going to be your classic
peach without you know pink thrown in
now lace is again a really bright pink
this is matte bright pink and this one
is what I'm wearing today
and I actually feel like I mean in the
spectrum of all these colors I feel like
it can be very intense but applied
lightly
it really looks natural almost as if you
just went out in the Sun and got a
little bit of Sun like on the top of
your cheeks or something it can be just
such a natural look in that way as well
so apply it softly it looks gorgeous
compared to the first pink that I showed
you see how much more warmth this has
this is cooler and brighter so I don't
think that just because you might have
fair skin like you couldn't wear some of
these different shades you just have to
have a lighter hand with it two shades
that I classifies a little bit deeper
and they're still wearable but deeper
one is called houndstooth
and this one I would say is like a mauve
this does have a little bit of a satiny
finish whereas everything else has been
matte this one I feel like just has the
slightest bit of Sheen to it but it's
more like a neutral I feel like um
compared to the softest pink see how
much more neutral this is even than the
the really kind of natural pink shade
the first one I showed just the type of
girl who doesn't like a lot of color in
the blush if you're not into the pinks
if you're not into the peach this would
be the closest thing to neutral but I
think a medium skin tone could wear and
then the last one is gorgeous for I
would say a darker skin tone it's called
pinstripe this is so pretty this is a
plum blush and I don't know if you can
tell a little bit in the packaging but
this actually has a little bit of gold
and shimmer compare it to UM houndstooth
the one I just showed see how much more
depth this has this would be a little
bit harder for you know a fair light
skin tone to wear but I think deeper
skin tones I feel like this was made for
you I think the sheen that this one
would have on your skin would be so
pretty so as you can see I think a pro
of this whole collection is the wide
color range I think there's really
something for everyone if you like you
know more of a natural look I think
houndstooth is going to give it to you
and I think Argyle are really natural
picks if you like more of a brighter pop
of color lace is a good one that's the
bright pink I think 12 is gorgeous just
such a rich peach pink
and also Swiss dot you know that's going
to give you really straight-up peach
orange eat color and then you know a
nice nice deep option here in pinstripe
my favorite shades out of the whole
bunch my two favorites would be twelve
and so this is that one that I said was
kind of like peachy pink and but very
intense and this one looks so pretty and
juicy and just lovely on the cheeks and
then the one I'm wearing today is
another one that I love and that's lace
and that would be the bright pink that I
said kind of looks like a you know you
got a little bit of Sun but it could be
more intense and look pretty on a deeper
skin tone too I really think if you're
accustomed to applying blushes and you
know about you know really what a
lighter hand can do for you I think
you're going to really be comfortable
with these if you're a beginner with
makeup and you're just used to you know
maybe using some lesser quality blushes
that you really have to scrub on with
your brush and then really have to try
to put on this is so much less than that
like you barely tap your brush in I mean
your brush will have product on it after
you just go Boop and then you're good to
go and a couple of applications
suggestions on this brush like this is
one from Sigma here see how it's kind of
like tapered down on the sides and the
bristles are much less densely packed
kind of a duo fiber type thing going on
there's a great kind of brush to use
with these blushes because you
automatically are getting more of a
sheer application if you use more of a
traditional brush like an angled brush
or just you know a regular classic sized
blush brush something I might recommend
is to go into your product you go on
your cheeks and then when you continue
to blend in pick up a bear brush and
blend it all in that way you're not
adding anything additional from this
from this brush you know you just get
the initial amount on there blend it out
with a bear brush and you'll get just
the right amount
on your cheeks as far as the staying
power goes and this whole staining idea
one thing I want to point out is that a
lot of it depends on like your
foundation and your moisturizer for your
skin type those initial products that go
on your skin can really make or break
the staying power of everything else
that goes on top of it you know like
your blushes your bronzers your
highlight if your skin is absolutely
breaking down under a lot of heavy
product on a hot summer day and you've
got oily skin already and you've got a
foundation that's too heavy a
moisturizer that's too thick and
everything's starting to go it'll go you
know you've got the right products for
your skin type and you know your other
stuff is staying pretty well this will
be there all day I've tried all of these
even the darkest what I've used in a
very sheer way and I mean they're all
really beautiful colors the balm blushes
are nothing new to me I know and love
their their line of regular blushes but
these are definitely something special
when it comes to highly pigmented color
that really does last trying to get a
good deal keep an eye on HauteLook I
can't guarantee you know what products
will be featured on there but I know the
balm features many things from their
line every so often on HauteLook calm
and you can get you know a really good
price so that's just maybe something to
keep an eye out for if you're interested
thank you so much for watching I hope
you enjoyed this review and have a great
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
