videos lately so I thought I would throw
something your way that was a little
more high-end but yet still a brand that
if your timing is good you can really
save some money on on this brand is the
phone and their cosmetics are available
at the balm comm and also they are
occasionally on the website HauteLook so
if you go to that website it's like
different brands each day that might be
on there and they can be dramatically
discounted in terms of their products so
I've heard a lot through that website of
this brand and that's what got me into
it and now I'm really kind of hooked on
certain things so I thought it would
take you through the things that I
really like and also mention some things
that were either kind of average or
didn't work wonderfully for me just so
you're aware of that and I'm pretty sure
this brand was once available at Sephora
stores but it's not there anymore
I'm going to start off and tell you
about a palette that's kind of new to me
it is called the Shady Lady and I love
that it's leopard print but this is a
palette of like colors that can really
look good smokey has a big mirror there
nice dark colors a good variety of them
from purple to blue to like a dark
hunter green and your neutrals Browns
and bronze and things like that but I
love these the texture of these is just
beautiful I feel like they're SuperDuper
soft and just really pigmented and I'm
using them today I actually just used
this row right here I use the neutrals
so like the lighter shade in here and
then I kind of smoked things out with
this caught in the act Courtney and this
is a brand that probably has some of the
best packaging like I love their names
for stuff I love the what you know how
cute everything is and so like they have
unique cute names for all their shades
too but this is a palette that I really
enjoy and I know they have some other
versions of this as well this is the
only one I've tried but I really really
do like this another palette that I know
I've gone on and on about the nude tude
palette and
I have a full review and tutorial on
this if you want more information but
I'll just tell you now it's wonderful
this is like my top favorite neutral eye
palette even I like it if it's a little
better than the Naked palette just
because I love the the selection of
colors that you get here they're that
same fantastic texture that I just
described with the other palette but if
you're a neutral fan you know this is
everything you might need you've got
matte really great super dark matte
shades gorgeous shimmery and one
actually sparkly shade and all the
highlights you could need I mean I just
think it's perfect and it has a little
mirror here
I also think the blushes from the balm
are really great quality I mean I feel
like they're right up there where the
eyeshadows are concerned in terms of
being pigmented being the color you
think they're gonna be you know on your
cheeks and of course I've gone through a
bunch of blush dupes I even duped
you know one of my favorites from this
brand which is hot mama I talked about
this cute kind of retro packaging isn't
that adorable
but this is a gorgeous shake kind of
peachy coral you'll have to check out my
blush dupes video to see you know what I
came up with the frat boy which is a
classic pink and then just recently I
got down boy it freaking odorous one is
just a little bit brighter pink this one
maybe has a little more warmth to it
this is more cool but I like all those
blushes not like their undue pible
because I did find a dupe for hot mama
but just speaking of their quality and
their texture and how nicely they go on
they're really probably some of my
favorite products that this brand makes
this thing it's called the sustainiac
and this is a tint for cheeks and lips I
have it on my cheeks today kind of right
here in this area and it's really cool
and it operates a lot like Benetint does
because you take out a wand
although Benetint has a little brush on
it and it's straight-up liquid this has
like a doe foot applicator and it is a
gel in here this is actually a red gel
so it's not going to pour out but I like
this I think this might give off just a
little more color than Benetton does and
I like them both and I will continue to
use them both but I just feel like this
might give off a little more pigment
maybe but it blends into the cheeks
super easily and like I said you use it
in the very same way you can use it on
your lips as well on my lips today I'm
using lipstick that I think is great
it's called me amore and I need to find
the little box that this came in because
it was so cute but like they've got
these different like almost Bond girl
type of characters on the boxes but this
is a classic red it's matte same power
with matte lipsticks generally speaking
for me you know if it's not feeling
super greasy on your lips but it
hydrates
enough it's gonna be a good lipstick for
staying power because it's not going to
start to look flaky but it's also going
to really kind of penetrate the lips and
leave you with a little bit of that
stained look so I think this this is a
great read at the same time they have a
great nude called my bills be paid it's
a good nude that's not too terribly
light it's not not gonna give you ghost
lips but it's gonna give you a nice
neutral lip so I really like this this
lends itself to my medium skin tone
really nicely for a good go-to nude
lipstick those are some of the things
that I'm just loving so much a few
things that maybe I don't feel as
strongly about on there are a couple of
the Luminizer products one is mary
loumanizer get a load of this it's a
freakin mugshot
I love how cute the packaging is only
the bomb could make like the mugshot
look super cute like that and then there
is betty loumanizer and she's like on a
wanted poster but Mary first off is a
highlight like a pearly light colored
highlight and I do like this I mean it's
very shimmery I love LA rocks spotlight
powder and perfectly lit I feel like it
is just the perfect shade for not being
to not being too shimmery and shiny and
that kind of thing and this is actually
quite shimmery which can be good in some
very targeted places but it also can you
know too much shimmer on your face can
also attract attention to your pores and
your imperfections and things like that
so while this can be good and I like
highlighting like my inner corner here
was good I still like it but I don't
reach for it that often the betty
loumanizer is gonna be your bronzer type
thing which is like the same level of
shimmer and everything in the last one
but this one it's gonna have much more
of a golden bronzy tone I don't use this
really on my face because I don't really
go for a bronze shimmer if I'm looking
to use bronzer I'm usually going to
contour with it or you know I just want
that natural slight deepening of my skin
tone when you put the shimmer in it
doesn't always stay looking that natural
so I might use this with a bigger brush
kind of over my decollete area for a
little glow there
but I don't rely on this as a face
product really at all I've tried the
time bomb concealer this is kind of
something that looks like it's in a
small little like lip color pot or
something it has a little bitty sponge I
have it here in the light I would say
this is a good coverage concealer but
it's a little bit dry it's just a little
bit drier than some of the kinds that I
seem to really enjoy which would be like
benefits erase paste Bobbi Brown
corrector and concealer those are very
hydrating concealers and it only takes a
teeny teeny bit to do the job with this
I'm not saying it takes a lot of product
when you use the concealer but I feel
like it just gets to a drier state on my
skin and I don't really like that when
it comes to any little lines that you've
got going on underneath your eye the
dryness is not necessarily a favor to
those areas and ever you're using any
kind of concealer you want to use the
minimum amount possible so you don't
have so much settling going on and if
you do dab over that area with a q-tip
over your line and it will pick up any
excess and you'll be okay you know just
throwing that out there but for this
it's not a bad concealer but it is just
a little bit dry for my liking texture
can be everything when it comes to
certain products and I just mentioned
that being dry this mascara called the
cheater
which again can't fault them for the
packaging at all it's all so cute but
this is just a little wet for me this is
what the wand looks like it's kind of
one of those classic like the brush part
just spirals and spirals around it's a
little bit tapered at the tip I feel
like it was just a little bit heavy on
my lashes I think it darkened them up
and gave them a really nice black glossy
look but yet it didn't allow them to
really build as much as as some drier
mascaras can so I'm not over the moon on
that mascara
there's my take on a bunch of balm
products I know I haven't tried close to
everything but I felt like I tried
enough variety by now throughout the
line that I give you a little heads up
and whether you want to shop for it on
the balm calm or keep an eye out for it
the next time it's discounted on
look this way you have some ideas so
thanks so much for watching guys have a
great day
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
