you about a new makeup palette that i
think is really going to appeal to your
sense of humor at least it is the neat
matte nude palette so it's from the balm
and they already have out a palette
called meet matte so there you see matte
dressed and here he is we would assume
nude and it is a nude eyeshadow
collection that is all matte so i'm
gonna get into explaining this show you
some swatches compare it a little bit to
another recent matte palette launch your
stuff just to give you a little
comparison here with the original meet
matte palette and you can see it's got
the same mount shades it's got nine
colors but in this new palette i would
say they are more than double the size
of the shadows in here and the original
meet matt in case you're not familiar
with that you've got some neutrals or
nude shades as they're being dubbed it
seems like these days but you've also
got a few colors in there like really
deep plums dark bluish greens and blues
and more of like lighter green light
pink with this one it is more neutral
but what I do like about it is that it's
all sides of neutral eyeshadows instead
of just giving you the warm neutrals or
the cool neutrals it does give you
everything there's a big mirror on here
as well texture of the balm shadows I
was comparing it directly to like my
Naked basics because these are a lot of
matte shadows and these are matte as
well and so as i swatched the thing i
noticed i love urban decay shadows but
what I noticed was that these even have
a more creamy texture to them like when
you put your finger on them it like the
product almost instead of like flaking
off or dusting away it's like it almost
hangs together on your fingertip and
whereas sometimes you could put a Urban
Decay shadow between your fingers and go
like this and you see powder powder kind
of runs away it's still a good texture
in it and it still works fine and I feel
like
comes off pigmented it is pretty but
these are really really good for not
having any fallout and this comes in
contact with the skin it really has a
way of almost attaching to it instead of
powdering and flaking off so I love that
about the bomb shadow texture I mean I
give it two thumbs way up for the bomb
for sure in terms of the shades let's
just go through and look at him here
we've got Matt Johnson which is like a
really really deep charcoal shade kind
of a dark dark gray Matt Garcia is a
deep warm brown Matt Malloy is going to
be your creamy white shade Matt Rosen
kind of a warm medium brown Matt wood
your classic dark dark brown like
seriously this comes off with the
intensity almost of a black if you apply
it concentrated like a liner or
something like that that's the way it
looks
matsing is a peach shade Matt Abdul is
sort of a classic gray Matt Lombardi
kind of a buttery golden yellow color
and Matt hyung is like a medium grey
with a little bit of a plum influence
thrown in I've kind of gotten into using
matte shadows a little bit more as more
matte shadows have become available I
mean I feel like more brands are putting
them out and they can be fun to work
with because with shimmer while you do
get Sparkle and you do get some
luminosity and it looks pretty and shiny
and stuff it can look a little bit muddy
sometimes or it doesn't have quite the
contrast that matte shadows can have
where you can really get like perfect
lines perfectly you know here's where
your lid is here's where your crease is
you can get a nice separation of color
you can see the contrast more that's
what I'm trying to say you're interested
in a tutorial I actually did use this in
my get ready with me video I think I
called it get ready with me average day
or something like that you can actually
see this palette in action I did a look
kind of similar to what I did today with
the cooler shades and that's what I'm
loving the most about this palette I
love using like today I used a little
bit of the white on the lid actually
mixed it
with this Matt Abdul for a light-gray
used some of the Matt Johnson shade on
the outside and in the crease blended
that out a little bit with Matt hung and
just did a little bit like buffing out
the darkest shade use some of the peach
shade right before I got to my brow and
then went in with just a little more of
the white right under the brows so I
mean great like kind of gradient effects
that you can do when you've got multiple
shades of brown multiple shades of gray
so you may be watching this thinking
okay Emily that's great that you like
this but do I need this if I already
have the meet met pal think that really
depends on how much you like matte
eyeshadows and how much you'll use matte
eyeshadows you know if you really only
kind of like matte eyeshadows then maybe
you don't we are not interested in any
of this you've got a few more colors and
if you're satisfied with that you don't
feel like you need any more neutrals
then just stay with that you may not
want to you know mess with anything else
but this is just more of a range of both
warm and cool neutral shades I
definitely like it better than the naked
basics because I feel like naked basics
I mean I've already done a video
duping the entire naked basics but as I
look at it you've got three shades that
are real close together there and here
each shade kind of has its own identity
each swatch is you know very true to
color and read minds here but if you're
also thinking well I want to try these
wonderful shadows from the balm but I've
not that cracked up about having all
matte shades something you might really
like which I talked about this in Milan
a pallets video and so many people have
said that they got this for Christmas
based on that video so that's exciting
but this has four matte shades in it and
then some shimmery ones in different
colors and this is just a super-fun
palette blush highlight and a couple of
lip things there but I've talked about
this more in that video but this is kind
of like a mix of everything the balm has
to offer
matte shimmer color nude just want a
little matte in your life you can get it
there but if you want to meet matte nude
and this would be the palette to go for
want more or different tutorials beyond
what I didn't get ready with me video
with this palette just let me know and I
would be happy to do some of those it's
fun to use fun to work into other
palettes you currently own so thanks
again guys have a wonderful day and I
will see you next time
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
