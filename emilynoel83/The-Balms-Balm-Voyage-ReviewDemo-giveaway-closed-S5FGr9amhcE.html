me your information and I'll pass that
along to the bone because they will be
sending these pallets out directly to
the winner when I give you a review and
show you some swatches and then also
show you just a little how-to on this
eye look that I'm wearing today that I
put together with this palette so this
palette
costs 40 to 50 if you were to order it
on the balmes website see it's a pretty
large ballot you know bigger than my
face but it is rather flats got all
kinds of cute little like old school
pictures almost like little bitty
postcards you know from around the world
and here it says amenities included 16
eyes shadows and three lip and cheek
stains so when you open it up this is so
cool I get a kick out of this
okay the place where your mirror is so
where you will see your face is right
here like on this passport picture it
says United States of America and the
name is Anita vacation and then we have
all of your shadows so sixteen shadows
here and they're all numbered off kind
of like your seat on a plane so a4 b4 c4
you know then the lip and cheek stains
come in at the bottom this is much like
the way the Bon Jovi was they had this
handy little flap here so your cream
products aren't getting you know little
specks of powder in them as you use them
I think that's a super smart idea and
then right down at the bottom you do get
some color combo ideas and they put
those together like boarding passes so
they say smokey and Shanghai and then
they give you like four shadows together
there Marv and Montreal so just to make
it a little more user friendly I guess
if you need some ideas and then for the
stains here they say second officer
first officer and captain I really love
how large these eyeshadows are I think
that's an awesome value kind of reminds
me of the size of the shadows in the
meet matte nude these 16 shadows you've
got four completely matte shade let's
take a look at some pictures and
swatches so you can really see what's in
here going across the top on a four is a
shimmery black that's the darkest shade
in the kit b4 is a shimmery Brown c4
it's kind of a rusty reddish brown with
sparkle d4 we're looking at a nice deep
army green olive green type color I
really found the quality of these
shadows to be consistent with other
palettes from the balm that I've used
like new tude and balm Jovi and stuff
like that now that second row on you've
got basically some neutrals but they're
a little bit lighter a three is a
shimmery
silver b3 is a matte gray c3 is like a
matte light to medium brown color d3 is
a shimmery gold but definitely not a
brassy gold it's kind of like more like
a champagne with a little bit of golden
he's looking at some of the matte shades
I did want to see if any of them were
the same as what's in the meet matte
nude and from what I can tell that b3
and that second row they're the matte
gray is kind of similar to a matte Abdul
here in the meet matte nude palette but
not exactly so that's the only one that
really seems to be a close match they're
moving on to the next row we've got some
fun pops of color here a 2 is a shimmery
purple love this shade it reminds me a
lot of the purple in the Maybelline eye
studio quad and autumn dream so I love
it when brands actually get the purple
right sometimes purple for whatever
reason turns out to be kind of a dud
shade but it's good in here
b2 is a shimmery mint green c2 is a dark
um kind of teal greenish blue color d2
is a shimmery light pan the bottom row
it's giving you kind of some lighter
neutral options a one is like a rosy
taupe shade just gorgeous if you love
tokes you would love this take on it
b1 is just a matte creamy shade little
bit of a pinkish undertone there c1 is
like a shimmery butter type color it's
just got a little bit of yellow in it
and then d1 definitely a lot of yellow
clearly in that shade and some shimmer
is one terms my favorite shades out of
the whole palette I really enjoy c4 up
here which has a little bit of a reddish
rusty kind of tone to it love the two
mats that are in the center row I think
they're so wearable so basic and that
purple is stunning the deep teal is a
knockout and I also love like I said
that rosy taupe down there at the bottom
now the very bottom of this palette you
have three of the cheek and lip stains
so these can be used either way I did
use one on my cheeks today I used
captain so this is more of the pinky one
and I just use my ELF small stipple
brush that is an awesome brush for cream
products just went right in here and
then just tapped it right on my cheeks
and that's all I have on there's no
shimmer in these um particular shades
but I find when I use something like
this I do just get a little bit more of
a glowy look on the cheeks just because
it's not you know a powdery finish but
it definitely doesn't feel sticky or
tacky that is a total deal-breaker for
me with the cream products I don't like
for it to have sort of a tackiness or
doing this really on the skin because I
feel like that really affects staying on
my lips I'm wearing a little bit of
captain which is the pink and a little
bit of second officer which is the red
first officer is probably the most
opaque the most richly colored of all
three these two on the outside are a
little bit sheer they actually come off
you know very similar to one another but
this one if for some reason this kind of
orange coral really is intense I just
applied the shades with a lip brush do
you think these are effective as a stain
like really good staying power if you're
going to be drinking out of a cup you
know you're still going to have the
color left on your lips but don't count
on these to be a real moisturizing
product after you know wearing these for
most of the day I do kind of feel like
maybe I need a balm over the top maybe I
need just you know another lipstick or a
gloss or something because the lips feel
a bit dry with just this on there so
just a heads up there most people assume
that's the kind of thing you're getting
when we're talking about stain what
you're getting I think if you were to
buy this for forty to fifty I think
that's an awesome value for this palette
you're getting shadows that are so large
and you're getting sixteen of them and
then you're getting three kind of extra
bonus type products right down same
quality that I've come to expect from
the Boehm eyes shadows a buttery texture
a really pigmented texture a little bit
goes a long way type of product that's
what these are velasca lot does a shadow
have fallout you know is it going to
fall down on my cheek as I apply it with
pretty much any shadow I use I am
totally in the habit of going into the
product and then tapping off the excess
because I find that it's better to be
safe than sorry you know it's just
pretty much become routine for me but I
would definitely recommend doing that
with shadows from the ball there are
some of the shimmery shades in
particular like this pearly color here
this kind of yellow shimmery color see
four up here that has a little bit of
glitter in it as well I would definitely
be conscious of that know that when you
put your brush in here
you don't need to be rubbing around and
scrubbing on the product just tap your
brush into it get a little bit off and
then tap off the excess just in case you
got too much on there that's just my
rule of thumb with eye shadows taking
the mix of neutrals and colors the mix
of matte and shimmer I think it's
awesome love just the creative concept
behind this whole palette so if you want
to see some of these shades in action
here's a quick eye tutorial on the look
I'm wearing today okay first off I'm
taking a little bit of this shade called
d2 and it's kind of a pearly light pink
color and I'm going to take that right
around my inner corner and also up on to
about the inner half of my eyelid next
I'm taking C form to overlap some of the
lighter pink with this SH and I'm going
to apply this all over my lid it really
is kind of like a rusty almost brownish
red color next I'm taking the matte teal
shade and C - it's a really dark teal
I'm going to Pat a little bit of this
right here on my outer corner you can
see that shade is just really popping
even if you put it on top of something
really shows up I'm also going to flip
my little brush around here this is a
Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush and I'm
just lightly working that shade into my
outer corner and up into my crease next
I'm going to bring in a fluffy brush
nothing on it but I'm just blending out
the edge of that blue a little bit next
I'm going to kind of warm up this area
right above the eye you can see how I've
brought in this reddish brown shade
again I'm using my e36 which is a really
small fluffy brush that allows me just
the precision I want to get that shade
right above the teal taking another bear
rush and just going over the edge of
that now and I'm going to highlight the
brow with b1 this is a matte shade that
has a little bit of a pink undertone to
it and just go right up under the
eyebrow underneath the eye I'm going
back to C to this dark teal and I'm
going to really connect this up with the
teal that's right out there in the outer
corner and then I'm going to pull it all
the way to the inner corner then I'm
going to go into this light mint green
in b2 that I'm just going to put it here
on the inner most part of my lower lash
line it just kind of brightens up what's
going on here under the eye of it I'm
doing some black liner right here on my
inner rim and then I'm taking my ELF
liquid liner in black across my upper
lash line and I'm just winging it out a
little going back just under the wing
with my smudge brush and that teal again
just to give kind of a pretty effect
there just really bring the blue outward
then I'm just going to finish things off
with some mascara on my upper and lower
lashes I know I packed a lot into this
