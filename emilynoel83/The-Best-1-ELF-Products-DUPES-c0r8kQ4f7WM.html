elf the brand ice lips face first
launched and everything was a dollar
seems like kind of a long time ago that
was the case but for a while there it
was they were selling all aspects of
their makeup line for a dollar and then
they grew they put out the mineral line
in the studio line and things really
started to change and I think in various
price ranges within the elf line they
have released some awesome things I'm
not complaining about their expansion in
their growth because I'm glad that the
brand has grown but wow that studio line
has gotten a lot of attention you know
for products that range from let's say
$3 to $10 there are still some $1
products out lurking in the grocery
stores and on elfs website and some of
them are really fantastic products and
even though they don't get the buzz is a
lot of the newly released things and
some of these things have been around
since elfs line actually began they are
still some amazing products and
definitely worth looking into so I'm
going to give you a roundup of those
today a lot of them I have actually
found to be dupes for more expensive
products so I'll show those as I go but
you know me I'm always kind of out for
the beauty underdog the lesser talked
about things the hidden gems the
unlikely favorites and that's what we're
going to be talking about here I've got
some tools and also some actual makeup
products so let's get started first
thing I want to mention are the tweezers
yes they sell a one-dollar tweezer it's
called the slant tweezer on elfs website
this is actually a really great pair of
tweezers who knew right I use tweezer
Minh tweezers and this is every bit as
good as those it's actually the same
size as what I normally use and
something that's really important to me
and I think a really good gauge of a
good pair of tweezers is when you look
at the tip and see how evenly or how
unevenly they meet and if they're really
coming together at exactly at precisely
the right spot you're going to have a
lot easier time picking up stray hairs
including those that are like barely
protruding from the skin so awesome
quality I'm going to keep using these
I'm going to probably buy an extra pair
and keep them in a travel bag because
tweezers are an easily forgettable thing
I think when you're traveling but I
would highly recommend those speaking of
travel and it's kind of funny because I
don't intend to travel with this this is
the elf travel
mirror and I actually got this in my
Christmas stocking and as I was browsing
elfs website more recently I realized
this is only a dollar it's a nice little
mirror one side is regular one side is
magnified and I'm always needing
something you know some small mirror and
generally I'm grabbing for a compact
it's no big deal really
but I must say the magnified side is
quite nice when you're trying to get
lash placement or trying to correct your
eyeliner or do something like that this
is great to just have as a little vanity
accessory item so I think for one buck
you can't beat it also did you know that
elfs individual lash kit is only a
dollar and you might be saying well
Emily you're always wearing this the big
strip lashes you know I didn't think you
were that into the individuals and the
truth is I'm not that's why I only want
to spend a dollar on them you know I
wear these occasionally and it gets more
of a process and I just don't feel as
confident with it but I'm practicing and
I'm getting better and I actually have
three of the little bundles on each eye
and I do like the way the lashes turned
out when you're wearing individual
lashes it's much more likely that they
will be mistaken for your real lashes so
that's kind of a cool thing this does
come with a mini glue I tend to use my
own glue just because I'm very attached
to my Revlon precision lash adhesive I
have like an unhealthy attachment to
that stuff but you get 18 of the
individual lash bundles in here and I
feel like they are pretty much exactly
the same thing as the Ardell dura lash
individual false lashes in the medium
length which I do feel is the most
usable length of the whole bunch if
you're wanting to save a little bit and
you're already feeling like it I don't
really know about false lashes just
spend a dollar and try it moving into
some actual makeup products here for
just a dollar elf sells something called
the shimmering facial whip I know I've
mentioned this in the past and I think
this is a great little hidden gem of a
product you're getting 0.3 for fluid
ounces these are not big tubes by any
means but I don't think it takes a lot
to get the job done when you use it the
couple that I'm wearing today are
actually the shade called pink lemonade
which I think doubles as a blush really
nicely I like to squeeze a little bit
out on my hand spread it out with the
finger so I can more easily pick it up
with a
and I'll just use my small stipple brush
here you can see it goes on very easily
onto the cheeks and gives that beautiful
kind of pinky glow for a really amazing
highlight I loved the white one this is
called spotlight something I'd really
like about these as a whole with an
exception of one shade that I'll mention
here these aren't packed with glitter
this shade is really nice for a pin
pointed strobe effect so I put a little
bit of this on my hand spread it out the
very same way I did before I grabbed a
different brush so I could really stay
true to color with this and put it right
on top of the cheekbones
such a beautiful look and I do feel like
the shade and spotlight is a pretty
close dupe for the Becca shimmering skin
perfector liquid in pearl so if you've
been waiting to experience that kind of
you know soft sheen that this gives your
cheeks try the elf another great thing
about any of these shades I've shown you
you know a couple of them and how they
can work on their own but they are
pretty concentrated they're pretty
pigmented and so if you wanted to just
mix a couple of drops of any of these
with your favorite moisturizer your
foundation whatever product you want I
think that would totally work but the
other shades that are available you've
got lilac petal which doesn't really
strike me as lilac it's more of kind of
a soft pink and then there's golden
peach which is a really nice soft gold
this is the only one of the bunch that I
notice a little bit of glitter in and
you might not see it in the concentrated
swatch but as it's sheared out I can
just see those tiny flecks of glitter
lurking in this product it's not enough
to really turn me off but I just want
you to be aware oh another thing about
the shimmering facial whip
they smell like fruit loops just saying
something that has been an elf's line
since the very beginning are these
luscious liquid lipsticks and by today's
standards I don't think a lot of us
would see these as liquid lipsticks
they're more like just Aguas to me
because I do think all of them with
maybe one exception have a very sheer
vibe to them and I haven't always been a
huge fan of sheer glosses I think they
have to be just the right shade and they
have to have an applicator that's not
going to apply them in a streaky way
because that's the problem with so many
sheer glosses you put them on with the
doe foot applicator and it's like you
can see tracks that the applicator is
made on your lips because the gloss is
so sheer with these now you're not
getting a lot of product you're getting
points you're
five ounces so I would think of this as
kind of a try me type thing experiment
with some new shades because you're just
not getting a lot but a cool thing about
this applicator is that you can see how
it's kind of at a slant and the product
comes up through multiple holes in that
sort of spongy tip and it does allow I
think for a very even application on the
lips you get the most out of these
products it's really an awesome delivery
method for glosses that are more sheer I
wish more brands would pick up on this
idea and but the shades that I really
like there's one called Baby Lips and
this would be the your lips but better
gloss you know it's not too pink if
you're really annoyed by sticky glosses
you don't have anything to worry about
with these they do not feel too heavy or
sticky to me at all and I do find that
this shade is a pretty close dupe for
the marvelous Moxie gloss in the shade
sparkplug I know that's a pretty popular
shade from the bare minerals marvelous
Moxie line there's a little bit more
shimmer in this shade but overall I
think they're very similar tone and both
great natural glosses another shade I
want to mention in the same line is
called strawberry and I would call it a
sheer warm red to me those are very
summery kinds of reds really fun shade
and the applicator does allow it to go
on in a very non streaky way and a shade
that I found in my collection that's
very similar is the tarte lipsurgence
lip gloss in natural beauty and when you
look up close at this one you can see
like a little bit of a golden a shimmer
and I think that warms up the tone a
little bit more this one actually
doesn't have any shimmer at all but they
come off a lot alike and I think that's
a great dupe now the last shade I didn't
really have anything identical to this
in my collection but just as is it's
still a great color and it's the shade
called cherry tart we're talking about a
creamy kind of reddish berry color I
think it's beautiful it's the most
opaque of any of the ones that I have
probably my favorite of the bunch these
do have a little bit of a cooling feel
on the lips it's not incredibly minty
but I do think it's something you'll
notice as you apply the product I think
these are a nice way to experiment with
some new shades of lip gloss finally
we're going to round out this video with
a couple of great $1 lipsticks from elfs
line and I have found that they are both
dupes of some great high-end lips
so the first one is the shade called
classy and I think it's a pretty cool
pink color this is a nice creamy full
color shade with no shimmer both of the
colors that I'm going to be talking
about from this line I mean they verge
on looking matte and I like that I think
it's a beautiful shade and I actually
think it's very very similar to angel
from Mac angel has a little bit more of
a shine to it you can see it very much
in the swatch but I think at the root of
these colors that cool pinky tone that's
not too light not too dark there are a
lot of light now the shade that I've
been wearing on my lips throughout this
video is a color called fearless and
this is a really fun shade because it's
a berry red but in a lot of cases I
think when Barry mixes in with red it
will take that red color and deepen it
up a little bit but in this case it's
kind of a brighter berry red so it's a
red with a little bit of pink mixed in
and I think it really takes the color up
a notch and I think it's beautiful and I
actually think it's very similar to one
of the new Urban Decay Gwen Stefani
lipsticks this is the one called
Wonderland and it has that same kind of
brightened pinkish red thing happening
here and I think both are very gorgeous
I really love a lot of lipsticks from
this Urban Decay Gwen Stefani
collaboration but if you're looking for
something lower cost still very great to
work with the elf fearless is awesome so
there you go guys some things that maybe
you haven't seen or heard a whole lot
about from elfs line that are only a
dollar definitely worth looking into and
some dupes as well who knew so thank you
for watching and I'll see you guys soon
