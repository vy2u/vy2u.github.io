video is kind of piggybacking off of an
idea that I talked about in my beauty
chat video very recently we were talking
about highlights and the fact that
highlights are just coming out like left
and right and really have been for some
time and now I will fully own the fact
that I have tons of makeup I am drawn to
a lot of makeup even outside of what I
feel are sort of my obligations for my
channel you know to try a lot of makeup
review a lot of makeup even just as a
regular person I feel like I am drawn to
want to try the latest and greatest
stuff right but I must admit I think
highlights are one of those areas where
I kind of have some limits
I'm reaching a limit of excitement here
where I feel like I've tried a lot how
many do I honestly need so much of what
I have is really good and this is a
video I might try to do in in different
makeup categories but I wanted to name
off five of the best highlights that you
might already have in your collection so
maybe before you start dropping money on
what's new new new you might go back in
what you have and discover some really
great things so this might prompt some
of that shopping your stash type deal
rediscovered products I love that
concept so much and so in the comments
section if you have any of these that
I'm mentioning definitely let me know
let me know if you've forgotten about
them or are they still like going hard
in your collection you're wearing them
every day I'd love to know but here's
one that is totally rediscovered for me
I hadn't used it in a long time but I've
always thought of it as like upper level
highlight you know and it's the balms
mary-lou manizer this one's so good I
mean it's the ultimate shimmery pearly
highlight I'm wearing that on my cheeks
today it's super glowy it's sort of a
look no further highlight product I mean
I'm not sure when I try this I think
what goes beyond this what really like
highlights and gets off a Glo better
than this I'm not really sure so when I
say that I'm talking for the people who
really want a maximum glow I'm wearing
this in like a sheer way you could build
this up I think even more and have
more pronounced look and that's not for
everyone but for the person who likes
it's borderline gooey sheen on the
cheeks yet it's created by powder I
think this is a great product and it
really had its attention-getting moments
I think before a lot of these other
highlighters came out and it's still
fantastic okay show of hands how many
people having Physicians Formula shimmer
strips highlighter bronzer palettes
sitting in their drawer this stuff I
love this this is great for versatility
and this is the one in Vegas strips that
I'm holding here I think at one time
they had a whole lot more shades than
are currently available but I know Vegas
Strip is one that they still sell and
you just got this awesome like gradient
effect here with the shades and this can
be a nice product to use this eye shadow
because especially if you look from like
this end compared to that end if you
just you know split it up that way you
really can create some contrast with
this but the shimmer is really beautiful
I pointed this out quite a while back
but your top two shades here of this
palette when you blend those together
you get a very similar effect to what
you get from Becca's champagne pop
powder highlight but much like with mary
lou manizer this is a nice powder for
being highly shimmery but you're not
getting clumps of glitter you're not
going to see like a chunkiness
or an odd texture thing happening across
your skin as you apply it's just a
really pretty sheen and I would say
Vegas strip the way it's different from
mary lou manizer this is very pearly and
kind of neutral this definitely takes on
a little bit more of a golden glow and
then if you go a little bit more towards
this end it can be a little bit deeper
glow almost a hint of coppery like rose
gold in there so this could also be a
nice highlight for a variety of skin
tones because if you want to focus more
towards this end that would be nice for
lighter skin but then deeper tan rich
skin tones I think would look gorgeous
with this type of tone another pretty
classic product in the highlighting
world I think are the Becca shimmering
skin perfectors and the liquid has
always been a really standout favorite
for me I like the powders too but the
liquid is really I think something
different and special and this is what
the full-size looks like and right now
I'm kind of working with this little
like sample
tubes that I died and this is with the
opal and I think this opal color really
is something special like there's a
little bit of peachy beige kind of
floating through this shade color wise
and I think when you put it just on top
of skin it makes so much sense it gives
so much glow but I've always said this
about this product you could never like
put a finger on exactly where it's
coming from if you apply that in a nice
sheer way it just looks so incredibly
natural it's so sneaky it just adds the
prettiest hint of doing this really to
the skin and that's a really versatile
product too because you could blend it
in with other things blend it in with a
foundation blend it with a moisturizer
to add a little more radiance there but
it's never over the top and I love that
about this product and again I feel like
it's been around long enough to where
chances are a lot of people probably own
that but have you been using it much
lately I'd love to know and then a
product it's very similar in consistency
to that and I think can kind of be a
dupe so to speak of the Pearl shade in
the Becca shimmering skin perfector is
the elf shimmering facial whip this
stuff has been around since the very
beginning of elf
I remember getting it like a right one
elf first came out in the early early
days of my channel like the first days
of my channel and this is one of the
only products that I know of an elf
slime that's still being sold for a buck
and the shade and spotlight I think is
one of the best they also have a peachy
one there's one called lilac petal but
spotlight is really great and it's going
to be a much loved shade for those of
you out there with a fair skin who feel
like a lot of highlights just don't
really bounce off of your skin very much
this is very very brightening the color
might even be a bit more concentrated
than the shimmering skin perfecter czar
once you blend it out I mean look at
that shine that you're getting right
here I talked about not liking chunks of
glitter in highlight because I think it
makes it look instantly like artificial
and fake and this doesn't have any of
that either it's just a really really
brightening glow the way I like to apply
something like this is I sort of blend
it out just a little bit on the skin and
an elf small stipple brush yes you know
the drill and then you can kind of gab
this right on top of your cheekbone I
already had highlight on so this was not
necessary but I just kind of wanted to
show how I would go about using it
another thing I like about this and I
like this quality in the Becca product
as well is that they don't stay like
super super tacky on the skin I mean you
are using a liquid so if you use enough
of it you know you will feel it there
but if you just keep it nice and light
and apply it with a brush like this that
sort of sheers it out
your going to have just a really nice
texture on top of the skin it's going to
mesh exactly with whatever you had
underneath and then a little something
for my anti highlighter crowd out there
this is something that I've sung the
praises of for the longest time and this
is my laura geller baked french vanilla
highlight so this is the type of
highlight that is going to give the most
subtle glow to your skin like it's just
going to have a tiny bit of pearl to it
but mainly I see it is kind of a
brightening type of shade I will most
definitely link below to the devoted
review that I did on this product but
it's very special it's a really nice
textured powder it doesn't take much
when you put your brush in it or you can
see I just swirl my finger in it you're
getting just the slightest bit of glow
off of this product is I turn my finger
just a little bit of glow not that you'd
even wear it that full out but I'm just
trying to demonstrate what the texture
is like it's very smooth it's very rich
and if you don't have this in like the
freestanding highlight you might check
your collection in a couple of other
places where this shade is included
laura geller has a round compact half of
it as Bronson Brighton and then you've
got the French vanilla in a blush it's
in that one and also more recently I
talked about the palette with three
little shades one is an eyeshadow duo
one is French vanilla and then a blush
so this has been tucked into several
recent Laura Geller products if you're
interested and real quickly I mentioned
the elf small stipple brush great
affordable brush to use with your liquid
and cream highlights cream blushes as
well so I would really recommend that
and then another brush that I've been
using a lot lately is from royal and
langnickel and the mo
line I picked this up at Walmart and it
came with another brush but this
particular brush is called highlight and
glow and I think this is just
spectacular fourth powder highlights as
you can see in comparison to my
cheekbone you know it's going to give
you kind of a pinpointed highlight there
if you want a little bit more diffused
application of powder highlights you
might look to the elf small tapered
brush and that's definitely something to
keep in mind the way you apply these
products particularly the mary-lou
manizer and the Physicians Formula one
that I mentioned toward the start those
products have a whole range so just
because you've seen people to watch them
out and they look just like the most
intense highlight ever there's a range
it can go to that really strong place or
you can keep it very light just by
dabbing the brush in tapping off the
excess and just working your way up a
little bit so anyway that's it I said my
piece I just wanted to talk about none
of these highlights that maybe aren't
getting quite as much buzz lately but
are still every bit as good as what's
hitting the shelves over and over again
from brands that might make you believe
they're putting out the latest and
greatest hope you enjoyed this video let
me know if you'd like to see this type
of video in relation to other products
and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
