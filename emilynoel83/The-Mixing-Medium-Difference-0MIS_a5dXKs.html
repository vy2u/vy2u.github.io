you a little bit about the different
uses of a mixing medium and I'd like to
start off by first saying that I got the
recipe to make my own mixing medium at
home with very inexpensive ingredients
from on course so um you get the chance
to go check out his channel on and it
will show you exactly how to create your
own and more on what it is and the
purposes of it and different things like
that so just wanted to start out by
saying that that he gets all the credit
for what this is and kind of
enlightening me as to how you can use
mixing medium and basically when you
think about a mixing medium it's
something that you can use to basically
change the texture of your powder makeup
so whether that's an eyeshadow a blush
powder even I mean for whatever purpose
you would want to use but I would say
the main thing is it gives you the
capability of taking your eyeshadows and
using them wet but in a way that I mean
this is actually has an ingredient in it
that sort of captures moisture and holds
it in and it's even more effective than
just using water to apply your shadows
wet so but that would be a main thing is
that you could take any shadow and
create your own liner out of it or you
can wear your shadows foiled as some
people call it by applying this and then
applying the shadow so it appears that
it is wet or maybe doesn't even look
what but might look more metallic more
intense you'll notice that different
colors will respond differently when you
start using the mixing medium with them
but there's a there's just a lot of
different uses for it and what I did was
I went ahead and made it and it's one
part glycerin which is something you can
find at walmart for like one or two
bucks for a little tub that's like this
tall oil it's actually clear it's clear
and almost kind of syrupy looking and
it's in a full bottle like shaped about
like this I don't know why I didn't just
bring it out good shape someone like
that and about that
and it's clear and it will be kind of a
syrupy texture if you were to turn it
around and stuff but you use one part
glycerin to three parts and water and
like this is what my little thing I put
a little label on it but I just put it
in a little travel container that i got
from big lots and asset and i just used
what encore suggested but because there
are no preservatives in this so you
don't want to necessarily make a huge
big batch so i just use like the the cap
of my water bottle that i used for the
water to just do that mixing wise and
that way i only had a small amount and
it's you it really takes very little as
you will see to make this effective so i
want to go ahead and show you what i've
done because I've done some swatches to
show you what the difference is between
um wearing a shadow dry and wearing a
shadow wet with a mixing medium and then
I'll show you how I do it so let's go
ahead and turn it around here so these
are several of the shadows that I'm
using one is wet and wild mega shimmer
shimmer dust and the color is pink
orchid so that's the first one the next
one is one of my femme Couture mineral
effects shadows in golden Oasis and so
that this is like a really light shade
sort of light meet mid tone shade and
then a darker shade which is my elf
mineral shadow in confident that's kind
of like a dark taupe so if we take a
look at my hand here the ones with em
are with mixing medium used okay so here
you can see we're looking at the top one
this is the wet and wild shadow you can
see on the left there it's a nice
shimmery shade but on the right see how
much more intense that shimmer is and
then as we go down and look at that gold
shade I mean the gold is nice as is
again but as you see the light kind of
move on that it's really pretty you can
tell any any shadow that has a hint of
metallic nature
to it this will really make the most of
that and then look at the elf it almost
seems like it's a slightly different
color with that because it's picking up
more light it looks more dense and it's
picking up more light on the right-hand
side there and it almost looks more like
a golden eat own and on the left almost
a plummy brown so you know it doesn't
necessarily I'm not really saying that
it makes your shadows better but in some
cases it'll make them either like with
the top it'll make it more intense in
the middle it will make it more metallic
and on the bottom it'll just make it
more reflective of the light so i just
wanted to show you what some of those
different ways are and so once again
here is my mixing medium bottle that I
made and just like a little cheap
plastic bottle that came in a set of
travel things and I also put down there
what my recipe is for it one part
glycerin two three parts purified water
so now I'm going to demonstrate to you
how I go about doing this because you
might say oh what all nice on your hand
but how do I do it so this is what I
would recommend all of those were loose
shadows so I was able to like tap a
little bit out on my hand or you might
just shake this put it on a brush put it
on your eye and then use a flatter brush
to dip into the mixing medium and spread
it around but on your hand obviously
we're going to do this a little
differently so what when I did these
what I'm trying to say is that I tap the
shadow out on to my hand first but you
might also be wondering you might say
well I don't have a lot of loose shadows
will this still work with a pressed
shadow and I'm going about going to show
you that does I'm going to use my Milani
shadow in blue ice and so what I'm going
to do is take my regular shadow brush
dip it in here get a decent amount of
color on it and I'm going to just apply
that right here on my
and get a little color on there so you
can just see what color I'm dealing with
okay so see that blue there it's a
pretty good shade of blue but now what
I've done with my mixing medium since
this will squirt out drops okay and even
a little droplet see if you can see what
the size of the droplet is falling out
on here see that drop that will be more
than what you need okay but I'm going to
use this was used to be a concealer
brush I use it for a number of different
things now but I'm just going to dip
that and by the way if you're wondering
what this is this used to be my ELF eye
makeup remover pads and now it's just a
little palette and I'm just going to
stick the tip of my brush just barely
down in there you don't want too much
and then I'm going to just blend this on
top on top of that blue okay I may not
be holding it very well for you okay and
you can see that that color has already
gained intensity since we've done this
and then might be looking at that and
saying I like that let's see if we can
take it a little further you can layer
it layer the dry on top of the wet and
then blend again with this brush look at
what we've got now you have a totally
different color let's give you some
perspective and show you what it was
like with nothing right next to it wow
it really takes a lot to build up to
that same intensity okay right here no
mixing medium here I'm sorry I've like a
crazy this is with okay and I want to
also try to show you hear that if you
touch it afterwards like this whole side
right here this has the mixing medium
you can touch it and it's not wet to the
touch okay it dries so don't worry about
that but just to show you yeah it takes
a very very little it will take me
forever
run out of this okay so um like I said
you could do this real easily with a
liner brush you could make a cooled
liner out of that blue shade or this
shade down here I mean the options are
just really endless but like I said if
you want more information check out on
course site and he has a great video on
how to make mixing medium how to use it
too so um I hope this helps you guys
