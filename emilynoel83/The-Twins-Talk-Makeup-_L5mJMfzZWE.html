Thanksgiving with there's Rachel and Amy
and we are gonna do a what's in the
twins makeup bag because anytime I've
had the twins in a picture or a video
people have said what are they wearing
on their faces they're so beautiful
we're gonna give away all their secrets
right now - okay you've been using the
same type of foundation as we started
since then wait yeah if we use Clinique
foundation it's super fit so it's really
sheer and if you do have any kind of
acne or anything it doesn't make it
worse it because it's so thin it works
really well in the summertime too
because it's not thick at all and
they're both wearing that now mm-hmm and
then to go with that is this stay matte
or stay neutral it's matte powder from
Clinique just have some runs are here
this is visit Physicians Formula from
Walmart um just for in the wintertime
sometimes not an everyday thing also
this is the same
French Physicians Formula yeah this
stuff this is the shimmer strips so you
can do that like a bronzer and I shadow
or whatever exactly to stay long okay so
probably like a holiday gift either
that's just Seto's different shadows you
usually use pretty like pretty neutral
yeah you know it's nothing like this I
just kind of put on some neutral also
Clinique blush we use thank you keep it
we kind of bury our I like that's one
thing we do very we've got a brown here
a navy and a black and these are just
regular many oh that's gorgeous
I like a base that I put on there keeps
it a little on your finger for me to
show me what color oh that is so pretty
and I just put it on my eye sometimes
that's all I put on and then also other
eyeshadow it helps keep that on like one
day if I what's the shade name on that
in case anybody's in China antique gold
it's called Double Wear stay in place
shadow oh okay that's pretty shade
that's that seems like it would work for
like any skin tone or and then some
shadow link sort of a glow it makes your
eyes pop of shimmer if you can't even
figure out what works best like if you
need mascara and blush mm-hmm I'd say
blush would most people don't know but
it is something that totally just makes
me totally you ready these two products
I'd say mascara
just use very particular protectant in
the hairspray I use just suave American
crafts it yeah okay so Snite so you can
see the way if she's got going on there
I'll just wear it down like this
straighten it usually yeah your hair so
your hair is not quite as long as this
special
so you can see we've got gold kind of on
the inner part of her eye and right now
on her on her left eye I'm starting to
work in the brown and kind of winging it
up a little bit these shades blend
really easy this is the palette I'm
using it's from Urban Decay you can see
the lashes are really thick on her
waterline she actually has a black liner
so that's what kind of gives her that
Julianne Huff's eyes are kind of a
little smaller than her so this kind of
makes her eyes look a little more that
he had eye effect really pretty and her
skin is just very glowy on her lips I
used Mac lip gloss in a nymphet over
Rimmel lipstick in spotlight beige so
that's how you get rid off makeup
I'm taking this little duo here and I'm
using the darker side and I'm just a
little bit goes a long way so I'm just
patting the brush in at once basically
and I'm going back here to her ear if
she were to suck in her cheeks real
quick
you can kind of see where a line might
form there and so that's what I've got
it going off of and then I put it on and
then in that kind of emotion and then I
blend it out in a circular motion this
is the eye with the mascara and then
this is the eye that does not have it
yet so you can see what a difference
that makes for this look
thank you guys so much for being willing
to let me do all that to your face and
show me what's in your makeup bag so
Happy Thanksgiving everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
