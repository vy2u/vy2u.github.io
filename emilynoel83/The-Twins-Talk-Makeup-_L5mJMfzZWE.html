Thanksgiving with there's Rachel and Amy
and we are going to do a what's in the
twins makeup bag because any time I've
had the twins in a picture or a video
people have said what are they wearing
on their faces they're so beautiful so
we're gonna give away all their secrets
right now combination yes combinations
can we used to have a damping we're
younger fair and there in the summertime
I mean like it gets a little more nearby
that definitely not shark at all when we
had the skin problems we used in this
clinic care line and that worked really
well and then the winner i have it's
kind of expensive dry ice to but so i
use like a redness reducing i squash and
just new to choke a kind of you've been
using the same type of foundation as we
started since then wait yeah we use
Clinique foundation it's super fit so
it's really sheer and if you do have any
kind of acne or anything it doesn't make
it worse it because it's so thin it
works really well in the summertime too
because it's not thick at all and
they're both wearing that now mm-hmm and
then to go with that is this stay matte
or stay neutral it's matte powder from
cleaning just have some runs are here
this is um visit physicians formula from
walmart um just for in the wintertime
sometimes done everyday thing also this
is the same branch musicians formula
yeah this stuff this is the shimmer
strips so you can do that like a bronzer
eyeshadow or whatever exactly to stay
long okay so probably like a holiday
gift I that's just set
shadows different shadows there since
you usually use pretty like pretty
neutral yeah you usually it's nothing
like this I just kind of put on some
neutral also clinique blush we use thank
you keep it we kind of bury our I like
this one thing we do very got a brown
here a navy and a black and these are
just regular pan many j is the Rasul
honor it's uh oh that's a gorgeous I
like a base that I put on there can you
get a little on your finger for me to
show me what color oh that is so pretty
and I just put it on my eye sometimes
that's all I put on and then also other
eye shadow it helps keep that on Monday
if I'm what's the shade name on that in
case anybody's interest antique gold
it's called double wear stay-in-place
shadow with balm lip plumper oh that's
one ok that's pretty shade that's that
seems like it would work for like any
skin down or and then some a new mascara
eyeshadow with the legs of a glow it
makes your eyes pop a list and shimmer
if you can't even figure out what works
best like if you need mascara and blush
mm-hmm I'd say blush would most people
don't know but it is something that
totally just makes me sir totally you
ready these two products I'd say mascara
just use very particular Tecton
hairspray I use just swamped generic
hair she crimped it yeah okay so tonight
so you can see the way she's got going
on there no just wear it down like this
for something but I don't really have
straighten it usually yeah your hair so
your hair's not quite as long as special
so you can see we've got gold kind of on
the inner part of her eye and right now
on her on her left eye I'm starting to
work in the brown and kind of winging it
up a little bit these shades blend
really easy this is the palette i'm
using it's from urban decay can see the
lashes are really thick on her waterline
she actually has a black liner so that's
what kind of gives her that julianne
hough's eyes are kind of a little
smaller than hers so this kind of makes
her eyes look a little more of that he
had I effect really pretty and her skin
is very glowy on her lips I used mac lip
gloss in a nymphet over rimmel lipstick
in spotlight beige so that's how you get
Rachel's makeup
I'm taking this little duo here and i'm
using the darker side and i'm just a
little bit goes a long way so I'm just
padding the brush in at once basically
and I'm going back here to her ear if
she were to suck in her cheeks real
quick you can kind of see where a line
might form there and so that's what I've
got it going off of and then I put it on
and then in that kind of emotion and
then i blend it out in a circular motion
this is the eye with the mascara and
then this is the eye that does not have
it yet so you can see what a difference
that makes for this look
thank you guys so much for being willing
to let me do all that to your face and
show me what's in your makeup bag so
happy Thanksgiving everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
