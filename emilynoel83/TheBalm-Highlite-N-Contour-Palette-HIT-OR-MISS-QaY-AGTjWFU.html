review this pallet from the balm for you
it's the highlight and contour palette
and I ordered mine not too long ago off
of the Kohl's website and I have always
been a big fan of the balmes line most
things in their line I have really
enjoyed and I think that you a great job
on pallets not only with the quality and
the palettes but making them just really
fun and entertaining for example this
has kind of a music theme they make it
look kind of like a tour poster and then
on the inside you've got this big mirror
here and then your highlights are on top
your contour products are on the bottom
the top says hit those high notes and
then the bottom says all about that base
has got like the decibels down here
you're getting two shimmery highlights
to matte highlights and then everything
on the bottom is matte including the two
contour shades this they call a bronzer
and then a blush as well so all of my
highlighting and contouring today has
been done courtesy of this palette so I
will be showing you that in a little
demo and kind of comparing a couple of
lower-cost items that you might want to
consider if this is something you're
interested in so I think some high
points of this palette to me are the
fact that matte and shimmer is included
so if you do want to highlight and like
add some brightness to your face you've
got two different tones as matte colors
to do that with and they are very
brightening they're nice textures very
pigmented you can see one is a little
more yellow in tone one has a bit more
peach and then your two shimmery
highlights are kind of distinct tones as
well one really like a bright champagne
type color the other has just a little
more peach happening to it just to hear
more depth and then even with the
contour shades down here again you have
options you know one is a little bit
deeper than the next they're both very
like contour friendly shades the bronzer
I haven't gotten a whole lot of use out
of especially sitting side by side with
those contours it does look a lot warmer
a little more on the orangie side but
then there's just gorgeous like rosy
matte blush so I do really like all of
the variety that I feel like they've
packed in here it does depend on skin
tone but for me like these matte shades
here can almost act well
and all over face setting powder type
things so I've got something like that
in here I've got something for glow the
contour stuff and the blush is really
allotted one palette where I think $36
good quality products I am enjoying it
but there are a few little cons here in
there that I would point out one of them
being these are rather skinny products
in here I mean while they have packed in
a lot look how skinny each of the pans
is you'll see this in the demo but with
the brushes that I use for these
products I don't I don't find it to be a
big issue like I'm not unintentionally
picking up the neighboring product with
my brush but depending on the kinds of
brushes you use I can see somebody bring
it in a big old powder brush and
probably not just being able to stick
very easily to just one shade so that
might be a slight concern with the
layout just the sizing of this also I
kind of wished that the highlights were
even more like up a notch here as I
looked at these I thought that one kind
of looks like mary lou manizer and that
one might be similar to cindy lou
manizer sort of their peachy glowy
highlight but i swatched them
side-by-side with those and they're
really not nearly as glowy is that that
might be good news to some of you who
don't like a really really pronounced
highlight but I sort of wish at least
one of these maybe was on par with those
highlights that everyone's really
familiar with from the balm because I
feel like these are pretty but I kind of
have to apply a lot of one of these
shimmery shades to get a really apparent
glow on my skin you know what I'm saying
and while I'm talking comparisons to
other products in the balmes line I did
look at these two shapes and sort of
compared those to their Bahama Mama
bronzer which is a nice dark cool
bronzer shade and these I think are on
par with that pigmentation wise but
they're not quite the same tone and I
feel like I've tried nearly every blush
that the ball makes and I don't think
this is really similar to anything else
that I have it's beautiful I love that
this is in here I think this tone makes
it really versatile for so many skin
tones because I could see someone with
fair skin wearing this lightly and it
would look really gorgeous but then it
also is kind of buildable so I could see
someone was more
Tanner rich skintone wearing this and
being very satisfied with the look as
well not over the moon with this bronzer
I just find that to be really really on
the warm side for me but having both of
these nice cool shades here I'm not
really going to complain about it but
another thing that I do enjoy about this
palette is that it makes a great
eyeshadow palette my goodness I mean
considering all of the sort of shortcuts
I've been trying to take with my makeup
these days you know I throw this in my
little makeup caddy take it downstairs
with me and I find yeah I can very
easily get a totally workable eye look
using these shades in my crease this
makes a nice warm eyeshadow shade for
sure and then I've got a couple glowy
colors a couple light colors it can do a
basic simple eye look just super easily
so I enjoy that I like finding ways to
stretch a pallet or it beyond the way
it's been marketed to you but before I
get into the demo is one other little
con that I don't want to forget to
mention to you and I don't hold this
against the balm but cold cold you've
got to figure out a way to package up
your makeup palettes that you're
shipping out to people because I
received this in a box just floating
around in there with zero bubble wrap
zero anything was like the only thing in
the box plus like a little shipping
receipt that was it and so three of
these pans popped out and I'm pretty
amazed that they didn't crack and
because they were just completely popped
out of here but thankfully these powders
all stayed intact for me overall I'm
pleased with the variety in this palette
I'm pleased with the quality just
looking at the way everything came
together on my face I like the way it
applied I wasn't having to work hard
with the products the balm generally
always puts out really nicely pigmented
powders so I'll jump into that and you
show you how I put them on I use my
Sigma small contour brush with that
first contour shade one it's a little
bit lighter and I just applied that to
the hollows of my cheeks not super
heavily but you know enough to get an
impact there and then I applied it a
little bit around my hairline as well I
don't go to too crazy with the heavy
contouring on my face most of the time
and I find that this product does nicely
fit my look you know I wasn't having to
be too careful with it but it definitely
does show
then I used my Milani blush brush and I
applied this really pretty kind very
rosy blush shade absolutely love this
color I think it would be very
universally flattering considering the
range you can get out of it you can
apply it very lightly get a very soft
rosy look or build it up more and the
fact that it's matte I think that's
great because then if you want more glow
to supply more of the glowy highlight on
top but then for a little added
brightness on my skin I did use my up
enough highlight brush and I went into
the matte highlight on the far right it
has kind of this buttery tone and I just
applied that to the tops of my
cheekbones and anywhere on my face that
I wanted to bring a little more light to
and those are really pigmented nicely
textured powders I like that there's two
tones in there to use I've gone between
both of them on my skin and they seem to
work well and then I went into the
highlight on the far left that I think
is the brightest of the two and here's
where I feel like you know if you really
want that to show on your skin you have
to build it up a little bit it's not
necessarily a little goes a long way
type of highlight and that might be good
news to those of you who don't like a
you know shout it from the rooftops
highlight anyway but overall the
finished look on very pleased was
absolutely love the combo of having both
matte and shimmery highlights good
products happening down here as well but
if you're looking at this and thinking
you know thirty-six bucks I don't know
if I want to pay that surely there's
another contouring product on the market
that I might like well I do have a
couple that I like that are lower cost
that I think are definitely worth
mentioning I know I've talked about in
both before but the elf contour palette
excuse me aside from one of the pans
just jumping out of the palette at me
here I do think this is a good product I
love the contour shade that's in here
you got a couple of highlights including
one that is that sort of matte buttery
shade that I seem to like to use a lot
and then you got this warmer tone right
over here that might act is more of a
bronzer no it doesn't have a blush in it
but it is a really effective contouring
palette this is like a two-time Emily
award winning thing I really really like
it and the cost is just great I think
it's like a $6 palette then another
thing that gives you an even more
variety here is the contour palette the
ultra contour pal
from makeup revolution love this thing
as well and this is really doing exactly
what the balls palette is because you've
got this range as deep and kind of cool
contour shapes these are matte right
here you're getting your two tones this
one has a little bit more of a
pearlescent glow and then these two
really shimmering shapes here on the end
one is absolutely like crazy shimmery
one is a little bit more toned down and
skin tone but this is also going to be a
fraction of the cost of what you're
getting from the balm I think I paid
like 10 bucks for that so it's true
neither of those contain a blush in
there which I do love that aspect of the
palette from the balm and I really like
the blush that's included but at the
same time the palettes for makeup
revolution and elf are really effective
just from the contouring and
highlighting perspective I think this
makeup revolution one can just take you
much more in a glowy direction the elf
one doesn't have anything extremely like
metallic and Frost in terms of
highlights so in a nutshell yes I like
what the balm is doing here but they're
bringing a highlight and contour palette
into a very like saturated market with
contouring products like this so there
are other options out there I don't
think you have to spend thirty six
dollars to get a decent look you know
but I do really like the balm quality
and if you were wondering about this
wondering if it's good yes I do think
it's good I wouldn't say it's a total
100% everyone needs to rush out and get
this because it's so crazy different I
do find myself glad that the bone added
something like this to their line I
enjoy it I'll continue using it and if
you are looking for something that
multitasks in a lot of ways and don't
forget really nice eyeshadow palette as
well you might be into this so thank you
guys so much for taking time to watch I
hope this was informative for you and I
will see you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
