using a set of hot rollers these are the
ones that I mentioned in my haul and so
many of you said how do you use those so
I'm going to show you exactly how I use
them in this video the placement of the
rollers why I you know put them in like
I do and just some tips for getting the
longest lasting curl out of a set of hot
rollers so with my hair today as you can
see it's kind of basic it's a side part
it's just down but using rollers in your
hair can also be a great base curl for a
lot of different styles you can put your
hair in rollers and then you can do you
know a side-swept look like this you can
pull half of it or you can you know
group this hair into a nice loose bun
and you know that can be a more
texturized interesting look for it so
don't think that the only thing you have
to do with rollers is leave your hair
down because that's so not the case what
I love about rollers the most using hot
rollers in the morning is that you put
them in and you can go off and do other
things you know you're not up slave to
your hair standing there holding the
curling iron waiting for the curl today
if you want to see how the whole process
goes keep on watching
make sure your parents totally dry make
sure all the tangles are out of it and I
like to use a heat protectant spray
before I do any kind of heat styling
right now I have the not your mother's
beat the heat thermal styling spray and
I got this from Walmart and I just like
to kind of put a little bit of that into
my hand and just run my hands all over
my hair then you want to make sure your
rollers are completely heated up one way
you can tell is that there's a dot on
one of the rollers and when that turns
from red to white you know you're good
to go that usually just takes a couple
of minutes but I kind of like to let
them sit and heat for even a little bit
longer just because I feel like the
effect turns out to be better so if you
have extra time and you can just get the
rollers going a little bit sooner I
think you get an even longer lasting
more lofting putting them in I almost
always start with my hair parted on the
side even if I might end up doing a
center part style and flipping part of
it over I just like the effect that I
get when I start on the side I feel like
even if I flip it over it looks a little
less defined you know you don't have
that look of oh here's my rollers right
there shape of the hair just seems a
little more organic I guess when you
start on the side rollers are relatively
small in this set but I generally start
with the larger rollers and use those on
the top part of my head so I've got a
little bit more of a smoother wave up
here and then end with the smaller
rollers toward the bottom and this is
about how long my hair is right in terms
of the clips I'll be using they're
shaped like this they just fit really
snug right over the Roll stuff you see
my part there I'm gonna take maybe an
inch of hair going about halfway back
onto the top of my head and that's gonna
be my first section smaller the amount
of hair you put over the roller the more
effect of the curl you're gonna have if
you put a ton of hair around the roller
you know it's you will get kind of a
softer wave so it's kind of a work in
progress you know trial and error to see
exactly what works the best but I've
just rolled that up find a Coral
I pop it on there and you're good and
see I've got major layers here what else
sometimes do is do a little twist of the
hair and that way it wraps around the
roller a little bit more easily so I
just go around here kind of tap there on
the end of the hair that might want to
fray out and then you just roll roll
roll I'll also do you know kind of a
larger size right on the back here so
I'm pulling up about this much hair and
don't go too much wider than the width
of that roller taking again larger
rollers on the top part of my head and
also use a large roller on this side all
right I just added one more roller right
below I'm the one in my crown another
one over here
something I want to stress is that this
does not have to be perfect I mean this
is just the styling time of your hair if
it gets around the roller and it gets
hot you know and it stays there for
enough time you're gonna end up with a
curl wait I've wrapped them around
because they're going sideways like this
I'm putting those in for volume they're
getting close to my scalp and the hair
is coming right up you see how the hair
is lifting straight up as it goes over
the roller just a quick example of what
not to do is rolling a roller like that
and then letting it like say sag down
like this see how the hair is really you
know wagging you want to keep it rolled
up tight so the hair is kind of coming
right off the scalp and onto the rule
next I'm gonna put in my next sort of
round of rollers I'm going to do those
vertically that way I'm going to get
more of instead of sort of the
old-fashioned wave that you can get from
putting in rollers this way you're gonna
get more of a modern almost like spiral
type curl or wave with this so for that
I'm just gonna take again similar
sections but we're parting it like that
take the roller wrap it around and then
I always wrap these away from my fan do
the same thing just behind that roller
we're going to roll
and I find that these rollers do have
the best effect on clean hair if you're
doing like second day hair that's
already got some product in it the
curled effect is not as strong so here's
what I've done I've got three rollers on
this side three rollers vertically on
this side I've added just a couple more
of those pink mid sized rollers to the
best is probably about a rollers worth
this is a rollers worth and what's back
behind here is maybe two so I've got two
more pink rollers left I think I'll do
those on each side and then I'll do two
orange rollers with what's in the back
and so I'm just going to continue to do
these vertically so wrap around twist
the hair if you need to so now this is
what we're working with with the roller
you're gonna go ahead and leave these in
for say a half-hour or so that's really
great if you can leave them in a
half-hour I've left them in as little as
ten minutes and still gotten you know a
nice wave out of it but I will see you
in a little bit now the fun part comes
and that's taking them out but I first
want to show you while this thing is
mostly empty these go down into the
container here and sit on little posts
that's how the heat gets to the rollers
I'm just gonna start taking them out to
see what I have
something I want to show you now they're
out about the difference in the curls
the ones that we placed going sideways
like this you can see there were larger
rollers number one so the curl is a
little bit looser a little bit larger
but we are getting you know that lift
from here and you can see we're getting
the lift in the crown as well because
that's the way we put those in but then
as you look at the hair that's that's
right down here that we put in with the
roller sideways you can see you're
getting a curl that's going away from
the face a little more going vertically
instead of you know the way we have it
up here styling I'm gonna go for just a
side part how this is today and what I
first like to do is tip my head over
really work my fingers into my scalp and
kind of loosen up some of these curls so
I'll do that and now you can see when
you start to separate those curls the
amount of volume you have really really
increases and then for styling I don't
do a whole heck of a lot to this but
what I will do is take kind of this
front section right here so I go back
about that much pull up this section I
put a little hairspray behind it I take
a teasing comb take any kind of
fine-tooth comb you have teased this
part a little bit and you could tease it
in the crown as well and make it kind of
big back there if you want to but I kind
of just like to get a little bit of like
a side bang almost kind of coming across
here and just by teasing that you get
just a little more control with how this
goes and then I sprayed that I grabbed
this part just kind of how we put it
over the roller spritz it a little bit
on the under side it gives it a little
more texture tease it and then kind of
comb down over it just lightly to finish
the style I'll just give it a little
more spray on what's happening on the
bottom there and then you're done so
that's my tutorial for these hot rollers
even if I were using a different set
I pretty much would put him in with that
same kind of patent a few impressions
about this particular set of rollers one
of the things I love about it so much
and that has set it apart from any
roller set I've had is the price is
really good number one and number two
the rollers are incredibly lightweight
on your head I also like the clips
because these clips do not create any
kind of bump or you know dent on the
hair like that was the issue with my
Remington heated clip rollers I felt
like I would put the clip on and that
would be very obvious where that clip
was and so I had to use different clips
on the top part of my hair here I can
use what's provided and that works fine
keep in mind this is a smaller set of
rollers and that may not be for everyone
not everyone once you know this amount
of curl or wave in their hair when
they're done with it you may just want
you know that volume at the crown and
volume all over and kind of a smooth
look and you can get that with larger
sets of rollers and I've been asked you
know well does the does a curl last a
long time and things like that and for
me my hair does not like to hold the
curl very well and if I go out you know
right out into a lot of humidity will
that affect the staying power of these
curls absolutely it really unfortunately
will but if you're you know staying in
kind of an air-conditioned environment
and you've put a little hairspray on it
the curls will stay there factor that
can improve the staying power of your
curls is the amount of hair you put
around each roll and you can do a little
less and maybe you end up using more of
your rollers all over you're gonna have
better state holding curls and you're
also gonna have a better hold the longer
you can leave the rollers in so just
something to think about there if you're
wanting looser waves or you know not as
tight of a hold put more hair around
each curler and don't leave them in as
long I hope this helped you out if
you're trying to figure out how to use a
set of hot rollers it really helps out
my morning routine because instead of
waiting and going around your hair and
holding with a curling iron you know you
pop these in you do some other things
you get your coffee ready you pack your
lunch and you know before you know it
it's time to take the rollers out and
you've got your style and as you can see
the styling did not take long for this
look so thanks again for watching have a
great day and I'll see you again soon
