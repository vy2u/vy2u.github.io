throwback Thursday on Instagram you pull
up old pictures and now I thought it
would be fun to do kind of a throwback
Thursday makeup edition and I have kept
some things you guys now you know I'm a
makeup freak right we've established
that this should not be any surprise to
anyone there are some things that I have
kept for purely like sentimental
purposes or potentially do purposes like
if I came up with a dupe of one of these
much-loved products from my past you
know that would be really fun but I'm
not using this stuff anymore because
this is stuff that I have had I would
estimate I had some of this just before
I started my youtube channel so that
would be back in 2007 or very early on
in the beginnings of my youtube channel
I think there are some of these things
you guys are gonna see and be like oh my
gosh I remember that or I love that this
is stuff I absolutely loved and most of
it is not around anymore so I've held on
to it it's been in a little bag like
this in my makeup room closet the first
thing I want to show this is something I
really wish they would bring back first
off remember L'Oreal hip you know when
it had like a whole section in Walmart
what about the jelly bombs remember
these weren't these awesome I love these
these had the best scent like a light
kind of vanilla scent I have succulent
which is a light pink I love this red
shade called delectable and plush this
is another pink shade I can still kind
of smell it they don't smell gross I
gotta say I'm not gonna use them but you
know what smell gross but beautiful
shades light sheer colors and they had
such a great texture you know they
weren't sticky at all on the lips but
they were glossy and they had just this
nice slight thickness to them I mean
it's so funny how something you haven't
used in years and years you can really
remember how they felt okay here's
another thing the Milani singles that
came like this I mean these were like
the best shadows so many of these I
remember reading about them being dupes
of this or that Mac shade and I bought
quite a few of these
in Walgreens just on their own and then
I remember when they were being phased
out and Big Lots had so many of them so
I got a bunch of them that way as well
but I love using these singles there so
like buttery creamy smooth remember the
shade called illusion it's like a pink
with a golden shimmer I'm sure these are
ringing a bell with some of you there
was spice a really pretty warm Brown Sun
Goddess this gorgeous gold and they were
just I think above and beyond
you know drugstore shadows at the time
and I feel like drugstore makeup has
progressively gotten better and better
over the years even going back to when
these were in their prime in the
drugstore they would still today I think
stack up fabulously with high-end
shadows those are so great okay my
Milani minerals blush in my tie how many
years did I go on and on about this
product and I have kept it and purposely
not fully used it up which I totally
could have but in case I come up with a
dupe for this shade I still want to have
this on hand and it's like the perfect
matte peachy pink really saturated
pigmented shade I know I got a lot of
people hooked on this including my mom
all I can say is why Milani why why you
discontinue these great things a couple
of other eyeshadows that make me feel so
nostalgic this is one that I think I
repurchase two to three times and it's
this Jane icing in the shade clubbing I
used this so much it's a black with a
little bit of shimmer in it and these
icings were such pigmented shadows they
were kind of on par with those Milani
singles I used that all the time like
kind of as a liner or in the crease and
wet-and-wild mega eyes remember when
they had singles packaged like this and
there was a shade called fine wink it
was this beautiful like kind of topi
pink type shade such a beautiful color
had a little Sheen to it but not too
much shimmer and sparkle and I just
thought this shade was amazing and I
believe this had a cult following as
well so I still have that I just wanted
to toss this out there Rimmel lasting
finish this is still around this is
still an amazing foundation this was one
of the first foundations that I really
fell in love with back in the day and I
loved it when it was packaged like this
in the squeezie to the Mary Kay people
out there could probably tell me if
this lipstick is still around but this
shade called amber suede folks this
doesn't happen to me a lot with
lipsticks this is kind of a deep
I don't know sort of a brick red type
color and I wore it all the freakin time
for news and in my earliest YouTube
videos I'm here you will see me sporting
this one it's not like I really need
this all over again because I probably
got a lot of shades that would be
similar to that if I took the time to
find a dupe but I love that back in the
day again we're talking like 2007-2008
with this stuff this one the label is
almost totally gone this was my first
like high-end eyeshadow trio and it was
from Smashbox it was called smashing
cocktail hour and my sister got it for
me and some sort of like eye tutorial
type kit I used these so much that
perfect pearly white shade that didn't
have any like actual sparkle in it but
just the perfect Sheen for the brow bone
the plum the brown I mean that plum has
a significant dent in it I don't know if
you can see that but that was just a
limited edition thing and that really
got me onto the Smashbox train and to
this day I still love Smashbox shadows
but those things really are some of the
things from my past in my makeup
collection that really stood out to me
like I feel so nostalgic when I look at
these and I think of the days when I use
those and love those and when they were
readily available in stores but as you
all know there is so much turnover with
products in the makeup world you'll love
something it'll get taken off the market
and part of why I like to keep these
things around you know of course it's
not for using them anymore they're so
old but a lot of times with makeup
brands you'll see things kind of come
back into the rotation like maybe it
will have disappeared for years but it
will come back with maybe a newer
packaging or a new name and I'm kind of
waiting for that to happen for some of
these things maybe it's wishful thinking
but it'll be cool when I have the old
thing to compare it to maybe I'm crazy
but I think it's gonna happen so I hope
you guys enjoyed this little walk down
memory lane thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
