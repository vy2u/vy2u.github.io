today um I had a good day I just got
back from a bike ride hence the t-shirt
and the boy Dale and everything um but I
wanted to do a video on tinted lip balms
partially because it was a request and
also because I think it's really timely
to do it right now because summertime
and it's a nice low-maintenance way to
give your lips some color and some
moisture and a lot of times there's an
SPF in these and that can be really
healthy for your lips when you're out in
the Sun all the time so I thought I'd
just go through some of my favorites
I've got let's see one two three four
five six different kinds and they're all
super affordable and are just a good
thing to have in your lip gloss or lip
balm wardrobe but also by the way thank
you to everybody that watched the
announcements video I made and
congratulating me about my job I really
appreciate that um I have one let's say
I'll be one week from yesterday that
I'll start so I don't know if you're
watching this video and like time is
fast but obviously that's wrong but um I
will be starting in a week so this will
be my last week of regular reporting as
I usually do so it'll be fun we're
having a pizza party this Saturday for
my last Saturday newscast so that'll be
fun too but anyway back to the video on
the first one I want to talk about is
kind of a new product from soft lips and
it is the soft lips tinted and it says
it's an SPF 15 it says tinted lip
conditioner
and they have it they have it in two
different shades Rose which I had
initially picked up and I liked it so
much I went back and got the bronze so
if I can show you what they look like
here um this is this is rose and I could
try doing some swatches here but they're
honestly not going to show up that much
um yeah not very much um but these both
have kind of a a little bit of a fruity
scent to them both and the Rose is
really light it's like a really light
fresh pink color on your lips and the
blondes is just as you would expect a
nice warm color if you're gonna look
like have it all over bronze look that
would look really pretty on your lips
and um you know a lot of people love
just regular soft lips so if you like
that you're going to really love these
because it's a nice it's a decent amount
of color it feels great on your lips
feels just like you know what the normal
soft lips
does maybe a little less slick which is
nice especially if you want some staying
power with these but they also have this
nice skinny tube which if you play again
if you like soft lips you're familiar
with how little it is so it's very easy
to apply if you don't have a mirror and
stuff like that and along that same
format another tinted lip balm I like is
the Burt's Bees lip shimmer and I have
like a little pack I think I got like a
4 pack once it comes with a bunch of
different shades but this is by far the
most the tinted bomb that I have with
the most color I mean you can see what I
just put there on my hand this color is
fig and it's light - um kind of a very
little bit deeper shade and all the
Burt's Bees have kind of a minty scent
and
kind of a tingle on your lips so if you
like that you like minty stuff it kind
of makes your breath
feel fresh too these come in a lot of
different colors there's also like just
a one that's just shimmer and so it's
really light and natural so if you like
Burt's Bees lip balm kind of like I said
with the soft lips then you'll probably
be a fan of their tinted stuff and this
has been around for a little while it's
not that new the next one is another one
of those kind of minty feeling bulbs and
it's the one I have on right now as you
can see it's really really natural
there's not a lot of color to it but
there is some and it's the NYX tinted
lip spa and these unlike the round
lipsticks you can see them in the top
and it's kind of like a flat thing like
that and this is what I have on it's a
little bit shiny and it's great nude
actually it's got that tinted feeling
feels so good like I will wear this
sometimes under my lipstick will use it
just with a lip liner or something and
it feels so good this color I don't know
if I said this color is spirit it's what
it's called and these run about oh by
the way these are available in the
drugstore probably less than three bucks
Burt's Bees I don't know I'm thinking
the Avenue of 3 or 4 bucks this is
around 4 dollars on like cherry culture
calm and it's really really good I would
really really suggest you try this if
you've if you're one of those people
that doesn't like heavy lip gloss and
you also don't like - lipstick either
and they have a lot of other shades but
this is so natural and nice um gosh it
just feels really good on my lips like I
keep one to go like that with my lips
because they feel so good so that's a
great one um moving on another new
product you might have heard me mention
in other videos is the hip jelly balls
and I now have acquired another one I
have them in succulent and plush and so
to give you an idea
but those colors look like to me they
smell like cotton candy
yeah they smell so good Luva but um this
is succulent and it's like a berry sort
of shade and then this one is plush and
it's just a nice light pink and I
absolutely love the texture of these
they go on so smooth they're great over
a lipstick and they're great alone
obviously plush since it's so light it
doesn't give off much color but this one
um
when you wear it alone you can tell but
there's something on your lips so I love
the hip jelly bombs they they really
feel like they kind of condition your
lips too they're not just there for the
you know for the gloss or balm it's like
they actually feel like they're doing
something good through their lips
alright this is my second to last one
and it's from ELF and I consider these
tinted lip balms they're the elf candy
shop lip gloss but it's how they feel
like a balm and they're tempted because
I have a lot of you two actually I'm
just going to show a couple they slide
open and this cherry one it actually
comes off with a regice regice tint on
your lips and same for all the colors
they all like this one is no one mayhem
and it's kind of a nude peach color and
it actually does come off that way on
your lips
and it feels good the texture is nice um
it's kind of glossy which is nice and
the smell oh yeah they smell really
really good so you're going to like
those if you can get your hands on them
they're only a dollar piece at elf and
then I'm going to finally end with
something very traditional that you guys
might all have well probably not all of
you but a lot of you will have is your
regular old cherry chapstick and you're
probably thinking I thought she said
tinted lip balms well believe it or not
this does leave a tint on your lips
this will leave your lips a little bit
pink after you wear it it's true and if
you're a chapstick fan and I mean I love
it when I see guys that like to wear
chapstick and you see them put on the
cherry and I'm like ha no your lips are
gonna look a little bit pink after you
get done but it's true
yeah oh it really does um you know I
couldn't even do a swatch for you to
show you because it's it's just that
sheer but especially if you don't
naturally have very pigmented lips which
I don't I'm not all those people where
it's like as I walk around like my lips
look pink all the time some people are
like that and if you are then this is
not going to stand out all that much on
you but you will be able to tell if your
lips are just kind of always just this
nude sort of shade like mine are you'll
be able to tell so I hope you guys found
this sort of review recommendation
helpful for you if you're looking to try
some tinted foot bombs like I said
they're a great great way to get color
on the lips without using a heavy gloss
or lipstick they're very low maintenance
you know you can just put them on don't
need liner or anything and they make
your lips feel good and the SPF is great
and so I hope all these items you found
to be interesting and affordable and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
