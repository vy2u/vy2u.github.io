tuning in for this video well I have a
question for you how would you like to
get some free fake nails and a bunch of
free false eyelashes just for giving me
one of your best beauty tips well you
can do that because this is my tips for
tips giveaway tips as in some free
revlon and runway collection nails and
starlet and also three different revlon
false lashes in flirty intensifying and
lush which are the individual segments
that you can add to your eyes this is a
really really great deal because i'm
just giving this stuff away this is and
you know courtesy of the the people at
Revlon for sponsoring this contest I
think it's great these are also the
lashes that are they're not the
self-adhesive ones they come with the
glue there and this glue does really
work i've been using those lashes is the
individual ones too so they work really
really well but anyway we are starting
this contest off today on june eighth
and this will run through June
fourteenth that will be the last day I
will accept a response on this and then
June fifteenth is when I will name the
winners and i will name for winners okay
so i will go through and i'm going to
randomly pick out through the comments
section so that is where you have to
you're gonna have to leave your comment
on this particular video and i will pick
from those at random I've already
figured out a way that I'm going to do
it to keep it completely random but
there are a few rules first off you can
be an international viewer and and do
this because I know some people you know
don't want to ship internationally but I
know I got a lot of you international
viewers out there so yes please
participate in this and you can only
post one tip don't even try putting your
name on there multiple times because I
will be able to find you and you will
not win you have to be a subscriber of
mine I'd like this to be you know a fun
little reward for the people who have
subscribed to me and been loyal
followers of my videos so thank you to
you and you must be able to give me your
mailing address if you are you know
younger than the age of 18 and you're
watching these videos you know maybe
just check with your parents and make
sure it's okay that you give me your
mailing address i'm not going to like
spam you with a bunch of stuff i'm just
going to send you your little prize
package and again you just give me your
best beauty tip you also will not win if
you just are spamming me with cut with
comments that aren't even real and
aren't even a real tip because yes i
will make sure that it is a real tip
just give me your best beauty tip I'm
not judging this on who has the best
tips but I because I am picking at
random but the idea is that will end up
with a big list of great beauty tips and
people can scroll through and see what
different people's best tips were maybe
it is something that pertains to a
favorite product that you think is just
the best or maybe it is a particular
method or way of doing something that
would really help people so think about
what's going to help people and when you
leave your tips and it's just kind of
for the benefit of everybody who watches
the video then so again for winners I'm
going to have four winners and each of
you will get on some of the Revlon
runway collection nails which I love I'm
giving you all stuff that I really
really like as well the intensifying
false lashes the lush false lashes which
are in little individual segments that
are really really great to use just we
know one or two on the outer corner of
your eye and then the oops groomed a
flirty at set here and it comes with its
own blue and its own kind of
instructions there too so um this is
just a nice little prize package I know
it's not huge but I thought you know I
want to be able to split this up and
give four people the chance to be a
winner so yay um so I guess the contest
is on now if you're watching this place
you have nothing to lose by going ahead
and leaving a comment again make sure
you're a subscriber first because you do
need to be a subscriber in order to win
so thank you guys so much for watching
this video and I hope you have fun with
this contest I hope we all learn a
little something too when we read
different peoples comments so thanks so
much guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
