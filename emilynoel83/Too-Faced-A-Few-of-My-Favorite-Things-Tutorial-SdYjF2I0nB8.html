holiday glam type I tutorial using one
of the palettes have been talking about
a lot lately it's the two-faced if you
are my favorite things and I have a
review on this on my Express channel i
also mentioned this in my top holiday
palettes and gift sets video on this
changes a few of my favorite shades to
create this look um it's using some of
these deep jewel tones over here some of
these neutrals maybe a little bit of
this go there's so many different
directions you can go with a palette
like this so this is just one idea i
hope you like it i'm starting with this
shape called crisp apple strudel it's a
nice taupe color and this is going to go
all over my lid just patting it on with
my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush and
i'll link to all my brush info below i'm
going to clean off my brush a little bit
and go to a slightly lighter shade here
called cream-colored ponies it's just a
mad creepy aid i'm going to get a little
bit of that just to lighten up my inner
corner next to the crisp apple strudel
is a shade called woolen mittens to fly
this to my crease from the inner corner
to the outer corner you could stop right
here with those two shades and there's
like a nice little daytime look so we're
going to deepen things up with one of my
favorite colors in this palette it's
right over here it's kind of a sparkly
dark teal called blue satin sashes and
so I've got some of that on a flat brush
and the first thing I'm going to do with
it is just Pat it on my outer most
corner here and then I'm going to get a
little bit more on my brush tap off the
excess and get a little bit into my
crease as well you can just do this by
flipping your brush over and then you
start wedging it there into your crease
but to make this look a little bit
different I wanted to have this little
bit of edge here so I'm going to take my
brush with the tip of it down into the
product I'm going to just place it on
the outer corner of my eye and just kind
of lightly practically draw the color
right in there as if I'm pointing back
to the edge
of my eyebrow and then just going to
fill in that little triangle we created
now I want to maintain that edge but i
am going to blend over the top part of
this shade just to make that a little
bit softer and help it transition into
our next shade a little more easily the
next shade i'm going to is this maroon
right here called soiree and like the
blue satin sashes color it's got a
little sparkle but really i'm not too
much Sparkle comes off on your eyes so
it ends up looking a bit more mac
getting a teeny bit of that color on
this light wispy ether t6 blending brush
from sigma i love using this and i'm
going to start right here kind of
innermost corner just barely above my
crease and i'm going to start pulling
that color right above the blue and it's
kind of overlapping with some of that
soft matte brown we put in the crease
toward the beginning also so it's a nice
kind of blended look here on the top
part of the eyes you can see i'm
blending over to the edge of that blue
but i'm not dipping down below it and
i'm just going in with my bare brush
paying attention to all the edges of our
colors here so making sure that maroon
is softened and then i'm going to go
ahead and do my highlight which will be
the cream color ponies matte cream shade
i just love the names officiates in this
ballot so cute and then i want to go to
this shake called party time get a
little bit of that on my finger here and
I'm just dabbing that right here on the
outer part of the lid i think it just
ties in the blue really nicely and
something about it looks kind of cool
overlapping the taupe shade so i'm just
doing that right here on this part of my
lid now we're going to work on the
shadow under our eye and i'm going to go
back to blue satin sashes i'm applying
this to the outer part of my lower
lashline and I'm kind of connecting it
up with this line we created right here
on our outer edge then going back to our
Crisp apple strudel shade anybody hungry
yet oh sounds so taking a little bit of
that under the rest of my eye so it's
going to look a little bit glowy there
on the low
I'm going to line my inner rim with my
Rimmel scandaleyes and nude then i'm
using my makeup geek a teal liner such a
pretty color on the shades called fame
i'm using my Real Techniques fine liner
brush for this is gonna take this across
my upper lash line and I'm just stopping
here at my outer corner then I'm going
to give my lashes a curl i'm using the
better than sex mascara that comes with
this palette and i'm going to apply that
to my upper and lower lash next step
with the lashes is not so much for
thickness but more for the shape i
really like the way a lash that has a
little bit of flare a little added
length at the ends i really like the way
that looks with this shape of eyeshadow
so this is just a pair of lashes i'm not
even sure what style it looked at me a
little bit like the demi wispies but
this is a different set that i had
trimmed down just a little bit if you've
got some of those half lashes you know
those could be great for something like
this but i'm just going to put on some
glue and then pop that right there on
the outside so there's the finished look
as you can see those lashes kind of
coming up right in line with the angle
of our eye shadow there on the outside
so that's just kind of a fun way if you
don't want to mess with winged liner you
can use your eye shadow to kind of mimic
the winged liner look so I did use a
couple other things from this palette
let's see i use the chocolate soleil
bronzer which is just a matte bronzer
that i use a lot anyway outside of this
palette and i used them melt into spring
blush for a little bit of peachy glow
there on the cheeks on my lips i kind of
wanted to tie things together with just
that softest bit of maroon that we had
up above our crease so i used this NYX
lip liner and plum been using this liner
a lot lately with some of my deeper
Barry looks and then the gloss that I've
got on top is the essence stay with me
long lasting lip gloss and the shade is
called choose food is a little idea for
something you can do with your two faced
a few of my favorite things palette or
any similar shades that you can round up
that you might already have thanks to
everyone who requested a tutorial with
this and have a great day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
