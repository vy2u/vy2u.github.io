holiday glam type eye tutorial using one
of the palettes I've been talking about
a lot lately it's the Too Faced a few of
my favorite things and I have a review
on this on my express Channel I also
mentioned this in my top holiday pallets
and gift sets video on this channel is a
few of my favorite shades to create this
look and it's using some of these deep
jewel tones over here some of these
neutrals maybe a little bit of this girl
but there's so many different directions
you can go with a palette like this so
this is just one idea I hope you like it
I'm starting with this shape called
Crisp apple streudel it's a nice taupe
color and this is going to go all over
my lid just patting it on with my Sonia
Kashuk small shadow brush and I'll link
to all my brush info below I'm gonna
clean off my brush a little bit and go
to a slightly lighter shade here called
cream colored ponies it's just a matte
cream shade I'm gonna get a little bit
of that just to lighten up my inner
corner next to the Crisp apple strudel
is a shade called woolen mittens apply
this to my crease from the inner corner
to the outer corner you could stop right
here with those two shades and there's
like a nice little daytime look so we're
gonna deepen things up with one of my
favorite colors in this palette it's
right over here it's kind of a sparkly
dark teal called blue satin sashes and
so I've got some of that on a flat brush
and the first thing I'm gonna do with it
is just Pat it on my outermost corner
here and then I'm gonna get a little bit
more on my brush tap off the excess and
get a little bit into my crease as well
you can just do this by flipping your
brush over and then you start wedging it
there into your crease but to make this
look a little bit different I want it to
have this a little bit of edge here so
I'm gonna take my brush with the tip of
it down into the product I'm gonna just
place it on the outer corner of my eye
and just kind of lightly practically
draw the color right in there as if I'm
pointing back to the edge
my eyebrow and then just gonna fill in
that little triangle we created now I
want to maintain that edge but I am
going to blend over the top part of this
shade just to make that a little bit
softer and help it transition into our
next shade a little more easily the next
shade I'm going to is this maroon right
here called soirée and like the blue
satin sashes color it's got a little
sparkle but really uh not too much
sparkle comes off on your eyes so it
ends up looking a bit more matte getting
a teeny bit of that color on this light
wispy ether t6 blending brush from Sigma
I love using this and I'm gonna start
right here kind of inner most corner
just barely above my crease and I'm
going to start pulling that color right
above the blue it's kind of overlapping
with some of that soft matte Brown we
put in the crease toward the beginning
also so it's a nice kind of blended look
here on the top part of the eyes you can
see I'm blending over to the edge of
that blue but I'm not dipping down below
it and then I'm just going in with my
bare brush paying attention to all the
edges of our colors here so making sure
that maroon is softened and then I'm
gonna go ahead and do my highlight which
will be the cream colored ponies matte
cream shade I just love the names
officiates in this ballots so cute and
then I want to go to this shake called
party time get a little bit of that on
my finger here and I'm just dabbing that
right here on the outer part of the lid
I think it just ties in the blue really
nicely and something about it looks kind
of cool overlapping the taupe shade so
I'm just doing that right here on this
part of my lid now we're gonna work on
the shadow under our eye and I'm gonna
go back to blue satin sashes I'm
applying this to the outer part of my
lower lash line and I'm kind of
connecting it up with this line we
created right here on our outer edge
then going back to our Crisp apple
strudel shade anybody hungry yet Oh
sounds so taking a little bit of that
under the rest of my eye so it's gonna
look a little bit glowy there on the
lower
I'm gonna line my inner rim with my
Rimmel scandaleyes and nude then I'm
using my makeup geek teal liners such a
pretty color on the shades called Fame
I'm using my Real Techniques fine liner
brush for this it's gonna take this
across my upper lash line and I'm just
stopping here at my outer corner then
I'm gonna give my lashes a curl I'm
using the better than sex mascara that
comes with this palette and I'm gonna
apply that to my upper and lower lash
next step with the lashes is not so much
for thickness but more for the shape I
really like the way a lash that has a
little bit of flare a little added
length at the ends I really like the way
that looks with this shape of eyeshadow
so this is just a pair of lashes I'm not
even sure what style it looked at me a
little bit like the demi wispies but
this is a different set that I had
trimmed down just a little bit if you've
got some of those half lashes you know
those could be great for something like
this but I'm just gonna put on some glue
and then pop that right there on the
outside so there's the finished look as
you can see those lashes kind of coming
up right in line with the angle of our
eyeshadow there on the outside so that's
just kind of a fun way if you don't want
to mess with winged liner you can use
your eyeshadow to kind of mimic the
winged liner look so I did use a couple
other things from this palette let's see
I use the chocolate Soleil bronzer which
is just a matte bronzer that I use a lot
anyway outside of this palette and I
used the melt into spring blush for a
little bit of peachy glow there on the
cheeks on my lips I kind of wanted to
tie things together with just that
softest bit of maroon that we had up
above our crease so I used this NYX lip
liner and plum been using this liner a
lot lately with some of my deeper berry
looks and then the gloss that I've got
on top is the essence stay with me long
lasting lip gloss and the shade is
called choose me this is a little idea
for something you can do with your Too
Faced a few of my favorite things
palette or any similar shades that you
can round up that you might already have
thanks to everyone who requested a
tutorial with this and have a great day
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
