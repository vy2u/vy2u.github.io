in that I ordered from Ulta I ordered a
pretty much as soon as I saw it because
I just fell in love with these colors
from Too Faced it's called the ala mode
eyes collection and as you can see it's
a collection of some neutrals some warm
neutrals basically and then a couple of
pops of color came in on Friday I did a
look with it on Saturday using the pink
and the navy Mainland today I was going
to use some of these corals and I wasn't
even really planning to shoot this look
but I just decided eh what the heck
we'll see what happens and you know this
is something that I plan to review in
the future just so you know but I'm just
in that trying it out phase right now
but the look I came up with has like a
little pop of some peach on the lid
fades out with kind of a coppery color
and then if you look real close you can
see that blueish pop there on the lower
lash line let's just get started here's
the look so I've already applied an eye
primer I used bare minerals prime time
and now I'm gonna go to my light shade
that I'm putting right around the inner
corner and that is this color right here
la Cosette I'm just gonna take that
right around the innermost corner I'm
taking this shade called Riviera which
is a little more creamy and I'm just
going to apply that right here next I'm
taking this peachy shade yard in and I'm
just picking some of that up again with
the same flat brush and this is what I'm
going to pack all over the rest of my
lid you can really build up that peachy
color if you just you know apply a
little more and keep packing it on I
think it's so pretty next I'm taking a
cote d'azur this pretty taupe shade I'm
first putting this on the outer part of
my lid just patting it on there and then
I'm going to flip my brush around and
pull that shade into my crease and I'm
you can see I'm really using the tip of
this brush so I'm not going on top of
anything that's on my lid but I'm just
wedging it right there in the crease
then I'm gonna go in with a fluffy brush
and I'm kind of focusing this on the
edge of the color just to blend it out a
little more and I'm cleaning off my
brush real quick and I went to
deepen up the look just a little bit
more and I'm taking day lemare which is
this pretty blue right down here it's
starting small with this shade and
focusing it in my very very outermost
question you've got it on your lid then
pull it up into the crease just a little
bit it really works nicely alongside
these other colors next I'm taking a
bear fluffy brush and I'm just gonna
again blend over the edges of what I
just did can is a really pretty coppery
color so I'm taking my itty bitty Sigma
e30 six blending brush and this is going
to kind of be like a transition shade
this is gonna be very visible even when
our eyes are open we're gonna have this
pretty warm glow on the edge of the look
using Riviere as my highlight again a
creamy color but it does have some
shimmer and that's what's gonna come up
closest to my eyebrow want this pretty
peach shade to get lost in all this
blending so I'm just gonna take a little
bit on my finger and just dab that over
my eye see how the shade really comes
back to life there and just focus that
right in the center of the lid next i'm
going to do my waterline and I am using
the Rimmel scandaleyes pencil this is in
the shade deep blue and this is just a
non shimmery liner that's really long
wearing
I love the nude one for my waterline as
well for some brightening but blue this
color blue can be actually really
brightening for your waterline also it
really makes your eyes look nice and
bright and white and also it's kind of
trying to wedge it in between my lashes
especially here on the outer part then
I'm taking de la Mer which is the
gorgeous blue in this palette and I'm
gonna be going over my liner there just
getting a little bit of this smudged all
across my lower lash line
did I just whistle a little bit when I
said lash line lower lash line and then
just underneath that I'm going back to
my taupe shading a little bit underneath
so kind of the blue has somewhere to
fade to I'm also using Navy liner across
my upper lash line it's a very dark Navy
the
this is the elf waterproof eyeliner pen
in midnight starting that right here in
my innermost corner I am going for a bit
of a wing here on the outside so just
kind of turning it up there filling in
any gaps and then for a little better
connection with the lower lash line I'm
going back to the blue this time I'm
using an angled liner brush instead of
my smudge brush for a little more
precision and I'm just gonna go
basically right under that wing and pull
that navy color down to my lower lash
line again just making it all look nice
and cohesive there next up I'm curling
my upper lashes I'm applying a couple of
coats of my Tarte lights camera lashes
mascara and for a really smudge free
look on the lower lash line I'm using my
covergirl LashBlast clump crusher
water-resistant down here this lasts a
really really long time yeah and you
totally don't have to do any false
lashes with this look but I was just
itching to try these new ones I picked
up from Ulta they're the curvy style um
for 140 and if you want just a really
you know beginner style false lash
tutorial i'll link to mine below so
that's my finished look with the Too
Faced alamode palette again something I
definitely plan to review so keep an eye
on the Express channel for more on that
as for other parts of this look I am
wearing my maybelline color whisper in
pinup peach I love this I think it
works really well
alongside this look and those little
pops of coral and copper that are
happening on the eyes and then on my
cheeks I'm wearing my sleek palette this
is the blush by three in pink lemonade
and I did use some of this pinky cream
blush first and then I topped it with
the warmer of the two powder blush and
as which is more of like a Corley shades
so that's giving me some glow on the
cheeks you know it's a shimmery blush so
you don't have to go overboard with you
know more highlight on top of that I
hope you
enjoy this look just experimenting a
little bit thought I'd bring you along
for the ride so thank you for watching
and I'll see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
