day and a Happy New Year so far this is
going to be a tutorial using the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette this is a
brand new palette from Too Faced as you
can see it's got a lot of neutrals in
there at first glance it has some
elements that remind me of Too Faced
natural at night and also just the
natural eye palette with some other
stuff thrown in as you can see and a
couple of the key shades for this look
are the gold and the burgundy and I
think even if you don't have this
palette if you have similar shades to
that you might consider combining them
for a look I think it makes a really
pretty effect taking my Sonia Kashuk
small shadow brush and going into the
gold I'm just going to Pat that shade
all over my lid and it's a really nice
gold color you know it's not too brassy
it's not very orange II just a nice
classic gold then I want to get kind of
a natural crease shade going so I'm
going to go to this color right here
it's a matte cool brown just using kind
of a fluffy brush getting it right here
to the innermost part of my crease and
then I'm going to pull it outward not
really trying to make any sort of shape
with this on the outside I'm just
basically getting it in every part of my
crease then I'm going back with the
small shadow brush and I'm going to this
nice deep burgundy shade first just
going to tap it right on the outer part
of my lid and once you've got that area
kind of covered I bring it in I don't
know about a third of the way so it's
just slightly starting to overlap the
gold I think those two colors look so
pretty
side-by-side like that then I'm going to
get a little more on my brush and just
flip it over and begin wedging that
burgundy right there in the outer part
of the crease I want this look to have a
distinct edge to it so I'm just taking
this small brush and almost like
creating a wing you know but really just
a little line of shadow so the look does
have kind of stopping point there and
then I just make sure that my shadow is
is most concentrated right around this
bottom part and then we're going to
blend it out so it looks like it kind of
fades away a bit toward this top area so
I'm just taking a bear
fluffy shadow brush I'm going to run it
over the border of the burgundy that we
put there then for a really pretty
effect on the edge of our crease color
I'm going to go to this shadow right
here it's a really pretty brownish shade
with just a hint of copper interesting
this small kind of detailed brush I'm
using a very light touch and I'm just
going above you know anything that went
in my crease we're going to clean up the
look a little bit I'm going to apply
this matte cream shade as my highlight
one step just kind of overlaps the other
this is going just under my eyebrow on
my lower lash line I'm taking a precise
angled brush and I'm going into the
Burgundy I'm just going to carry right
off of my edge in my shadow and get this
really really close to the lash line
like just right up in between the lashes
then see how we've got this nice amount
of shine here on the lower lash line
that's from the gold shade the same gold
that we put on our lid so I'm going to
take a less precise brush this is my
smudge brush and I'm just going to take
that shadow um underneath where I did
the burgundy and all the way in kind of
brings the look full-circle gives a
really nice accent to your lashes when
you put mascara on next up I'm going to
line my lower inner rim with this liner
from Jordana it's called espresso last
and so the twelve-hour made to last
pencil taking that all across my
waterline and I'm going to take that
across my upper lash line as well I'm
not winging this out I'm just really
following closely to my lashline the
nice thing when you're really looking
into this mirror doing something you get
the smell of this eyeshadow and it
actually smells kind of like that
chocolate Soleil bronzer as kind of a
sweetness to it I love that do not lick
the eyeshadows I'm just curling the
lashes using Clinique high-impact
mascara and just get a coat of that on
upper and lower lashes and then these
are my salon perfect demi whispies a
little bit flared at the end it really
works well with the shape of the
eyeshadow so I'll apply those so there
you go that's the finished look I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial I'm probably
going to be doing a review or something
more I'm giving you more information and
swatches and stuff on this palette but
so far I'm really enjoying it and as for
the rest of my face I do have on my NYX
blush and pinched it's a really pretty
peachy coral and then on my lips I'm
wearing the Too Faced la creme lipstick
in pink chocolate it's just a nice
creamy shade like a deep ma wysz rose
kind of color and then over the top of
that for a little bit of shine and to
pick up on a little bit of the gold
that's going on in my eyes I use this
Rimmel stay glossy lip gloss and the
shade is endless summer so I just put
that over the top so thank you so much
for watching this tutorial guys I hope
you're having a great day and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
