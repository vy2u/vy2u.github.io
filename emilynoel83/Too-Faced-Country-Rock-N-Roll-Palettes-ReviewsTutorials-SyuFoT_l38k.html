bit country and a little bit rock and
roll excuse the Osmonds reference but I
will be reviewing these two new pallets
from two-faced and showing you a little
tutorial from each one along with the
individual reviews I'll make sure to
compare these two pallets and let you
know how they stack up with some other
Too Faced palettes that I know and love
so I'm gonna start off with the country
palette and first off I did try to do my
best like Carrie Underwood loose waves
for this video this says Nashville nudes
eyeshadow collection and when you open
it up it's got that same format that a
lot of these two-faced pallets have and
you do have a little guide here that
takes you through each of the looks that
are lined out right here in the palette
so there's a day a classic and a fashion
look do have a mirror right behind this
little pamphlet which i think is really
handy I love having mirrors in my
palettes and I really wanted to just
fall in love with this palette because I
love the thought of a country music
themed palette I think just the whole
music theme in general with these two is
so so cute when I open this one up and I
saw that some of the shadows are named
cowboy take me away famous in a
small-town all-american girl I'm like I
love those songs but you really get to
looking at the textures of these shadows
you can see that there's really one
matte shade dolly the really dark brown
does come off without much shimmer on if
you look horizontally you can see your
top trio is gonna give you a pretty
natural classic type of look and the
next one down you know you got a little
more color to work with with that pinky
shade and the purple and then your
bottom one is a little bit more of a
blue toned silvery very cool or you can
mix all these up and work from all over
the palette and that's what I did for
the little demo I'll be showing you but
to look at the swatches you see what I'm
talking about lots and lots of shine I
really wish there was a little more
matte happening in this palette because
the texture of cowboy take me away that
really pretty soft peach is so wonderful
this really does matte shades really
well and I always want to see more of
them in there
Hallet paper roses shade it looks really
pink in the palette but it comes off
more golden in the Swan couple of these
shades I found to be especially like
gritty in texture one of them is a
yellow and that's that shade right up
here at the top very hard to really
build up the color on my lids it was a
little flaky I'm some glittery fallout
with that bluebird was a little bit
gritty as well takes a little more work
to build up and I don't feel like it
translates on the eyes which with as
much blue intensity as it does here in
the palette I want to walk you through
this look and then explain a little more
and by the way for both of the different
looks I will have all the makeup I'm
wearing all over my face listed in the
infobox as well but to start off I prime
my lids and then I used famous in the
small town that pearly white right
around my innermost cordon I used yellow
all over the lid and like I said took a
little work to build up not the easiest
color to work with and then I used dolly
the deep brown as an outer corner type
shade I also placed it right up there in
my crease with my small flat brush and
then I used a fluffier brush to buff
that out a little bit and if you wanted
to you could stop here and you've got a
very classic neutral type of eye look
but I kept going of course and I went to
paper roses and I use this as my
transition type color I blended it right
on the border of the brown and I used
the matte peach cowboy take me away as
my highlight right up under my brows for
the lower lash line I wanted to work in
some of the Blues a little bit so I used
Bluebird with my smudge brush just on
the outer corner of my lower lash then I
worked in word with Nashville which is a
really like steely blueish silver type
color and I didn't feel like I got a
great color punch with these not a lot
of blue really stood out finish off the
look I pulled in my Milani
almond cream shadow stick and I used
that to brighten my lower waterline and
I used my Too Faced eyeliner in perfect
Navy across my upper lash line and I
topped that again with Blue Bird and
then I just finished the whole thing off
with some mascara on my upper and lower
lashes and it's not that I'm really
disappointed in the
look that I came out with I mean I think
it's a pretty latency that this palette
does have the potential to go deeper and
darker if you used more of the dolly
shade or maybe put a nice rich deep blue
cream shadow base under Blue Bird you
could bring out more of that blue in
tenses and what you need to know about
this palette overall very shimmery if
you try to steer clear of shimmer you're
gonna have a hard time with that here
because there's only one truly matte
color can look kind of right here at
these shadows and see you could pull off
a pretty standard neutral type look but
again I have issues with this color
right here I think that could have been
a really gorgeous if it were a more
buttery smooth texture and not quite so
flaky so as much as I wanted to love
this palette I love my country music I
love my Carrie Underwood's just can't
get that excited about this one I would
like to see more variety in colors more
variety in the textures that they're
giving us instead of just so much
shimmer for now let's take a look at the
rock and roll palette so this palette
super cute on the outer packaging as is
the other one too my safety pins on the
outside it says I heart metal right
there in the corner and then when you
open it up there's that space for the
little how-to guide and your mirror and
then all the shadows inside and very
much like the country palette there's a
lot of shimmer in this one as well the
light shade in the upper left called
rockabilly is matte everything else has
some sort of shimmer or sparkle in it
but it's varying textures there are a
couple of these shapes that I think
flake glitter a little bit and then
there are some others that you know
appear to have some glitter but they
still do apply pretty smooth would you
look at the swatches you'll see
something I was a little disappointed
with with this palette were the lightest
shades
I thought rockabilly that matte cream
shade was really good but then new wave
and new romantic underneath it
I just thought we're lacking a little
intensity and new wave does have some
glittery fallout with it as far as the
other shades and the palette I think
they swatch beautifully I think you've
got a lot of deep jewel tone colors and
I personally really like those kinds of
shades the gold in here I think it's a
stunning tone of gold I think it can
make a great accent paired with like any
of these other deep colors but
unfortunately the texture of this shed
it seems really off to me I really have
to make sure I put it on top of the base
otherwise I have fallout and Sparkle
everywhere so that's a shadow I have an
issue with with the fallout and also a
little bit of glittery
like light dusty type fallout with this
Center highlight shade right here
obviously some pros and cons there with
the textures of these shadows but as far
as the overall color selection I really
would have liked to have seen a few more
mattes in here maybe just at least one
of these deeper shades could have been
met to give you just a little more
variety and the kinds of looks you can
pull off and the way they come off on
your eyes I've got to admit I love the
plum I love this like deep sapphire blue
I think this dark olive green is
gorgeous let's check out the tutorials
so you can see what I'm talking about
here I first primed my lids and then
I've used a small brush to put pop that
deep plum all over the outer part of my
lid I also patted that up into my crease
as well then I used my Sigma e25 brush
to get a more diffused application in my
clay also blended over the border just
with a bare brush to get the smoothest
border pocket I used a smudge brush to
apply the plum all the way under my
lower lash line
I used a specific base I used my
back-to-basics smudge pot from Elle lie
that on the inner part of the lid and
then I just used a small brush to Pat
that gold color very carefully on took
it all around the inner corner you still
have a little bit of fallout but I think
this helped the situation quite a bit
used my M cosmetics water liner in black
night on my inner Rin I used my Jordana
color nd black liquid liner on the upper
lash line I applied some mascara to my
upper and lower lashes and I also added
some false lashes as well to really give
it that glammed up rock-type will
actually love the finished look that I
got from this palette Inc the plum with
that fun pop of gold is just really cool
overall I really like the jewel tones in
this palette I wish there were more
variety and textures as in you know
having some more matte shades in there
but something this palette really
reminds me of it's got some stiff
competition it reminds me so much of my
urban decay
smoked pallet this ballot I mean I love
this you know right up there with any of
my naked palettes if not more I think
this one is so so versatile you've got
like matte brown and black some other
matte shades up here some really deep
jewel tones and it just totally reminds
me of this kind of a palette but I think
I like the textures from Urban Decay
even better because as opposed to having
you know a lot of sparkle thrown into
these shades you've got smoother
textures that are still really pigmented
I just think the smoked palette is one
of the best things even DK has come out
way so if I was liking this kind of a
concept but I had to choose between the
two I would definitely go with the
smoked palette over this but if you just
were comparing these two side-by-side I
think I do kind of like the colors that
are in the rock-and-roll palette over
the country one I think this is total
personal preference so I'm just throwing
out an opinion there I think they're
both pretty but I find this one to be a
little more fun but as you heard
throughout the review I think they both
got their pros and cons individually as
far as this whole idea of country and
rock-and-roll themed eye palettes I
loved it I loved the thought when I
first heard like I caught some kind of
Instagram posts that Too Faced was
coming out with these I thought oh my
gosh what a cute idea you know I think
they're gonna do something really
awesome with this packaging is perfect
on each of these but once I really got
to using the palettes it's like I like
them but I don't love them you know what
I mean I would have picked these up
because I love to collect Too Faced well
that's basically I'm like a two-faced
palette enthusiast I have a video on all
my favorite ones actually but when it
comes right down to how well do these
stack up with some of the other
two-faced palettes that I really really
love you know I wouldn't find myself
recommending these over the romantic eye
or natural at night or even the ala mode
palette or the chocolate bar like I
think they've got some really really
strong palettes that are great in color
variety great in variety of textures and
just the quality of each shade is so
good then I pull out these and I feel
like there are quite a few more
questionable shades not that I can't
pull off a good look with either of
these because I think I can
but when we're drawing comparisons here
I don't think these would be my
favourites I don't feel like they're
total must-haves but if you're someone
who like I said likes to just keep up
with all the latest Too Faced palettes
they are really adorable and they might
be fun just more as a collector's type
item so thanks so much for taking time
to check out this two-in-one review I
hope you guys have a great weekend and
I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
