tutorial today using one of my new
Christmas gifts it's the out of the
two-faced world domination tour little
pallet said it's actually kind of like a
jewelry box and now what I lift it out
of there is this pallet that has a lot
of different I lip it's all eyeshadows
here and blush actually so what I've
done is I've used the the purple and
blue shades I've created sort of a smoky
look there the thing about these colors
is it doesn't seem like this is the
first time I've actually used them and I
thought well I'll just see what kind of
a tutorial I can put together so if you
look at those colors and fear them and
think those are gonna be you know a
little too loud for me they really are
pretty toned down there's more color to
them than what you're actually able to
see through this camera shot but I mean
for some people that's a good thing that
they're not you know SuperDuper colorful
and rich and for other people it makes a
color like that usable because it's more
subtle so I just kind of take from that
you know whatever you know whatever
works for you that may be a positive or
a negative
so anyway I'm gonna go ahead and do a
tutorial just showing you how this works
and maybe kind of reviewing it along the
way then so what I'm going to start out
with is this kind of blueish silver
shade here and I'm going to use my eye
shadow blush I've already you put on a
primer I'm going to just apply this all
over the lid so
this shade I mean I am kind of having to
layer it on I feel like these are
applying differently than some of my
normal two-faced shadows for some reason
I feel like I have to kind of dip back
into them multiple times I mean it's
just more of an inconvenience than
anything but as you can see they're got
my first layer just kind of covered my
lid with that and then I'm going to take
my crease brush and I'm gonna dip into
this turquoisey kind of shade in the
palette that you see there and I'm just
going to use that all over my crease
area here and you can see it's giving me
a nice sort of contour but it definitely
doesn't look like it does in the package
they're just kind of applying that all
over and now that I've gotten kind of a
solid application of it I'm going to
concentrate it now a little bit more
with my finer brush on the inner half
here because I'm going to use the purple
which is a little bit darker on the
outer half of the crease so you can see
a little more of that blue coming out
right there
and we'll go over to kind of blend out
any harsh edges that we've created there
with a bigger brush
okay now this properly kind of shade I'm
gonna use that with the small crease
brush once again and I'm going to
concentrate this on the on the outer
part of my crease kind of working in
that outer outer V shape you can see the
shape sort of developing there but as
you can I mean it's definitely that
appears to be a very bold color in the
package and I'm not seeing a lot of bold
colors here I'm seeing a hint of that
color and I also did use a primer that
typically works really well my Mary Kay
eye primer which works pretty well and
you know bringing out what color the
shadow might have so anyway it's it's
nice its smoky it's kind of soft I'm not
saying you know I don't like it but
however it's just not it's not the color
you're looking at in that package to me
anyway and so next I'm going to use this
pink color here it's kind of a shimmery
pink and I'm gonna use that as my
highlight and this actually is a little
bit gave me a little more color than the
other one so so there we go and I'm also
going to just kind of try to get a
little more intensity there on the
crease as I work from one eye to the to
the next I'm going to go into the purple
again
deepen it up just to hear okay and I'm
gonna take my muff II a number 10 brush
from Smashbox and just excuse me go over
that make sure there aren't any harsh
edges next I'm going to grab my
blackberry Colorstay eyeliner and I'm
going to line probably 3/4 of the way in
on this eye on the top lid just gonna
lightly you know doesn't have to be
perfect but there we go
kind of got the the top part there and
now we're going to go and do the bottom
just kind of connecting at the corner
and we're going to go all the way to the
inside and I'm just looking down into a
little mirror here so you guys can still
see okay
all right so we've got our liner done in
this you are so close to me that that
you know may look a little I don't know
how that's really coming off here on
camera for you but this is softer than
black and dark brown and now I'm going
to take my liner brush I'm gonna dip
into that purple shade there and I'm
actually gonna just go over this just to
give it a little more color gonna go
over what I just did so that black berry
shade is like a deep deep plum and so
we're just bringing out more purple in
that by going over it and I'm gonna go
over this too up on top shade there and
then I'm going to just take my crease
brush my fine crease brush again dip it
into the purple and we're kind of just
gonna smoke out the corner here by going
over that another strategy that's good
is to use a smudger brush where I like
my shadow liner brush from Smashbox
number thirty and that can also kind of
soften the color on the bottom here okay
so what we've got is just kind of a
smoky looking you know it's worked in
some color but it's subtle color so once
again some people like that idea some
people don't
um gonna curl my lashes here but I mean
I like the look I feel like this is
something I could wear pretty much
anywhere but like I said um a little bit
disappointed just in terms of the way
those colors it seems so promising and
like I said it seems like for me most
two-faced most Too Faced shadows have a
little more intensity than that so that
was a little odd to me I mean I don't
know if it's just the the palette is
totally formulated different than
anything else but I'm using my Rimmel
extra super lash like that dollar 97
mascara I'm kind of going for a little
more natural look with the lashes here
wouldn't have to though so there you go
I hope you guys enjoyed this look and I
/ with you it's something I haven't
really done before sort of critiquing a
product as I use it but like I said this
is my first application with this so I
thought it would be kind of nice to give
you guys that initial reaction and also
show you you know how it works so I
think that's maybe kind of an effective
way to do a review so again this is the
palette that comes in the Too Faced
world domination tour a little kind of
jewelry box looking thing it also has
some blush and some lip colors in there
too my lip color today though is the Too
Faced mirror mirror gloss in and it's
kind of a nude shade so it's really it's
kind of transparent it's sort of like
your own lip color just shinier it's
really really shiny and the shade is
called unperfect
and so I hope you guys enjoyed this look
and and the information as far as the
review goes and I hope you have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
