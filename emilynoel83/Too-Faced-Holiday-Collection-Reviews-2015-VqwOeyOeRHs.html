me it's great to have you here as always
today we've got a lot to talk about
we're going to be discussing the
two-faced holiday collections basically
they're big three pallet collections you
faced always does a good job I think
with their themes for their holiday
collections and just making it very
consistent throughout all of the
products they're putting out so this
year it's kind of a Christmas and Paris
thing and the three different parts of
that that I'll be talking about are the
petite from a soul and that is the $39
collection that's available only at Ulta
then you've got Legrand chateau and that
is kind of a trio of palettes and that's
going to be available at Sephora Ulta
and the Too Faced website and then the
Sephora exclusive Isla grand palais and
that is your largest pallet you've got
several extras with that and that one is
$58 the outer boxes of all of these are
very simple very classy I think they
just look so pretty it's the kind of
thing that I don't know if I'd even feel
the need to wrap these because they just
look so pretty from the outside and then
when you take the actual makeup box out
you've got a couple of them that look
exactly like their outer packaging and
then the chateaux actually looks like a
little building here's what's
interesting aside from the little extras
that come in a few of these this is the
total amount of makeup you're dealing
with palette wise out of all of these I
do like that they've got this gorgeous
kind of outer packaging that could be
kind of a display item you know
something really cute to have out if you
want to but when it comes right down to
it you don't have to travel around with
something that bulky and the palettes
themselves are just very thin and
streamlined the first one I'm going to
focus on is lip a teeth Mason and this
is the one that is exclusively available
at Ulta again just a really beautiful
little set up when you open the box up
if you wanted to leave this open you've
got your palette sitting down below a
cute little like dress form I love the
illusion of a wrought iron staircase and
then a place for your better than sex
mascara once you open up the palette you
don't have any mirror on the inside so
just a heads up there but you do have 12
eyes shadows on
inside and it's gonna be a mix of matte
and shimmer you do have some nice matte
basics and let it snow reindeer and
dreams down here but everything else you
know quite a bit of Sheen going on here
you've got a couple of really really
deep dark shades a couple of the colors
that turned out quite a bit more sheer
than I expected we're honeypot which I
believe is a shade I've had in other
palettes and that one seemed a little
light to me and pussycat is going to be
a sheer pinky purple out of all of these
collections surprisingly and this is
probably the one that I like the most
granted it is the smallest of any of
these sets
I do like most of what's in here I think
the shades are pretty it's easy to work
with I think the quality is there for
the most part and seeing is the one
somewhat colorful shade is pretty sheer
this is going to be something that the
neutral buffers will enjoy however I've
got to look at this and compare it to my
Stardust palette by Vegas name because
it is the same amount of shadows and I
think a pretty similar size as well and
I definitely prefer the Stardust palette
over this I think there's just more
variation in this palette there's more
consistent quality in this palette and
you know if I had a choice I would
definitely go for this one and it's not
that much more expensive and you get
even more extras alongside it and I
talked much more about this in another
video where I was comparing other
palettes so I'll link to that below if
you want more info and that star dust
palette while not technically part of
this Too Faced Christmas in Paris
Holiday Collection it is I think a very
giftable item and something I really
really enjoy this one while it's a
decent palette the quality is like 90%
there like I said a couple of these
shapes like honeypot and pussycat were a
bit more sheer than I was expecting but
the mattes are great quality that's
something that I can say pretty much
across the board for all of these and
Too Faced holiday palettes really great
consistent buttery creamy quality to
their matte shadows bottom line I think
this could be a nice giftable item for
the neutral shadow lover if you're
really wanting to give something from
this you know Paris collection a you've
got somebody who collects and decorates
with a lot of that theme they may really
like that
now the next option and a little more
expensive is the Legrand Chateau and
I've got to say this is my personal
favorite on the pack
I just think that is so cute don't be
surprised if you see this hanging out in
my background sometime soon the top just
comes off and then the outside opens
almost like just two doors opening and
then you can see on the inside you've
got this cute little like what I would
picture is a Paris apartment building
overlooking the Eiffel Tower you've got
your better than sex mascara in there as
well as three separate palettes
there is the little to-and-from so this
kind of reminds me of the way labelled
carousel was last year you know it has
those separate palettes that lift out
and you could give them altogether to
someone or you could get these
individually each has a bow on them the
two from like I said they open up no
mirror on the inside there are six
shadows in each and a blush the one in
this particular one kind of looks like a
bronzer just to show you all of these
here side-by-side so you can get a feel
for your full color scene that you'll be
getting the pink palette primarily light
and mid-tone shimmery neutrals this
green palette is going to be your really
classic neutrals half matte half shimmer
very basic but probably the most
complete in terms of giving you a great
light to dark range and just the balance
of you know highly shimmery shades and
matte shades that can create that
contrast for you and then this other one
is your kind of smoky purpley palette
some very dark tones a sheer purpley
shade in here this is actually the one
I'm wearing today and I was not really
thrilled with this purple shade is quite
sheer it's like a purple with a bluish
tone shimmer I feel like I've seen this
shade in two-faced palettes like going
back years that this has shown up in
two-faced holiday palettes this seems
very familiar to me again the mattes are
great in all of these there'll just be
those certain kind of shimmery shades
that don't quite measure up the blushes
that are in each of these palettes are
not representative of Too Faced best
blush work by any means and if you've
tried those new little heart-shaped
blushes that they have and they actually
have several of those that are part of a
little kit that comes with some melted
lip colors those are really pigmented
just really outstanding blushes and
seemed extremely sheer particularly the
one called tre fab and that is the one
that I'm wearing today it's just it's a
really barely fair color it's a matte
pink and it just doesn't really do much
Mademoiselle that's the one that's in
the overall neutral palette this shows
up a little bit more it's a little more
pigmented but again it's nothing close
to those heart-shaped ones that are out
now and then this bronzer here called
Jolie you know it's fine it's not a bad
product but it's just gonna be a soft
kind of shimmery bronze but knowing that
someone may be spending their money a
certain way based on a recommendation I
give I want to give it to you as honest
and as bluntly as I can this palette for
example pretty shimmery shades but
where's the matte there's no real
contrast to be able to create with that
so if like I took this as a little
travel palette with me somewhere I would
feel it was incomplete this one like I
said the best balance because it is half
man/half shimmer but it's very very
neutral and I know I've been criticized
a time or two when I critique a palette
based on its uniqueness and I'll say
something like well I've got a ton of
that in my collection and people are
like of course you've got a ton of it
you've got loads and loads of makeup but
I've gotta say I know some of y'all out
there have a buttload of makeup too and
you've probably got a matte cream a
matte light brown matte dark brown
shimmery bronze shimmery Brown shimmery
black this is your very basic palette
that it is what it is maybe that's
exactly what you want to give someone or
maybe if it's a matter of buying this
for yourself you might think we'll gosh
I've already got a lot of that kind of
shade this palette honestly if you're
really into purple and you're really
hoping this looks super purpley it
doesn't you know it's just a very soft
purpley smoky look is what you end up
with I've got rendezvous in the crease
I've got this on my lid which shows up
just barely there and then a little bit
of this shade in my outer corner and
just on the lower lash line cuteness
points off the charts this is freaking
adorable but I mean again I don't like
this better than say that Stardust
palette or my lorac mega Pro 2 or the
balms new in the ball of your hand
palette and none of this stuff is
beating that now finally the largest
palette the most expensive product
release
for the holidays from two phases
LaGrande palais and that one is the
sephora exclusive it definitely is
adorable as you look at the presentation
here you've got just this cute little
mannequin back there little Sephora and
two-faced bags you're getting the most
extras here with the mini better than
sex mascara the mini melted liquid lip
color in the shade peony that's a really
pretty kind of warm pink those show up
very opaque on the lips they're a fun
texture to play with if you haven't used
that kind of thing it would be you know
something fun to have an experiment with
and also a Too Faced shadow insurance
which i think is really great to have a
primer alongside shadows like this then
your palette is actually 18 eyeshadows
and four face colors this would normally
be the part of Too Faced holiday kits
that I would really be like yes I love
this but I really started using its
watching it experimenting with these
different colors and I'm not that
impressed matte colors are great
like I said two-face has done a great
job with their mats ever since they're
little like matte neutral palette which
i think is just the balm it's really
really nice soft pigmented quality there
they seem to have mastered that
but then in their holiday kits they'll
throw out some kind of brighter shades
that really catch your eye to see them
here like eyeful Midnight in Paris these
shades like paint a beautiful picture of
a pallet for you know to look at if
they're so flaky and shimmery they do
not apply very well at all there is a
buttload of shimmer in this palette I
don't want to diminish how beautiful
shades like cobblestone city lights
dream light Belle femme stiletto Yule
Log those are all really nice shades
blushes at the bottom Stardust and
skyline you know they're very soft they
remind me of the quality of those
blushes in these individual palettes
which like I said is not at nearly as
intense as their newer released
individual blushes the highlight is
gorgeous the highlight called flush I
think that's really pretty has a little
bit of a golden tone to it I think it's
beautiful and they give you sun bun and
you love me some Sun bunny so that's
nice to see of these sort of like accent
shades as you might call them down here
in the bottom I would say party dress
this hot pink is probably the one that
has the most color payoff kind of pretty
you know if you wanted to pack that on
you would see that shade quite a bit
more but these other ones here in this
bottom row I'm really struggling with
their flakiness you're just not gonna
get that kind of a look to show up on
the lid I've said this before but just
to reiterate if it came right down to it
and I had to choose I would pick the
Vegas nay Stardust palette over all of
this stuff I also like I said my other
kind of palette frontrunner currently as
far as makeup goes for the holidays
loving that palette from the balm loving
my lorac mega Pro - these are I think
some of Too Faced cutest stuff I think
it's really well thought out on the
packaging to kind of boil the makeup
part down to such a small thing but
still give you the cuteness and the
presentation of the outer packaging I
think that's smart and it gets adorable
but I don't think it's two-faced best
quality makeup in all of these palettes
at least just not consistently I hope
this video sorted some things out for
you if you were trying to figure out
what to do about these new holiday
collections I'm just trying to bring you
my most objective opinion possible here
so thank you for watching I'll see you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
