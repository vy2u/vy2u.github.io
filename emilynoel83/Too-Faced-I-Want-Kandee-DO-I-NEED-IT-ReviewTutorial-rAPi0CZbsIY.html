tuning in this video it's gonna be all
about the I want candy collection the
collaboration between candy Johnson and
two-face it is a candy-themed line the
stuff is really cute there's a candy
scent kind of associated with most
everything here and yeah if it seems
like I'm talking about Too Faced a lot
lately it's just because they've
launched a bunch of stuff kind of all at
the same time that whole
peaches-and-cream collection was
exclusive to Sephora and I believe all
this candy Johnson's stuff is exclusive
to Ulta so today I think I want to just
take you through kind of try on style
and talk about everything as I go I have
been experimenting with this stuff for a
little while now I was sent the full PR
package of it all which really does
allow me to give you the most like
well-rounded idea of like here's the
best stuff from this line here's the
stuff you can skip kind of thing I've
got the brightening face powder for
different matte liquid lip colors
there's an eye liner an eye shadow
palette and then also a highlighter
stick so what I have on my skin today is
Foundation and concealer and I was just
starting to apply a little of this and
that I'm like no wait you're gonna show
that on the video so it's the I want
candy banana pudding brightening face
powder so this is a yellow tone powder
and if you look really closely at it up
here if it'll focus you can see some
little flecks of like blue and purple
and pink so it's almost like a little
effort toward color correcting I think
but it just does show up is sort of this
light yellow tone very matte powder and
I am picking up on some subtle banana
scent with that but it's not too
overboard and compact wise here just a
regular compact with a mirror and I'm
just using my ELF small tapered brush
and I had just gotten done putting a
little bit of this like kind of on the
under eye area and my first like thing
that I noticed about this is just how
mattifying it is it's interesting I
don't see a ton of color coming off on
my skin but I do just notice it getting
a little bit more modified and I already
had on a pretty matte foundation I used
the one from the peaches of creme
collection so to me gets a nice little
powder I don't think it's really
anything to write home about but it's
okay so next time I'm just going to
breeze through a couple steps that
aren't include
in the candy Johnson products I'm going
to do bronzer I'm using lorry Geller's
bronze in Brighton and then I'm using my
Too Faced pink leopard as a little bit
of a blush okay next thing in the candy
Johnson line is the I want candy candy
glow Luminizer really cute little stick
here it's a highlighter stick and this
was the one that I feel like I noticed
the most profound like candy scent too
it makes me think of just like some kind
of sweet sugary candy also a lot like
just vanilla frosting or something like
that it really smells great and this is
a super frosty highlight with kind of a
pinky tint to it and when you blend it
out on the skin it's very dry feeling
it's not sticky tacky you don't notice
really any moisture to this product at
all so what I'm going to do here is just
give myself a little like streak of that
right up in this general zone and it
blends out really easily just with your
fingers
I love the way this looks right after I
put it on I mean it's really giving me
that glow and I do really like the color
tone of it and all but as it wears
throughout the day and I don't notice
this as much right now like I can look
up pretty closely at it and yes I am
seeing flecks of actual glitter in this
product which kind of like I just don't
like to see glitter on the top of my
cheeks it's taking me back to like fifth
sixth grade place in my life but right
now it looks a little bit more like
smooth there's that somewhat metallic
almost sheen in it but as this wears
throughout the day I swear the sort of
base or like binding pearly aspect to
this product sort of fades away and then
all I start to see really is the glitter
on my skin and I see it more just in
natural daylight like if I cut myself in
a mirror somewhere in my house and I'm
like oh there's really quite a bit of
glitter and I'm still at a decent
distance away from my face like looking
at myself so for that reason I mean I
can't take anything away from the smell
I like the texture I like the color tone
but I don't think it wears that well and
it's pretty obvious that there's glitter
in this maybe that's something you like
or maybe that's something you want to
stay away from but I think it's
important to know that that's there now
I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit once
again and do my brows I'm using my ELF
instant lift brow pencil in neutral
Brown and I'm gonna put on some Milani
eyeshadow primer and we'll jump into
that eye palette
okay so now we're ready for the eye
palette which i think is really a cute
design here because I instantly think of
that old school at kind of old-fashioned
box of chocolates here it's got the
little like candy Johnson caricature
sticker down here on the back it's like
an outline of every shade and the
palette as if it were like telling you
which flavor of chocolate it was that's
so cute in such a cute detail and then
you have 15 shadows on the inside to me
it seems as though they've been laid out
into like three different quads also
with three different and highlighter
type options here and what I notice in
this palette well it is a matte and
shimmer balance the shimmers in here are
really I think intensely shimmery like
there's some ultra frosty shiny colors
in this mix and a glance at this I
instantly thought of like a holiday
palette you know how to face holiday
palettes just seem to be this random
assortment of neutrals maybe with a few
shades that pop just a little bit here
and there and that's kind of what this
palette makes me think of now there's no
mirror on the inside in case you were
wondering I've already done several
looks with this I definitely did one
concentrating in on these warmer tones
on this side I seem to just draw bits
and pieces from the center group and
then I've also done one that
incorporated kind of those very shades
over there this color called raspberry
cocoa it's really fun to work in and I
really think I'm just gonna bounce
around a little bit today I am going to
start with raspberry cocoa and use that
in the crease I'm just using my Sigma
e25 brush here again to face does mattes
really really well I talked about that a
lot in my video with the peach
collection because there's an all matte
palette in that collection and I do
think as I review these things that have
all kind of come out at the same time
it's important to keep it all in context
and think okay maybe not everyone's
gonna go out and grab every piece of
every collection so which one's really
best and I'm going to tell you right now
I prefer the Just Peachy mattes palette
I'm just gonna grab this palette right
here
I think this
is outstanding like I love this I love
all the mats
I think two-face doesn't matte formula
really nicely and in here it was just
such a great combo
like the dark plums the bright peach
shades the neutral Browns I mean
everything was working for me so well in
that palette and it just feels a little
bit more unique to my collection this
palette feels like a lot of colors that
are already lurking in a number of
places you know I'm not saying I don't
like them because I have enjoyed the
looks that I've made but I'm not quite
as like gaga over it as I was for the
last one okay that's raspberry cocoa
worked into the crease then I'm gonna
use banana cream pie as a highlight this
is kind of the most yellowy toned I
guess highlight powder here and then
you've got whipped cream here which is
just out of control
like if you want a bold like powder
highlight maybe even wear that on your
cheeks or something that one's going
there for sure I'm gonna use a little
bit of that just under the highest part
of my brow whipped cream is just crazy
y'all it's just going there okay then
what I combined these in a little
different way than I've tried it before
I think I'm gonna do butterscotch - and
instead of using this as a crease shade
I'm gonna just Pat some of this on the
lid and see what happens
makes something will different go down
here with this palette today okay yeah
I'm mainly patting this here on the
inner part of the lid this is a matte
shade again mattes are here to play
two-faced notice how it's done with the
mattes not saying the shimmers are bad
because there's some gorgeous Frost's in
here I just think sometimes consistency
is maybe a bit more of a concern with
the other finishes but mattes are great
I'll take whipped cream and show you
what that's made of right around that
inner corner look how like just popping
that is frosty colors on the eyes I mean
I think some people be all about them
some people might say yeah I try to stay
away from a lot of shimmers if you try
to stay away from it I mean I don't know
maybe this palette is something to
completely steer clear of but I do like
the ability to do those pinpointed pops
with just a little bit of product and
feel like yeah that really went there
you know then
think I want to do a little bit of hot
chocolate that's a mat from the center
quad and just Pat that on the outer part
of the lid and this did come with one of
those little like guidebook type things
and you see Candy's face and like some
step-by-step how to's with the palate
I'm dabbing just a hint more of that
butterscotch shade just right in here so
I don't lose that color and then I want
a little more of raspberry cocoa just
kind of bringing it upward even more
then I'm thinking it might be kind of
interesting to try some of this sweet
toffee shade which has some shimmer to
it and like kind of I don't know add a
little bit here on the outer border at
this point I'm just playing here I'm
just trying to combine these in a
different way than I have already
and here's an idea I'm going to take a
brown pencil this is a Makeup Forever
aqua Excel and n60 take a brown pencil
to my lower inner rim
smudge it down just a bit and then I've
got this Marc Jacobs pencil in the shade
Orange Crush so it's just a metallic
like really shiny eye pencil a lot of
orangie tone to it blend that in here on
the lower lash line
and then I'm going to top it off with
sweet toffee yeah that's kind of a cool
look
and again this palette sent wise you
know you really get that sweet sweet
smell to it I mean not so much like as
I'm wearing it around but just from the
palette itself as you're putting your
brush in next thing I'm going to apply
is this black liquorice liquid eyeliner
it says Kandy eyeliner and it seems to
be like a really traditional liner but
you take it out of its little tube here
and you see that that tip actually has a
slight angle to it it feels like a
little felt tip that's just been cut to
an angle I just can't get the hang of
this one maybe I'm just so set in my
ways with like a really fine brush tip
eyeliner but here I feel like I keep
having to check myself like okay is that
is that laying at the right angle and I
end up getting a lot thicker line than I
was going for even though I feel like
I'm trying to hold it right you know
what I do like is the the darkness of it
the intensity of it like it dang it see
what I just did there
well I guess my wing is going right
about here now
maybe if you're not so set in your ways
with certain liquid eyeliners you'd feel
like oh yeah I like that little angle
being in there but for me it just can't
do it it's like it doesn't appear when
you take that little tip out of its
inkwell that there's so much on it but
then I start going across my lashline
I'm like me and that thing is loaded up
like there's so much product here
but the intensity of the color the way
it dries down it looks just super dark I
like that now I'm going to like add a
little more shadow here there is a
licorice rope color it's a near black
it's kind of like a super super dark
grey and I want a little bit of that
over here and we really played with this
shade yet
another few shades that I didn't work
into this look that are really like
pronounce this frosted pink shade super
shiny sugarplum up here
that's a shade I feel like shows up in a
lot of holiday palettes it is taupe
silver a splash of lavender in that
color as well it's really pretty and
sugared strawberries are really cute
shade as well as kind of like a peachy
pink but I'm gonna leave you for a
moment and real quick curl my lashes do
some mascara maybe a false lash on top
and join you with the lip colors okay I
look is complete I added some lashes on
there and these are like a random super
cheap style that I got for like $1 off
of might have been shot miss a or
something I just found him looking
through my drawer but also speaking very
loudly to you through the camera is my
lip color and I want to try on all four
of these melted matte liquefied matte
long-wear lipsticks for you so there are
four in this line and I had actually
never tried this formula before this
launched and I'm pleasantly surprised
like I've used them melted you know the
ones that are in more of a squeezy tube
you can see packaging wise here it's
like a hard plastic but the original
melted stuff and there were melted
metallics I've used those but this is
kind of a different ball game it's a
matte liquid lipstick they do have a
pretty significant dry down I think you
know they feel pretty dry on your lips
but they wear a really long time they
only really transfer off if you make a
real effort to kind of tug at them but
otherwise I think they're pretty
decently long wearing and another thing
that I really like about these is that
they don't darken as you wear them like
they stay very true to color and that's
kind of a rare thing to find with liquid
lipsticks that do have that major dry
down but I think the colors are pretty
brilliant three of the four I absolutely
love so let's start out with the one I
liked least exactly the lightest one
called melted ice cream super super
light nude and I think it could be
pretty maybe mixed in with a different
shade or like kind of topping off the
next shade I'll be showing you but on
its own it's just not for me not for my
skin tone it just seems really really
light on my face the next one though the
one called freshly baked I absolute
love this color this is without a doubt
the most wearable in the whole
collection I think for almost anyone you
know it's this kind of dusty rose color
and I could see melted ice cream kind of
topping that one off perhaps in the
center at the lower lip
you know before they've totally dried
you can kind of blend them a bit with
your finger and that could be pretty
absolutely love tropical punch this
shade screams candy Johnson to me so I'm
really glad it was in the collection I
think it's a gorgeous hot pink fuchsia
color it's so bold I love how these
colors seem to go on super evenly you're
not building up color to get an opaque
look on your lips it's a really nice
formula and then I'm sweet and sour I
love this cover like I think this is so
pretty it's a real orange --red I mean
more toward Orange even I just think
it's stunning and what's interesting
about these is if you happen to lick
your lips there's a little bit of
sweetness that comes off of these and I
have never noticed a taste off of any
liquid lipstick I have ever used and I
don't know if these are usually that way
the melted mattes but I have a hunch
that maybe they infuse some flavor in
these just for Kandi's collection but
that was a really unexpected sensation
I'm like mmm I'm actually tasting
something off of this lipstick but yet
it's not transferring off I'm not like
licking the color off but there's just a
little subtle taste there so overall
thoughts of this whole candy collection
I would say my least favorite thing is
the eyeliner just because I'm kind of
set in my ways with liquid eyeliner and
while I like the formula I like the
blackness I'm just not a fan of the
applicator the banana pudding powder was
just kind of okay for me I mean it's a
cute idea I like the banana scent it's
very mattifying on the skin but I think
there are a lot of powders that do
generally what this does it's giving
just that little light hint of a yellow
tone to the skin but like I said it's
not anything that I'm really like wow
that's amazing and this candy glow
Luminizer stick I mean I've really
wanted to love this because I think it
looks so gorgeous initially applied but
looking up close at it there is glitter
in it and the way it just seems to wear
throughout the day I feel like I see the
glitter more and more and I'm just not
about the glittery highlights this
palette I think it's an adorable
packaging design I really think this
whole collection
stayed so consistent with like something
I would imagine candy Johnson might
create and also what to face general
vibe is you know it just seems to really
work I think everything is well
thought-out
very cutely designed nicely put together
here but this palette it's certainly
giving me nice wearable looks that I can
enjoy but there are loads and loads of
palettes out there these days and it's
just it's not a need for me odds are if
I hadn't received the pr package i would
have been curious enough to go ahead and
buy it myself but knowing what I know
now like I think I could pass on it I do
like that they've laid it out with I
think three distinctly wearable and nice
looks here and if you really like frosty
shades they put in some fantastic frosty
ones here amid the mattes which you know
I like but just for shade selections
sake I just can't get past the fact that
these are a lot of fairly common colors
and also just in the context of other
new releases if it was this palette
versus this palette I am wholeheartedly
on the Just Peachy matte strain I love
this one my favorite element of this
collection I think might be these melted
matte liquid lipsticks I didn't have
really good staying power I think it was
a nice like little range of shades each
one very you know distinctly different
from the next I love the two brights
like I adore those shades I think
they're great and I think freshly-baked
is super wearable as well melted ice
cream not maybe my cup of tea but might
be someone else's but guys I hope that
gave you some insights on this
collection again if you're interested in
the peaches-and-cream collection which
is the big Sephora exclusive recent Too
Faced launch check out that video on my
channel and thank you so much for
hanging out with me today I'll see you
again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
