a quick review on a little set form to
face it might be one of those sets that
it kind of comes across as an
afterthought compared to their larger
palettes but I really think this is a
great high-quality set it's filled with
what I guess you'd call deluxe sample
sizes of products from their regular
line it's called the melted kisses and
sweet cheeks set and it is three
separate boxes inside that one larger
box and each one contains a melted
liquefied long-wear lipstick and a
coordinating love flush blush and while
I've had quite a bit of experience with
the melted liquid lipsticks I feel like
I've been using those for a long time
and this is my first time in with this
kit trying out those blushes and I've
got to say I'm super pumped about these
blushes they're a little goes a long way
kind of product finish on the skin is
really natural-looking and I love all
three of the shades that they've put in
here now I already have full sizes of
these different melted liquid lipsticks
so that's what you're gonna see me
applying so I don't have to mess with
these new ones and I can give those to
someone else in case you're not familiar
with the way these work and you twist
off the cap and then the product pushes
up through this little kind of spongy
applicator here and I know something I
said when I first reviewed these was
that that seems to work fine for the
more natural shades in terms of getting
a precise enough line on your lips you
know but they do have some really
intense shades in this line I've got a
really hot pink and more of a reddish
berry type color and with those you know
it really shows if you're not inside
your lip line so that's something to
keep in mind with these you may want to
brush off a little on a lip brush if you
want the most precise application but I
really think that's only necessary for
the boldest brightest shades the melted
fig is a little bit on the deep side but
I still don't have any trouble with the
application in this format so I just
wanted you to know that but the texture
of these you know it's kind of a velvety
feel on the lips
I know these are kind of referred to as
a liquid lipstick but they're not gonna
be like those totally matte liquid
lipsticks it's almost like solidify and
totally set I'm wearing this one for a
little while now and as you can see
there's still a little shine coming from
it you know as
press my lips together there's still
some creaminess there I do find that
they have really nice staying power so
that's a plus and it's just kind of a
fun texture to work with you know they
go on very opaque on the lips it's not a
lot of work to build these up as you'll
see in the applications and I think they
pair nicely with the blushes that
they've given you although ultimately I
really think you could go any direction
you wanted and things would still look
fine the first one I'll talk about is
the melted peony with the blush and
justify my love so this is going to be
your classic pink blush it's a little
bit on the cool side and it was the only
blush that I noticed that had just the
tiniest bit of a shimmer like a very
fine sparkle in it which is something
that I had trouble picking up on once I
applied it to my cheeks but I can see it
when I look closely at the product and
sometimes I can see it when I swatch it
while the other two blushes seem to have
this kind of interesting really soft
satiny finish to them you know they have
the intensity of a matte blush but not
the chalkiness that you might pick up on
in some matte blushes this shade doesn't
quite have that same smoothness and
texture still a pretty blush and still a
pigmented blush but I'm just pointing
out there's a little difference that I
picked up on that comes with the melted
peony liquid lipstick which is going to
be a really classic pink color I think
it's really pretty this was the first
one that I remembered experimenting with
from the whole line it doesn't go quite
as cool as that blush shade does but you
know they make a nice pairing in the
next kit you're getting the melted fig
and the blush in your love is king and
that blush let me tell you this one
really took me by surprise when I put it
on because it is so intense it's kind of
a plummy berry type blush as I was
saying before it has this interesting
kind of satin finish I think a lot of
people are gonna like the way this comes
off on the cheeks because it's not glowy
at all but yet it doesn't look super
flat and dry and the way I use this
since I used this in conjunction with
the other blush what I did was put this
one on just a little bit lower on the
cheek and I just love the way that comes
off and I'm very careful when I apply it
to just tap into the product tap off the
excess and then maybe even tap on my
hand if I feel like I've gotten too much
and then just apply it to the cheek and
it looks so
pretty and the lipstick you get in there
with it is the melted fig and this is my
favorite melted lipstick of the bunch
it's not your standard kind of reddish
berry that I wear a lot of it's got a
little more purple in it and I think
it's just really interesting so pretty
goes on with completely full color as
all of these do and then the third kit
that you get has the melted lipstick in
nude and the blush is in the shade
called love hangover and that blush is a
really nice kind of rich coral and the
way the plastic is a little bit
different color from the actual blush on
the inside it might be a little bit hard
to really hone in on exactly what color
this blush is but I think it would be
very universally flattering and I just
popped it right on the apple of the
cheek and I think it looks so fresh in
that way I've worn this alone plenty of
times but it does look kind of pretty
paired with that other blush and then
the melted lipstick that you've got here
is melted nude and this is going to be a
deeper nude this is the shade I've been
wearing throughout the video I when I
first tried this and it was one back
when these first came out I remember
thinking being a little uncomfortable
with a deeper nude shade like this and
now maybe it's after wearing more of
those trendy kind of brownish nude type
shades I feel very comfortable in this
one so it's kind of hard for me honestly
to pick a favorite between these two
sets the one that has the more peachy
blush and the one that has the plumy
toned one these are definitely my
favorites now that I don't like the
peony set but I just think you know
these colors just something about the
texture of these blushes is even better
I think this is a great little kit from
Too Faced there's the to-and-from on the
back of each of these boxes so they
would totally you know fit down in a
stocking and be something I think
someone would be really excited to see I
wasn't really loving some of those
larger sets as you may have seen in my
other video but I think these are really
really nice smaller gifts so thank you
for watching and I'll see you guys later
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
