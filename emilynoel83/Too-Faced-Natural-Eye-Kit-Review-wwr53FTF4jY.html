and staying with me throughout my review
asan I know there's been enough like
keeping up with the kardashians
marathons and everything like that on TV
and that's kind of what inspired me to
do something I've never done before
which is a bunch of reviews all in one
day so next thing I'm going to talk
about is a high-end I shadow palette
from Too Faced i love the two-faced
palettes over time I've tried several of
them come I've tried the little box it
looks like a little jewelry box i'll
actually grab those who show you how
cute just a couple examples of them of
the two-faced pounce i've tried in the
past the world domination tour adorable
little palette here that looks like a
little jewelry box and it has the makeup
inside so that one's super cute and I
get these a lot as gifts my sister is
actually giving me both of these for a
couple of Christmases and then the
glamour revolution palette which is so
cool and it has like all the lip stuff
in there and then it has a pullout thing
here with the eyeshadow palette oops you
can kind of see how that pulls out there
so anyway I think the two face products
are awesome in the packaging is second
to none and so I'm trying out something
from them that's a little more natural
it's called the natural eye palette here
I'm not sure how long this has been
around but it's really really pretty and
it's the neutral eyeshadow collection
and so basically this gives you several
different ways to create a neutral I I
mean really if you wanted to be creative
you could come up with a lot of ways but
the thing magnetizes there you can see I
kind of pulled that off and then you
open it up and I am nuts nuts about the
color selection that you get here really
unique colors I mean you might think
okay she's going to tell me about a
neutral eye palette what here am i going
to see that I
seen a zillion times before but these
are really fun colors and I mean there's
just so much variety and they there's
just a new unique twist a different
texture i love the textures of some of
these especially also just packaging
wise there's a little drawer here that
you can pull out and you get a
double-ended like sponge tip applicator
and a liner there so base and also up at
the top you have a little air area to
put these cards you can pull out three
looks outline there's one for day one
that says classic it's a little more
dramatic and one that says fashion which
is like the most dramatic you can do
with the colors given and so if you look
horizontally across this palette you can
see how it all corresponds for a
close-up look here this is day so going
across there classic and fashion so
you're getting the larger shades are
kind of like you're all over lid type
shade or highlight shades their shade
you might use in a couple of different
ways so I think that may be why they
give you more and then your darker
shades you have like a mid-tone mid-tone
shades in this column and your darkest
shades to use as liners and contours and
just smokey colors there I've tried each
of these kind of going cross not
necessarily maybe in the exact same way
they have recommended but I just love
the textures of these and I mean for me
being one who you know I'm working in
the news and I'm doing I'm anchoring
every day I think this has given me a
little bit of a fun twist on the neutral
I that I wear so often come but heaven
like for example that's a matte shade
this whole shoe area going across is
basically matt and i like that i like
having that option in this palette so
you've got heaven you've got a velvet
revolver and sex press 0 is this deep
rich brown that is so beautiful so great
to work one in the row that says classic
you've got silk teddy which is a really
pretty on like shimmery pink with silver
under
push-up which is a unique shade that I
like to blend up with like if I've got a
dark shade right out here I'll put push
up right there i'm not wearing these
shades actually right now at this moment
but that's push up very metallic and
erotica is kind of a brown taupe gold
hybrid kind of shade it had some shimmer
some sparkle to it and it's really
pretty those shades are gorgeous and I
love how these blend like doing the
classic look and putting silk teddy on
the inner part and push up on the outer
part like one shade just blends with the
next so well and then going across the
bottom nude beach is um kind of like a
silvery sort of a silvery neutral shade
with actual gold sparkle in there and
then honey pot is a really golden a
metallic gold shade and then cocoa puff
is deep brown with a little bit of
sparkle to it so you've got that matt
sex presso shade at the top and then
cocoa puff has that golden undertone
shimmer so these are all really pretty
don't think that you're limited to just
using the three you know across each
shade mixing and matching is really fun
with this set you do get a nice little
selection there of shimmers although
it's more there's more shimmer than Matt
you do have some matte shades to kind of
set off the shimmer and vice versa and I
think you're going to like this if you
get your hands on it again I'm not
really sure how long this has been out
it's not often that I get to go to an
Ulta or sephora to sort of browse this
stuff in person but if you have this let
me know like what your color combos that
you like to use here with these let me
know what they are because I am really
having fun experimenting with this
palette right now again it's from Too
Faced and it is the natural I neutral
eyeshadow collection so thanks so much
for watching this video and there is
still more videos there are still more
videos to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
