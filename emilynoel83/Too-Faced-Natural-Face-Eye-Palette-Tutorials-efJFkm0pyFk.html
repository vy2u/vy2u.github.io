pallets in one very exciting it's the
Too Faced natural eye and natural face
palettes I've had the natural eye for a
while and I actually have another
tutorial already on this if you're
interested but since I was doing the
natural face I thought I might just put
them both together so you could see what
like the entire look was like and also
show you my very favorite eye look with
this palette and I'll also show you the
natural face palette which this is
something that's a little more new to me
I actually was kind of experimenting
with this on my sister-in-law the other
day we were getting ready to go
wedding-dress shopping with her and so I
used this on her and this has your
concealers blushes cream blushes bronzer
and so it's kind of like once you get
your foundation on this is the rest of
your face so first off everything else I
used on my face was drugs moisturized
and then I used my Rimmel fix and
perfect Pro primer just all over my face
and then I used my Revlon Photoready
foundation and just spread that all over
it's kind of a foundation that has a
little bit of a glow too and there I
went to the concealer in this this shade
actually works really well for my skin I
could see this as being good for lighter
skin too if it's much darker skin I
don't think this palette would work as
well for you so that's kind of the
downside is that it comes in kind of one
across-the-board kit here but anyway I
used the concealer around my under eye
area I went around any other spots if I
had kind of sunspots or anything like
that coming up I went over those areas
around my nose as well really a good
coverage concealer it's not too dry it's
got just the right amount of creaminess
to it and it goes on thin enough then I
went to the Brighton step which is just
like a shade or two lighter than the
concealer and I just considered this to
go around the areas where I just wanted
a little extra brightening so that might
have been the inner most corners of my
eyes this is also something you could
use to highlight in sort of a matte way
around the face you could go down the
bridge of your nose with this your
there is a cream highlight in here
called luminize and it's kind of like a
pearly peachy colored highlight and I
just used this on my brow bones and I
also used it on top of my cheekbones you
can also go on your Cupid's bow area
that's just an example of a few of the
places I used it with all the cream
products I went to the cream blush which
is beautiful it's just a beautiful kind
of dusty rose color so I blended that
into my cheeks it blends super easily so
I was happy with then I went to the
bronze veil bronze veil and this kit is
it's like your bronzer but it's not as
dark as chocolate Soleil which is matte
and just like I said a little bit deeper
it is my favorite bronzer and I kind of
wish that they just put that in here but
bronze veil is maybe even a little more
wearable for lighter skin tones it has
just the tiniest amount of shimmer in
there but that doesn't keep me from
using this as a contour because you
can't really see the shimmer that much
finally the powder blush which is super
pretty this is like a peach blush with a
little bit of Sheen I just put that kind
of on the apples of my cheeks and so
this was something that I felt like
worked for my skin tone and my coloring
but it also worked on a blond-haired
blue-eyed girl which was my
sister-in-law Sarah if there was one
thing I could change about it just for
my personal preference I would have put
two faced chocolate soleil bronzer in
here but I do realize for some lighter
skin tones that might seem a little dark
so for the masses this is probably the
best configuration but I was really
pleasantly surprised with how well the
concealer and the brightener worked I
think it's awesome that you get two
different shades they're very convenient
too for travel and just having a lot of
products all in one there where the face
is concerned moving on to the eyes we're
gonna talk about a look that I said is
my favorite if you like the look of sort
of neutral rose gold type colors this is
so so good for that one of my favorite
shades in the kit is called push-up and
that's the shade we're gonna start with
of course I put on some primer first and
then I'm taking a small flat brush and
I'm putting push-up all over my
LED leaving a little space on the
innermost corner but basically all over
the lid then I went to the lighter shade
right next to that which is silk teddy
which is kind of a light light pink
shimmer and I use that right around the
tear duct area and I went to sex spresso
which is a dark deep matte brown and
with that what I'm doing here is a
little different technique it's
something that I think can be really
quick for getting that outer V and
really just no-brainer style take your
small flat brush and just kind of Pat
this in the exact shape you want your
outer V to take on patting it not only
on the outer part of the lid but also
out a little bit into that V a little
bit up into the crease then take your
fluffier brush and just buff out not all
over your eyelid but just buff out
around the edge of what you just did
there and you're gonna see it blend
beautifully into the perfect outer V so
that's another easy kind of way to get
that so with sex press oh and you can
take kind of a liner brush or I like to
use my Sonia Kashuk smudger brush and
bring that down on the lower lash line
blend it right off the edge of what we
were doing in the outer V bring it down
a little bit and then just kind of buff
it out you know don't go back for more
product just take what you've got on
your brush and keep kind of pulling it
in wear it back to push up and I used a
technique that I often like to do which
is kind of sandwich in a color so we put
push up on the lid we put the deeper
shade in the crease and then we're going
back with push up kind of to get that
little halo effect right around the
outer edge of the deep shade then I'm
going to a matte color called heaven
which is just your matte kind of cream
slightly off-white shade and just put
that up under the brows so this way the
impact of the shimmer is really on the
list from eyeliner I used wet and wild
mega liner in the black shade just go
from inner corner to outer corner I
thickened it a little bit towards the
outside but didn't do a big wing with
this look then I took my Maybelline
master drama eyeliner in Midnight master
this is a black eyeliner it is a great
long wearing pencil from the drugstore
and I just went around the outer
most part of my lower lashline with that
kind of keeping it soft a little bit
smudgy if you want to go over that again
with your smudger brush and a little bit
of dark shadow just to blend it all in
then I'm going to curl my lashes apply
one of my favorite drugstore mascaras
which is al may get up and grow so maybe
go a couple coats with that it's a
little bit of a dry formula really helps
out sparse lashes then I'm going to take
my Maybelline lash discovery small brush
doesn't smudge put a little bit of that
on your lower lash line finish off the
entire look I wanted kind of a rosy
neutral lip so I used one of the Revlon
just bitten kissable balm stains and
honey it's actually kind of a soft pink
and then I taught that off for a little
more gloss I used my Neutrogena moisture
shine gloss in healthy peach so that's
what's giving me the shimmer on top of
this whole lipgloss I hope you guys
liked this tutorial I am definitely a
fan of both of these Palelei make me
think bridal makeup and I mean I just
feel like these would be a fun gift like
for maybe even like a wedding shower
like maybe you give one and then a
friend gives another to the bride and
then she's got like kind of a full face
Bridal type look to go arms of the face
palette this is gonna be the type of
thing that maybe if you've already got
your must-have concealers and your
blushes and your bronzers that you know
you love in your collection you know
maybe you feel like well I don't really
need that little palette if you're not
really satisfied with your concealers
and you would just like that total look
and one palette maybe you travel a lot I
could see this as being beneficial for
that again the deeper skin tones are
left out with this which is not cool I
mean you would want to have maybe a
deeper version of this palette and for
people with darker skin because these
concealers are just going to be a little
light the bronzer would be a little
light as well but for light to medium
skin this works
pleasantly pleased and surprised with
the coverage of the concealers I love
the colors of the blush as far as the
natural eye kit goes I've already talked
about this one before you're comparing
this to the Naked palette I think I've
said before I think there are a few more
options in the Naked palette just in
terms of what you're given but I must
say I love this pose
jep shade and I just like the look that
I was able to create I'm glad I have
this palette because I really enjoy the
different neutral looks you can get you
can get a totally matte look or you've
got you know your shimmery options so I
love it I love the two together I think
they do complement each other and they
are meant to as the back of the natural
face palette so you know if you have any
video requests in the comments section
and have a great day bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
