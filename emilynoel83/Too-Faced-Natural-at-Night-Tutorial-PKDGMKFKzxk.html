neutral smoky eye this tutorial maybe
one for you it is for the Too Faced
natural at night palette and I've had
this palette for a while I really enjoy
using it not just at night time but you
know for a daily base got kind of like a
brown look sort of a warm look with some
Burgundy's we're gonna really be using
this and some of the Browns and then
you've got a great olive look in there
as well another reason why I wanted to
do this tutorial was because I recently
posted a picture on Instagram i'm using
a smoky Brown I look and I'm Emily
Noelle 83 on there by the way if you
have Instagram and want to follow I post
a lot of random pictures of me Tyler
cupcake etc but um anyway a lot of folks
were interested in how to you know get
that kind of a smoky Brown neutral and I
also did recently pick up the summer eye
palette which I am super excited about
and I I just wanted to let you know that
a tutorial will be coming on this as
well this has like some kind of distinct
colors in here with pinks and a coral
and a turquoise so I thought I'd ask you
if you wanted to see like kind of a
particular look pink coral turquoise
faced with this one let me know what
you'd like to see and I'll take that
into consideration for a future tutorial
but this looks like just such a fun
palette in terms of how to get this look
I first used two faced shadow insurance
use that or your favorite primer all
over your lid then I went to the shape
called after-hours which is a really
pretty kind of like a rose gold shade I
feel like it's how it comes off on the
lid so I used a flat brush to Pat that
all over my lid and also pull it up into
the crease just a little bit to aid in
my blending then I used a light shimmery
shade called night light and this really
has some sparkle to it I used this I
just patted it on the inner most part of
the lid and also around the tear duct
area then I used one of my favorite
shades in this palette it's called
Eclipse and it's kind of like a really
warm brown almost with a little bit of
burgundy in it and I patted that on the
outer half of my lid and then I also
used a pencil brush just to take that
shade and
it underneath the lower lash line
because I thought it gave a really you
know softness to this smokey look not
being a super dark shade but it's still
with something that helped define me
asked a little more definition there I
used an angled liner brush you'll see
how this can get much more definition
than a pencil brush and I just used the
shade called cocoa star which is a nice
matte brown to add a little bit of
definition right in between the lash on
my upper lash line
I used a liquid liner pin from lorac and
this is the front of the line Pro I just
went all the way across my lash line and
when I got to the outer edge I did sort
of a winged liner look and basically
it's kind of a matter of creating a
little triangle there on the outer
corner this is the way I've always done
it at least is what we're what works for
me and then it's just a matter of like
colouring it in and once you've done
that you've got a line that's kind of
like pointing up to the outer edge of
your eye from there I used a brush that
is really been useful for me lately it's
from the Sigma performance collection
this is the shader crease brush went
into cocoa star and I just used that to
really work off of that the shape that
the outer liner gave me but kind of
creating actually an edge to the
eyeshadow with this brush to create more
of a crease for yourself you can kind of
work this brush inward a little bit more
still with the cocoa star shade then I
blended a little bit of Eclipse on top
of that just to soften it a little bit I
used my highlight which is spotlight
that's kind of a matte buttercream shade
so just use you know any fluffy brush
you like and take that up too right
under your eye press up I just curled my
eyelashes and I applied some of my Maui
volumizing mascara to my upper lashes
and a coat on my lower lashes as well
and I used a set of lashes from the Katy
Perry I lower collection and these are
called cool Kitty it's sort of a thick
lash but lashes that aren't too long so
I just used my Revlon precision lash
glue place those kind of align them with
the center of my eye and then press them
down on the outer and inner corners to
make sure they're secure in terms of
finishing touches for the face I'm using
a bronzer from
since Sun Club and it's called sunny
it's a wonderful matte bronzer I
actually really like the tone of this
for some contouring then I used my NYX
blush and pinched which is a gorgeous
peachy blush with some gold toned
shimmer to it really plays off of this
look very nicely because we've got such
a strong eye I don't think the cheek
really competes with it then for lips I
used lipstick from the balm it's called
my bills be paid and it's got like a
matte nude lip and I use my tarte
lipsurgence in moody which adds a little
bit of a pinky berry tone to this and
finished it all off with some NYX mega
shine lip gloss in perfect which has
that pinky golden tone really kind of
matches up with the tone of the blush
too I hope you enjoyed this look with
the Too Faced natural at night palette I
really really like this one I'd really
recommend it for those of you who are in
the market for a palette to give you
several options for a smoky eye and
don't forget summer eye tutorial will be
coming but let me know if you want to
see kind of the pinks the corals or the
turquoise look for that one so thanks a
lot for watching guys and have a great
day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
