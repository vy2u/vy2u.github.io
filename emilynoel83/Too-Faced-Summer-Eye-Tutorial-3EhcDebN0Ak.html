two-faced summer eye palette this was
something I talked about in my last
two-faced eye tutorial which was the
natural at night video and I mentioned
that I got this one and I was asking you
guys you know which kind of color family
do you want me to work with for this
video I there's pink coral and turquoise
and I got a lot of requests for all of
them really and I actually worked in
both the coral and the turquoise kind of
underneath here for this look it's so
easy you're gonna love how simple this
one is this past weekend I was doing a
lot with the pinks and I loved that look
too so don't be surprised if I go back
and do another tutorial using that
because they're all great shape you know
you know this is a high-end product but
actually everything else that I'm using
and that I will demonstrate with the
cheeks and the liners and the lips and
all that stuff is going to be drugstores
so that's cool too so first off the way
I started this look I just used some
primer two faced shadow insurance just
went all over my lid with that and then
I went to the palette and I used the
coral crest shade and just take a flat
shadow brush Pat that beautiful color
all over the lid it's got just a little
bit of gold and sparkle to it and you'll
find that the shade is rather buildable
so if you want more orange equally color
just go back and pat on a little bit
more and also take it up through the
crease a little bit that's what makes
the blending of this look seamless it's
gonna go to toasted coconut in the
palette which is a matte kind of medium
brown color using a slightly smaller
crease brush because we don't want to
get so out of hand with our crease shade
that we cover up the coral that's on the
lid so just kind of carefully take that
toasted coconut back and forth through
the crease and then we're gonna grab a
fluffy brush go back to coral crush and
it's kind of like we're gonna sandwich
that Brown shape because we've got coral
on the lid brown in the crease and now
coral as sort of a blended out shade
that will be visible when your eyes are
opens you've got
blend it out go to peach fuzz which is
one of the light shades here take that
right up under the eyebrow I also used a
small brush with peach fuzz just to
brighten up the inner corner of my eye
as well next up I'm gonna take some
turquoise liner and this shade is simply
called turquoise it's from wet and wild
and it's a color icon liner just take
that all under your natural lash line
here and went once you get to the edge
actually extend that up a little bit as
if you were doing a winged liner up from
the bottom a angled liner brush and
we're gonna go to mermaid in the Too
Faced palette topping off that liner is
also going to improve our staying power
which is great I'm gonna use some of wet
and wilds mega liner just a black liquid
liner going all across my upper lash
line and once we get to the end here
we're just kind of going to do our wing
sitting right on top of that turquoise
so it's like both your lower and your
upper liner are winging out there doing
so in the same manner just kind of
pointing out toward the outer edge of
your brow and when you constantly keep
that in mind you will have the same
looking wing on each side I'm gonna curl
my lashes and apply some mascara I'm
using my owl make it up and grow love
that stuff so just apply that to your
upper lashes and I love also the
Maybelline lash discovery for my lower
lashes because it is such a precise
little brush the aisle or natural lights
lengthening and these are really nice
false lashes to use for just that added
length and it just creates a great frame
for the whole eye look I use my Revlon
precision lash glue put that along the
band pop the lashes right on my upper
lash line grab your mascara again and
finish off with another coat so to pull
together this summery look with the rest
of the face we're gonna take some
bronzer i'm using my essence sun club
bronzer and sunny it's a matte bronzer
just use that to warm up your skintone
and then I'm using NYX blush in cinnamon
this is a matte blush but it has a great
coral color it comes off kind of sheer
it's not quite as scary as it looks in
the compact there I also wanted to use a
little bit of a highlight and one that I
am loving is from wet and wild
it's called reserve your Cabana you can
that on top of your cheekbones down your
nose and another place that I love
highlighting for just an added great
look this right on the Cupid's bow area
super easy lips I'm using Maybelline
Color sensational lipstick in coral
carnation itting that on and then I want
to sheer it out just a little bit I
don't want the lips to overwhelm the eye
look so you this is a great tip for any
lipstick you want to tone down a little
bit just kind of DAB over it with your
film is giving the appearance of a
stained lip and then on top of that I
want to use my ELF lip gloss in paradise
pink this isn't so much a pink shaded as
it is kind of a golden a peach another
alternative shade would be the elf super
glossy lip shine in goddess picks up on
the little golden tones we've got going
and makes it look really fresh so it's
just that easy guys that's how you get
this look using the Too Faced summer eye
palette I must say I've had so much fun
with this palette you could go totally
neutral just by using kind of B shades
and these shades but I love that you
have options with pops of color using
the pink the coral or the turquoise is
so much for tuning in have a great day
and I'll see c'n</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
