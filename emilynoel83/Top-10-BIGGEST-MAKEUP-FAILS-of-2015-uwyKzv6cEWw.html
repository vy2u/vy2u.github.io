hope you're having a great day I'm about
to drop some info on you on some majorly
problematic products some things that
really did not work for me and I know
fails is kind of a strong word but I'm
not really sure what else to say you
know these things just didn't work for
me and I guess my advice to you would be
to consider the fact that these are just
my personal experiences you might like
some of these products you might have
different skin than me in fact I know
you do you might have different
preferences just all around just take
this info like a little bug in your ear
next time you're shopping maybe you
remember a thing or two that I said
about this or that product and it kind
of just guides your purchase hopefully
in the right direction for you but
because we just can't get enough of
doing top tens around here I thought I
would actually count this down to a
number one biggest fail so all of these
things I consider to be fails and as we
go the things just keep getting worse
and worse sound like fun so I'm starting
off with things that I like give the
thumbs down to and we're gonna end with
something that you just want to like run
the other direction from how do we get
to number one because it's it ain't good
so number ten I'm gonna talk about the
Too Faced melted metallics specifically
in the lighter shades these they're just
not a pretty finish on my lips the
metallic finish I think even when I feel
like I've exfoliated my lips and I feel
like they're moisturizing in good
condition there's nothing like a
metallic frosty look product to tell you
oh no there are some problems on your
lips and it's odd because sometimes
these will look kind of nice like an
interior lighting but then you get
outside or you look at yourself in the
rearview mirror in the car and it's like
wow that's even more frosty than I
realized so a couple of the shapes
specifically that I'm talking about are
the melted metallic peony so it's a
metallic take on the original peony
shade which I actually really like from
the regular line I'm a fan of many of
the regular melted colors but the
lighter shades and the metallic variety
just really show up frosty another one
that is like that for me is the melted
metallic debutant which is more peachy
less pink now I should point out that
there is a deeper shade from this line
it's called melted metallic jelly I
believe and it's like a really dark
berry it's got the little metallic twist
to it and
for some reason that just looks a lot
better on the looks think that metallic
shine or shimmer just isn't as
in-your-face
and that shade looks really pretty these
however do not there's something where
if I want to get use out of them it's
gonna have to be more as like a spot
lighting effect maybe just in the center
of the lips not something I want to wear
all over the lips the colors themselves
are pretty so that's kind of a
disappointment number 9 is the hard
candy sheer envy conceal and correct
palette I'm pretty sure I mentioned this
in a haul video and hard candy when that
line first hit Walmart stores they had a
corrector and concealer palette and it
was all of these shades but it was just
set up like little circles back to back
to back and I remembered referencing at
that time that the concealers are really
really thin they kind of have a greasy
feel to them if you expect coverage on
your skin which many of us do from a
concealer it wasn't going to give you
that and it's the same deal with this I
feel like they just took that same
formula which was not good and popped it
into a palette like this now I will say
that the corrective shades which would
be the shades that I would not probably
reach for as much are a little bit
thicker but the skin tone shades are
like just so incredibly thin I like
coverage and that's the number one thing
I went out of concealer so I would not
advise anyone to purchase this number
eight is an eyeshadow palette and it's
from NARS and I know Kristin Gaiman
mentioned this recently we actually
bought this palette around the same time
and it is this dual intensity eyeshadow
palette and it looks like it could be a
pretty palette some of the shades you
know have a real smoky effect smoky
potential but to me these shadows had
just a very dry feel to them just to use
them as is and then when I wet them down
I would always have creasing with these
creasing is not normally a big concern
for me I don't have super oily eyelids
just a situation where it's a pricey
palette I wish it would just be good to
use it dry but then I've got to use it
wet to get the pigmentation but then it
comes back around and I don't like it
because of staying power I'm just not
really into this formula and I was
hoping for much better from NARS number
seven is a product I found this year at
Target it's from pixie and it's called
the perk up peach under cover cray
so we all know how I can't get enough of
the peachy salmony toned under-eye
correctors because I think they do the
best job for correcting the bluish dark
under-eye circles and this really is the
proper tone I think the whole problem
with this product is that it's so thick
and dry that kind of a product is not
what I want to be putting on an area
that can be prone to showing signs of
fine lines dryness anyway just as is I
don't need to be adding anything to that
to make that worse so from a color
standpoint yay from a texture standpoint
boo maybe possible fixes for this
product would include putting some on
your finger
adding a little bit of a facial oil to
that and thinning it out just the
product as is I didn't like the way it
worked
and pixie party sells something called
correction concentrate in a shade called
brightening peach which is a better
consistency it's not quite as moisture
packed as the benefit erase paste but
it's still good and it's I think a much
better alternative to this dry crayon
and by the way some of these things
including that product I just mentioned
I have done reviews on like either on
this channel or on the Express channel
so I will link to all of those so you
can check them out number six I'm
talking about a drugstore BB cream that
just for whatever reason did not mesh
with my skin and it's the BB cream from
Rimmel in the radiance version now
what's odd about this is that the
regular BB cream the one with the blue
cap from Rimmel I absolutely love it is
my favorite drugstore BB cream I think
it's got coverage it's got a much lower
price tag than many of the other
drugstore BB creams but this works great
this just seemed like it was sitting on
top of my skin like I could sense the
little bit of luminosity that this
product had but instead of covering my
skin like a seamless glow it just sat
there and I felt like I didn't even have
to get up super close to feel like I
could see the makeup just hovering on
top of my skin part of the thing with BB
creams is that many of them do claim to
be both your makeup you know your base
step but also a moisturizer this one
does too it says it'll moisturize for 24
hours so I shouldn't have to apply
moisturizer underneath but even when I
did it
attempt to get this to go on my skin and
just I don't know mesh in a little bit
better look a little less makeup he I
still had that appearance and I should
probably also mention my skin type right
now pretty much normal
maybe verging a little bit on dry this
time of year but most of the time I
would say I'm not too oily not too dry
into the top five things are getting
worse and worse and this is the Becca
under eye brightening corrector this is
another one of those products that I
have a full video on and this looks kind
of like a pearly pink shade I would call
it
it does have some luminosity to it and
you will really notice it when you apply
it to the under eye area it's almost
like a glowy highlight type thing that
you might put on your cheeks but it's
been concentrated it's put into this
creamy formula and you're supposed to
use it as an under eye corrector I
remember the exact words were that it
would eradicate under-eye circles it
does not come anywhere close to doing
that for me what does potentially it
dresses up those under-eye circles it
makes them look more shimmery but
they're absolutely still there this does
not camouflage in any way it does not
take them away you've really got to pull
in something like this that is a non
shimmery product that can actually do
some color correcting for you this
product was just so off base from where
the claims were to what it actually did
for me I'm thinking this maybe if you're
a person who's got like hardly any
under-eye discoloration and you put some
of this in that area and you're like oh
I feel nicely brightened now maybe this
would do that for you but if you
actually are trying to take a dark
circle and make it no longer look dark
this does not do the job okay number
four things that just make you go what
the heck why what why is this necessary
this product is from benefit it's the
professional license to blot stick I
cannot find mine anywhere in here for
the life of me but I know I still have
it it's a twist up stick it twists up
almost like a lip balm it's actually
about the size of a lip balm and it
feels kind of like maybe a less
moisturizing lip balm remember when I
mentioned this in a past video I
compared the texture of it a little bit
to the dr. feelgood balm type
the idea is that you're going to
actually take this stick and blot it
over areas where you're shiny and it
takes away your shine it's kind of like
a Mallee poreless face defender concept
except imagine taking the poreless face
defender without the sponge and just
dabbing it on your face and I just hate
the idea of taking a product that I'm
gonna reuse reuse reuse and dabbing it
directly on my oily nose let's say like
it that doesn't sit well with me so this
is a combination of not even liking the
whole theory and concept of a product
but then when I actually use it I don't
like the look of it it does what many of
the products that are trying to be kind
of like the poreless face defender do
which is you blot them over an area
where you might feel like you're oily
and then you get an up-close look at
your skin and you can practically see
like little outlines of remaining makeup
on there because yeah you've gotten rid
of some shine but what's left behind
does not look perfect the pros face
defender honestly one of the only things
that I can actually put that on my skin
it's not too thick it does the job
without adding this weird film on top of
my skin so that's what the license to
blot did and I cannot get behind that
these top three are just like cannot use
products I just can't make them work
number three is the double wear stay in
place eyes shadow base from Estee Lauder
yes something from Estee Lauder with the
double wear name is a fail for me and
this base I can't wear it with a darn
thing
I get creasing with everything and I can
use so many other cheap eye primers like
this little stick from NYC the city
proof stick that was I think on my top
ten eyes list love this thing this cost
me a couple bucks anything I put on top
of it wears all day this stuff it looks
like kind of a neutral skin tone base
shade the texture feels decent enough it
feels like the kind of thing that you
might put on and you know shadows able
to cling to it a little bit better but
all it does it prompts whatever I put on
top to just kind of collect increases
and I got this with the best of
intentions I was like oh I didn't know
there was a double wear eye base that's
got to be like the longest wearing eye
base in the world because the foundation
so awesome but this was just a major
go for me number two smashbox x-rated
mascara gorgeous tube i mean it just
looks like some little makeup statue i
want to put out somewhere but when I
take the mascara wand out it has gotten
worse and worse over time with being
completely overloaded with product like
every time I take this out it just gets
more and more loaded down with product I
have a review on this if you want some
more specifics but it's kind of that
concept with the brush that a lot of
mascara brands are adopting these days
in which there are some bare places like
there are three little bear lanes on
this brush they're supposed to collect
some product so when you apply to your
lashes it's like the longer bristles
will sweep it through but you'll have
all this thickness and volume and with
this I know the problem is something
internally here where I can't pull that
wand out and see it getting really
nicely cleaned off so there's too much
collecting on the brush and then it just
way over loads the lashes and I hate
having to feel like okay in order to use
a mascara I've got to blot it off onto a
tissue waste a bunch of product I mean
for something that you're gonna be
paying a high-end price tag for I don't
think it's worth it final thing would be
the most frustrating product of the year
for me the thing that made me the most
upset as I used it and the thing that
makes me sit here and think did anybody
from the company sit around and try this
out first you know did anybody test this
before they put it on the marketplace
like it angers me I'm talking about the
kiss so simple lashes I do have a full
video on them and they are lashes that
have an attached little tab the tab is
actually attached to the eyelashes the
fluttery hair like part of the eyelashes
themselves and you're supposed to be
able to hold that tab and then you've
got glue on the lashes you can sit it
right on your lash line and once they
get on there you can just pull that tab
off and you've got beautiful lashes in
theory it should be a great thing the
tab is so glued on to those lashes
you can't just lift it away if you want
to experience the major second hand
frustration go watch the full video on
this stuff but it just it did not work
could not make it work
you get the lashes on my lash line I had
to remove them from that little helper
tab I just don't know how much more of a
blatant fail I could have because so
simple is in the name and it just took
the last process which I think many
people can be intimidated by or they
think it's going to be hard so they pick
up the so simple lashes and oh my gosh
this is awful that's all I can think
people would come away thinking after
trying those so those are my top 10
biggest fails of the year yes there were
more yes I did narrow this list down
somewhat to the things that I felt were
just the worst products for me if you
made some of these products work for you
or if they do just happen to work well
for your skin type or whatever props to
you I'm glad I of course got these
things with the intention of them
working for me as well I wish they would
have but they didn't so thank you guys
so much for watching this video thank
you for watching the Emily awards as
well that was a lot of fun to do it top
ten style this year and I will see you
again in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
