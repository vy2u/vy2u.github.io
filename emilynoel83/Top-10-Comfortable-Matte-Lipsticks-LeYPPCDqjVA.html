makeup phase that you start going
through like a certain kind of product
that you just start loving and loving
more and more of for me right now I am
becoming really obsessed with matte lips
and I think part of it is because there
are a lot of really comfortable formulas
out there right now and I don't think
there always have been so that's part of
it and I think also my lips I've been
keeping them in a little better
condition than usual I mentioned in my
colorless makeup must-haves my little
elf lip exfoliator has been great I've
been using this so regularly and just
lip balms and you know when I don't have
a lip product on trying to keep them a
little bit more hydrate and its really
made such a difference and I think it's
made these matte lipsticks apply so much
more beautifully and look a little more
flawless on the lips when you go to
those little extra steps don't get me
wrong still love my shine still love my
glosses but I feel like I'm starting to
appreciate the matte look a little bit
more lately I want to share with you 10
of the matte lip colors that I love the
most I think they are all really
comfortable formulas but also these
specific colors that I'm showing you are
colors that I really love so here's a
little quick look at the range so we've
got light kind of natural ones all the
way to deeper really really fall-like
colors when I wear these I do feel
comfortable enough just to put these on
as is I don't really need to prep my
lips with a lip balm first but maybe
you're sitting there thinking you know
what my lips are another level of dry
and they're dry no matter what one lip
balm that I recommend using under matte
lipsticks that will still maintain the
matte finish on your lips but just make
everything feel a little more hydrated
are the EOS lip balm so this happens to
be the sweet mint want any of these
bumps from just that regular AOS line if
you had experience with these you know
they're not a greasy lip balm they don't
leave your lips looking overly shine so
if you think you're going to want that
little bit of extra hydration and prime
underneath these lip products this would
be the kind of recommend but enough
chitchat let's get right to it the first
one and the lightest one that I'm going
to recommend I felt the need to throw in
and nude and this is the revlon matte
lipstick in nude attitude I think this
makes a really great kind of base lip
color for a lot of different neutral
looks you can throw in a lip liner and
not really alter the finish of this
lipstick but kind of adjust the color a
little bit this goes on really velvety
smooth and does have that purely matte
finish if you like something that's
still pretty light but with maybe a
little more peachy tone
I love the elf matte lip color in coral
I've gotta head and ordered a few more
of these because I think the format's
really unique you know it's not quite as
wide as some of the jumbo lip pencils
but it's definitely thicker than your
average lip liner so you can have full
precision when you put this on but I
think the finished color is just so
beautiful just that hint of peach
without being too loud I think people
who typically love a nude lipstick with
like this color another really natural
shade that kind of makes me think your
lips but better is the tarte lipsurgence
matte lip tint and exposed
I know exposed is a super popular cheek
color from this line but this is a
gorgeous lip color and it does have that
hint of a minty quality that the tarte
lipsurgence lip products tend to had I
think it feels really soothing on the
lips on a big fan of the regular lip
surgence products and I think they did a
great job with the matte finishes this
next one is one of my most recent finds
and I got it in an old to order butter
LONDON moisture matte lipstick and the
shade is called abbey rose I think it's
a beautiful fresh pop of pink it kind of
makes me think of springtime but I'll
pretty much wear this any time it is
such a beautiful texture totally matte
and really really long we're also kind
of unique and that is I continue to like
wear this and press my lips together I
keep feeling the moisture in this
product but yet it maintains that
totally matte finish on your lip and
this has lasted me through meals it's
just got like really epic staying power
so if you're looking for a matte
lipstick splurge that might be one to
check at leas excuse my chippy nails but
this is the butter LONDON one I just
showed you the next one is kind of close
to it but you see how it's got
little bit more like of a mauve twist to
it and this is from the Rimmel Kate
Mosse matte lipstick collection so the
red tubes and it's number 103 and this
is the first one that I tried from this
line and I remember like months and
months ago saying this is the most
comfortable matte lipstick I've ever
dried like it feels so velvety smooth on
full color just fabulous pigmentation I
think this 103 is something the pink
lovers will enjoy I also have 102 which
is a little bit lighter pink if you're
into that I'm kind of convinced that
this whole line of Kate Moss matte
lipsticks can do no wrong the other one
that I love is the 109 and this is an
awesome kind of orange e bright coral so
you don't have a lot of matte lipsticks
in this tone but I think this particular
shade is stun another kind of drugstore
matte lip product that I think is right
up there with the Kate Moss ones that I
just mentioned are the revlon colorburst
matte balms these are great the couple
of shades that you'll be seeing from
this line are this one and this one so
we're getting into some of the deeper
colors and this first shade is called
sultry and give this shade is kind of a
deep mauve I find the color a little bit
buildable the more I put on the deeper
it starts to look so you can kind of
blot some off if you want to and get I
think a little bit more of a pinky
appearance out of this shade but it's so
beautiful and it feels really really
nice colorburst matte balm that I love
and then I've been wearing throughout
this video is called stand out it's
really wonderful to have a good matte
red lip color sometimes with the glossy
or red lip products you might feel like
you run the risk a little bit more of
them drifting outside your lip line or
just getting sloppy if you're not
keeping a close eye on it and I love how
this shade really stays where I put it
it just feels really lightweight on my
lips and not to mention the beautiful
coat now my last two here we're getting
into the deepest tones so great full
option and this is just a great line all
around for really impressive color
intensity and it's the NYX matte
lipsticks so a couple to mention one
that I know I've mentioned a lot is the
NYX matte lipstick in Alabama very
similar to the shade I just mentioned
obviously same finish but just a little
bit deeper red tone
so great fall option even just a really
pretty like holiday option as we get
into that time of year which seems like
a long way off right now but you know
and the other one that is so near and
dear to my heart I remember wearing this
for my first
IMATS that I went to it was IMATS New
York not this past year but the one
before and it is in Merlot
so another NYX matte lipstick you like
this shade always looks a little
brighter in the tube than it does in my
swatch or when it's actually on my lips
it's a great full-body deep berry color
NYX matte lipsticks feel very creamy
they might feel a little heavier on the
lips than some of the other ones that
I've mentioned already but I still think
they're very comfortable so there you go
those are my 10 matte lipstick picks
again their colors that I love but also
formulas that I think are actually
comfortable thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you again soon
