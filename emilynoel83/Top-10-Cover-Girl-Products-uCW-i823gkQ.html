me for this video on these top 10 brand
videos are some of the most popular ones
that I do and I think it's because it's
just a really straightforward upfront
way of explaining what products what a
brands best products are in my opinion
and I do these non brands that I am
extremely familiar with brands that I've
tried pretty much everything that
they've had to offer it one at one point
in time or another and I'm just sharing
some of the items that I think are the
very best I've done these for several
different other brands like Rimmel
Revlon elf you know and I will put links
to those down below so you can kind of
quickly refer to those after this video
don't know really why it's taking me
till now to do covergirl considering
I've used the brand a lot I just kind of
kind of got off my radar at some point
but you guys all reminded me so thank
you very much for that but I'm just
going to start at the beginning briefly
go through these products and at the end
I have a special pic of my mom's because
she has a definite favorite covergirl
product and also an honorable mention
item that I want to make sure I get in
here too that didn't quite make it into
my top 10 after much back and forth in
my mind but I still do want to talk
about it so first off and these are in
no particular order I didn't number them
like number one and then number ten but
I just kind of doing them in categories
so starting off with face stuff my one
of my favorite face products is the CG
smoothers tinted moisturizer this is one
of my favorite tinted moisturizers it
provides a little less coverage than the
Aveeno positively radiant tinted
moisturizer however I feel the coloring
on these can be a little more forgiving
you know tinted moisturizers don't come
in like as many shades as a foundation
does so you kind of need that shade
range to be really flexible and really
sure enough to work on a lot of
different skin tones I do have light to
medium here for this and I think there
are two other possibly two other choices
and I just it's an SPF 15 goes on super
move man just even out the skin while
not being too heavy it's just a really
great tin intended moisturizer and until
I found if you know you know this was
kind of like the one I was going to this
is very affordable again you know you're
gonna find it in any drugstore where
covergirl is sold and it's nice to have
the sun protection in there and it's
also an oil-free products so if you have
excessively oily skin this is a really
nice lightweight option for your face
and it also has no added shimmer that's
another advantage I think it has over
the Aveeno is that you put this on and
you're not going to get extra shiny you
know you can use this pair it with a
concealer or powder and you're pretty
much ready to go face wise um a couple
of other face products that I really
like are the covergirl cheekers blush
--is and I do have some specific color
recommendations the first one is in plum
very glow and you can tell I like both
of these blushes I'm going to recommend
because I have definitely hit pan on
them both plum very glow as you can see
here is a fairly bold pink as it appears
here in the packaging but it has some
shimmer to it not too much you know it's
not like glittery glittery but it has a
little Sheen and it comes off a little
more sheer than it appears here but you
still get that nice pink another
favorite that I have is golden pink
which I've talked about many times again
I've hit pan on this I've used it so
much this is kind of like a warm almost
like a bronzer but a little bit warmer
kind of some deep deep peachy apricot
tones in there um but I love this so
much here's the issue I'm going to some
drugstores now and I'm not finding it
like it's not even it doesn't even have
a little label like section and so I'm
getting concerned that this may be
discontinued but however there are some
stores where they're still stocked and
selling them so I don't know if it's
just that
girl is maybe scaling back their
selection even more in some stores I'm
not really sure what the deal is
so anyway golden pink I think is great
but in anticipation of it possibly being
discontinued I have picked a couple of
other ideas for you if you're looking at
something similar there's a shade called
soft sable this is what it looks like it
has a little bit more shimmer to it than
golden pink and it's a little bit
lighter but it's right along the same
color scheme if you have more
fair-skinned but you still want a nice
contour this might actually work better
for you south say another option and
this may be more towards the darker skin
tone range is plush plum I believe
that's the shade I have here yeah and
this is you know a nice plum shade works
nice as a contour I've used this as a
contour several times before and I think
it gives a really pretty glow how would
I use this differently I would use it a
little bit lighter with a little lighter
touch and just understand that you know
the contour is going to be less like
skin tone it's gonna have a little bit
more of that rosy glow to it because of
the pinkish undertone this covergirl if
you're watching please don't discontinue
golden pink it's awesome lots of people
have agreed with me that they like I'm
gonna move on to eyeshadow sand
eyeshadows are one of the things I think
covergirl does best and when I kind of
put a little alert out there on my
Beauty broadcast Facebook page that hey
you know I'm gonna do a video about my
favorite covergirl products a couple of
you went out there and said like oh I
bet drama eyes is gonna be in there and
you know it I I mean I don't know how
many videos have featured this in but it
is so worth it I love this palette
talked about it many times it's
extremely pigmented you're getting a
nice burgundy shade a silver a black and
a white and this is ideal for a smoky
eye you will get a terrific smoky eye
with this because that black is really
the black you see there that burgundy is
absolutely gorgeous by far my favorite
palette that covergirl
and then I have some favorite single
shadows that I want to mention here real
quickly - one of them is golden sunrise
and this appears to be actually kind of
a harsh gold right there in the
container but this has been for a long
time and I've kind of gotten off of it
for a little while but as I found it in
my collection I was like you need to
keep up with that I will take like a
fluffy
you know fluffy blending shadow brush
and just kind of go in here with it and
use it up here as a highlight and it
gives the it doesn't make you look like
this it gives you the lightest most
beautiful glow as opposed to having you
know stark white up there with that real
harsh contrast with the rest of your eye
they can't apply this in a very
concentrated way as well you can get you
know for sure gold but it's also
interesting if you use it in a more
diffused way just as a highlight come
another one of my very favorite
covergirl shadows is Browns smolder what
a fantastic matte Brown this is just
great can be used as a liner can be
great for a smoky eye just kind of
smudged around the eye terrific is an
outer V gives it a little bit lighter
just in the crease for a little bit of
definition there but what I love about
these covergirl singles if you really do
get a lot of product in these and you're
not gonna run out too quickly and
because covergirl has greatly improved
over the years the formulation of their
shadows you don't have to use a whole
lot to get the effect you want on your
eyes and make them show really really
nice Brown so I use that very frequently
so I would not want to be without that
in my collection and another lighter
shade that is nice in a couple of ways
is mink and I know this has been called
a dupe for certain Mac shades is that
all the glitters someone can correct me
or give me the Mac dupe that this has
been mentioned about down below in the
comment section but yeah mink is a
gorgeous shimmery shade you can tell it
really reflects the light but yet it can
look a little bit deeper at times as
well to swatch this shade it's just more
you know that can easily be a highlight
shade I use this a lot all over the lid
and kind of blend it up into the crease
and am really in a hurry and don't want
to do a lot of outer V action there
because when it's catching the light
it's bright when you put it in the
crease or somewhere we're not as much
light as hitting it you get more this
look so from from light almost Champaign
to a light brown that's what this shade
ranges between and so I think it's a
very multi-purpose shade to have in your
collection their eye product that I want
to talk about and I don't have the
original lash blast on me but I have the
lash blast luxe
really I don't see any advantage to
having the lash blast luxe that clings
have a little extra sparkle and the
formula or something just go with the
regular lash blast will be darker you'll
get more impact I think from the
darkness of the mascara but I don't
necessarily I wouldn't call this my
favorite all-time mascara of lash blast
however I feel like it when I put it on
I do not have flaking issues I do not
have any issues with this rubbing off
and I just feel like it's extremely long
wearing without being waterproof which
means very long wearing but I can still
wash it off fairly easily at the end of
the day and not feel like I'm scrubbing
and then losing eyelashes at the end of
it but lash blast is known to have a big
brush rubber bristles short short rubber
bristles lots of people are happy with
the separation this gives their lashes
the lack of clumping and it's just it is
a really good practice 8 and 9 of my
countdown already so number 8 I'm gonna
say is the wet slicks fruit spritzers
lip gloss and I really really like if
you're looking for light shimmer on the
list I know there are lots of people
that don't gravitate toward the darker
lip shades they don't want red they
don't want brownish or bronze even but
they want something light on example
this one that I have in Bury splash is
going to give you a definite light pink
shimmer it's not going to be as opaque
as it appears there in the tube but I
will squeeze them out here and kind of
swatch it for you so you can get 90
of what it will look like like that very
light and shimmery and nice and and it
just has a wonderfully fruity scent
there another shade that I have and
enjoy is FIGS splash this is a nice kind
of nude shade and it has also a really
yummy scent and then one that I just
recently mentioned in a haul video is
the lemon which is an interesting kind
of golden shimmer to so I like the way
these smell
they're not stick nice to top off a
lipstick sheer glossy shine smell lovely
and really go on well so I like those
another thing that I like that I kind of
this is a definite rediscovered product
in my collection and I will be using
these a lot more because I just
remembered how much I love these the
covergirl lip slicks I'm having another
flashback to high school here because
these are great products these are sheer
um basically like lipsticks but they do
go on more sheer and like there's a
bronze shade the bronze comes in the
yellow here and they come off there like
moisturizing they feel like a lip balm
they're like CoverGirl's tinted lip
balms and I love them and what's nice
about them is you don't just get light
shades like this this one is starlit and
it's like super light and shimmery you
see that next to the bronze there but
there's also darker shades like this one
which is in daring and it's a little bit
more like a red shade but it's still
sheer and really really nice and know I
haven't had these since high school
these particular ones that I'm showing
you here but like I had them and then
like I don't know they just kind of got
shoved to the back of the collection
then I start looking at them again the
other day and I'm like oh my gosh I love
these so just really nice how wearable
they are this is the more red one I
already had kind of a red lip liner on
there but these go on super smooth I
like them I get to an honorable mention
product which is something that I okay
like I've tried other um drugstore press
powders that I might like better than
this for example L'Oreal True Match
because I feel like it has a lot of
coverage for a pressed powder but um
something that has just been in my purse
all the time I almost always have a
covergirl pressed powder floating around
in my purse I had in one of my purses
one of the like it's like a silver
compact and I think it was one of the
ones for oily skin and now they've
repackaged them kind of like this I
recently got this one and used this sort
of as a touch-up before the news because
it does I mean you get more matte skin
it does smell the clean pressed powder
does smell kind of Noxzema ish you know
be aware but I don't mind the smell and
I do think it provides nice matte
coverage in just for the fact that for
so long a covergirl pressed powder has
existed in my purses
I felt it needed to be an honorable
mention and this mom's favorite a
covergirl product my mom act absolutely
swears by is the outlast lip stuff and
this is just one that I happen to have
I'm not recommending specifically any
shade in her name if you go back and
watch the ends world where mom and dad
came to visit she may have mentioned a
specific shade that she likes but she
has tried a lot of the different long
wearing lip products and I know that the
covergirl outlast has proven to be one
that has been very very long wearing and
she says it doesn't like work its way
into like little fine lines you may have
around your lips and I think the shade
selection has improved somewhat she said
they've gotten you know and it depends
on where you go what are you shopping at
to the selection of colors your going to
find from covergirl and other drugstore
brands for that matter you know you may
go into one store it's like oh they have
absolutely every color and then the next
door it's like where are half the colors
but anyway my mom really likes that so I
thought it would give that a mention for
anybody looking for one of those lip
products that you know state is like
indestructible for throughout the course
of the day you like put on the top layer
which is the lip color and then there's
like a balm that you can keep putting on
throughout the day
so anyway guys that is my top 10
favorite covergirl products I hope you
enjoyed this list and I hope you will
share your favorite covergirl products
below because I know we all have our own
opinions on this stuff and if something
didn't work for you that I said work
great for me you know make a mention of
that as well so thanks a lot for tuning
in guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
