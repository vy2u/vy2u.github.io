since I've posted some videos I
apologize I've been just kind of busy
and crazy lately I've got a cold right
now so that's why I sound kind of nasal
and all but I do want to say thank you
so much to everybody that has subscribed
and commented and watched so many nice
words on the different videos that I've
done I really was not expecting people
to enjoy what I've done like that but I
really appreciate it and as always let
me know what you want to see if there's
something you you know that you want I
have gotten several requests and I'll be
working on those so also I want to give
you guys an update I have completely
reorganized my makeup so if you've seen
my makeup collection I have done it I've
gotten a new little like batch of
shelves and it's all reorganized and I
really like it
so if you're interested in seeing that
just let me know otherwise it probably
won't reshoot all that but if you want
to that's cool
also I'm going to be doing a new segment
it's gonna be quick tricks and so that's
gonna be like various little things that
I do but it's gonna be like stuff under
three minutes to explain so like a
really quick like short little aspects
of different things in video format of
course so we looking out for those I'm
pretty excited about that I think it'll
just give people you know something if
you don't a lot of time and you're still
surfing YouTube is something you can
look at and not have to watch ten
minutes worth however for this video you
may have to watch ten minutes worth
because it's gonna take me a while to
get through this because this video is
ten dirt cheap products worth trying I'm
in buy dirt cheap I mean like under
three bucks so most of the men are right
around $1 so I'm really excited about
this so I'll get started I can't really
spend a whole lot of time on any one
product or else I won't
the room also just let me know if you
need some more details on something I'd
be more than happy to explain it further
so alright start with number ten is a
product from Jordana a brand you can
find usually in most Walgreens stores
and it's their easy liners
these are eyeliners and they have quite
a few different colors I just grabbed
out a couple that I have one is called
eggplant it's a really cool shade and
kind of a a deep brownish purple so like
some unusual shades that you're not
going to find in other lines and also
that was sea green color it's like a
true actual kelly green is really what
it is we're kind of borderline forest
green but I just I feel like the staying
power is decent especially if you top it
with like use a liner shadow brush and
top it with like a shadow of a contract
or a similar color but these are like
$1.99 or two for three bucks
so really cheap and such a wide variety
great for experimenting so that's my
number 10 product number nine is the elf
regular and waterproof mascara duo
now I have to admit I have not tried the
waterproof end of this I am just judging
this on a regular end now you must know
lll products are only 99 cents apiece so
for the regular end alone its earning my
you know my kudos yes you could say and
it is really cool the thought that there
is a mascara with a waterproof and a
regular on the same tube I think that's
a really cool idea but the regular side
is what I've used and it really is is
pretty thickening actually it lengthens
thickens I don't have an issue with it
waking off and I really have not heard a
lot of people talk much about elfs
mascara but I think it's really good and
for a dollar I mean why not just check
it out and see if it works for you
anybody who strike the waterproof in let
me know but like I said I'm judging this
on the regular side alone and I like it
a lot
number eight is another elf product that
I have and it's the elf elements and so
it's a neat little case and it's just a
really nice case because with a nice big
mirror and you can actually fill this
with whatever you want I know some
people fill it with even different
brands that fit these little cases but
the elf stuff has a little magnet on the
back of it yeah it just fits right in
like so and they give you can choose
from lip glosses blushes bronzers and
eyeshadows that they haven't so I've got
a couple different things I got a really
nice eyeshadow in there and I also
really like this bronzer those are
probably my favorite items you can put
in there I'm not wild about the lip
gloss but overall I think this is just a
great idea a great thing you can take in
your purse and have you know a few
different things switch them out you
know get different different things in
there so I would really recommend that
and just the versatility I mean I know
some people really like this just to put
other products and it's just a nice
portable option for them so that is
number eight the elf elements compact
that's again a dollar and what I'm going
through this I mean I'm picking my top
pin there are other things that I like
believe it or not that are dirt cheap
beyond this category but I'm picking my
top ten things that I really think you
should try number seven is once again in
an elf product I'm really impressed with
a lot of elf stuff it's the elf super
glossy lip shine it's got an SPF 15 it
comes in a little tube this color is
like is pink kiss this color is goddess
just I mean they they have a nice range
of shades really nothing too deep so
you're gonna get a pretty neutral to
light lip color with it but I like it
because with some squeezy lip glosses
they like separate my
we haven't used it in a while you'll
squeeze it out and get like a queer gel
and then your color these don't do that
they hang together they have decent
staying power they've got an SPF in them
and they're not too sticky no annoying
set at least to me scent is very
subjective some people may not like it
but I like them I just think they're a
great product a dollar I can't believe
it great quality for a dollar seriously
okay got a move on take a dual on here
number six is else all over cover stick
this is something I've started using on
a daily basis it's like a concealer
foundation type stick just dotted over
the problem areas have really great
coverage even better coverage than some
of those liquidy concealers good over
blemishes hasn't added to the problems
of certain you know when you have a
blemish and you don't want to put
something on so it's just going to make
it worse
I don't feel like this makes mine any
worse just a good all-around concealer
for once again a buck I'm sorry I'm
still on element number five I mean get
much dirt cheaper than oh is there candy
shop lip gloss these are so cute these
little pins and they slide open and what
you get in there they have multiple
flavors like this is melon and then I
have a cherry one too not only do they
smell great but you actually get color
with this like this is actually actually
comes off as a nice peachy nude on your
lips and the cherry really does come off
like a sheer red so those are great
items moving on I've got another Jordana
product and at number four it's their
pretty shiny lip glosses these just have
a wonderful texture to them and a great
kind of you know sparkly shine but not
overwhelmingly I mean we're not talking
glitter it's got a nice shimmer to it
again of item that's $1.99 each or two
for three dollars so love those those
are great number three
is my NYC matte bronzer in sunny as you
can see I've been using the fluent white
a bit just great all over color for the
face not too shimmery great for everyday
number two is NYC's color wheel mosaic
eyeshadow you get you know multiple
shades and they just have a great
pigmentation less than I believe that's
around two dollars and I got to wrap it
up now um number one and by number one I
really do mean it's elfs eyelash curler
got a great little grip on it fits my
eye wonderfully well I've heard so many
people that like this and if you don't
get anything else from elf tribus Prada
the eyelash curler is great all right
gotta go now but that ten dirt cheap
products worth trying thanks for
