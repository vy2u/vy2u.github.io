this top 10 favorites video I've already
done two top tens already on Revlon and
wet-and-wild it's just sort of bringing
you some of my very favorite items from
different brands and today I thought I'd
use a elf because I have tried a lot of
different products from elf and some
people are actually pretty new to this
brand because it is largely available
online at eyes lips face comm that's
where you can find the entire line of
this makeup and you can browse through
it and see exactly what I'm talking
about a large portion of the brand is
yeah is just a dollar a piece for the
items you get and then there's some
different segments like the mineral line
there's some skincare thing or not
really skincare but more like body bath
and body type items and there is a new
studio line which I haven't really tried
much from that yet so don't expect to
really see those in this particular
video but I may review it down the road
but anyway it's highly affordable it's
available online for the brand in its
entirety but you can also sometimes find
these items in certain Big Lots stores
or K Mart's or targets at times I can't
really make a blanket statement say it's
available in all of those but you may
find it depending on your specific
location so let's go ahead and get
started
the first product and these aren't
necessarily ranked like going up to my
very number one I kind of split them up
into different different categories here
so it's not necessarily my least
favorite - my most favorite I had to cut
out a lot of products to make this video
because I like so many elf things but
anyway I'm gonna start with the product
that's on my lips here it is one of the
mineral lipsticks and now the mineral
products run a little bit more expensive
than the one typical $1 items on the
website they may be like somewhere from
3 to 5 dollars but this is a great
quality lipstick the packaging is really
nice - it's nice sleek black packaging
this shade is royal red and as you can
see by looking at my lips it has a nice
kind of healthy Sheen to it but it's not
super shiny and it's not overly shimmery
or anything like that
this
some nice golden eeee undertones to it
so it's a very wearable read I mean you
can if you're kind of maybe new to red
lipstick you may want to give this shade
a try because I find it to be super easy
to wear and you know you don't feel like
you're really flashing a whole lot of
red in people's faces but at the same
time it just looks really fresh and
polished another thing that really sets
this lipstick apart from a lot of things
I've tried is how it feels like a lip
balm on my lips like when you put your
lips together it's like mmm it doesn't
feel like you know a drying kind of
lipstick it's very nourishing so I like
that a lot um couple other elf mineral
products that I like I couldn't pick
just one on the eyeshadow so this counts
as one but it's really two
the elf mineral eye shadows are great
they're loose shadows so if you are into
pigments and you like kind of having the
opportunity to use a product may be dry
or also wet and you can definitely you
know put a mixing medium with these and
get a little bit thicker color if you
want but I picked two shades the first
one is glamorous and this is sort of a
mob I'm not sure how well there we go
this is a mauve colored shadow with
definitely some sparkle to it and it's
just so warm and pretty it looks nice
all over your lid it can also be a
really really subtle contour shade too
so this is one of one of those shades
that you could use alone all on its own
and get a contour a natural contoured
effect but also feel like you got
something going on on your lid as well
so it does have a hint of them some very
very fine sparkle there that's kind of
like a silvery shimmer almost but it's
it's not like big chunky glitter so I do
like that a lot and the other shade that
was just it just the toss up between
these I kept going back and forth and I
was like no I have to show them both and
this one is in socialite and this is a
gorgeous taupe shade it's deep it has
tones of
gray and brown altogether and to me that
kind of means taupe I guess it's just
the sparkle and this is maybe even more
fine than it is in the glamorous shade
but it's just beautiful and makes a
great crease shade you could wet this
down with a little mixing medium and use
it as a nice topi colored liner but it's
just gorgeous and I love that as an as a
nice natural look that yeah I mean you
just get the whole range if you want to
make it go from natural to dramatic with
that color um another mineral product
that I like to think this is the last
mineral one I'll be mentioning it's the
elf blush in rose
check out that color it is so pretty it
is a really bright rosy pink and you get
a lot of bang for your buck for this
because you're getting this nice large
amount of the product in my opinion and
it doesn't take a lot to get great color
on your cheeks I mean you really kind of
have to use a soft hand because it is
just it can be dramatic if you want it
to be but for those who are everyday
minerals fans that have tried Sunday
brunch this is kind of similar to that
and it's just one of those sort of
one-of-a-kind shades and I was so
impressed with this I think a lot of
people have the assumption that because
elf is not all that expensive it's not
gonna be very pigmented or have a lot of
color payoff this is great I mean I kind
of underestimated this I was like I just
feel like trying it you know I'm not
sure but it turned out fabulous so
that's a really really nice blush there
um next I think everything that I have
left to talk about the other half of
this review oh yeah everything is a
dollar from here on out so if you're a
bargain shopper really listen closely
here my next thing is the shimmering
facial whip in toasted okay so this is a
little like basically think of cream
shadow or a cream highlighter it can go
either way
I've used it as both and if I swatch a
little bit on my hand here you'll see
that it's got this nice kind of you know
going for practically looking skin tone
and amount you know at times too looking
a little bit
deeper almost but it's got some nice
kind of sort of a metallic tone to it it
can have so it it really gives a nice
effect if you put it underneath the
shadow you can also mix a little bit of
this in with your moisturizer and here
I've just kind of rubbed it all over my
hand and you can see that sort of just
glow that it can give you so imagine
mixing a little bit of that in with the
body moisturizer and wearing it all over
that way
a little bit like kind of as a highlight
on your cheeks I'm just rubbing
whatever's left on my finger here you
know it can work great at in that way as
well and you might think this is a tiny
little container but honestly I have
been using this for a while and I have
not made much of a dent in my supply so
you know this small amount really will
last you and there are some other nice
pinky colors too but I just like this
because I like the ability I have to use
it on my eyes a little bit more than
some of the pink shades um next if
you're in the market for a concealer and
you want something cheap and you want
something that's kind of more creamy
than liquidy try it out one of their
all-over cover sticks the mine is in
light so that's the shade that works for
me and basically you could use this as a
stick foundation although I find it
easier to blend in more of a concealer
format in other words blending it all
over your face I don't know I haven't
been a big fan of using it in that way
but as an under-eye concealer or as a
concealer for blemishes it actually has
some really nice coverage another eye
product that I definitely want to pick
to put in this is the quad in drama so
they have some $1 quads and it's four
colors together I don't know why this
one that I got happened to be in
rectangles because they're usually like
I think they're triangular shaped but I
did a tutorial using this to show
everybody how you can do a really really
affordable smoky eye and I thought it
turned out great very slowly so I am
definitely a believer in this palette so
what you get is a nice black shade a
shimmery charcoal gray a light silver
right down in here and then a white and
this is all you need to get a smokey eye
if you are just experimenting with that
look if you rarely wear smokey eyes but
you might want to do it every now and
then I mean you're only out a dollar so
you might want to give that a go for
just just experiment with some of those
shades and it really does give you a
good look I mean everybody seems to be
under this not everybody take that back
a lot of people seem to be under the
impression that you know if you're gonna
get any kind of quality looking you know
eyeshadow look it's gotta be you got to
spend a certain amount of money no you
don't you can definitely get out really
cheap with this and it will look great I
promise just need to know how to use it
so and part of that part of knowing how
to use it as having good tools and elf
really has a great eye shadow brush for
packing the shadow all over your lid my
favorite favorite brush from ELF is the
professional eye shadow brush it looks
like this and it is once again only a
dollar has this little dome shape to it
it's very thick it's a it's an has a
nice thickness to it and I stiffness to
it and that's what allows you to really
pack the shadow all over your lid it's
pretty much my standard brush for that
it uses on a daily basis and I love it
so much I have not had any problems with
the way it's put together or anything
sometimes in expensive brushes get kind
of loose between the ferrule and the
handle haven't had that issue with this
really whatsoever and another couple
quick products I want to mention are the
cuticle pen with avocado and almond oils
great great way to moisturize the area
right around your nail and push back
your cuticles before a manicure it has
kind of a marker tip to it practically
and then my number one favorite product
I know I wasn't said I wasn't ranking
this but I love the eyelash curler use
it daily have one at my makeup area here
and one in my purse and it just works so
well has this nice little way to grip it
so you're not like worried about your
hand moving around and pull out your
eyelashes so anyway those are my top ten
products from ELF I love them so much
and please let me know if you have any
questions or what are your favorite
products please share so thanks for
watching guys
