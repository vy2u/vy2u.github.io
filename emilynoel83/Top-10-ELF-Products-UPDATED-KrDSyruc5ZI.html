in this video a new elf top 10 video you
asked for it this has been much
requested over quite a while here
because the last time I did an elf
favorite products video was more than 2
years ago and that was before the they
came out with the whole studio la elf is
a brand that you can find at Target a
lot of people find it in their Kmart
stores and the full line is online at
eyes lips face dot-com there are
different ranges of products that they
have they have the elf essentials that
are one dollar products they have their
elf Studio line which can be about like
3 dollars and then they have a mineral
line with some 5 dollar items as well so
they've branched out also into making a
few pallets and different things so
browse the whole line on their website
that's where you can see everything they
have but I've tried quite a bit and so I
wanted to share with you the things that
I consider the best you start really
numbered off in any particular order I'm
just sharing them with you randomly so
one that I love is the elf studio blush
the studio blushes and I have tried
several are really good this one is
called blushing rose and it's probably
my favorite if you look up really close
at it you can see that this blush has
actually a little bit of a golden
shimmer to it and so it gives you a
beautiful glow a little bit goes a very
long way I already have a different
blush on right now but I will just show
you you know if you just tap your blush
and your brush in that you have enough
and it gives you just a gorgeous rosy
glow that can look good on deeper skin
tones you know you can build this up or
if you're a medium skin tone like me you
know it can be just great just used in a
really lightweight another elf studio
product for the face that I love is the
contouring blush and bronzer I've gone
through I don't know how many of these
as you can see I'm on my way to go in
through another one I love the bronzer
side as a contour for your cheeks so
that's awesome that's probably the side
of this
that I love the most because it's
overall basically Matt and then you've
got a shade over here that is kind of
like a peachy pink with some shimmer so
I'll use this side occasionally it's not
bad but this side fur as a contour is
just awesome a lot of us are looking for
that powder we can pump in our purse not
have to worry too much about you know I
do I have to be really careful applying
this or whatever you just want something
to touch up with throughout the day or
when you start your day if you just want
something to be able to lightly go over
your t-zone get really light coverage
but something that's a little bit oil
absorbing or can work for like oil
control that's the translucent
mattifying powder I've recommended this
to a lot of people you get a sponge and
then you've got your product and this
basically I mean this is kind of a one
color fits all product here it goes on
very sheer be able to detect the powder
on your face but yet you are taking a
step to control oil throughout the day
so I love the translucent mattifying
powder $3 product works really well
number four is one of the one-dollar
quads that I love so much this one is
called drama this is one of the first
ones I got it's even in rectangles not
triangles like some of them are but the
quality of this little one dollar
palette will blow your mind if you want
a black silver kind of toned smoky eye
you can totally get it with this I'm
talking really rich colors here it's
just awesome using with a primer you
will have staying power obviously I
didn't use a primer to swatch these and
check out that black you know it's
awesome so I love that quad in drama
that's definitely a must-have shadow
product from ELF
and the other one so this would be
number five here is the quad in day to
night and I did a tutorial with this I
think this is a gorgeous quad that they
have you've got a light creamy shade a
plum kind of a matte charcoal color and
a pretty light taupe gorgeous colors I
mean definitely this can be everyday
this can get more to remain
if you want to build up those deeper
tones these can act as liners just like
the black can that I showed you there so
I mean I think you really need to look
into these elf one-dollar shadows and
those are two of the best ones in my
opinion next up number six the elf
mineral lip sticks I love these I think
these lipsticks put off a great amount
of color but they feel like lip balms on
and they've got a nice range of colors
they continue to come out with new
colors for example an initial favorite
one that I had was royal red and I
really do like this is a nice wearable
red and it conditions your lips and it
feels good on your lips and then the
other one one that I'm wearing now is
called red white pink and this might
have been a newer released shade but you
know if you look close at and there's
there's some straight-up creamy shades
like this one some of them might have a
little hint of like a little bit frost
to them but I think they're great they
all feel good I've got like four or five
of these and I think they all
consistently feel nice on the lips and
put off great coat number seven is the
elf super glossy lip shine and these are
just a dollar and I've liked these from
the start these have an SPF 15 there's a
nice range of colors they are super
glossy as the name implies I just pulled
out a few just to show you some of the
different colors on this one's called
goddess this one is pink kiss love those
and the one I'm wearing on top of that
lipstick I just mentioned is watermelon
so you know how sometimes lip glosses
are like they're clear and appear to
have just a tint of color and usually
that doesn't show up hardly at all on
your lips these are I mean to swatch one
for you on my hand they are somewhat
creamy so you are going to be able to
see that color on your lips for sure so
I love knowing that going in with these
glosses because you can expect that okay
goddess is going to look like this it's
going to be kind of a a neutral pinky
golden shade and pink kiss is going to
be a light baby pink so I really am a
fan of those glosses and being only a
dollar you can try a whole bunch of them
eight nine and ten are all tools one
thing that I have loved for again from
the start
longtime favorite elf product is the elf
$1 mechanical eyelash curler works very
well has a nice little way to kind of
get your fingers in there and really
feel like you're holding it so it's not
like wobbling around and pulling out
eyelashes and things like that it also
opens with a really wide space like a
mouth you can easily get your lashes in
there you don't have to feel like okay
where do my lashes fish so this rubber
part here is actually very spongy so
when you use it you really feel like
you're getting you know a nice curl
happy number 9 is a I shadow brush this
is the elf eyeshadow brush just a dollar
in my very first videos was the elf
brush review and I believe I was talking
about this brush then I have cleaned it
it is not loose it is the quality of it
has stood up for so long it's only a
buck I can't believe it and it just it
lays down shadow just perfectly it is
dense it is soft you can find the shadow
brush at Target you can find it maybe
even at Dollar General or you know
wherever you can run into your elf
products but it is great for packing
color on your lid or you can kind of
wedge it in there and pull color up
through the crease but more recently I
discovered another one dollar elf brush
that I love and it is the professional
eye crease brush so this one is kind of
a domed brush it's not as big as you
know a random fluffy brush might be just
for comparison I mean see this is a
fluffy blending the crease and
everything brush this is one that you
can take in and you know build up a bit
of an outer V with its small enough to
smudge products under the lower lash
line so there you go everyone that is my
new updated top 10 elf favorites hope
you enjoyed this video and if you're new
to elf
hopefully this guides you through the
brand and gives you an idea of some
products I think you'll love thanks
again have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
