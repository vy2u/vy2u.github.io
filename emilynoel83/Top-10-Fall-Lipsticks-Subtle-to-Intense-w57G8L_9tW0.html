obvious I love lip products so much lip
balms lip glosses lipsticks I'm all
about them and I really love when the
fall season comes around because then I
think it's really time for those deeper
shades those really rich saturated
colors and I know that that's a trend
that maybe not everyone's the most
comfortable with you know like if you're
really a girl who's into the nude
lipsticks the light Pink's you know it
can feel a little strange delving into a
deep berry or red but in this video I'm
gonna give you my top ten lip products
for fall and my first five are gonna be
what I think of it's easier to wear
lipsticks the colors maybe aren't quite
as intense and I think it's kind of like
a gateway to trying those deeper shades
and then my final five will be the
richest most saturated slate pigmented
shades so I totally think there's
something for everyone in this video
you're gonna see them all being tried on
my lips and then here's a look at the
color range we've got so everything from
a little bit deeper neutrals all the way
to berries Reds and just some really
really rich colors I would say I am
listing off not only colors that I love
but formulas that I think are absolutely
some of the best of the best first one
I'm gonna talk about is from Mac and
it's a cream Sheen formula which as my
favorite Mac formula I think it's so
comfortable and creamy and smooth on the
lips but this shade is called cream in
your coffee and I've had this one for a
while and I really like the shade I feel
like it's kind of a deeper neutral color
that also has maybe a little bit of mob
and a little bit of berry mixed in I do
think this is on the side of being
easier to wear if you've never worn a
really deep lipstick I think this is
something you can put on and yeah you
know it looks a little bit deeper it's
also not super loud and again it's very
creamy it does have that hint of shine
that I think also makes it very wearable
and comfortable another great option if
you're just trying to dip your toe into
the world of berry lip products this is
the Neutrogena moisture smooth color
stick and soft raspberry and it's
actually a pretty close shade to cream
in your coffee which I just showed you
this one
got a little bit of shimmer just a very
subtle way to wear a berry lip product
without it looking you know too purpley
if that's not what you want or too deep
and dark I think it's very wearable a
great everyday type chin also these
color sticks are some of the most like
hydrating moisturizing comfortable to
wear on your lips product you like lip
colors that pack in a lot of shine
definitely check out the Sonia Kashuk
shine luxe sheer lip colors they are the
bomb I mean I have three of them I love
them so much shade that I have on now is
the sheer plum and so great great plum
something about this I feel like just
makes your lips look a little bit fuller
and I mean I know it's plum and that
might be different for some of you but
it's not a scary shade like compared to
some of my more intense shades that I'm
gonna be talking about like this one is
just a little bit more sheer a little
bit easier to wear beautiful classic
berry lip but coming from a brand new
product this is the Jordana twist and
shine moisturizing balm stain and this
shade is the cranberry crush color love
the so mice are so nice you might
instantly see these and think of the
Revlon just bitten kissable balm stains
which I like those as well I feel like
these have a little bit more moisture to
them and they definitely have that
staining quality like you can see this
is freshly applied and this has you know
quite a bit of shine on top of it right
now but as that starts to wear away I'm
just gonna do some blotting here for you
as you start to lose the shine look what
you're left with like this would be me
like three-quarters of the way through
the day I've still got a really pretty
berry look to the lips it's not as
intense as it once was but they're still
color they're kind of recommending it
here in my first half of the lip colors
because I think it's super user friendly
this is a very easy way to apply a
deeper lip color because it's more
precise than a regular lip stand then
you've also got the added benefit of not
having to reapply it constantly so I
think if you're just starting out this
would be a really nice place to do it
with a berry color alright who likes
Reds that are more bordering on berry
and less on like a fire engine
tomato type red if you
like a berry red go for the color
whisper and this shade is called very
ready this was not one of the first
color whispers I tried but it definitely
is one of the best in my opinion look at
this color this one is totally walking
the line between my most intense lip
colors and the ones that I think of is a
little more wearable I think these go on
so easy and smooth you've got kind of a
lip balm --is-- feel on the lips with
these color whispers and I just think
the application is very simple but yet
the color on this is so darn rich
surprisingly rich for something being
called a color whisper right I don't
care I'll take it I mean this shade just
screams holiday special occasion I'm
going somewhere fancy but I want a lip
color that's actually gonna feel
comfortable and hydrating and light on
the lips so I really like this okay so
we just went through our first 1 2 3 4 5
lip colors now buckle up ladies it's
getting intense these are for people who
want to play and want to have some fun
with their lipsticks this shade is wild
I love it so much it's from markets
called make it rich it's a lip crayon so
again one of those jumbo pencil type
things
unlike the Jordana in Neutrogena that I
showed you earlier those actually twist
up when you need more product this one
is one that you sharpen and this
specific shade it's called peony it has
a little bit of metallic happening here
I'm sensing a little bit more of a
purple tone this is a fun going out
party I want my lips to make a statement
kind of shade and I love it Milani color
statement lipsticks if you have not
looked into this line and you like
lipsticks with full full color check
them out this shade is called uptown
mauve one of my favorites of all the
line that I've tried and this has a
decent amount of purple in there did you
see how this went on it goes on like a
champ I mean full full color all the way
no need to overlap it's got a nice rich
creamy formula I could just see this
color with like your hair pulled all off
from your face I barely there I and then
these lips are making this statement I
love this color those classic classic
red with full color is from Tarte it's
the glamazon lipstick in wild this is
real red this is not a red
goes on the far orange end of the
spectrum I feel like sometimes these
lipsticks when I wear them alone also
look slightly matte as well so for a
really classic red lip you might want to
give this one a shot they also have a
red called fierce I believe that's a
little bit more Orange II if that's what
you line down we're going from classic
true red to a red that's a little bit
deeper and this is from NYX this is the
matte lipstick in Alabama think of the
Alabama Crimson dyed and this is that
kind of a really pretty crimson color
it's actually thinking about mentioning
in this sort of slot of my video the NYC
sheer red but then I thought I think
I've mentioned that one enough people
know that I like it but that shade like
this is you know a really pretty red
that's just a little bit Dean I think
for some people this kind of a red can
be more wearable than an all-out bright
red can but I love this shade these mix
matte lipsticks look into that line they
are all so saturated and beautifully
pigmented no shine on the lips at all if
that's what you're going for
all right queen of darkness here and
this is a really really super dark
lipstick from Revlon it's from the Super
Lustrous line and it's called black
cherry and I know it is the rich vampy
deep color that some people may be after
maybe not everyone but I know that some
people really like a nice deep lip but I
want to let you know that this shade
actually can look one of several ways
this is what it's like applied straight
from the tube and that's how it got on
the lips with like the fullest color
possible but if you apply it with a lip
brush or if you were to just dab it on
your lips with your finger you would get
more of a look like this which is like a
sheer berry so it can go between that
and that it can go several different
ways and by the way I just kind of
roughly apply this and I'm seeing some
mistakes in the way I put it on so I
just want you to know it is a really
great color it's a color that can go a
lot of different ways and if you're
looking for the richest of rich this
shade is nice and this whole Super
Lustrous line is nice so there you go
guys my top ten lipsticks for fall I
hope you enjoyed this video and again
these are all formulas that I really
really like so even if you think well
maybe I don't like that shade but I'll
look into that product these are really
really high-quality and lipstick
formulas
thanks for watching I'll see you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
