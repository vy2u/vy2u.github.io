you have probably noticed I use a really
wide range of products everything from
stuff that I get for a dollar to um
select items that you know I've gotten
as gifts or you know occasionally some
high-end stuff but since I have done 10
dirt cheap items worth buying I wanted
to do ten high-end items worth buying
and so you know over the years I have
seen some high-end products I mean I
pride myself on being a bargain shopper
but there are some more expensive items
that may be worth looking into so I'm
going to give you ten of my picks and
you know if you want any more
information on any of these feel free to
ask me because I am going to have to go
through and kind of quickly to get them
all in um number ten is a particular
toothpaste eyeshadow in two phases the
brand and the color is glamourpuss
and it is like a a kind of shimmery
taupe shadow and it is just a great
everyday color umm I love the packaging
of these I think they're so cute and I
just I really like all the Too Faced
shadows but this shade in particular is
just a fantastic everyday shade so
that's Too Faced shadow and glamourpuss
I love that and my number nine item is
philosophy cinnamon buns lip shine
anybody who's tried this is probably
saying oh yeah right now because this
smells so good it smells exactly like
you know hot cinnamon rolls but it isn't
just a clear lip gloss but it's really
shiny and it lasts a long long time it's
not even that expensive really but it's
just for the snow alone just to keep
this in your person take it out every so
often and just to smell it I'm a big
scent person so I really like that so
that's number nine number eight if
you're going to try a primer there's a
reason why I'm recommending this in the
small size because
I am NOT one of those people that feels
like I have to wear primer every single
day so for me having a smaller size
works well and Smashbox photo finish
primer really is great and you've
probably heard a lot of good things
about it and a lot of them are true this
does help your foundation go on really
smooth what I've told people in the past
is I feel like primer aids usually in
the ease and application but I don't
always see a total difference in the way
my face looks afterwards but if we're
talking high-end products that are worth
giving a try you may be surprised at how
much more easily your foundation goes on
with this stuff and like I said travel
small sides of it and see how you like
it there because you still get a pretty
decent amount for the money and so it's
a Smashbox photo finish primer that is
my number eight product number seven is
an item from bareMinerals
it is bisque because that's like it's
called their multitasking face product
and this is commonly used as a concealer
in their brand I have a lot of products
in the bareMinerals line but this is
really really great and picking it
because I think it can be used pretty
well with them you know another makeup
brand of another type just to like say
you put on a liquid foundation and then
you wanted to touch up with this stuff
with a concealer brush over certain
areas the coverage is really amazing for
a product with a powdery consistency I
really like it bisque that is the shade
so it's not why I mean there's bisque
and then there's like summer bisque but
basically this is the color for
under-eye concealing it's great it
really has wonderfully great coverage so
try that out that's bisque from
bareMinerals at number seven and number
six
here's another smash brought Smashbox
product it's their um cream liner duo
I have their cream liner duo's in a few
different shades this one just happens
to be midnight brown and blue black as
you can see you get two creamy liners
and you really need a liner brush
usually to make it work but as like a
little water on your hand dip your liner
brush in it and then dip it into this
and it applies so easily not only on
your top lid but also your bottom lid
too and it's one of the products where
unlike a liquid liner you can take a
smudge tip a q-tip or anything like that
and smudge it out and make a really easy
smoky eye with this kind of thing so
that's Smashbox cream liner duo not
going to restrict the shades on that I
think any any one of them is great from
brown to black to this like a midnight
blue color really good moving on to
number five I'm going to nominate
Smashbox lip gloss for this Smashbox lip
gloss has a really nice consistency I've
got so much lip gloss and some of it is
not the greatest some of it is too
sticky some of it is too watered-down
and this has got to be like the happy
medium this is one of the things like
they sell it in different different like
formats I guess this is like a
double-ended one that I've gotten in
like a limited edition set that's kind
of a nude color and then a sort of berry
shade and I've got other shades from a
holiday set that are a little more sheer
but it just goes to show that whatever
variety they make a very good quality
lip gloss so that's just something we're
looking into if you're trying to
experiment maybe with that brand and you
think I want to try good lip gloss I
really don't think you're going to go
wrong with the Smashbox brand number 4
is I'm putting a Mary Kay product in my
high-end category and
it is their age fighting lip primer okay
so this just basically looks like a ball
and I'm not really I won't say I'm
extremely concerned with age fighting at
age 24 but what this does is basically
keeps your lipstick on your lips for
those of you out there that think a
liner is enough maybe certain liners are
but you don't even necessarily have to
use a liner if you're using this lip
glosses lipsticks stay put when you use
this underneath it's really smooth it's
just a really really fantastic product
I'm so glad I have it and I it's the
kind of thing that I'll keep getting
over and over again it's just that great
and just something you can totally count
on days if you're going to wear like a
red lipstick you know you don't have to
feel scared about that leaving your
mouth if you put this on okay
moving on number three is makeup forever
Diamond shadow in this really pretty
sparkly black shade everybody needs to
have a good quality black eye shadow
because that can be your liner that can
be your crease that can come out to make
a nice little you know cat eyed effect
it's just good for so many things and
this is so pretty with the very subtle
sparkles in it you can maybe see kind of
in the video here umm it's just
fantastic it would I mean I used this
almost on a daily basis in some way you
may think oh that's only for a really
dramatic I will know it doesn't have to
be you it's it talked to you how you use
that number two product is my Merrill
veil from bareMinerals I'm sure people
have heard about this product and heard
what it does it's just a great finishing
touch for any makeup you're wearing
works obviously great with the bare
minerals line but works well with you
know so you just used a liquid
foundation a regular blush and then put
that over the top of it even I
I found that it's really nice in here in
areas where you get dark around the side
of your nose in towards your I use a
concealer brush with a little mineral
veil in there really brightens that area
up and then my number one product is a
Smashbox eyeshadow okay it's I have
trios and duo's in a lot of different
shades it is it makes doing eye makeup
so easy it blends so well the colors are
so rich you just it's a wonderful
product I love it I love this trio and
smokey eyes that came with their
expertise kit I just I do use this a lot
of the time if you're watching me in a
video
lots of times I'm wearing this just a
great great product so thank you so much
for what for watching those are ten
high-end items worth trying thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
