channel you know that I like to
sometimes take a particular makeup brand
and rank my top ten items from that
brand I don't usually do them in any
particular order and I'm not with this
one either but I'm just picking ten of
my favourite products from the brand and
these are usually going to be brands
where I've tried a lot of the stuff so I
can give you a pretty accurate idea of
what's good from the brand so today it's
Maybelline so I'm just gonna go ahead
and quickly run through ten products
that I really really like so starting
with face products the first one is a
foundation that I've been really
impressed with from Maybelline and it's
the super stay 24 hour makeup so it's a
liquid foundation and it is one of the
longest wearing foundations I have it's
right up there with Revlon Colorstay in
terms of staying power it claims to be a
zero transfer 24 hour wear foundation
and I've got to say there have been a
couple times where I have had this on
for almost 24 hours I mean I get up
early I do my makeup for the news and
sometimes if I run into a situation
where that's had to stay on longer than
I wanted it to this would still make it
through so I think this is a really good
product I would say in terms of skin
types this will work for pretty much any
skin type I think it would work
especially well vote for people who have
borderline dry skin because it seems to
I don't want to say hydrate you but it
really evens out the skin and I feel
like it almost has a nourishing feel to
it it blends very easily and it's not
one of those foundations like sometimes
with Revlon Colorstay especially I know
I haven't tried the normal to dry
formula but the combo to oily I know
that I put that on and I feel like I
have to blend it very quickly this one's
a little bit easier than that so again
that's Revlon super stay 24-hour makeup
it's the foundation how about a couple
of concealers now actually I'm really
putting one officially in my top ten but
I'm gonna mention another one because I
know it's a huge favorite of a lot of
yours as well the one in my top ten is
the dream mousse concealer I use it in
color called cream that's like 4-5 by
the way
shading the foundation is classic beige
anyway
this concealer is great for under-eye
I've got it on my under eye area now
this has been a daily use product for me
lately and as you can see I mean it just
comes in a little glass jar it's very
easy to use if you're familiar with the
dream mousse dream matte mousse
foundation this is a little bit creamier
and it seems to have a little more
pigmentation so it works really great as
an under-eye concealer or you know any
other areas of your face that you want
to conceal and also keep matte not shiny
not attracting any attention to lines
pores etc so that's a really really
great concealer now one that I've
recommended in the past that you know of
these two right now I kind of put this
one out on top but this is another great
concealer and it's the maybelline
mineral power natural perfecting
concealer and this it's good to have you
different kinds of concealers something
creamy like the dream mousse but also
something more liquidy like this this
can blend over larger areas of skin
quite nicely it has good coverage this
can also be a good under-eye concealer
as you can see you know you're working
with an applicator here and you know if
you don't typically like to wear a
foundation maybe but you want to cover
up you know certain areas after you put
on a moisturizer you just want to use
something quick this can be used very
quickly and can still look really
natural on the skin so those are a
couple of different options depending on
the formula you prefer next product is
the maybelline mineral power foundation
I reviewed
quite a few of the items in the mineral
power line quite some time ago and I
still think after trying everyday
minerals after trying bare minerals and
different things this is probably my
favorite drugstore mineral foundation um
I feel like I would equate this to the
everyday minerals matte formulation and
they have intensive matte original glow
they have different different formulas
but the matte is very good coverage and
it doesn't
get very shiny on the skin so here
you're dealing with the typical kind of
sifter thing you taps them into the lid
you use a good buffer brush or a kabuki
brush and you blend it all in and my
shade on this look at the cap on and
look at the bottom sandy beige it's
medium one this is a really good
drugstore foundation and if you're
trying to experiment with mineral makeup
maybe you've never tried it before so
you don't want to spend much on it I
think this will give you a pretty good
indication of how a good mineral makeup
will work and if you do have oily skin I
think this works pretty well in keeping
that at bay I guess and now to a product
that I do definitely reach for without a
doubt without fail every single day and
I use it in a very specific way it's the
Mabley mineral power finishing veil
powder I have this in light so this is
what it looks like you've got a little
compact here and like Maybelline is
doing with a lot of their compacts like
the mirror part swivels out I don't
really use that sponge but you have a
mirror in there here's what I use this
for you could use it all over your face
is basically like a finishing powder
just to kind of do away with any shine
you could use it periodically throughout
the day is just a sheer powder but I
love using this with my little generic
concealer brush that probably came from
Walmart or Big Lots or something like
that and I just get a little bit on the
brush and every single day no matter
what after I do my eyeliner I Pat this
under my eye I've had this eyeliner on
since 1:30 a.m. where I got ready for
the news today and putting this on
underneath I don't have any smudges
underneath this is great with I think
kind of absorbing any oils that come off
of the of the liner and I put it right
up as close as I can get to the liner
without going on top of it okay very
easy trick but for some reason this
powder does an exceptional job of just
kind of keeping everything in place I
know that's a huge concern for people
though the liner getting all over and
with it being summertime you're going to
sweat you're going to deal with that
even more so this is awesome a blush
that I really like from Maybelline is
the dream mousse blood
that pink frosting I believe is the name
mine says whipped strawberries and this
is one that I've had for a little while
but I believe it's known as pink
frosting now and it's just a pinky shade
probably looks pretty bright right here
but I mean to put some on and kind of
blend it out it blends to a nice pretty
sheer kind of pinky cream blush there's
a peach satin shade that looks nice
there's a bronzer with this that works
well too but you get really fresh
looking pink cheeks when you use this
shade and I'm just impressed with how
pigmented it is for a product coming
from the drugstore it has a really nice
blend ability to it a lot of people seem
to express concern that I've had this
question actually quite a bit on people
saying okay I put on cream blush what if
I'm going over you know my foundation or
I'm going over the top of some other
makeup product I've already put on and I
don't want to like rub it all off well
this is a great example of a makeup
product that is sort of a basically a
cream product but you put it on and it
is so lightweight you don't have to
apply hardly any pressure when you blend
it so you don't feel like you're
blending away whatever was underneath
and things like that you know what I
mean it's so light you can have such a
light touch with it and really get on
that nice pigmented effect top this off
with you know a powder blush you're
gonna have a really long wearing look as
well so any of the dream mousse blushes
you know just pick your favorite shade
but I think they all work really well
okay how about we move on to some lip
products let's see I will start with
what I have on right now and this is I
think it's called the volume XL
seduction lip plumper it's a really long
drawn-out name I don't love the names of
all the Maybelline products but this is
really good it's a great gloss it's a
little thick but I tell you what that
helps with staying power and it does not
travel anywhere you know outside your
lip line so that's great you're going to
take the cap off it clicks up from the
bottom it comes out from this top part
this is solid plastic there isn't any
sort of like sponge tip going on and
basically it just comes
out the top when you press that there
this is the shade I have on and it's
really glossy you feel a little bit of
tingle and I think you get more of a
plumped effect I truly feel like this
does plump your lips up it gives you
that temporary kind of tingling
sensation basically an irritant sort of
to your lips that's how lit plumpers
work and it makes them you know get a
little more full this shade is 705 and
this is a pretty kind of neutral beige
new a little bit of a bronzey shade
great for summer and they also have a
gorgeous pink shade in one Punishers
that's 705 this is 115 and this is a
really pretty pink very kind of shape a
next lip product that I love or the
color sensational lips lipsticks by the
way this was one this only counted as
one and so is this color sensational
lipstick sort of like the equivalent to
like the revlon colorburst only their
maybelline brand and they come in a ton
of colors lots of different color
families the color selection on the on
the what would i call these the color
selection on the color sensational
lipsticks is probably better than what
most brands have to offer they just have
a lot of shades to choose from and they
come with these little caps that just
lift all the way off and then you know
lots of different shades this one is
born with it this is what I've
recommended and lots of people have
liked it's kind of a light super natural
pink shade with a little bit of like
nude tones to it as well another great
shade is blushing brunette if you like
that kind of natural rosy tone it's it
appears kind of a reddish but it's I
trust me it's not too red it's not
unnatural at all it's super wearable
makes the whole face kind of light up
these go on really smooth I like the way
they feel I haven't had any like drying
effects on my lips or anything from
these so I think they're great and the
color is really bold and true to what it
appears to be on the lipstick itself so
good
stuff there four-eyes gotta recommend
the lash discovery not as a primary
mascara but I love using this again a
very specialized used for this product
on my lower lash line
the brush is tiny in case you haven't
seen this before
it's a teensy little brush and it's
great for highlighting those small
lashes on your lower lash line or right
in here it just makes them stand out you
don't want to have your lower lashes
looking super chunky and kind of
unnatural this gives them some
definition if you have really light
lashes you're just gonna help them stand
out a little more I think that's a great
mascara and I feel confident putting it
on my lower lash line and it doesn't
smudge or go anywhere in terms of a
regular mascara I really like the XXL
Pro 24-hour bold you may have seen
little displays of these individual like
double ended mascaras they have one
that's curling one that is like lash
extensions they've got all kinds of
things that these different mascaras can
do but the 24-hour bold is really good I
like that even just the one side this is
a great brush you get a lot of
concentrated bristles they're not too
long it's a tapered tip so it's easy to
get into the inner lashes just on its
own that side works well for getting
volume and stuff but then you have this
other side that I think really tops off
the length and really sets it and makes
you mix it all good to go for the day
full volume eyes great looking lashes
and yes
oh hello the Sun just came out I think
it kind of just washed me out there but
that's okay anyway it really it really
works well and it will last you
throughout the day and into the night
finally let's top it off with some eye
shadow had to think about this for a
little while but I'm going to say that a
recent favorite product is coming in and
it's kind of knocking out what used to
be a favorite for a long time I'm gonna
say my favorite eyeshadow palette from
Maybelline is bronze colet's these
colors are really great and you pair
them with a darker brown shade and
you're gonna be really impressed they
are all pigmented they are all soft and
they all give you a fantastic color
payoff look at those shades I like
putting you the the light shade on the
inner part of my lid the bronze shade on
the outer part and this warmer shade cut
right here kind of in the crease and
then take a dark brown and kind of mix
that in with it as well it's so pretty I
really like this but yeah I do like
taking a dark matte Brown and kind of
putting it right in the outer corner
that's my favorite but another one that
I just want to mention it's not included
in the top ten but stylish smokes
charcoal smokes is a good kind of smoky
eye kit if you don't have one already
don't like it quite as well as covergirl
drama eyes but this one's got to be my
favorite from Maybelline so thanks so
much guys for tuning in for this video I
hope you enjoyed my top ten Maybelline
products and please if you don't agree
with something I recommended or you have
another favorite you'd like to add or
you'd like to say hey yeah I love that
thing to definitely share it in the
comments section I encourage people to
look to more than one source if you're
considering buying a product so I think
that helps people who are kind of
skimming through the comments section if
you can provide your own insight on
these things as well so thanks again for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
