tuning in for this video I love doing
these top 10 favorites videos because
it's where I pick a brand that I am
really familiar with obviously if you're
gonna pick like top 10 favorite items
you know maybe you haven't tried
everything in the brand but you know you
are familiar with a lot of the items so
I've already done these videos on Revlon
wet and wild elf and now today I'm doing
it on Milani and the reason why I chose
my timing to be this way for this brand
was because I just found out thanks to
some loyal viewers and subscribers and
whatnot that Milani is now available on
cherry culture calm most of the brand is
on there so if you I've heard from a lot
of people you know I've highly highly
recommended some Milani products but
then I hear oh it's not in my drugstore
and that really makes me feel bad so I
was so excited to know that many of
these items
pretty much everything maybe it's set
for one item that I'm gonna mention here
is available on cherry culture calm so
that's really great news so I'm so glad
that you all will have access to that
again so anyway let's get started I'm
gonna just run you through my top 10
favorite items and I don't have these
really ranked in any specific order just
I'm gonna start off with the face
products um first is the Milani sunset
duos what these are are a blush and
bronzer in one so you're gonna see that
I've hit pan and a lot of these items
and so I think that's a testament to how
good these really are this one that I'm
showing you I have these in about three
different colors but this is probably my
favorite and sunset breeze and it's kind
of a medium toned bronzer with a plummy
colored blush that actually has some
shimmer to it I don't of these two
things obviously it's the bronzer that I
enjoy a little bit more what I like so
much is the fact that it's a matte
bronzer and I've talked about time and
time again how a matte bronzer is a
really good thing to have in terms of
getting that all over just kind of
deepening your complexion a little bit
while still looking natural because you
don't have shimmer and glitter all over
your face so this is a great thing to
have in your collection and
maybe you're not a huge blush person but
you do want a little something to use
that's a great blush color as well I
love that pretty kind of shimmery plum
shade so if you're trying to get kind of
a two-for-one thing going get grab one
of these these are really really nice
products now another item I'm going to
suggest here that is kind of similar to
this you'll notice it's a little bit
it's got a little a little different
tone to it it's got a little bit more of
a peachy slash a little bit more orange
you tone to it and this is the Milani
powder bronzer you can see it's got kind
of that like little floral print on it
and this one that I have is in light and
you might think I mean I feel like I
have a medium skin tone but I got this
in light and it really works well it's
just you know you can kind of take your
pick it's a lot like the sunset duos
it's just you know a little bit warmer
and you don't get the blush with it so
if you're not at all concerned about
having this blush you might want this
but I love either of these products I
will throw them into my makeup bag for
work on any given day and I you know
they're just great to use and this well
if you look up really really closely you
might see a hint of like a little bit of
a pearly glow to that but overall it
really gives off a matte look all over
your face that shimmer really does not
come through a whole lot like it does on
some bronzers so anyway there is a
couple of great bronzer options for you
um my number 8 product is the Milani
glimmer stripes I have these in a couple
shades as well but the one that I'm
featuring here is in Bury glimmer and
you can see I did an eye tutorial on
this I think I called it it was one of
my teen tutorials called multi-purpose
pink and I basically went through and I
used all these on the eyes and I use
them all over the face as well so these
are really really versatile colors and
the formulation of these colors in the
glimmer stripes which there's also like
a bronzy one too there's several
different tones but this is very similar
to the Milani single eyeshadows and
those are very popular for their texture
their color payoff so you use these and
you get some more
you know a pallet of basically five
unique eyeshadow colors which are so so
pretty and I mean they've just got a
gorgeous hue to them they go on great
there's so much fun to you know blend
and make up your own little I look with
them but at the same time you put a
fluffy
you know allover face brush in this and
you've got a nice rosy toned highlighter
so basically it's another one of those
products where if you want to cut
corners and get sort of a two-for-one
thing going you know perhaps maybe the
bronzy tones would be more for you or
you get some Browns and some cream
colors and golds and things like that if
you think hey I'm looking for eyeshadows
in those colors but I can also use this
all over my face as my highlighter
you're good to go so I love products
that do more than one thing the next
thing I want to talk about is something
that had mentioned in so many videos I
don't even know it's the Milani minerals
blush in my tie okay
so this is the way it's packaged as
you've got this little part that lifts
up the actual pin and you get a mirror
on the other side and a little brush
that I really don't use so I can't
really talk that brush up too much but
this is great this is a great great
color it is all about color there is not
like a bunch of filler and shimmer in
this this is such a pigmented blush I
have that on right now and I use it most
days I would say and I love the fact
that it's a peachy pink it is
I think universally flattering on but it
pretty much any skin tone and if
somebody asks me what is a good natural
blush that is actually going to help me
see a difference in the way I look give
me that look of health and energy in and
and a really vibrant look I would
suggest this more often than not so
anyway that's the Milani minerals blush
in my tie and those are available for
sure on cherry culture as well as is
everything I've talked about so far
except I think maybe the big powder
bronzer in light I'm not sure that
that's on there yet they may be still
building some of that up but anyway the
next two products and I'm counting these
separately are the Crystal gloss I have
two of them that I want to talk about
this
one is the one I have on and it is in
it's worn off because I've used it so
much it's the label used to be like
printed right on there but this is an
summer baby I think it's called and I
have that on my lips right now what this
is is a gorgeous gorgeous shimmery um
pinky gold gloss so it's like you're
getting a light kind of neutrally pink
with some pretty gold undertones another
added bonus for these crystal glosses
ooh I just got it on my nose
they smell like absolute like a vanilla
frosting or something I don't know they
just have the one of the greatest sense
of any lip gloss that it's not meant to
be scented you know what I mean they're
not promoting this as like a wonderful
smelling lip gloss but it just has that
you know universally sweet kind of
really really nice scent to it so I love
that so that one is summer baby and then
I have a coral one here called
tantalizing and I did not see this one
on the website but I do have it in my
drugstore so if you have access to this
in stores maybe keep an eye out for this
one you can see that's a gorgeous
gorgeous coral with again some kind of
golden undertones and I believe it has
that same scent yes it does it's so
pretty I love how these glosses go on
because you really get color with them
you know it's not just one of those
super sheer all you're gonna see is
shimmer you know I feel like I've got
that pinky golden glow that really sets
off the rest of the face with this one
that I put on so and this one is also a
real face brightener too with that coral
tone alrighty so we got the lip glosses
out of the way in the face products now
we're gonna move on to the eye products
Milani is known for having some
fantastic eye products especially in
terms of their single eyeshadows I hear
them you know compared to Matt
continually as you know a kind of a
duplicate product and they run you know
only a few dollars a piece and you're
getting great quality great color payoff
try and think of what else I can say
about these that I mean there's really
no dry
back to these in my opinion so I just
wish maybe they had even more color
selection because I think they could
really really sell these products
because they are so great but anyway
I've got three individual eye Milani
eyeshadows to tell you about the first
one is illusion I've used this from time
to time and some tutorials
hopefully it's coming off so you can
sort of see it there but what this is is
a really really pretty light pink with
gold with golden tones to it I don't
know if you can see as I hold my finger
there but you're getting like a light
shimmer but it goes from pink to gold so
it's not going to necessarily look the
same in all in all different kinds of
light but it's a really really unique
color you can see if I kind of turn it
back you're seeing more pink and then
more gold head-on so love that shade so
much another one that I love for just a
dark shade in the crease or even as a
liner shade is javabean so here you're
looking at a pretty much medium to deep
brown with some some shimmer to it and
when I say shimmer all of these three
that I'm going to show you have some
shimmer to them but it's not chunks of
glitter and sparkle you're seeing more
of a sheen more of like a pearly tone to
it if I get a little swatch of that on
my finger you can see it's just that
gorgeous gorgeous warm Brown finish
there and then the last shade I want to
tell you about in terms of the singles
is flare and this is kind of like an
orange II copper and I love using this
shade if I were going to put these three
shades together for a look I would do
illusion all over my lid which is the
light shade I would do javabean in the
crease and maybe a little bit of the
outer V and then just to warm up this
area right up here does that kind of
fades up to your to your brow we're into
a highlight shade I would use flare
which is just a really really warm shade
and I like using it super sheer there it
is right there on that finger there and
it's and you're looking at you're
pulling thinking ah you know metallic
orange what you know that doesn't really
make sense but you put it on really
sheer you get this nice warm wash of
color if I were to do it let me
just go ahead and grab a brush right now
and kind of show you what I'm talking
about you just get a little on the brush
use it kind of as your crease shade sort
of fades up into your highlight shade
and you get just this really pretty warm
wash of color I love how that works it's
a really again a unique shade and you
wouldn't think of using it like that but
it actually turns out really natural so
I love that okay you got to get through
this now I've got one more product to
share with you and I have done a
tutorial using this palette and I love
how versatile it is one I mean I talked
about having loving have a product where
it can do more than one thing and this
is it this is the this is the fashion
shadow in catwalk it's the runway eyes
collection and you can see what you have
to work with here you could do a smoky
eye using the white the silver and the
black you can add some color to it with
the blue or this kind of Ruby shade and
then you've got this pretty kind of
grungy gold to throw in the mix so you
could go so many directions with this
palette and I was able to do a look
where I incorporated I believe it was
the white the red the blue and the black
and it really turned out cool so this is
probably my favorite out of the runway
eyes collection however they do have
some other really cool looking palettes
there too and you can find it on sherry
culture so anyway guys that is my top 10
favorite Milani products I hope you're
all excited about having that
opportunity to find those items online
now and hopefully this video gives you
some ideas of some good things to look
for so thanks again guys so much for
