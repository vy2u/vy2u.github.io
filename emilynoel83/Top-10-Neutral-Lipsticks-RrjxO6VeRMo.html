taking the time to tune in for this
video I'm going to share with you my 10
favorite neutral lipsticks so that can
mean neutral as in you know a really
light nude lipstick that might
practically erase your lips or down to
something that's a little bit deeper but
it's still in that neutral color family
you know it's not pink it's not very
it's something that has like maybe some
brownish undertones or kind of a caramel
in color and yeah I've just kind of
selected some of my favorites and I kind
of you know what I'm thinking about
ideas for videos I sort of think about
you know what have I been getting a lot
of emails about or what have there been
a lot of questions about on the Facebook
page or Twitter or things like that so
this is why I thought this would be an
appropriate video and I will have
swatches of these lipsticks on my blogs
so if you want to kind of be able to
compare them a little bit more
side-by-side through a swatch you can do
that so anyway I'll just kind of get on
get on with the descriptions here and
try to keep them as short as I can the
lightest lipstick that I'm going to
recommend here is from Revlon it's one
of those revlon colorburst lipsticks
that you know i love so much and this
shade is soft nude and so this is you
know you may have heard people talk
about this before but this is a really
light nude lipstick what I put it on
with my skin tone I feel like it almost
makes my lips blend in with the rest of
my skin it's it's creamy it doesn't have
shimmer in it so if you just want that
creamy nude lip look this is going to
give you that classic nude lip to where
it is practically you know kind of
making your lips not stand out too much
if you want that emphasis real heavy
emphasis on your eyes then this might be
a good lipstick for your lips on those
you know maybe you're going out and you
really want that kind of contrast going
on so again that's soft nude from Revlon
the color burst so it's got this kind of
packaging with it and it is a creamy
lipstick it is something I'm not going
to call it a long wearing lipstick
because it's just not one of those super
long wearing kinds but I also don't feel
like it wears off that quickly either
it's just kind of one of those
in-between the next one is from wet and
wild and if you've been
keeping an eye on the wet-and-wild brand
it's been changing a little bit and they
have some new matte lipsticks and this
one is 902 C so it's kind of stinks but
you have to kind of identify some of
these just by the number but it's 902 C
and this is going to be a little bit of
a deeper nude shade so like this is
going it's still matte and it's really
pretty but like if I compare this to
soft nude this is the sort of color
difference we're talking about so this
one shows up a little lighter it's got a
little more shine to it just cuz it's
one of those creamy lipstick so this
one's a little more matte and just a
little darker but if you are looking for
that neutral color on your lips
personally I like taking this and
topping this with a little bit lighter
gloss right in the center of my lower
lip I think it looks really really
pretty that way but this is not gonna be
one of those crazy shiny lipsticks but
it is going to last a fairly long time
on your lips which is sort of impressive
there but yeah from wet and wild you're
gonna get a really good price on that
and it's just a nice you know if you
don't like to necessarily look like your
lips are erased from your face but if
you do have a deeper skin tone this may
be like a good nude lip for you I just
kind of now thought of that but you know
if your skin tones a little lighter this
is going to be your nude but this may be
the nude for someone was a little deeper
skin next up sort of one of those light
shimmery shades that's kind of sheer
kind of just really going to look nice
and shimmery on your lips and this is
from another one from wet and wild this
is one of their regular like I think
they're $0.99 lipsticks and it's 547 B
just a light kind of champagne shimmer
this goes on kind of sheer it feels
super light on your lips and I kind of
like this because I think these shades
that are super light and have a little
shimmer kind of brighten up the face you
know so that's a really really good
lipstick there from wet and wild next
one is another one that has you know
that little bit of shine that little
almost metallic edge to it and it's from
Nick's or NYX whichever you like to say
it and it is called Seto
see eto this one is kind of a little bit
deeper than anything we've talked about
so far but it has kind of a more complex
tone to it you can see it's got almost a
metallic feel to it it's coming off a
little bit deeper on camera honestly
than it appears here in front of me but
it's kind of like a peachy bronze is
kind of the way I would describe this in
person and it's fairly light and it just
has a nice amount of shimmer it's going
to be very complementary to other skin
tones and it's not going to be one of
those lipsticks that you put on and you
feel like to make this work I have to
use a gloss with it it can look really
nice on its own next one is a light
lipstick but it has a little bit of a
pinkish edge to it and it is the elf
mineral lipstick so you can find this on
the elf website in nicely nude and this
is what we're looking at for this
lipstick it is really I feel like it is
a nude color but it has a lightish pinky
peach tone to it with a golden undertone
so if you look really really closely at
it you can see that the shimmer very
subtle by the way not chunky the shim
shimmer in this actually has a golden
tone but the lipstick itself is like a
peachy pink so this is really really
pretty it's gonna give you kind of a
natural look and like I said the
shimmers are very fine in this so it's
just gonna come off like a nice creamy
lipstick really you're not going to see
a lot of kind of chrome metallic look
with that this next one is a huge
favorite of mine and it is another one
of the revlon colorburst lipsticks so I
had soft nude earlier and this one is
blush so this one is so wearable so good
I would recommend this for so many
people of different you know skin types
because this is just a really nice
neutral shade it's creamy it goes on the
lips and really I mean the color pops
but yet it's not it's not an over the
top kind of look you know what I mean
like you're getting a lot of color but
it's so wearable it has um kind of its I
would call this like a rosy tone neutral
it has a little bit
like a deep rosy mob and twist to it but
it's it's just a really great color and
I mean it just kind of makes your whole
face look sort of pulled together it's
kind of hard to describe
sometimes with these products I really
like it's like I just can't quite find
the words but I think you're really
gonna like this if you've been on the
lookout for a neutral lipstick and you
just haven't found what you've been
looking for this one is so nice and just
the fact that it has that little bit of
a rosy tone to it if you got some blush
on its gonna bring out your cheeks it's
gonna really make the whole face lifted
next one I have to talk about is the one
I have on right now so we're talking a
little bit deeper and still with a
slight rosy tone but I'm still calling
it neutral because I just really don't
feel like this is a berry I don't feel
like it's a pink at all and it's one of
the Rimmel moisture renew lipsticks
which I really love just pretty much
like I like the color burst I really
like these two and this shade is dusty
rose so this is what I have on my lips
now so as you can see it's kind of
neutral but it has that little bit of
mauve that's like a Mavi Brown almost
and I don't know if you guys have looked
up Alba mayo on YouTube but she's great
she wasn't one of my contest early on
and I've loved her videos ever since I I
found her on there and I she talked
about this lipstick looked great on her
I liked it on myself as well it's pretty
creamy so this does not have shimmer and
sparkle to it so straight up kind of
creamy lipstick a little bit deeper I
think it really can dress up your look
just a little bit where some of these
other neutrals are just so wearable you
know they're not gonna really stand out
a whole lot but this is a little more of
one of those neutrals that's going to
pop a little bit more from your face the
next two are sort of like a drugstore
dupe and a high-end version that are
very very similar to talk I'll talk
about the high-end one first and that is
Mac's
Viva Glam 5 I don't have a lot of matte
lipsticks I only have a few but this is
one that I'm so glad I got because I
heard it heavily recommended by people
and even the girl that the counter was
recommending this to me and I
got it and I was not disappointed so
this is what we're looking at here this
one does have some shimmer your see I'm
seeing like a golden toned shimmer in
this and as for the lipstick itself you
know it's an it's a neutral shade it's
got some Brown it's got a little bit of
bronze in there and it's got maybe a
little bit of a hint of like a rosy
color but not a very very muted on that
side so neutral lipstick but something
that's going to give your face a little
color not going to erase your lips if
it's going to kind of enhance you know
the cup natural color of your lips I
love that little gold shimmer to it I
think that's really really pretty with
the Viva Glam 5 but I think I've found
something that is the drugstore dupe of
this and it is moisture renew from
Rimmel in sunset very very similar in
and it's right down to that little tiny
if you're looking right up close at it a
little bit of a golden shimmer to it
it's got sort of you know tones of peach
and light bronze and just a really
pretty look and you look at them side by
side and they are very similar it almost
looks like when I hold them up here
together but Viva Glam 5 has a hint more
mob in it and this has a little more
gold but really they're they're very
similar on and just watch them they look
very similar as well so I was kind of
happy with that find I thought you guys
might like to know about that as well
we're getting to number 10 already can
you believe it Wow times flying for me I
don't know about you but my last one is
from L'Oreal it's a color riche lipstick
in Eva's caramel so this was when they
came out with all of those star inspired
shades for all the celebrities that are
endorsing their products they all kind
of had their own lipstick shade and this
is Eva Longoria shade and so this is the
deepest one I'm going to be talking
about today but I still feels definitely
a neutral this has some tones of red
deep bronze gold I mean it's just it's
it's a kind of like a warm color but
it's kind of like I've got a lot of deep
bronze in this that I think is very
pretty
it's not too dark it's not gonna
overwhelm the face but I like it I think
medium skin tones would look great on
this I mean you picture Eva Longoria
people with her skin tone and darker I
think would really look nice with this
if you have super super fair-skinned I'm
not sure that this would be the best
pick for you but this is I mean if
you're going for a really maybe dressed
up look and you want those that your
face to come across very polished very
finished and you still want to keep it
neutral this lipstick I believe would be
a very good pick for you so um thank you
so much for tuning in for this video and
hearing me ramble through all ten of
those lipsticks just recently got off
work and I'm still in my work gear my
work makeup my work here right now is
but I've been thinking kind of about
doing a video like this for a while so
I'm glad you tuned in and have a great
day and I hope to see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
