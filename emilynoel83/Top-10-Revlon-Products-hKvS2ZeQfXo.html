doing a little bit different thing in
this video I thought it would be fun to
take a brand and kind of tell you what
my like top ten things are from that
brand and it's something I might do with
brands in the future but it seemed wrote
like a really good idea at the time to
do something with Revlon because I have
tried a lot of Revlon products and I
feel pretty knowledgeable about the
brand and able to tell you what I think
really works so I'm going to go ahead
and start with face products the first
thing Revlon Colorstay foundation I use
a shade for oily slash combo skin in
fresh beige and this is really really
good makeup I use this actually before I
got into the Rimmel lasting finish
mainly just because I come across the
lasting finish in a sale or something
like that and the shade just at the time
suited me better but really these are
they're both great foundations and
usually if somebody comes to me and says
oh I you know tried the Rimmel and I
can't find my shade the upside to the
color stay is that there's a little bit
wider range of shades for you so you're
more likely to find something that will
work this is often compared to Mac
Studio Fix I know a lot of makeup
artists actually really enjoy using this
foundation so you really can't go wrong
with it I mean for me it's I mean I
really like both of those so they're
very long wearing and it's just a great
great liquid foundation another Revlon
face product that I like is the pressed
powder in light/medium that's the color
I use I'm not sure if I was a a
different skin tone I would like
whichever one matched me but that's the
one I have if you were wondering yeah
I've used quite a bit of this
you practically see yourself in this
part too now but this is just a really
nice pretty light powder works very well
in conjunction with the foundation if
you use that foundation you want the
powder to keep in your purse throughout
the day to kind of touch up with this
Revlon powders really nice nice little
sleek black packaging to there I'm also
really liking the Revlon brushes the
newest ones that they're coming out with
are really
really nice quality and I I actually
found the ones that I got at Big Lots
but I know they are selling them at
Walmart too and they're a little bit
pricier than you know those other you
know little drugstore brushes that are
hanging up there but there's a reason
why these are definitely great quality
you can see this is the contour brush
and it's pretty pretty long here and
it's yeah contour shadow brush it's got
really nice soft bristles it's just a
great size for a contour brush you can
see how that might work for me they're
very soft very nicely put together
nicely made I also have a concealer
brush although I'm just counting this as
like one item Revlon brushes but that's
the concealer brush they have too so
that's definitely worth looking into and
especially if you need something and
maybe something broke on your you need
something right away and you can't
really take the time to order from
another company that's that would be the
place to look I would say if you're kind
of in need of that gonna having that
drugstore emergency and you need a good
brush to tide you over and just to use
just to add to your collection these are
great okay moving on to lips now first
thing I want to mention is the Revlon
matte lipstick in nude attitude and
looks like this and this is a really
really good nude lipstick at for a true
nude lip like this kind of really I mean
III hold it up to my skin and it kind of
almost looks like I'm holding a
concealer up there so you are gonna get
that almost erased lip look but that
that can be really good for that true
nude effect that you want there and the
fact that it's matte you know you can
either leave it matte or you can go over
it with a nice gloss or something like
that and use that to kind of amp it up a
little bit if you want you have that
option here so that's nice and to other
lip products here first the Revlon Super
Lustrous lip gloss awesome awesome
product I mean this I would say any
shade here I've tried so many and I like
so many of them are just happening off
be holding up one here that is toast to
shine and it's just kind of a golden a
golden a light beige shade and the
texture is so nice the color selection
is gray
and they actually last quite a long time
however you know you may not sometimes
you don't always want like this super
super long wearing stuff on your lips
and because it can be a bit drying this
feels very good on your lips now that
being said they have another great lip
gloss that is a little more of a long
wearing thing if you're really into the
long wearing stuff I'm not talking like
the purple
you know the lip what stuff you paint on
and let it dry this is actually a lip
gloss it's Revlon Colorstay mineral lip
glaze and it is basically a long wearing
lip gloss it's able to last for quite a
long time they also have some great
shades so I'm going to say any shade on
this I've tried three of them that I
like so far this one is what I'm wearing
right now in lasting shimmer and it's
just awesome it's just you are gonna get
a little bit thicker texture than you
are on the Super Lustrous but both are
great I mean if you're looking around
and you're thinking maybe I can't find
the shade I wanted one or the other I
really think you might be happy with
either of these there's a bit of a
stronger scent I believe with the
mineral lip glaze but this is great -
this is really smooth really shiny -
you're gonna get some different finishes
with the Super Lustrous some are more
shimmery have a little more glitter to
them things like that here like I've got
shimmer but it's overall kind of more of
a smooth effect with the lip glaze I
hope I didn't totally confuse you there
bring up those two different lip glosses
but just rest assured I like them both
so moving on to eye shadow I really like
that they're 12 hour eye shadows it's
Colorstay product and these really these
really are long wearing this palette
that I'm holding up here is in nude
elements I'm gonna say any shade on this
- because I've got like a set in sultry
smoke and coffee bean and one that's
more like a purples and pinks and I
really like them all and they're nice
nice pigmentation on them just really
easy to use easy to blend and and they
are very long wearing so I mean that's
not a lot a lot of companies will put
that label
this is long-wearing this is so many
hours but Revlon is one of the few
companies that I feel like can really
deliver on a lot of those claims for a
lot of their different products so
another shadow type thing I like are
their illuminance cream shadows these
can be greatest bases especially if you
want a different colored base if you
want to go over it with more of a sheer
powder and then let that color base
shine through the one I happen to pull
out here is in not just nudes and so
that's like a nice range of kind of like
a skin tone shade shade onto some
shimmers and then a deeper Brown I've
tried lots of these do you see what I
try to get something I like I sometimes
go and try a lot of different shades in
it so I think they have something it's
like kind of a jewel tone one that has a
pretty kind of emerald green and a darks
like sapphire blue and those are pretty
- these are I mean these are being sold
in stores right now but you can often
find these in Big Lots as well and it's
just great to have that color selection
and again with any cream shadow I say
this over and over but don't use a lot
don't put it on real thick try to keep
it a thin coat and that will improve
your staying power there okay we're down
to the last two products and they're
both liners the Revlon Colorstay pencil
liner shades I've tried our black black
brown which I'm holding up here and
Blackberry all great I'm wearing the
black brown on my lower lash line and
then on the top lash line I'm using
Revlon Colorstay liquid liner in
blackest black probably my favorite here
I really haven't branched out as much in
terms of the liquid here wearing that on
the top lash line just my favorite
you know liner combo is from this brand
they really do work well and last a long
time on me and you could of course use
this all over your eye to UM just great
products so of course there are things
that you know from Revlon sonica like
everything that I tried from Revlon but
they do have quite a few great products
so I just thought I would take this
opportunity to tell you what some of
those are for me anyway so thanks for
watching guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
