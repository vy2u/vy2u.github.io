for this video this is going to be a top
10 favorites video I love these because
they are just so super straightforward
easy to understand everything I'm
talking about this video in this video
is something I would recommend sometimes
I do these videos and then people still
comment and ask so what did you really
think about the mascara well you know
like if I'm putting it in this video it
is something I would recommend to you
clearly it's your choice you know if you
want to go out and buy these or not but
these are just things that I've tried
they've worked for me I would hope they
would work for you but obviously I can't
make that call as with any review you
know it's everybody has different skin
types different reactions to different
products so while I can tell you this
worked for me and I really like it I
can't give you that guarantee so you are
kind of going on your own decision here
if you want to buy those of course but I
have done these kind of videos for other
brands as well so if you want to see
what those are I will post some links
over in the sidebar but this is gonna
take kind of a while because it is 10
different products you're gonna see kind
of a mini explanation on so let's get
started first one and these aren't by
the way in like like the first one I
talked about is the best they're in no
particular ranking in this video I'm
just listing 10 of them off so and there
may be more besides this that I really
like but I just had to narrow it down
somehow these are really hard videos for
me to do as well first one is Rimmel
lasting finish foundation my shade is
200 soft beige and my goodness this is a
great foundation I've recommended this a
lot lots of people have loved it it just
it's a mineral enriched 16 hour
foundation though it goes on your skin
blends really easily really long wearing
good for your skin because it's got it I
mean it's mineral and rich and it's
oil-free so for those of you who are
worried about a little shine you know
there is one alternative to this that is
somewhat like this but it is the Rimmel
stay matte so if you're really really
concerned with oil maybe try that out
but either way I think I mean this is
kind of a universally good foundation
only problem I can pick out with this is
that they don't have a very broad shade
selection so if there's not a shade here
that works for you that's kind of when I
start gearing people toward
Colorstay if they don't have your shade
but 200 soft beige is absolutely an
exact match for my skin tone number two
product is Rimmel fix and perfect primer
just kind of wanted to talk about these
two together because a primer is a good
way to after you moisturize and you let
that kind of sink into your skin it's a
nice kind of barrier between your face
and the makeup kind of keeps that
foundation from sinking into your pores
and then kind of becoming non-existent
by the end of the day so this is a nice
little layer sort of a think of it as
almost like a protective layer to put on
your skin and this shows up in a peachy
shade some people with very dark skin
tones have said they don't necessarily
you can kind of see there it does rub
into your skin somewhat colorless Li but
some people with very dark skin tones
have said that they're not in love with
this especially but I do really like it
as opposed to some of those primers out
there that are gel like and some people
feel like they make them kind of oily
this one is sort of creamier but it rubs
right into your skin and it does create
that nice base for your foundation you
go on smoothly and hopefully last a
little longer too so number three Rimmel
natural bronzer I love these this is a
product the best way I can describe this
do you all know how much I like NYC
sunny which somebody told me on my
Facebook page that they email the
company again and now they're saying
it's not discontinued so yay happy dance
for that but I didn't know that like I
called you remember back when I did the
initial video talking about this and I
said you know I called the company and
then I asked if it was discontinued and
they told me it was I don't know if
everybody made mad dash to the store and
they're like man this is selling like
hotcakes now they've got to keep it but
one of my subscribers one of my facebook
people had said that it is no longer
discontinued it is part of the regular
line and they got that email from
someone from the company so they
forwarded it on to me so it looks
totally legit awesome thank you for
giving me that info but why am I talking
about that well when I was with my
friend Kaylee and we were shopping for
makeup for her
and I was going to pick her up some of
that NYC sunny but the store we were at
did not carry it and so I found the next
best thing which is actually pretty much
a whole lot like that product and it's
the Rimmel natural bronzer plus natural
minerals looks like this the only thing
I'm not wild about with these is how the
packaging is I feel like like you got to
just twist it just right for it not to
lift off but you can it's possible I
carry this with me my makeup bag all the
time and haven't had an issue but they
look like this
and the way I'm holding here is the one
I'm wearing today which is sunlight
which is basically a matte bronzer this
is them gonna be that your most close
dupe to NYC sunny lasts on my skin is
not too orange II is not too dark as you
can kind of see as I hold that up there
kind of use it as a little bit of a
contour just dusting it lightly all over
my face no shimmer to it so that's great
but the other one that's good is
Sundance this one does have a little
shimmer to it I'll hold them both up
some by side by side but I'm
recommending both of these because I do
think they're both good Sundance might
be a little warmer and sunlight might
have a little more yellow undertone this
may be a little warmer and it does have
some subtle shimmer but really it's not
gonna show up like super Sparkle on your
face so you don't have to be too overly
concerned about that you'll see the
difference if you check them out in the
store though but Rimmel natural bronzer
very good stuff nice alternative to NYC
sunny if you need it maybe you don't
have access to NYC but you do have
Rimmel so check that out next thing is a
mascara and it is the max volume flash
max mascara in extreme black that's in
the bright pink tube with the gold
riding on it it's a super flashy mascara
if I show you the brush here you're
gonna see that it's a rather large brush
but it's not and it's not monstrous by
any means it's got like it's a
traditional brush with just some kind of
like spiky medium length bristles and it
tapers down to a point so you're gonna
put this on it's gonna give your lashes
a really rich black look but it's also
going to build a lot of volume like I
talked about in my Lancome Hypnose
review it's something you want to apply
somewhat slowly to prevent
clumping and you know kind of go over it
again slowly in multiple coats and you
can kind of build it up but I like this
mascara mascaras are kind of one of
those polarizing topics and makeup some
people you know you hold one up and say
I love this and somebody else will say I
hate that so I don't know it worked for
me just kind of watch your application
methods with it and it may work for you
as well
love that one now to an eyeliner that I
use every day for work because I feel
like it instantly wakes me up and just
makes me look really alive and it works
great on the news and the the trick is
the soft Kohl Kajal eyeliner pencil in
pure white so I this right on my
waterline I have it on there today
and sometimes when you wake up in the
morning that area looks a little bit
reddish or pink or and you know what
that just makes you look tired you can
have a fully done up you know I makeup
look but then when you look I mean that
part looking kind of pinkish or reddish
you can just kind of make you look sick
and tired honestly so this is a really
really soft pencil and I just will go in
and put that on my waterline and I feel
like my eyes it's basically what we've
done is expanded the amount of whites of
my either so my eyes look a little more
wide open a little more wide awake and
like I said taking the redness away just
adds to that effect so it's really soft
and nice I've really gotten in the habit
of using this daily because I love what
it does to wake up my eyes obviously
you're putting something on your
waterline that's not gonna stay as well
as something you're putting on your skin
but still I mean it's a white liner so
it's going to fade and not be really
like a big deal but this Lysol
throughout my newscast and I just love
it so a good way to kind of perk
yourself up some makeup artists will say
you know you need to use beige pencil
instead of white because the white comes
off too stark but I don't feel like this
comes off like I don't feel that way how
did I guess maybe this some eyeliners
that are more pigmented than this what
come off even more of like a stark white
but this just seems to give just the
right amount in that area so I love that
okay next to a lip liner that I have
talked about several times before Rimmel
exaggerate lip liner in ravish the best
red lip liner in my book love it
this you'll notice like this when I
talked about was a pencil that you would
sharpen this one is an automatic liner
that you just twist up and this is just
great I love the red color on this it's
not too bright bright cherry red but it
is just enough red to just work with all
your kind of berry lip colors you got a
cranberry or a cherry red or you know
whatever it may be this gives great
definition to any red lip look next item
is a gloss that I'm wearing right now
and it is the Rimmel vinyl bronze mirror
shine lip gloss and summer nude I think
I talked about this in a video and also
on my blog if you want to see close-up
swatches check my blog Keys this is like
a pinky shimmery shade it's kind of like
a light rose shimmer and not like big
sparkles of glitter shimmer just really
soft and I've got this on my lips right
now and I'll kind of talk about this in
conjunction with the lipstick I'm
wearing which is the new fairly new
product out the moisture and new
lipsticks a little crown on the top
purple tube really pretty this is this
shade is dreamy and so what you got here
is sort of that light kind of pretty
pinky nude sort of color I really like
it got a little shimmer but it's kind of
like a pinky a light pink beige probably
the best description I can come up with
and I topped it with this which is
summer nude and this is the result and I
really like this for being a light lip
that doesn't erase your lips and erase
and suck the life out of your face I
feel like sometimes you need just a
little bit of some kind of warmth in
your lips sometimes to just really perk
it up and bring the face to life so
again this lipstick shade is dreamy
goes on really smooth these new moisture
in
sticks have collagen in them and a lot
of vitamins and also their SPF 18 so
they do feel really smooth they have
kind of a lip balm ish sort of feel to
them I was just telling Tyler look that
like I was like I need I was looking for
trying to fish some lip balm out of my
purse and I didn't have any but I had
this and I was like well that's okay
this feels like a lip balm anyway and
the gloss works really really well very
shiny has a great texture a light light
sort of borderline fruity scent but goes
on really nice and actually has a decent
amount of staying power for as
non-sticky as it is so really like those
two paired together next lipstick is
another one of those new moisture renew
lipsticks this one does not have shimmer
it's more just a creamy lipstick and the
shade is dusty rose so here you're
looking at on its it comes off in person
actually a little more on the nude like
a like a deep neutral shade I feel like
the camera is picking up a little more
red in this color but so think like a
neutral shade with a hint of rosy mauve
it's creamy
no shimmer to swatch it here for you
it's really pretty it's it's swatched
right there on my hand you can see how
it kind of you know that shine that it
has that moisture in this lipstick
really kind of catches the light just
like it does when it's on your lips but
you're looking at a neutral kind of
muted Mavi pink and what I love to do
this has been like a consistent like
go-to look for me I like this one but I
liked if I want something a little
deeper I'll take this shade put it all
over my lips and then find like a white
frosty lip gloss and just highlight the
center of my lips and it is just it
makes the face pop I don't know what it
is about it but your lips look full they
look shiny but not you know overly so
and that shade just really works great I
could see that working on a lot of skin
tones doesn't make you feel washed out
it's not brown by any means it has just
enough warmth in it and just enough kind
of like I said a Mavi pink to this to
really look pretty on your lip
and still kind of have that neutral
undertone which I like now I know I got
some people out there that are not all
about the nude lip and so I've got
something for you something that I love
also what I want that plumb sort of
deeper lip oh gosh I've talked about
this a lot
look how used this is this is metallic
seduction this is not one of the
moisture I knew this is the lasting
finish and what you got here is kind of
a swatch it and then maybe that'll help
me describe it's got a little bit of
shimmer
it's swatched right here it has a really
kind of fresh scent to it and this is
sort of like a wine shade with hints of
red like kind of a reddish wine color I
would say almost a little bit of
cranberry you've got some sort of like
blue undertones to it but it's just a
really really pretty shade great for
just when you want to throw on a little
deeper lip and I'm not talking deep deep
dark black note I mean you can see it's
just got that nice deep kind of berry
look to it I love this shade I've used
it so much it just is another kind of
face brightening lip color I like lip
colors that don't just put something on
my lips but they do something to the
look on my face to make me look a little
more alive so there we are we're at ten
now those are my top 10 favorite rental
products I did have to leave some close
ones you know just off the list you may
have noticed I didn't mention any eye
shadows and that's because I don't
particularly care for the Rimmel
eyeshadows I'm not a huge fan I've tried
some and like had some quads where I
thought oh this one shade was you know
kind of soft and creamy but what about
the others so I mean I haven't had that
as great of luck with the eyeshadows if
you think there are some eyeshadows I
should try that sort of defeat this
stereotype I've got going in my head of
Rimmel eyeshadows let me know but as for
these products I've mentioned today now
I've tried and tested by me and I really
like them so thank you so much for
tuning in for this video and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
