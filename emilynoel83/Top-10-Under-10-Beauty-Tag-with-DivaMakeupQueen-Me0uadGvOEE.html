was all created by my friend wing and
you may know her as diva makeup queen
she's here on YouTube she's so great I
would highly recommend you subscribe to
her Channel
when it comes to like new drugstore
stuff or reviews or anything she's so on
top of like the new stuff that comes out
and I just enjoyed her so much actually
got to meet her in person and I met in
New York and this past time I don't like
the makeup friend that I need is a
next-door neighbor you know so um she
actually came up with this idea first
off you come up with your top 10
favorite beauty items that are each
under ten dollars and then you put
together a look using those items so all
of the items that I'm mentioning in this
video are part of this look the first
thing I'm going to mention here and I'm
not listing these in order of preference
but more so just in order of the way I
might apply them to the face first thing
is my covergirl plus ol a concealer ball
continue to love this even after you
know mentioning it in the Emily Awards
this past time but I think this is a
really great stick concealer it's a lot
creamier than most I find a lot of stick
concealers can be kind of dry this one I
actually am not wearing any foundation
but I just went around the face you know
with this in different places where I
need it is just so easy to quickly you
know dotted on blended in and nothing
looks cakey when I was thinking about
powders and stuff I was actually going
back and forth a little bit between the
one I'm gonna mention and the NYX stay
matte but not flat powder foundation but
the reason I mentioning this one this is
L'Oreal True Match pressed powder is
that I feel like this is really
versatile it'll be good as just a light
touch up type thing I think you can
apply it with a spoon you don't really
pack it on and make it more of a full
coverage product so it's whatever you
want to be and I'm wearing this of
course again today the actual texture of
this powder is just a little bit more
high-end feeling than a lot of the
powders from the drugstore it just kind
of like hangs together a little bit more
doesn't come off just real flaky powdery
light on the skin another product that
has been something I've loved for a long
time
definitely repurchase this several
tightly it's kind of a rediscovered
favorite because I've got a lot of
different blushes and bronzers I've been
using but I love the elf contouring
blush and bronzer this is in the they've
got several different like color combos
now but this is the one in Saint Lucia I
believe and this is probably my favorite
I've tried all the different ones and
this one I believe has the most matte
bronzer and then the blush has a little
bit of glow to it it's kind of like a
peachy golden shade really nice product
for the price that's a three dollar
product and I love it I wanted to name a
few eye products as well and if you're
doing this tag you know you can name
whatever kinds of things you want to but
I just tried to get a little bit from
each category that you can guess the
kind of eye shadow I love wet and wild
color icon eyes shadow love them love
them love them I mean I use these all
the time I'm always kind of
rediscovering different trios and
different eight pan palettes that I love
a really good basic I mean the comfort
zone I think is nice because it has some
great neutrals and gives you some kind
of wearable colors to experiment with
but one that I reach for the most
is to the silent treatment as you know
if you've got any of these a little bit
goes a long way it does not take much to
create the look so what I did here with
this look as I took the brow bone shade
put that all over my lid worked in a
little bit of the taupe colored eyelid
shade on like the outer part of the lid
and in the crease and then I used in my
outer corner this really deep dark shade
that has some nice little sparkle to it
and it just gives you a great works with
anything type of eye look that's what I
would classify this palette as works
with anything any lip any outfit it just
looks good and it's so pigmented and
rich you could get a deep dark smoky eye
easily with this so I love it I
definitely felt the need to name an
eyeliner because I have one in my
collection that I just feel like is
really multi-purpose and if this was the
only eyeliner I had I feel like it could
do the different things I would need it
to do
would be you know lining my upper
lashline or lining my waterline or being
something I could smudge on the lower
lashline for a smoky eye and it's the
Maybelline master drama in midnight
master that's the black one
it's a retractable liner love-not Avenue
sharpen and it just goes on so nicely
for the upper lash line is it does a
decent job for me of staying in the
waterline to one of those liners where
when you put it on you know you can
smudge it out
but it will set to an extremely long
wearing state in just a matter of
seconds so you don't have a lot of time
to long wearing eyeliner is very
critical of those that tend to smear a
little bit so this is a great long
wearing one from the drugstore I started
thinking about what kind of lash product
to include I've been so back and forth
on this it's like I've got a lot of
mascaras I really like I've got a lot of
false lashes I like but really
regardless of what I'm doing with my
upper lashes the same thing is typically
always on my lower lashes and that's
Maybelline lash discovery mascara I just
get the regular kind and it does not
smudge at all
and it's just the perfect thing to you
know highlight your lower lashes and I
just figure if I'm reaching for it so
often if I've repurchased it so many
times it's a definite favorite whether I
want to do false lashes on top or
something more natural by the way I am
wearing let it wear are they kind of
false lashes that I'm loving and they
are the red cherry number 43 these got a
blog devoted specifically to them I'm
just really enjoying those I really felt
the need to name a lip product and I
feel like I'm kind of wearing different
lip products every day I'm trying to
switch it up and get use out of
everything in my collection but
something that I think really can serve
a lot of purposes for me is a Revlon lip
butter I mean it's gonna give you
intense color it's gonna give you the
shine go-to shade for this season for me
something that I just think is rich and
juicy I've got it on my lips now call it
a bright buildable red okay this one can
look a little more sheer when you first
put it on but you can definitely add on
some more and it's wild watermelon this
is one of the newer shades that
come out and I think it's gorgeous if
you got into the lip butters when they
first came out maybe you've got a lot of
different shades but check out the new
ones sorbet is another gorgeous one if
you like like a bright pink magenta type
shade but this is just so juicy
wonderful red and like I said when you
first put it on it can seem a little
more sheer but you can build that puppy
up in no time and it looks so pretty I
think my last three things they're not
makeup but they are things that I feel
like I use all the time where Beauty is
concerned or just getting ready for the
day or taking off all the makeup at the
end of the day I mean these are
important things in my routine and
they're all affordable and so I wanted
to give them a mention as part of my top
ten the first one my equate to and one
daily facial cloths and these are really
just like the Olay kind I go back and
forth between them all the time these
are probably the best value because you
can get in here comes two packs of these
are the normal skin and I just love the
way they take off all my makeup make off
all the eye makeup
they're a little dry cloth like this and
when you moisten it it lathers up and
you can just really remove everything
and I don't know where I would be
without these there are not a lot of
things that I've been using consistently
since college but this is one of them
Olay you will find comes in oily to
combo normal to dry and sensitive skin
as well so you have a few more options
there but these work great for me and I
love them all so hair wise something I
used to create this style you may have
seen in the little clips where I cut to
actual application of some of the makeup
products but velcro rollers gosh I love
these for creating volume and big waves
with my hair with this look I actually
just kind of swept it I took out the
rollers I swept it all over to the side
and just clipped it right back here
particular rollers are from Sally's and
they're made for fine hair they actually
have a little bit longer loops there so
they catch your hair a little bit better
but the ones from goody are fine as well
they're good the goody ones are good you
can get them in like full sets
definitely for under ten
or you can buy your own like four or
five packs and use those too
and my Tresemme my Tresemme hairspray
whether it's the big cans sitting on the
bathroom counter or the little can
floating around somewhere in my purse
I've got to have this this is my go-to
hairspray I need it to finish my looks
all the time no matter what special
occasion everyday doesn't matter that is
my hairspray it's the tray to level four
I've got it all the time that's my top
ten under ten dollars again if you want
to do this tag each item that you pick
has to be less than ten dollars and if
you can somehow show it in the linear
look like actually use it in the look
and the video you shoot that would be
really cool I think it's a cool way for
people to actually see how the items
come off so thank you wing for creating
this idea and involving me in the
kickoff of and I hope you'll check out
diva makeup Queen if you haven't already
she is awesome and have a great day guys
