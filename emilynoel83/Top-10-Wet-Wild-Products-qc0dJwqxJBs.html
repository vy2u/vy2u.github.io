video it's going to be another brand
favorites video which I did one of these
before on Revlon and it went over really
well and I just kind of was thinking you
know what kind of things do I want to
see in a makeup video and I really liked
taking common brands that are available
in the drugstore and just kind of
telling you what some of the top
products are in my opinion so I'm gonna
give you today my top 10 wet and wild
products so as you know wet and wild is
available
it's very readily available and it's in
a lot of drugstores I find it at my
local Walgreens or Walmart and a lot of
the products run you know less than $4
you know a lot of them just one or two
dollars so it's very very affordable and
I wanted to just run you through my top
ten and some of the things in the top
ten like it might be two shadows or two
you know of whatever and I count those
individually so my numbers I guess 9 and
10 are these single shadows that they
have and these are the mega Eyes singles
and this one is in wicked and that is a
pretty black shade it's actually really
nice if you're looking for a good black
to use I mean this it does have sort of
some shimmer but it's really not like a
chunky glittery shimmer and honestly it
doesn't like if I've used this it
doesn't show up that much on your eyes
so it just want that nice black tone to
do a smoky eye with that is wicked there
and then the other one I mean you could
pair these two together and be set for
your entire look if you wanted to this
is called fine wink and it is a pretty
kind of skin tone with a hint of pink
it's look kind of like um if I were to
compare it to something more high-end
it's kind of like um Mac's Naked Lunch
only with a little more of a pink tone
to it at times and so that can just make
a nice all-over lid shade or a pretty um
highlight shade I don't know if you can
see it there on this finger but it's got
a gorgeous pearly Sheen to it so I mean
that kit you can kind of like do this on
your lid this and the crease and then
highlight with that and you would have a
really really nice look
so those two shadows are great for
singles and they are no more than you
know two dollars so those are really
awesome um so those would be I guess
nine and ten and then my seven and eight
picks are the wet-and-wild mega glow
illuminating powder and I had these in
two shades and I couldn't rule out one
of them so I had to include them both
and what these are are like little
strips of color there and you can use
this all over your face really you can
use it all over your face is like a
highlighter slash bronzer or you could
use those individual strips like an eye
shadow so I love products that are
multi-purpose like that I think it's a
great way to save money to buy a product
that does more than one thing so this
one is in starlight bronze that I'm
showing you here and I actually have
that on my face I just dusted it all
over my face and it just gives a really
nice glow and can kind of set your look
too but each one of these colors I mean
kind of wiped off my fingers room the
last one but I mean they would they're
really really pretty and you could pull
off a great look just with these so some
are a little more shimmery and sparkly
but overall these are kind of shimmery
so I'm kind of putting in in that
highlighter category because they do
have a decent amount of shimmer you
wouldn't want to overuse these on your
face but that one is like I said
starlight bronze the other one is in
catwalk pink and so this one's a little
bit lighter this is even more on the
highlighter side don't know if it's
showing up but this is kind of a pink
strip right here and then you've got
like some light shimmery champagne
shades and then some more warm Browns so
if these are just really fun to play
with and like I said use them in more
ways than one definitely be great on
your eyes and your cheeks so those are
the mega glow
they're called illuminating powder there
okay so that was ten nine eight seven
number six is going to be my jumbo eye
pencil that they have it's called
idolized
if you see that there it's a cream
shadow pencil and I'm not sure if this
is limited-edition or not but I just
recently found it not too long ago at my
local Walgreens and this one I have is
number 134 distress and it's a gorgeous
deep blue shade if you can see that
streak I kind of made there and it's not
like it's got a whole lot of shimmer to
it either but it has a borderline a
little bit of a metallic e look to it
but it's so easy to wear it's like an
eye base if you wanted to do lighting
and they had other plenty of other
colors but use it as an eye base to go
over it with your shadow or I I've even
used this just as a liner just really
carefully like used it on my lower lash
line for kind of a different look so
those it's again it's eye lines cream
shadow pencil and they are kind of short
they're kind of they're shorter than say
the NYX jumbo shadow pencils but really
really cool um my next couple of
products are the wet and wild lipsticks
this kind I don't know it doesn't
exactly have a name on here does it yeah
I mean I'm sure they're labeled as
something at the store but on the
packaging it doesn't exactly say but
it's the ones that are just they're
round lipsticks um and I have two shades
here one then what I have on is 547 B I
really wish they just named and that's
my one frustration with some of these
products it's like just give it a name
so we can all remember but this is a
really pretty um kind of golden e nude
color I have it on right now and just
makes a perfect you can wear it alone
I'm wearing it completely alone just the
lipstick but you can top it off with a
gloss and I mean they're really smooth
the staying power is obviously not like
the greatest in the world it's just a
regular lipstick but it feels good on my
lips and almost kind of a lip balm II
feel I feel like and um I mean I don't
think you can ask for much more of these
run around like 99 cents I believe don't
quote me on exact for exact but
because prices may vary slightly by your
location but and the deal you can get I
mean Walgreens you get buy one get one
free on some of the sweat and wild stuff
and it's like you've walked out of there
with four products for maybe you know
two bucks or or three bucks so that's
great um the other one that I've used in
several tutorials now is five ten a and
this is a pink shade really pretty pink
with I mean it's just kind of pearly it
doesn't it's not like chunky shimmer
very very wearable so if you're into
pink and you want kind of a nice pink
lipstick to tour if you just want to try
it I mean you're not out much money if
you decided you didn't like either these
but again 5:47 be the one I have on kind
of a gold any nude and then 510 a is the
pink alrighty so now we're down to what
number three here and my number three
product is the bronzer so if this is any
indication of how well I like it I've
clearly hit pan on this one and you know
need to go get a new one this shade is
Tahitian tan I think they have something
called Bali bronze that I've used -
these are just great bronzers seriously
really good bronzers and the colors are
nice and deep and rich there's a small
amount of shimmer to him it's not over
the top but this can I mean summer is
right around the corner everybody wants
a bronzer if maybe you've never even
tried using a bronzer they have a very
light shade - that's more of a
highlighter and then they have some deep
shades so kind of check out what's there
if you have like the basically the
lighter your skin you know don't go for
a complete contrast for the bronzer but
for my medium skin tone I really like
the Tahitian tan from what you can see
there have what's left so really like
that and I don't know if I even mention
this but I am kind of going in order so
like I'm getting towards my more
favorite products the further I go into
this list and so now we're down to one
and two and I couldn't rule either of
these out either these are the same
product but different shades and it's
the ultimate expressions palettes this
one is in sand
castle and this one is in Paradise Cove
so these are phenomenal quality for the
drugstore they really are I mean if you
look up on like makeup alley and
different sites I mean these things get
some wonderful reviews and what you've
got here is four great shadows right
down the middle that I mean are
obviously nice like all over lid shades
or contours and then you've got some
wonderful light colored shades there on
the side and my goodness the the
pigmentation on these I mean you just
just one swipe through it and you've got
a number of different options here for
one of these palettes and then what's
really cool is you got that little
hidden mirror that comes down there and
it's a big I mean it's a good sized
mirror you could fewer traveling you
could like handle doing your whole
makeup with that mirror so um Sam castle
if you're looking for the Browns your
general neutral shades and then I love
this palette to Paradise Cove which is
getting into more of the plum shades and
you've got a great kind of plummy Brown
Burgundy's purple shade some and then
some peachy tones and light purples on
the outside so again fantastic you've
got the wonderful little pull out thing
there I've recommended this to these to
a few friends and they've really liked
it too gotten a lot of use out of it so
again those are my top top products I
guess is the ultimate expressionist
palette so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video kind of running you through sort
of like a mass review of some wet and
wild products I really like so let me
know what your experience has been like
with these realize that I'm just one
person and what works for me may not
work for everyone but if you want to
know my opinion these are the things I
like a lot so thanks very much for
tuning in for this video everyone and
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
