this video I know you're sometimes used
to me doing like a top ten or a top five
favorites video but this is going to be
a top 12 that's just kind of the way it
worked out with the selection of
products I was looking through I spent a
lot of time kind of narrowing down some
of my very favorite products from
Coastal Scents that's a brand that is
available online at Coastal Scents com I
feel like you get some very very great
quality products for a wonderful value
there are a lot of things that I'm not
mentioning in this video that I use and
that I love but I just wanted to keep it
condensed and keep it to be something
that maybe if you've never tried this
brand you're gonna get introduced to
some things that would really start off
your collection or just be good general
products that could all work together
nicely so anyway let's get started I
can't you can't really ramp ramble on
too long about any one of these things
so try to give you the best information
I can the first must have her favorite
product I believe is the 88 warm palette
so it's not showing you too much room
just looking at the outside but if you
look at what's inside this is mainly
that palette that's going to give you a
great great variety of neutral shades
not only are you getting in the brown
tones and stuff like that you're getting
all of the smoky shades as well which is
something that says sometimes left out
of palettes that are called neutral
sometimes you will get those nice
natural Browns but you won't be able to
maybe make this Simo key i but what's
nice about this is in addition you get a
lot of nice warm tones like plums you
get a lot of beautiful plums some kind
of coppers and peaches as well and I
know what kind of the camera kind of
washes out a lot of these shades and
make them all look really similar but
you get a lot of different highlight
shades and a lot of different finishes
as well when you get the warm palette
you're not just getting all matte or all
shimmer you're getting a nice blend of
some satiny finishes some more shimmery
finishes and then just matte so that's
really nice to be able to have that kind
of versatility in one palette and it's
just the sorts of shades and looks that
you can develop are great for everyday
great for work and just a natural look
so I would really recommend that as
Hallet to have in your collection if
you've never tried anything from Coastal
Scents and you do gravitate toward the
more natural looks alright moving on to
one other palette that I want to
recommend and again I like so many
palettes but I'm trying to take into
consent consideration people that may
have never tried this brand that really
want to experience the full range of
what's available so the other palette I
want to recommend is actually the first
palette I ever received from Coastal
Scents and it's the 78th palette what
you're getting with this one is a wide
range of bright colors now some of these
are shimmery and some are matte I've
been asked time and time again is is
that an all matte palette no I can look
at any any one of these little color
families here and see a handful of
somewhat shimmery / satiny shades I
don't mean they're like a lot of glitter
and things like that but there is a
slight bit of shimmer to some and none
and no shimmer to others so you've got
that nice selection up here you've got
some nice neutral sort of smoky shades
in this segment and then at the bottom
you've got some great blushes and these
are really really nice blushes as well
you've got from sort of the light peachy
apricots to some brighter pinks and in a
really nice bright sort of red tone
blush that you sparingly can be
absolutely gorgeous
so in terms of those who say I don't
know if I want the 88 matte or the 88
shimmer palette this is sort of a nice
mix and it also lets you experiment with
those blushes so that's why I consider
this palette to be such a good value you
have everything you need to create a
nice smoky eye but you have so much
versatility in terms of colors that you
can't really go wrong with this now if
you're if you've seen this and you're
thinking well don't really need the
blushes at all and I really really like
shimmer or I don't like shimmer at all
if you have a definite stance on either
of those then either get the 88 shimmer
or get the 88 matte if you don't care
much about the blush but the blush is a
nice little option and you get plenty of
shades to play with as well in several
different finishes so that's really nice
that's gonna do it for the palettes
they're the big palettes but I do have
some other recommendations in terms of
eyeshadows Coastal Scents has a product
called hot pots and they're like little
individual
shadows that you can buy you can buy
four of them you could buy one of them
three of them however many you want it's
completely up to you what colors you get
so if you are just looking for a real
basic look not only can you get the like
say for shadows you can get a nice
little on case for them as well and so
this is five products actually right
here the cases is one of them and then
these shadows that I'm recommending are
each a product as well so basically you
can also get larger palettes that hold I
believe about twelve shades so that
could be nice too if you really wanted
to customize and you know a whole pallet
but again this is for different colors
in here and I just absolutely love these
shades and the thing that I'm gonna have
to do here is pop them out and remind
myself exactly what the number is
because they're identified by a letter
and a number so we'll see if I can get
those out here okay this really pretty
shimmery sort of light gold one get a
little swatch for you there that's what
that looks like just very very light
very shimmery one of my favorite
highlight shades it is s03 so that's
that color the other one here that's
that I had on the top of the palette is
has been called a dupe for a satin taupe
from Mac and it's s35 so with that
you're of course getting a nice kind of
sort of smokey brownish charcoal shade
that I love as a contour and let's see
the next one here is s13 oh I love this
shade for kind of putting it on the
border of your crease color so like you
got your crease color here sort of with
a fluffy brush kind of blended right up
into your brow bone area look how pretty
this is this is s13 let me show you what
that looks like
absolutely beautiful kind of violet
fuchsia shade but looks really natural
it has a nice mouth shimmer to all of
these happen to have some shimmer to
them just so you know I just really like
they're not overly you know overly
shimmery but they are I mean extremely
wearable
I'm having a little trouble getting this
other one oh there I got it this is s 28
and this has been called a dupe for
Mac's sketch so here we're talking about
sort of a deep brownish plum shade and I
satiny finish to show you a swatch for
that you can see it next to the brighter
one so this is the one I just put on
there a little bit deeper a little more
brown tones this one has a little more
high shimmer to it and is a little more
pinky purple so anyway the way I got
those out there there's actually a
little hole on the side of all these you
can just stick a pin into to get them
out and then they're magnetized in but I
just really like that combination of
colors all together so if you're sort of
wondering okay what should I want the
hot pots but I don't know how to
formulate my own palette those are my
suggestions there next thing I want to
recommend is the concealer now I was
really impressed with Coastal Scents big
concealer palette that gives you I want
to say ten different concealer shades
and I think that's a great product
especially for a makeup artist but for
the everyday person that only puts
makeup on themselves it's maybe not the
most practical thing so I was excited to
hear that they had come out with these
camo quads
which give you for concealer shades in
one palette and so this is great for not
only concealing but you can contour with
these shapes too they are pretty much
the same consistency as what's in that
other that other camouflage the big
palette only I feel like these aren't
quite as thick I'm just getting that
feeling from them the palette that I use
is medium and I would have thought it
was light at first but this the this
palette is really what works for me
mainly what I would use to conceal are
these two shades I would maybe use this
one under my eye and this one kind of on
blemishes and things elsewhere on my
face but then you've got a shade that's
basically white that you could use to
kind of lay down a highlight and then
you maybe go over that with a powder or
something and it just kind of you know
it's not like you get a streak of white
you definitely blend it in with a sponge
or something but it's just a way of
highlighting you can also use this shade
of course there's no shimmer in these
but this darker shade could be like you
put it down
or blended in and you've got sort of a
base for your contouring so think of it
as a concealer palette but but also some
ways to highlight and contour as well so
that's why I like the camo quads
I definitely like the texture like the
staying power I feel like they work fine
around my eye area and yeah I definitely
think this is a great great thing that
they did because that larger palette you
know I think a lot of people may not
have been so interested in that because
they wonder what am I going to do with
this super fair shade that I'll never
wear this really dark shades so here
you're getting it more in your color
family now one of the lip glosses that I
love the Coastal Scents max overall are
a great line of lip glosses I like there
are certain shades that are my favorites
and I did a whole video on that so if
you want to learn more about certain
ones that I really like check it out but
and sing with a lot of these products I
have done videos on pretty much
everything I'm talking about here on an
individual basis so be sure to search
through and look for more details if you
want them but there are a few more
shades that weren't in the original set
when the Coastal Scents max were
launched and one of those new shades is
turned out to be my favorite it's what I
have on my lips right now it's pretty
and shimmery it's called love kitten and
you can see here it's it's just a
beautiful kind of slightly rosy
neutrally shade that has a lot of
shimmer to it but I feel like it looks
natural on the lips got a nice shine to
it really sets off your face because I
feel like it does have that really
dazzling shine again I think of kind of
a light brown neutral with a little bit
of mob or Rhodes undertones is what this
shade would be like I was glad I liked
it so much because when I first saw it I
thought wow that's kind of universal I
think that would look good on really
deep skin tones or people that even have
lighter skin I just there's something
that's really appealing about this shade
and I think is because it is so
multi-dimensional so that's shade is
called love kitten and it's one of the
newer ones out from Coastal Scents now
for the brushes brushes I think we're
one of the first things I really
discovered and started trying from
Coastal Scents because
realized I can get good quality brushes
here without spending a whole lot of
money and so one thing that I would
suggest if you are looking for say a
full brush set Coastal Scents sells
quite a few variations but I feel like
the best one is the one that is the
reptile brush set it comes in this
pretty black case here and I believe it
comes in pink as well I just like this
because I love the red handles on the
brushes too so I've done a full video on
this if you want to know more about each
individual brush but rest assured I feel
like this is giving you almost every
brush you need and I will it will kind
of completely set with my last two
recommendations here but what I love so
much about these are how great
especially the face brushes are you get
a wonderful powder brush here you get a
blush brush a contour brush I guess I
should probably hold these up at least
get through them as quickly as I can
blush kind of a angled contour you've
got a foundation brush sort of a doe
foot thicker more fluffy kind of eye
brush your flat kind of eye shadow brush
that you would use to apply shades all
over your lid a fluffier brush that you
could use to pet powder concealer down
under your eye or use it as a highlight
it carries a little more product there I
gotta have one of these for your brows
and lashes you have a flat liner brush
that is cut a little bit softer for
those times when you want your liner to
look maybe a little softer on the lower
lash line you have a let's see this is
your lip brush this is the concealer
brush which I have been using actually
for eyeshadow it's so nice and flat
great size I like it for packing on
color you get a smallish brush here that
can be good for if you have a really
small lid this might be the brush you
use to pack shadow on it or to get in
the inner corners but it's still not a
smallest one that I'm going to tell you
about you have a great great stiff
angled liner brush that can really
handle those cream liners you might want
to use with it you've got this brush
here which when I first did the video I
was just not familiar with but
apparently it's something you can use
for your lashes
to kind of brush up in between them and
separate them a little more and you know
whatever I'm I'll have to admit I really
don't use this that much it's cute I've
missed that but and then you have a
little crease brush here that is
actually pretty small it's kind of like
a pencil brush nice and controlled for
smudging colors underneath and getting
colors in your crease and defining your
outer V however given that set of one
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
fifteen different brushes in there which
come in this case that rolls up and
keeps them all really nice with that
flap there yeah this is a great great
brush set I really think you almost
everything you need but if I could add a
couple of brushes to it and round out my
top 12 here one of them is the it's on
the website it's called the chisel
detail mini brush I've used it so many
times now I get asked about this brush
more than anything when I'm doing a
tutorial see how small it is
it's teensy and it's even smaller than
that small one I showed you in there but
this could not be better for getting
color right around your tear duct I mean
obviously there's nothing on it right
now but I mean it is just perfect or
smoking out and blending out an edge
oftentimes I think people feel like
they're out of control with the brushes
because they're just too big for their
eye having a really nice small brush can
get that color exactly where you want it
and that is only a dollar ninety-nine so
tiny brush there but very much great to
have in your collection another one that
I like is this synthetic deluxe crease
brush which is about 279 on the website
super super soft I don't know if you can
tell how nice and dense and soft that is
but this would be a brush that it's a
little bit thicker than the one I was
pointing out that's like a pencil brush
or could define your outer V this one is
good for getting color just all over
your crease it's not as big as say the
fluffy or contour brushes this is just
another random brush see the size
difference this is sort of a bigger
brush that many people might use just to
blend out and use their okay this one
you would probably carry some product
with and use it to just get it right
there
your priests so backgrounds out my top
12 everyone thank you for hanging around
so long to watch this video and see what
my favorite Coastal Scents products are
again they have more products beyond
this that I think are great but I'm
trying to take in consideration people
that may have never tried the brand
before so thanks so much for tuning in
guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
