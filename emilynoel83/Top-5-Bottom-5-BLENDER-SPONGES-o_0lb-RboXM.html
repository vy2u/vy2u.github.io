going to be a top 5 bottom 5 but not in
my typical style normally I focus all on
one brand at a time but I thought it
might be useful to do this style of
video just with these Beauty Blender
type sponges in general now you've got
the actual Beauty Blender but there are
of course a lot of knockoffs as well and
so I thought maybe I could share the
ones that I think worked the best and
the ones that really don't because
sometimes the way these are packaged in
stores you can't always just get your
hands on it and squeeze it and feel the
texture or understand what's going to
happen when you dampen it is it going to
grow in size to become nice and soft you
know there are a lot of potential
questions there so I thought maybe I
could answer some of those in this video
and in the past year I've become such a
believer in using some sort of sponge to
apply foundation or concealer I don't
think you have to use it with every
single product out there but I just
think it's such a versatile tool because
you can take thicker foundations and
kind of get a more sheer look to them or
I think blender sponges build coverage
really nicely but I feel like they do it
in a way that you can really customize
to your own liking and for me I will
always use a sponge like this damp so I
will get it under the sink I will
squeeze it a few times let the water run
through it and you will notice with most
of these they really grow in size every
sponge that I show in this video I've
freshly cleaned it and so you're looking
at them at maximum size when you
purchase one of these they're going to
be just a little bit smaller than this
because they're just dry but anyway you
get into the sink squeeze it a few times
really then wring all the moisture out
of it I don't even want to hear like a
squishy sound in my sponge anymore
that's kind of my cue that okay I've
rung it out enough I like to squeeze it
in a towel and then I feel like okay I'm
ready to go it's damp but it's not
really depositing a lot of water on my
skin and then you can use it to dab out
your foundation your concealer I think
beauty blenders work great on cream
products whether it be a cream contour a
cream blush cream highlights you name it
there are a lot of really great
functions for these and more than I
probably even realized at this point but
I also hope that this video helps you
out because I think it can be useful to
have more than
I've really enjoyed having different
shapes and sizes and also just different
ones to have in your rotation so when
one's dirty you can grab for a different
one before it's time to clean them and
speaking of cleaning I have a
Beautyblender solid cleanser it just
looks like a little round soap and I got
a mini sized and a little kit that I had
gotten and I do think that works really
well I just kind of get my sponge damp
rub it on there and then wring it out in
the sink and you can see just all of the
product falling from the sponge and does
anybody else really get satisfaction out
of cleaning their sponges I think it's
way more fun than cleaning a makeup
brush let's move on to the top 5 bottom
5 I'm going to go with the top 5 first
and I'm going to start with number 5 and
work my way up to my most favorite my
number 1 sponge so everything in this
top 5 to me I think it's very good
quality so my number 5 is the actual
just traditional Beauty Blender the pink
sponge like I said this has been freshly
clean so it is at its like maximum size
right now it's really nice and squishy
this is one of the best in terms of
being a full-size sponge but coming to a
nice like tapered point so it does work
really nicely for blending and
foundation it's nice and soft it just
has a very bouncy texture to it so it
works so well blending out foundations
if you want to blend out some concealer
it's not my favorite thing for concealer
I'll get to that in a second but I do
think this is just a great quality
sponge it's going to be more expensive
when you buy sponges from the actual
Beauty blender line but it is number 5
in this little ranking for a reason
because I've got some things that I
still like better number four is the
Beauty Blender blusher and this is a
more recent release and it is actually
like kind of a grayish shade and again
this is its maximum size it originally
when you get it it looks a little bit
smaller than that and I feel like it's
made out of a little bit softer material
than the original Beauty Blender it
feels like just a larger size of the
micro mini it's that soft it's that
spongy so I just love this sponge
texture wise but I do think it actually
does a great job on cream blushes it's a
really perfect size just for hitting the
apple of your cheek there but also if
you wanted to do a contour you know and
go
right under the cheekbone it's not
oversized for those purposes either and
at the same time I've used this for
foundation also so it's a nice kind of
middle size a very very soft feel so I
love that one I love it just a little
more than the original beauty blender
now my number 3 sponge is a great great
deal and it's from Ulta and it's called
the small super blender and I got this
in a duo for like four or five dollars
and this one really seems to grow in
size a lot when you dampen it I feel
like when it started it was like half
this size but here it is next to an
original Beauty Blender it's kind of
close to the same height but it's got
this little pinched in hourglass type
shape here and I love that it is really
soft it feels you know just as squishy
as my regular Beauty Blender does but I
do love the size I feel like it can do a
lot of the same things that the Beauty
Blender blusher does it's got the little
pointed side it's also got a nice
rounded side I've applied foundation
with this many times I can also get
under the eye area with it I feel like I
can do any kind of blush bronzer type
step but I rank this one just a little
higher than the Beauty Blender blusher
because I feel like it's just a
tremendous value for it to do basically
the same functions and you get to for
right around five dollars or a little
less I think that's amazing now my
number two Blender sponge is the Beauty
Blender micro mini absolutely love this
for the under-eye area I think this is
so great for under-eye concealer it's so
gentle it really has a softness to it I
swear it's a different material than the
original Beauty Blender is made of it
feels exactly like the blusher in that
it's very very soft very squishy and
it's just the perfect size to hit that
cavernous I like the gullet on the inner
part of the eye dabbing all over here
it's great for not over blending your
concealer so you can maintain a lot of
coverage but at the same time it makes
the finish the end look of your
concealer on the under eye looks so
natural so this thing is just so useful
to me such a must-have I purchased a
little four pack of the pastel colored
Beautyblender micro minis off of Sephora
and I was fully expecting to have bust
it into those by now because I was
thinking well this maybe is going to
lose some durability it's smaller maybe
the more I wash it the more it's gonna
like little pieces will start to come
off or something I have seen no change
this thing has just States so good so
we're moving on to number one now and I
really see this one and my number one
sponge like these are my top two like if
I could only have a couple these would
be it and this is my Real Techniques
sponge so I'm so glad I like my Real
Techniques sponge because it's a lot
less expensive than the regular Beauty
Blender a lot of times you can find
these in two packs at Ulta and it's
absolutely as soft as I could need it to
be I feel like the textures maybe just a
teeny bit softer than the original
Beauty Blender I enjoy having this flat
edge because sometimes I just Pat on my
foundation like that I feel like it does
a really quick job of it but you've also
got this nice point to work with as well
so versatile really nice quality holds
up well if you haven't used any kind of
sponge like this before I think this
might be a really great place to start
and then you know like I said this is
the great little dynamic duo team for me
I love that around your smaller more
precise areas and then this all over the
phase these sponges can give a really
pretty natural looking finish to even
some of the things that I thought were
more cakey but you know just using a
damp sponge can help a lot there's one
product that I did not mention in that
top 5 and I just want to give you a
little explanation why because I've
mentioned this fund recently this is
another Ulta brand sponge they're
selling these in duo's they're white I
didn't get it totally clean here and
it's SuperDuper soft like it feels kind
of like the micro mini or the Beauty
Blender blusher but it's a lot chubbier
than a Beauty Blender and I do like
using it but I feel like I've often got
a really pinch it to get where I want it
to go you can see the tip doesn't come
quite as pointed like it does on a
regular Beauty Blender so I like this
sponge I like the quality of it but just
the shape leaves a little to be desired
for me but all the sponges what they
have in common is that growth when you
add water to them
just a great softness something my
bottom-5 have in common is that when I
add water to any of these they really
don't change they don't change size they
still feel really hard like very hard to
start with and the water just doesn't
seem to help them out too much so bottom
5 we're going to be leading up to an
ultimate worst blending sponge but
number 5 is the one from Elle so as you
can gather here this one is the least
bad out of the group it does have a
little bit of softness to it I can
actually like squeeze the sponge in my
hand it's definitely not as soft as one
from like Beauty Blender or Real
Techniques but it does have just a
little bit of give to it it's still not
enough for me when the sponge is not
spongy and soft enough I feel like you
run the risk of having a kind of a
streaky and uneven application to your
foundation and this elf sponge you know
this is damp and it really didn't change
the shape of it much it didn't add much
to its texture so it is in my bottom
five because it's not a way I would want
to apply my foundation or anything
really numbers four through one here
same kind of complaint we just keep
getting harder and harder with the
sponges like a little rock-hard sponges
this one is from Ulta this is the one
actually called the super blender so
earlier we talked about the soup the
small super blender this one is soft and
squishy this one like I don't know this
one is definitely made out of some
different kind of material not nearly as
squishy as the other one you can see it
looks similar to the shape of the elf
but it's got a little more flatness
across the bottom but just a really hard
blender sponge
I was recently trying a few things from
I Kate house that website where you get
a lot of like really affordable pallets
and different things and I tried a
Beauty Blender sponge from there and
this brand is called Tina and yeah it's
it looks like it should be good right it
kind of resembles a regular beauty
blender but you're seeing the sponge
here totally you know wet down with
water and it's really hard
it doesn't change shape much I did use
this one day over the weekend to apply
my foundation I just thought uh you know
you can tell such a difference after
you've been using something so soft and
nice like this members two and one these
are the most rock-hard blender sponges
that I
ever used and the up and up brand from
Target I tell you they make some
fabulous brushes some of my favorite
drugstore brushes on the market but they
totally missed the mark when it comes to
their blender sponges they made them
look cute I think they put them out in
some different colors but this sponge
like that's all the more I can squeeze
it like if you start pressing this up on
your face there's no give to it it is
just way way too hard and then they put
out a mini and I remember being so
excited when I saw this in the store
because I was like oh my gosh that's so
cute I haven't seen like a micro mini
dupe yet but this is my number one worst
because this is like rare while this is
hard at least it's big this is hard and
tiny and I would not advise anyone to
try applying concealer with this product
like it just goes nowhere it has a mind
of its own it's like a stubborn little
sponge it just doesn't want to give it
doesn't want to really absorb water it
just and that really sums up just about
all of the blender sponges that I've
tried I know there are many more
knockoffs out there some may be awesome
there are other you know things from the
specific Beauty Blender blant brand that
I haven't tried and I'm open to any
recommendations you want to give in the
comments section but I just thought it
was time and to give a little roundup
I've tried this many sponges and some
are definitely so so good and affordable
too and then some are just like little
rocks and when this stuff is all
packaged up in the store and you can't
really get your hands on it and squeeze
it and get a sense of how soft it is or
how soft it might become that's when you
got to go to youtube and do your
research right so I hope this helped
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
