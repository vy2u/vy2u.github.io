new series I'm getting started on my
channel top 5 bottom 5 so talking about
five of the best products for a
particular brand and also five of the
things that really did not work for me
of course they might work for you they
might be some of your favorites but I
will just try to give you my best
explanations on those things and really
when I think back I had done some like
top 10 videos for certain brands way
back in the start of my channel but it's
been so long and the things in these
brands have changed so much since then
I really thought it was time to bring
something similar back but I also know
that you guys are just as interested in
the things that I don't like as the
things that I do and I would love to
have your requests on any brands you
would like to see featured in this
series high end drugstore please let me
know in the comments section but
starting off my top five products for
covergirl and will work up to a number
one here but number five is the
continuous color lipstick number five
fifty the shade name is in the nude it's
not really like a classic nude lipstick
I'm wearing it now it's a really
beautiful soft mauve lots of people are
enjoying this cool really subtle take on
pink and this is just a nice creamy
classic lipstick it's not matte um you
know you might notice just the slightest
hint of shine I find it works for so
many different makeup looks that I wear
so I really like that one number four
the covergirl true Naked palette in
roses this one there are three different
true naked palettes you got the nudes
the goldens and the roses and the more I
use them and play around with them the
Roses it's really emerging as my top
favorite this is a different eye shadow
formula from a lot of their just basic
quads and trios I find them to be really
soft when you put a brush into them you
will notice like a little bit of powder
kicking up that you know may frustrate
some people more than others to me I
don't really mind because I find they do
blend so easily on the eyes they're easy
to build up I've gotten a variety of
really pretty looks with this and I
think part of what allows you to get
that variety there are three really nice
matte shades in here a matte cream a
light pink and then a deeper light kind
of berry mauve color there's some nice
dark smoky tones there are a couple of
really metallic
so having that kind of variety in one
pallet even though it is very
monochromatic you know all in the rose
color family I think you do have options
here I'm wearing it for today's look and
just really liked how the look came out
number three I love my covergirl instant
cheekbones blushes I mentioned these in
my what's old at the drugstore video
these are products that I think just
happened to fly under a lot of people's
radar but I just love how it's blush and
highlight in one each of these that I'm
holding up here and they have like two
tones of a satin finish blush it's not
super shimmery but there's a little glow
happening there and then each one has
its coordinating highlight so these
cooler pinks this is the purely plum
trio and then I've got peach perfection
over here so I'm wearing peach
perfection on my cheeks today love
taking the little bit deeper shade kind
of right above where I might put my
contour putting the main color in the
middle putting that right on the apple
of the cheek and then topping off with
the highlight which I just think has a
surprising amount of impact I mean it's
beautiful
in the pink palette here I was wearing
this in a recent video but I equally
enjoy the peach one I just think they're
a great deal and there are a couple
other shades in this line too next
product that I love from covergirl is
the outlast stay fabulous 3 in 1
foundation I'm wearing it today in the
shade 840 natural beige this has an SPF
20 there is a pump it's a long wearing
foundation I think it's got really nice
coverage I think it's probably ideal for
people with combo to oily skin I've just
noticed you know over the past couple of
years I've worn this on and off and it
just has really fantastic staying power
it's a matte finish foundation I know
they have more recently come out with
something that's a little more glowy and
luminous but I think of this is just a
standard like buildable medium to full
coverage type of foundation if you're
more on the dry side I won't say you
couldn't use this foundation but you may
want to really pay attention to
moisturize your skin really well before
you put it on because I can't see it
sometimes clinging to drier areas and my
top product in this top 5 had to mention
it had to mention it my favorite mascara
I know when we find mascaras we
of its a very exciting thing I think
people can spend years trying different
mascaras before they ever really feel
like they've landed on one that totally
works for them this form eyelash type it
really works
I've got straight lashes I've got lashes
that don't really want to hold a curl at
all I feel like this builds fantastic
length holds my curl I like the size of
the brush it's a rubber bristle brush
and the bristles are kind of short if
I'm not going to wear false lashes this
is definitely the thing I want to use
and I also love how I can wear it
throughout the day without flaking or
you know smearing off in any way and I'm
not even using a waterproof version easy
to remove at the end of the day so yay
for that now if I could have a little
honorable mention outside that top 5 I
would mention the clump crusher
water-resistant not everyone needs or
wants a waterproof mascara but I know
I've been asked sometimes for weddings
what mascara would you recommend if
there's a chance you're going to be
crying I would really suggest this
mascara it's great on the lower lashes a
lot of times to just on a day-to-day
basis also little honorable mention for
the Shivering shapes sharing shann's
simmering Oh shimmering sands trio this
one has been around a long long time
it's gone through some packaging changes
I don't think the formula is as great as
like these new true true naked palettes
but there's something to be said for the
subtle look that this can give the word
that really comes to mind for this trio
is foolproof it doesn't get too deep and
dark but the shades are easy to blend
now bottom-5 from covergirl the things
that did not work out so well for me one
of these things is an eye liner it's
actually a newer product I think it came
out when the true naked eye shadow
palettes came out because it's called
true naked waterproof eyeliner duos a
dark matte Brown and a kind of bronzy
coppery shade that has some shimmer and
I'm all for the concept of two liners in
one but when I was using this I could
not believe how quickly it smudged for
something claiming to be waterproof
first off they don't go on super
smoothly to begin with sometimes you
know liners that tend to be very smudgy
they'll also be very soft but these were
not very soft you know they're not
really up to the standard of a lot of
great eyeliner pencils drugstore or high
and there are many great liners out
there so you have to work a little bit
to get the color to transfer especially
on that copper side I've worn this on my
lower lash line within a couple hours I
was seeing smudging down below the eye
and I just I don't have patience for
that so I would not recommend this to
you guys either another thing this brow
powder has anybody tried this it's the
brow and liner powder I have it in 805
basically it's like a loose brow powder
and the way this little tip is I find it
very difficult to not get a super opaque
like full-on very heavy look when I
apply this the powder is very dark and
pigmented and it's just hard to go light
with it and if you do try to kind of
flick it a little bit and kind of give
yourself a lighter look in the brows
that's when you deal with a fallout
issue from this product at least I did I
noticed it kind of like teeny tiny
specks of this super dark rich pigmented
powder coming you know around my eye
shadow look or even below the eye not a
fun thing to have to deal with who's got
time for that
another thing that I thought I still had
it on hand apparently I tossed it
recently but it's the fix stick
concealer it's like a jumbo pencil
format concealer from cover girls line I
thought it was dry I thought it was kind
of difficult to blend the coverage on it
not so bad but definitely not the kind
of thing I'm going to want to take up
around my eye area get on any fine lines
or potentially wrinkly looking areas and
the scent on it the scent on it is like
a crayon or some kind of art supplies it
just does not seem right for makeup
another thing that I didn't love and I'm
not criticizing the whole true magic
line because I do have a full review
where I talked about the bronzer the
clear product that's kind of similar
it's along the lines of like a Mallee
poreless face defender type of thing
where you can blot over your skin and
mattify or you could use it as a primer
these products are kind of creamy and
consistency to the touch but then you
blend them out and they start to feel
more dry and the one that I really did
not like from this line is called the
Luminizer and it looks like a pretty
golden highlight and I put it on my skin
before and I was just astounded by the
fact that it just looks like little
particles of gold glitter I think it's
ed about exaggerating the look of any
fine lines you might have I wish it was
more of a pearly Sheen as opposed to
Sparkle to me the worst thing in this
bottom five is the covergirl clean
foundation I have it here for normal
skin I remember using this like back in
the day when I was quite a bit younger
it had a different looking packaging
design and I think maybe the formula was
different too then I didn't really have
any breakout issues with it but this
stuff definitely broke me out I don't
have a lot of problems like that
generally speaking with foundations
moisturizers I try a lot of things and
this was one of the few things that my
skin really had a reaction to so I know
this is speaking very much from personal
experience and this might not cause that
kind of problem for everyone is thinking
about all the qualities that for example
covergirl outlast stay fabulous has that
this one doesn't you know it's got the
better coverage it's got amazing staying
power it's got a pump which is always
convenient to me it's like even if this
didn't break me out I still find this
one to be leaps and bounds superior so
that is my top 5 bottom 5 for covergirl
I hope you enjoyed this video again let
me know your brand requests in the
comments section and thank you for
