I've done a top 5 bottom 5 video on this
channel so I thought let's do it and I
gave myself a big challenge in focusing
on elf for this video because elfs line
is huge it's growing all the time so for
the top 5 really narrowing it down to
the best products like if you've never
tried elf before and you picked up these
things these are all things that I think
you'd have really really good luck with
and I always get questions in these
videos without fail like what about this
product that you once said you like but
you didn't mention here what about this
other thing and the whole challenge of
top 5 is that I'm really trying to hone
in on the 5 best it doesn't mean there
wasn't a number 6 7 8 9 10 that were
also really good products but the
challenge here is what are the 5 best
and also what are the 5 worst in
addition to the top 5 bottom 5 makeup
products I am going to give you a bonus
top 5 brushes at the end of this video -
so I'm gonna get started with my top 5
first and I will lead up to an ultimate
best product I think from this line but
all five of these are really just I
think fantastic products first thing I
want to mention is this mad for matte
eyeshadow palette yes 100% met neutral
eyeshadow palette but a really nice
shade range and a really awesome formula
as well I find a lot of consistency
across all the colors you've got super
deep dark shades leading up to a full-on
black and then you've got awesome shades
to highlight with wonderful mid-tone
shades and I just like the variety so
much you've got everything from just
that classic you know brown you can put
in the crease a couple of shades that
are a little bit more rosy berry type
colors for my look today I mean I put
some of this almost mob type shade right
in my crease I used a little bit of this
beige under the brow I use the pink
shade on the lid and I kind of deepen
things up with this rusty Brown that's
in here and I just love all those
different tones and I was really pleased
with you know the way the look turned
out I've done a lot of great looks with
this palette it's just a great basic to
have in your collection and mix in maybe
with those shimmery shadows that you own
and love and they do have different
shadows here and there throughout their
line that I think are good but this is
probably one of the most consistent next
up a product
definitely talked about a lot from elf
slide the lip exfoliater this is kind of
a unique item from the brand because
I've never tried just a stick exfoliator
on the lips and it really is the easiest
way to go there are so many lip scrubs
where you got to dip your finger in and
you're going like this it's messy this I
mean it has really caused me to actually
exfoliate my lips frequently because
it's so easy and this is just the
classic one it's kind of like a brown
sugary type idea and scented flavor but
they also now have a mint one and cherry
one and you just basically run it over
your lips spend as much time as you want
you know maybe go 20 seconds top lip 20
seconds on the bottom lip and you will
feel your lips having so much additional
smoothness and I usually like to do this
at the start of my makeup routine once
I'm done I'll pop on some sort of balm
kind of let that sit on the lips for the
whole duration of my makeup routine and
then right before I put my lip product
on my lips are so nicely hydrated and
it's just a really great step to take
especially if you love all of these
matte lip products that show all the
problems and flaws in your lips speaking
of that my number three product that I
want to talk about here are the elf
matte lip colors and these really are
outstanding mattes
I am very critical of a lot of matte lip
products because I don't like it to be
an uncomfortable experience I don't like
to be thinking about the product that's
on my lips constantly because it feels
annoying or just you know incredibly dry
so these sticks are awesome I like them
both for the formula but also the simple
design of the product and I've got like
six colors here that I will kind of show
you rapid-fire all of them on my lips
but basically what we have is a twist up
stick that is not incredibly wide it's
not quite as big as some of those chubby
stick type um lip pencils and I think
that's good because they've got a huge
shade range some shades like the one I'm
holding and wearing here are very deep
and dark and you get a little more
precision that way plus sometimes blows
people's mind is but in the end there is
a sharpener that you can pull out and
you can get an even more defined tip as
it naturally wears down with use so it's
just a great product the formula of this
is creamy enough it does kind of glide
across the lips
it's very long where I don't find these
to be an uncomfortable product at all
and they're like three dollars each you
can really experiment with this line and
I'm just gonna show you really quickly
some of my favorite shades like as I got
six of them here I want to show nearly
nude I think is a gorgeous classic nude
I also really like praline and I will
often end up mixing these two as opposed
to just wearing them alone but praline
I've talked about so much is a great
neutral I also like tea rose and this is
kind of a unique shade it's kind of a
soft pinky mob and I think that's really
beautiful also love love love hot
commodity this makes me think of like a
hot melon type of shade you know kind of
coral to the extreme a couple of deeper
colors that I think are really pretty or
cranberry that's a nice classic brick
red and then the shade that I've been
wearing throughout this video is called
scarlet Knight and I know it's
summertime but I just think this is a
stunning rich berry lip now the fourth
product I'll mention or I guess my
number two here is my ELF moisturizing
foundation stick these are fabulous
products for coverage for really
customized coverage I guess would be the
best way to put this because you can
apply them just like a targeted spot
concealer you know just over certain
places you can go all over the face with
them you can build them up and yet they
seem to look so skin like and so natural
but they do truly pack in coverage so
why do I have two of them I've got one
in the shade nude because that's a total
skin tone match for me and I've also
played around with the shade called
almond which as you can see is much
deeper and you could do cream contouring
with that just application wise it's
really just as easy as drawing it all
over the skin and I like to take a
Beauty Blender type sponge and just you
know dab that stuff right in and if
there are any areas where you were
lacking coverage you want to go back
touch up and add a little more you
totally can and it's just it's a rare
product when it's able to give you
coverage and not look incredibly obvious
so these were definitely mentioned in my
foundations that don't look like
foundation video I think they are an
underrated and remarkable product from
elfs line and if you tried them you'd be
so surprised like well this
it's a really great product and then my
number one product in this lineup would
have to be the elf contour palette this
was tough because in this realm of what
elf puts out you know they've got a lot
of these four color palettes that
they've done the blush palettes I think
are wonderful both cream and powder but
I think there are a lot of contouring
products on the market these days and a
lot of them don't do it quite right and
I think elf really really did it's so
similar to my favorite high-end
contouring product which would be the
Smashbox contour trio so it gives you
everything that's happening basically in
that palette plus a light shimmery shade
so you've got shimmer and matte here in
those top couple of powders more of a
classic bronzer type shade and then I
think the perfect tone of contour the
textures on these powders are so soft
and you can pop them out if you had
other products if you had an elf blush
that you really liked and you found you
weren't using one of these colors all
that often you could take one out
replace with a different product but the
quality is good just the function of all
of these products I think is really good
I find myself getting use out of every
part of this love the big mirror that
they have in these palettes it's just
it's another thing kind of like the lip
colors where it's good from a quality
perspective but it's also really good
from a packaging and design idea as well
so I love that product really really
happy with all of my top 5 here now
jumping into the bottom 5 I've got this
elf Foundation serum this this is just
not my style for makeup and I'm going to
put that out there right the get-go it's
my number 5 product I have it in the
shade light and I have a video that I
can link to below where you can see this
product in action a bit more it does
have broad-spectrum SPF 25 sunscreen but
I just want more coverage I really hate
taking the step taking the effort to
apply a foundation type product and then
not really seeing wonderful coverage
coming from it I'm a coverage person
what can I say like coverage I like
staying power
I like those practical things that
foundations should offer me and that's
what I want to see from them so I am NOT
a fan of this one it just does not do
enough to perfect the appearance of the
skin it is called beautifully bare that
is where this line comes
there are some really nice products from
this line but this is just not something
I can recommend another thing since the
beginning of elf a product I just could
not get on board with this lengthening
and defining mascara and I think this is
like the first type of mascara elf ever
put out since then they've put out some
other things I've tried them I tried to
keep up with some of the new mascaras
they've put out some things have been
better a lot of things have it really
not my socks off but by far the worst
one for me it's been this lengthening
and defining the whole design of the
brush is just like not a good mascara
for me the spiraled around bristles that
are widely spaced are not a good thing
for added separation in your lashes if
you're trying to get the look of more
lashes this type of a brush doesn't
usually help with that and once I put it
on is just you know where is the product
I can't really see it on my lashes so I
do not think mascara I cannot handle
number three product that I was a little
bit infatuated with when I first got it
just for the beauty of the look and the
packaging and I'm like oh this is kind
of cool but then I really start using it
and with time I think this is just this
is not worth the trouble and it's these
mineral pearls it's kind of going off of
the idea of the girl on meteorites type
products that are these loose pearls
just kind of floating around in a dish
and I well there goes one there's one of
my issues they fall out all the time so
it's really hard to wrangle these guys
and then you'll miss one and step on it
and squish it into your carpet it's just
not the most like effective and
efficient way to pick up product on a
brush like you can dab your brush in
here or they give you a little puff and
I feel like I've got a spin forever
getting product on there for very little
pay out that I see actually on my face
or color payoff I would so much rather
just have a solid powder in a pan that I
can dip into and go at it that way my
number two worst product from elfs line
these baked blushes and I will say and
there's been one recommended to me it's
like a light nearly high light type
shade that actually does have some
decent color payoff but pretty much all
of the other colors that I have the
look like there are blush type tone just
do not show up on me so I've got passion
pink and a peachy cheeky peachy peachy
cheeky over here and they don't pick up
like on my finger for a swatch they
don't pick up off of a brush either had
a lot of different brushes and
ultimately I just don't have the
patience for the stuff you know elf has
some fantastic blushes in their little
palettes that are designed like this and
they're so so good and it's like these
these blushes just cannot hang with that
now it's a fail in one respect what a
product just simply doesn't show up on
your skin but I think it might be an
even worse fail when the product does
show up on your skin but you cannot
blend it out like that's just out now
frustration that you can't really get
around sometimes and it can really screw
up your makeup look I'm talking about
this duo stick particularly the
contouring one they have some for lips
bitter you know fine they're kind of
what you would expect like jumbo lip
pencil stuff but it's basically elfs
take on the nude sticks ideas so you get
the little tin there's a sharpener and
on this contour stick has the contouring
side which first off I think it's a
little too warm to really look like a
convincing contour but also you put it
on your skin and it is so so hard to
blend this out and picture yourself
having to apply a lot of pressure to get
that blended out on top of foundation
and whatnot it just it doesn't move
across the skin very well and it could
really mess with your makeup look and
have you you know taking some product
off trying to start over so that's
tricky
and then the shimmer side makes no sense
to me because it is an all-out full-on
gold like but you know it's not like
beautiful golden laura geller gilded
honey type thing it's like a yellowy dry
imir
type product and I just don't I don't
understand why that's on there it does
not look realistic on my skin at all yes
I have applied that and looked at it I
thought it just leaves me scratching my
head who designed it and who thought
yeah that's where we're onto it we've
hit the mark with this now we're going
to go back to the happy side so I can
mention my top 5 brushes because as you
guys know if you've watched my videos
for any amount of time
I am a religious user of certain elf
brushes and the first one that I think
everybody needs is this complexion brush
this is a really nicely sized brush for
powder bronzer contour it can do so many
things in a pinch it's not one of those
massive round powder brushes it's
something that you know really can do
the hollows of the cheeks and it's so
soft it's nice quality I've had this one
for so dang long it's been washed so
many times and it continues to feel soft
the cut of the brush is really really
nice so yeah that's something I will use
with anything from my ELF contour kit to
my chanell powder it works great another
must-have brush from the line I think is
the small tapered brush this one you
know again with the cut it's so nicely
tapered up to an actual sort of pointed
tip you know it's not like a harsh point
but it's something that can definitely
reach your inner corner of your eye area
this is nice for under eye setting
powder this is nice for a highlight you
can even use this for a more precise and
defined contour also my good friend the
small stipple brush this is a must must
must must brush for anything cream blush
cream highlights blending out a cream
contour works so well it's all about the
cut of the bristles the way they've left
them so short and densely packed enough
so that you can actually stipple if you
want to and you're not seeing a bunch of
bend in those bristles and it's nice if
you want to do a little circular motion
blend out however you like to blend out
cream products but this has made any
sort of stain whether it's like a liquid
stain a rich creamy blush some sort of
liquid highlight anything of that nature
this applies it so well and you can
easily build up with this brush it won't
look too crazy intense when you apply it
with this it's just let goof-proof
another brush from the eye line that I
think is really great is they're
blending brush and this is sort of like
a sigma e25 but it's not quite as chubby
and this little bit of a soft dome thing
happening there at the top is I think
really useful it's good to get in the
outer corner it's great for getting some
product right here in the crease and
working
outward if you needed to do a one shadow
look with this you know the flatness can
help you a little bit because it can Pat
shadow across the lid as well and even
if you feel like well I've got small
eyes a lot of create split brushes or
blending brushes just muddy up my look
and are too big this is not too big
final product this is would be I guess
under the tools section the $1 slant
tweezers they have come out with other
tweezers that I think they're charging
maybe a couple more bucks for this is
this is my favorite pair of tweezers
that I own and I do own tweezer men's
and other stuff the little edges there
come together and meet perfectly it is
just the best thing for tweezing your
brows I seriously don't have any
complaints about these I only paid a
dollar for thank you guys so much for
watching this top 5 bottom 5 plus the
bonus top 5 brushes this was a lot of
fun for me but it was really a challenge
there are a lot of things I still really
like from elfs line that didn't get
mentioned in this video but I do feel
like I really was able to zero in on the
ultimate best and also the ultimate
worst so thanks again and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
