in in this video I'm gonna be doing a
new top 5 bottom 5 I noticed a lot of
requests for this kind of video on a
recent one that I did and it's very
self-explanatory the idea I pick a brand
try to pick a brand that I've tried like
nearly everything from so I've really
got a good scope of products to pull
from and I just named my top 5 favorite
products and my least favorite products
give it a thumbs up for sure if you'd
like to see more and thank you so much
for subscribing to my channel I'll list
all the brands that I've featured below
already and maybe check out that list
and definitely let me know if you have
any requests for other videos like this
and also with these videos if you don't
see something mentioned I mean the odds
are there are a lot of things like with
this particular video there are a lot of
products that I really like that are
kind of slightly outside the top 5 but
the thing about doing the top 5 is
really to hone in on the best of the
best you know and so for me in my
personal opinion there may have been
some things that I still liked but
weren't the tip top and same goes for
the things that I like the least there's
certainly that kind of average ho-hum
range in every brand where there's some
products that just didn't Wow but
weren't the worst things either so
jumping right into my top 5 I'm gonna
work up to my ultimate number one from
the brand so top 5 first thing I'll
mention are these new matte color riche
lip pencils they are so good so creamy
so full color there's one shade in
particular called mastermind I know the
names are kind of cheesy but don't hold
it against the product it's a really
good lip pencil I've got a lot of this
shade on my lips today actually as well
as the infallible matte paint in
peach-pit these lip liners they go on so
velvety smooth you know they are a
skinny pencil a very traditional
sharpener Bowl lip liner they go on so
easily like I can fill in my entire lips
with one of these just in a jiffy they
don't pull they're super creamy but they
are matte and they have some really nice
bright shades in the range too there's
some like fuchsia and red colors there's
another neutral that's like a super cool
like kind of rosy taupe and it's called
mattes
it that's a pretty one as well this one
the
that I've worked in to my look today a
little bit warmer I guess I described it
as a deep nude kind of spice color this
one called 112 mastermind just a nice
one to have in your collection great if
you ever you know grab a nude lipstick
and it's like a little too nude a little
too light you can use this in almost
contour your lips a little bit and give
them a little extra dimension so I think
that's a great line of lip liners number
four would be the pocket palettes from
L'Oreal this is a great little line of
eyeshadow actually they're super
consistent really smooth and creamy I'm
actually wearing this one called boudoir
charm today I'll open this up for you
it's very full you know on my lid in my
crease and even just really buffed out
like just above the crease is this kind
of burgundy shade there that's a total
winner I've got a little bit of this
shade on the lid and the other two
shades are like kind of smudged on my
lower lash line but I love that one my
other favorite from the line is called
French biscuit look at this like you've
got some mattes in there to play with
this pretty light creamy peach shade a
couple of tones of brown one is more
matte one has a little sheen and then
this shade with the sparkle if you need
a great basic gorgeous drugstore
eyeshadow quad check that out they've
got more colorful ones as well with like
Blues aquas purples I will definitely be
linking below to any related videos that
I've done by the way to some of these
products but I have done a full review
on those quads and I think they're just
the bomb really great stuff number three
this is a long long time favor for me
from L'Oreal and it's the true match
pressed powder I have loved this stuff
I'm thinking back to like the earlier
days of my channel but to this day it
remains I think one of the strongest
products in L'Oreal's line and
definitely their best powder these come
in a lot of shades the one that I'm
wearing and holding here is buff beige
I've also worn Sun beige as well if I'm
a little bit darker I think I wore that
a lot actually in my news day is the
texture of this powder is just
everything I mean you feel how creamy
this stuff is it's matte but it doesn't
look like an awful matte you know heavy
mask on your skin but this powder packs
in a little coverage if there was any
powder like
not marketed as powder foundation but
works nearly as well as most powder
foundations do and has as much coverage
as that type of product it would be this
thing right here it's the kind of thing
where yes it can work for touch-ups but
it can go beyond that you know if you
want to apply a little concealer all
over your skin and then kind of buff
something like this on for a little
added coverage it would certainly give
you that so I think that's a great line
of powders to look into okay number two
I am so cheating with this one guys and
I know it I'll admit it but the whole
paints collection okay this is great I
love that L'Oreal has done this they've
created this line of really interesting
products from lips to cheeks to eyes
that have a little more color a little
more vibrancy it kind of makes me think
of a rebirth of that L'Oreal hip line I
had been so impressed with certain
things that they've done though in this
line I've done a whole video review
likes watching things out trying them on
I tried on like all the lip products
they've got just a standard like L'Oreal
paints lip color it's the line that has
spicy blush so I've tried on all of
those but since that video they've come
out with the matte version also
metallics like the matte peach bit that
I'm wearing today the metallic and moon
lust is a great one love love love the
paint's eye colors these are creamy eye
colors that set to a really long wearing
place you'll find mattes within the line
there are some that are shimmers timeout
short story my battery very rudely went
dead
also there was a baby in need of my
services downstairs so I'm back now and
someone's mowing next door so if that
comes through I'm not sure if they'll
come through or not but if you hear it
that's what it is that's just you know
everyday life I think what I was talking
about were these infallible paints quite
a range of colors actually and I really
like the sunset fire one if you're into
warm looks cool ivory it's kind of like
two different tones of this shimmery
pearl and that can be a really pretty
accent to almost any look also and then
Navy Yard is this gorgeous navy blue and
a rosy sort of peach color paired with
that but definitely check out my full
review on the entire paint's line to see
so much more in the smallest nutshell
possible I think these eye colors are
great I think they're blush palette is
outstanding I'm wearing a couple of
these shades mixed
this is a powder blush palette at first
I thought this was cream but it's really
like just an intense array of powders a
couple of peachy tones a couple of pinky
tones they are all matte and they are
intense and they're really beautiful
they're intense but they're wearable and
so I love that I've really reached for
that a lot and then the other aspect of
their line like I said the lip colors
the regular ones they've got great matte
ones also the metallics I mean it's just
a fantastic formula and by the way these
are not like squeezing up through the
tube they're actually a doe foot
applicator within a squeezy type tube so
I think that's a really nice packaging
design as well paints collection
definite win for me I think they have
really put L'Oreal I guess back on my
radar quite a bit more due to a lot of
these products it's kind of cause
L'Oreal to be a brand to watch for me I
mean they're a big brand and you might
think well who's not watching them but
honestly you know for a while there I
think I had kind of a L'Oreal dry spell
and now there are quite a few things
that I like from this brand but my
number one would be the lash paradise
yes you probably knew this was coming
since I hadn't mentioned it yet and I I
just absolutely freaking love this
mascara if you watched my drugstore haul
like restock video repurchasing things
that I've run out of I recently
repurchase the mystic black shade of
this which I'm about ready to bust into
probably the next time I do my makeup I
will get that one out because this one's
pretty dry now but it's a brush that
reminds me a lot of Too Faced better
than sex however in a couple of aspects
I think it's better than that mascara in
that it really does not smudge or flake
off on me at all and it does a better
job of holding the curl of my lashes the
kind of mascara like sometimes I feel
like I talked about mascaras and it's
such an individual thing right so I
would say something like you know I
really enjoyed this mascara but if
you've already got something you love
you know go with that stay with it and
joy but this is one of those mascaras
where I might challenge you and say like
if you have not tried this I think you
should try putting this up against
whatever your current like Holy Grail
mascara might be right now and just see
just see if you don't like this better
because I bet you will so again that's
my top 5 if I had just a couple of
honorable mention products
things that I really like that may not
be for everyone but just stuff I want to
give a little shout out to the pro glow
concealer I wear this in the classic
ivory shade and if you're into a lighter
coverage makeup look like you're wearing
a lot of tinted moisturizers light
coverage foundations this concealer is
so great with those because it doesn't
like over mattify and overpower the
coverage of whatever your face makeup is
so it just wears really well alongside
lighter looks so if you're into that you
might like this and another thing that
they've made recently foundation wise
that I think is pretty darn good is this
infallible total cover I didn't jump
into loving this one immediately but I
realized it takes quite a bit of TLC to
like you know blend this into the skin
like it needs to be worked into your
skin like with a Beauty Blender
preferably I'll have to link to the get
ready with me where I put this on and I
really enjoyed the finished look I got
so many compliments on my skin actually
in an Instagram picture where I had this
on got it in the shade natural buff I
mean it's just it's not foolproof I
guess is what I'm trying to say and so
that's kind of putting it outside my top
5 for this brand I don't think everybody
maybe once or needs this much coverage
and you kind of got to really work with
it as you put it on it's like opposite
end of the application spectrum from
that Estee Lauder water blend stuff
which frankly like if Tyler wanted to
come up here and put that on me you
could probably blend that stuff out it's
so easy to work with and blend this
takes a little more working with but
it's probably one of the better coverage
drugstore foundations let's move on now
to the bottom 5 so I'm gonna work up to
an ultimate worst here but number 5 in
terms of things I don't really like from
this brand the infallible Pro glow
powder I saw this come out and I think
part of me kind of hoped that it might
be a formula just like True Match but
somehow but like a teeny bit more
luminous maybe but it's really not I
feel like the powder texture is drier
like not quite as good and it's got this
weird split pan thing going on here
where it's basically matte powder on the
bottom and then the top part has little
flecks of sparkle and it's not enough
like there's not enough of a sheen to
the top part of the powder to actually
have a glow effect on the skin
I guess if you wanted to take a powder
and make it more glowy maybe you could
go into true match like dab into this
and then dab into your highlight and
kind of buff the two together I don't
know I may have also been hoping this
would be kind of like the it cosmetics
illumination powder you know like a good
coverage powder paired with just a
little bit of luminosity but this just
it's not doing enough for me and in
really any regard number four on my list
of bottom five would be the color riche
eyeshadow singles these I thought were
very very hit and miss when I redid like
this makeup room and I redid my storage
I got rid of a lot of single eyeshadows
and I got rid of like three or four out
of this line that I just didn't think
we're good enough one of the better ones
of the bunch is this number 207 that I
held on to but the other ones I felt
like - put your finger in them it's like
okay this is a nice feeling texture but
then they wouldn't deliver really like
something with the formula I had
difficulty picking it up on my finger
but also picking it up with a brush so I
feel like these quads are so consistent
and a better formula overall than these
I'm not saying there might not be a few
gems in this range it's just it's hit
and miss number three on the stuff I
don't really like list is this
infallible total cover corrector palette
this just does not contain the shades
that actually function to correct my
skin you know there are two shades in
here that I think are really rich and
colorful and if you're into greens if
you're into Purple's like these show up
very boldly and that way I don't
typically reach for those kinds of
shades I'm more of maybe a yellow or a
peach type corrector person this is not
very peachy at all like it really does
not function to correct darkness on the
under-eye this yellow can be kind of
brightening but that's all it is you
know these aren't very good coverage
products I do also have the skin tone
palette and those I think are a little
bit better I can get a better concealed
effect from those but even still with
that the coverage is a little lacking
they're just a little too thin they
leave me wanting more needing more
concealer wise and again with this range
like nothing is effectively tackling my
biggest problem area which would be the
under eye like I'm wearing these even
today and I had to go over and over
with other stuff to just kind of build
it up this to me is one of those
products that you feel like you're
building up building up and still not
seeing enough effect out of it no matter
how much you build it number two in the
bottom five would be this L'Oreal
voluminous primer I know some people
love the L'Oreal voluminous mascara if
you do I'm thinking chances are you're a
person who does not have issues with
losing the curl in your lashes like if
you got naturally curly lashes maybe you
love voluminous and maybe you love this
primer but if you're a straight lash
girl like me this primer I feel like
practically is like lash straightener
hug me I don't know how to explain it
but I put it on I've got my nicely
curled lashes I put on this primer and
they just drop this is just not a
formula that plays well with my lashes
and I don't see some pronounced like oh
my gosh and how they're getting huge
that I put you know a mascara on top of
this it's not doing a lot for me from
the primer like building up the lashes
standpoint and it surprised me a little
bit because L'Oreal double extend going
way back to college days and the mascara
that has the white side and then the
dark side and it's just regular double
extend not the red tube but the like
golden white tube I love that stuff that
works so well for me for so many years
that I feel like the base coat of that
one was maybe a little thicker slightly
drier than this and maybe that's why it
built up better on my lashes but this
just kind of sucks the curl from them
and doesn't do too much and as it stands
right now my least favorite product from
L'Oreal is the brow stylist kabuki
Blender this product it's way overboard
for my brows and I see it being pretty
overboard probably for a lot of people
we're really looking at a crayon style
thing here and right now like yeah the
tip is pretty well formed there and you
look at this kind of going into my brows
and you think yeah it's not too big but
when that rounds off you're gonna be in
a real pickle if I already feel like
this is way too thick for my brows this
is not a sharpener Bowl thing here that
we're dealing with but then this little
brush that's on the end it is literally
like the tiniest kabuki brush you've
ever seen her like a really dense high
crease brush there's not a lot of
movement to it's just really thick it is
soft and it seems like a decent cut to
it but you're supposed to like put this
on then you can
Russia in through but all I get with
this product is like overboard brows
it's just way way too much and I've used
some thicker products in my brows at
times like thicker pencils you know
things that weren't just that little
pinpoint brow product like a brow Wiz or
something like that but this it's like
how were you ever supposed to get any
precision out of this because as you use
it it's just gonna round off more and
more and then this brush like what like
does that really it doesn't carry
product through and kind of separate the
product through the brow hairs like just
a regular spoolie brush would so
somebody was trying to really recreate
the brow idea with this product but it
does not work for me so I think that
about covers it that's my top 5 bottom 5
for L'Oreal thank you so much for
