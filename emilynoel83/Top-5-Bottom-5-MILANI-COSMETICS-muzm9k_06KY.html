is top five bottom five four Milani so
pretty self-explanatory the way I do
these videos is I choose a particular
brand and then I choose five of my
favorite products from that line and
five of my least favorite products and
this was the hardest one so far like
narrowing down the top five took me so
long because I had a list of probably 15
products from Milani that I would say I
really liked and so kind of narrowing it
down to five that I think anybody could
go to the store pick up get great use
out of that was kind of tricky so in
this video I almost felt like I would be
depriving you guys of really good
product mentions if I didn't maybe give
you just a little bonus 5 outside of my
top 5 for this video I'll make it quick
but I just there's so many good things
to mention and then I also have a bottom
5 as well so stay tuned for that at the
end of the video but I'm going to give
you this top 5 like leading up to a
number one best product from this line
so number five amazing product this
blush brush Milani recently released a
full line of brushes I bought the whole
line it was kind of pricey as far as
drugstore brushes go to get all of those
and I reviewed them all and this is
definitely one of the best of the line
I've started to love it even more than I
did in that video where I raved about it
so it's great for blush it's an amazing
contour brush you know you want to put
your bronzer around the perimeter of
your face whatever it's super soft it's
just full enough I don't like my blush
brush to be too big and it definitely
can't be too small either you know what
I'm saying but it's got the perfect
little taper toward the top where if you
wanted to just dip into a highlight and
just get it right on the edge of your
brush there you could do that and also
you know keep that kind of confined to a
certain area so I love this brush and if
you were curious about any of them this
is definitely like the one you should
pick up actually they make a really good
blending brush too number two product
from Milani is the shadow eyes shadow
sticks these are creamy shadow sticks
that set and last all day there are some
fun colors in this line that I have
theirs
beautiful purple I use the green a lot
if I'm doing like a pop of green on the
lower lash line with a shadow this shade
called green Safari is almost always
like my base there so you can really
count on them to set and stay but one
that I think is above and beyond in
terms of must-haves is the one in almond
cream and I love using this you've seen
me use it a lot in videos on the lower
inner rim for brightness it brightens
that area but it doesn't look
unnaturally bright the way sometimes a
white liner can it last a connect jumbo
stick and putting it in there in the
lower inner rim but really it isn't that
hard to apply and it totally stays this
would also make a fantastic base like
all over your lid if you wanted a nice
like neutral beige full coverage you
know totally cancel out any
discoloration on the lids this would be
nice there as well got to mention the
Milani color statement lipsticks I know
we get in this haze of liquid lipsticks
like do I need a liquid lipstick do I
need to go all matte with my lip colors
they do have some different finishes
some of my favorites are just the
straight-up creams that they make but
works for anytime any person any
occasion always feels nice on my lips
I've got a few shades that I'm holding
up here a couple that I am wearing right
now I love nude cream this is a great
classic nude lipstick love the color
intensity love the staying power I put
that all over and then I've been getting
some use out of this shade called teddy
bear which is kind of like your brownish
neutral and I have a little bit of that
on the border of the lips and just kind
of blend it over it one more time with
the lighter shade but these two together
you know this is a fun little shade to
sort of alter the look of any nude
lipstick you might have an amazing
classic pink looks good on anyone pink
would be this shade called pretty
natural love this color let me swatch it
for you not too much of a bubblegum pink
but yet it's not too much of a Mavi
purpley pink either I think it's just a
perfect mid-tone gives life to the face
type color and then there's a gorgeous
red in this line too cold red label
fantastic red lipstick I've worn this
one a lot
- let me swatch boom how amazing is that
you don't have to get your lipstick in a
liquefied state in order for it to be
fully opaque colorful and great-looking
on the lips these lipsticks are fabulous
options as well number two product from
Milani is the bronzer excel in fake tan
without a doubt one of my top bronzers
of any brand any price range I love this
stuff they do have some other color
options too but this happens to be just
perfect for contouring then the split
pan gives you this extra side with just
kind of sunny warmth and I use this to
contour with today and I also did take
this side which has just a teeny bit of
golden shimmer this one's totally matte
but I dusted this just like all over the
skin to kind of wake it up a little bit
and I love the amount of product you get
I love the pigmentation and my number
one product from Milani you've probably
been predicting this as I've gone
through this little countdown but it's
the eyeshadow primer probably one of the
less exciting makeup items that people
talk about but really if it makes my
shadow stand out more and lasts all day
I'm game
you know this is important to me it
doesn't take a lot I want to show you
truly all I use between two eyes is only
about that much and then I just kind of
DAB it between my fingers and go across
my lid up into the crease all the way up
to the brow cover that whole area and
then give it one more dab over it one
more time with a clean finger and pick
up any excess and then you will be set
so those are my five makeup things where
maybe your person who's never tried
Milani and you go after those items and
I really think your satisfaction rate
would be so high if you just tried those
five but I do have a little honourable
mention I do just want to let you know
what things I was like internally
battling with before this video and the
things that I still really really love
but they didn't make the top 5 Milani
multitasker powder fabulous stuff I've
got the shade light/medium here this is
full full coverage matte powder you've
got to be careful with it you know you
can definitely go too far with this
stuff I would suggest just building up a
little at a time if you tap a brush into
it you definitely get a lot
product off it's not one of those
powders you're going to scrub into and
struggle to pick up products so it works
really well
yes I've hit pan also this little eye
palette that I am wearing today it's
called everyday eyes and it's in the
shade earthy elements I am so so happy
with the quality of these shades this
like mid-tone taupe color is so crazy
creamy and beautiful the only reason why
maybe this didn't get vaulted right into
the top five is because I haven't tried
any of the other colors yet so I kind of
feel the need to experiment a bit more
maybe do like a devoted review to these
kinds of Milani eye palettes but I am
loving this one I've got a lot of this
shade just all over the lid this in the
crease both of these kind of warm mattes
blended just up above the eye and that's
what I love about this just the variety
of finishes feel like this is a really
just smart color selection in here got
to mention the amore matte lip creams I
feel like I am one who is just kind of
slowly like inching my way out of the
matte lip color party I'm really
embracing my love for the classic
lipstick these days I got to say but
Milani Zamorin matte lip creams are some
of the best for being true liquid
lipsticks and that they are so so thin
so you can apply a thin amount get full
color they're not going to feel too
heavy on the lips this shade that I'm
holding here is called romance it's a
beautiful a little deeper take on red
there's a gorgeous berry in this line as
well I just really felt the need to
mention that for those of you who love
the matte liquid lipsticks now I've got
two heard some mixed opinions on these
but I absolutely love these they're
called I've worn off the label on this
one they're called moisture lock lip
treatments and they're basically lip
oils and I use them kind of as a pre
makeup lip softening routine or you can
use them just any time of day that your
lips need a big drink of moisture I feel
like it goes a little further from my
lips moisture wise in a classic lip balm
I love the rose it also got the honey
lemon the almond cocoa was one of the
first ones I got and since that time
I've also gotten the beach mango and the
raspberry like I'm kind of crazy about
these I think a lot of people maybe
expected those products to be something
they weren't really designed to be like
they're not going to give color to your
lips they're a straight up treatment and
I
feel like I get one distinct effect from
the coconut one and then a totally
different like purpose for my lips from
the raspberry let's say I feel like the
only difference in all those different
ones is just scent and you know bombs
may be completely adequate for a lot of
people out there but if you want to kind
of step your lip moisturization up a
notch you might consider one of those
lip and then lastly in my little you
know just outside the top five products
here Milani has great blushes the baked
blushes don't get me wrong they're
amazing but a particular blush that I
have really become attached to is this
romantic rose and it doesn't necessarily
I mean outside of the gorgeous packaging
that shade maybe doesn't look super
remarkable but I always love it I always
love the way this looks on my cheeks and
I always feel that little bit of like
surprise when I put it on like wow
that's so pretty and I think it's
because it applies just a little bit
deeper than I expect it's a little more
neutral than a classic pink it just
always looks good now we're going to
dive on into the bottom five some not so
good things for Milani this was a much
easier list to put together because
there just weren't as many different
things to consider here so that's good
we like brands to have more good things
than bad things but my number 5 and
we're going to be working up to an
ultimate worst product here but number 5
would be this cream to powder makeup I
have it here in the shade medium beige
and I think when I first got this
product and had tried it out I you know
thought it was kind of average okay but
now that I've tried so many more cream
type compacts or cream consistency
foundations I feel like this is quite a
bit too heavy and kind of cakey looking
on the skin it also has a rather strong
like old perfume type scent that I just
I can't get over I smell it any time I
apply it I'm like oh it's just the kind
of thing that I know has been in
milania's line for some time and I would
not be surprised if they reformulated it
I hope they do and come out with like a
really great coverage but natural
looking cream foundation that's what
they need number four would be this
length in seconds lash extension fibers
so basically we're dealing with some of
those loose little hairlike fibers you
can definitely see it when you look
close
sup at this wand and you're supposed to
apply a coat of any mascara then you
apply this to the tips and then you
finish with another coat of mascara and
what I found this does for my lashes is
it just kind of makes them more clumpy
also I find that the little fibers are
always flying off everywhere I swear I
have inhaled you know like breathe in
through my mouth and definitely breathe
some of these in for sure gotten them in
my eye even as careful as you want to be
when you got these loose fibers it's
like they have a mind of their own also
I just don't like what this does for the
consistency of mascaras that I pair it
with and this was my complaint with like
the Too Faced better than false lashes
system is that you put this on and then
you put a mascara like any other random
mascara over the top you're slowly
changing the consistency of that mascara
as it grabs some of these fibers and you
know they don't all just stay right
there on your lashes I swear your
mascara will eat some of them up take
them back into their tube and then
slowly your mascara becomes thicker and
more clumpy number three is a product
that I no longer have here but this is
one of the worst mascaras I have ever
tried in my life and it's called total
lash cover it's still being sold I will
pop up a picture but it's got the most
ridiculous wand first off there's a lot
of space in the wand so I feel like you
know spaced out bristles just like areas
holding clumps of product so the lashes
really easily get overloaded but then so
much of the tip is just this rubber nub
with nothing going on like if there's
any part of a mascara wand where you
need some bristles I would say it would
be the tip because that's the area where
you're really you know maneuvering
around like if there's any part of that
brush that can hit the inner most lashes
it's going to be the tip but when that
tip contains no bristles we thought that
was a good idea that just it's one of
those things leaves me scratching my
head hello things are getting serious
here for every product that I love from
Milani where I feel like people really
sat down put some time into creating
great formulations and great products
there are some things where I'm like
what the
Eck Milani and one of those is this
fierce foil line of stuff including the
eyeliner now I have this in the shade
purple foil it's the kind of thing you
might take a swatch of and you're like
okay it's a shimmery cream liner alright
but the problem is this stuff just does
not last it was not built to last it was
built to maybe look cool in one or two
pictures and then BOOM times up
turns back into a pumpkin we're done
glitter in eyeliner is just a really
tricky thing I think unless the brand is
coming up with a formula that can
totally like keep that glitter under
control it's going to run around
everywhere and that's kind of what I
noticed with this to it like it causes
the product to appear to be even
breaking down maybe faster than it is
because right after you apply just got
these glittery flecks that are just
roaming your face doesn't look good my
number one most disliked product from
Milani though is the fierce foil eyes
shine and these are things where at a
glance you know they look pretty and
metallic these are like really really
creamy it's something where it's gonna
look pretty instantly like look at the
gorgeous shine it's metallic
okay don't fall in love with it because
these things have a tendency to crease
like crazy even on the back on the
instructions it says reapply as needed
so it's like they know this stuff is not
going to be like in it for the long haul
so if you're going out at night you're
gonna look at your eyes and be like okay
it's all collected in the crease I guess
we'll just kind of smear that around and
put on more that's not realistic for my
life and they also say a little goes a
long way but I think the problem with
this texture is that it's hard to go
small with this like even if you're
thinking I'm just going to use a little
like on top of the center of my lid to
just accent my eye look there is a
thickness to these and there's a
moisture that these seem to maintain
they don't really like set dry down you
know completely go to a long wearing
state so it's kind of a dangerous risky
thing to put on your eyes in my opinion
so I'm gonna leave it there thank you
guys so much for watching let me know
what brand you want to see next in my
top 5 bottom 5 series and I will see you
again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
