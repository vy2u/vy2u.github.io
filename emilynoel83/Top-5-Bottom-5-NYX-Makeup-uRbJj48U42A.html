me for my top five bottom five series I
think this is a fun way and kind of a
challenging way to really look at a
brand and think about what are your
favorites and what are your least
favorites and I'm never picking on any
one brand when I you know mention the
things that I didn't like so much
because I truly feel that every brand
has hits and misses and some of those
products that didn't turn out to work
for me may very well still work for
someone else but I'm just giving you my
take on this stuff and I think it's just
kind of fun to put the focus on one
brand at a time here and mix was
definitely by far one of the most
requested brands for this series and
it's one of the most difficult because
NYX has tons of products they're always
coming out with new stuff I like a lot
of NYX products when I get that dreaded
question sometimes like if you could
only use one brand what would it be
NYX really is one of the first things
that pops into my mind because they have
such variety such innovation but really
quickly before I get into this I want to
say a huge huge thank you to those of
you who have been sharing my channel
with friends and family I feel like I've
heard from so many people on social
media and just in comments recently who
say I shared your channel with my family
and my best friend and we watch your
videos together and I just want to tell
you that that fills me with such joy and
such gratitude because I think there is
no more special genuine wonderful way
for a channel to grow than for people to
share it with the ones that they love
and so I just want to say thank you
because nobody has to do that you know
you spend time watching my videos you
don't have to comment you don't have to
thumbs it up you don't have to share it
with anybody but and those of you who do
care to do that like I just want to say
you have a special place in my heart
I've been on YouTube for a long time and
I don't take that lightly I really
appreciate it so thank you so much now
what you came here for top five bottom
five I start with the top five products
and I kind of tend to work up to a
number one um but with a lot of these
things I gotta say for NYX they're kind
of like on the same page for me like I
love so much of the stuff in this top
five
equally it was really hard to like place
one above another product so just keep
that in mind I really love all this
stuff and number five I'm going to say
the high voltage lipsticks I think this
is such a great lipstick formula so
creamy absolutely super opaque and
pigmented really really comfortable on
the lips I mean if you've kind of been
there done that with some of the dry
liquid lipsticks that are on the market
and give these a shot because they feel
completely different on your lips but
they are all the color you could hope
for I'm wearing a couple of them on my
lips today and as I was thinking which
ones am I going to talk about because
I've got a lot of ones that I think are
really gorgeous and I thought no let's
just narrow this down to you know if
nobody's tried these and they were just
going to grab like let's say three and
there are three that I really over and
over like to mix together so there's a
nude called Mirage great nude very
full-on nude you know and it's not often
that I wear this alone but I love mixing
it with flutter kiss when I wore these
two together on snapchat I don't think
any other picture I've done has been
screenshot it so many times like these
two are gorgeous together flutter kiss
is like that kind of soft neutral hint
of mauve type color that everybody's
gaga for and a lot of people wear it in
a matte version and a liquid lipstick
but I think it's beautiful with that
little bit of shine and these two
together like flutter kiss all over the
lips a little bit of Mirage in the
center it's a great combo but if you
want to have even more versatility I
would pull in the shade called wine and
dine I actually combined wine and dine
and flutter kissed
today so wine and dine is kind of the
berry look you're seeing on the outside
flutter kiss is more on the center of
the lip and so I think you've just got a
lot of versatility if you had these
three number four would be the stay
matte but not flat powder foundation
this is an old one I have used a lot of
it I really really like this powder
foundation I need to get a new doing a
lot of reviews I kind of feel the need
to jump around and try more things once
I've made my mind up about something but
this is a really fantastic powder
foundation for not looking too much like
powder you know it honestly has a really
beautiful finish on the skin I wouldn't
describe it as being glowy but it's just
it's the kind of thing where you put it
all over your skin and you turn your
face and you don't feel like you're just
seeing one dimensional you know
completely matte skin and if you've got
an Ulta near you where you can actually
get your hands on the product I
encourage you to touch it swatch it feel
how creamy it is you know it's a really
nice smooth powder I've worn this alone
plenty of times but I would say the way
I've worn it most is even just as a
standard powder to set foundation really
lightly in fact I used you a little bit
around the outside to do that today on
top of my foundation and it just really
reminded me how great of a product this
is number three for me from NYX is the
highlight and contour pro palette it's a
nice range of contour shades that would
work for a lot of different skin tones I
tend to bounce around between these two
a lot you've got you know shimmery
highlights here in here matte highlights
to work with as well actually this one
has a little bit of a satiny finish to
it but I love the quality of these
powders they feel a lot like the texture
of the stay matte but not flat powder
foundations you know and that they're
very smooth even when you're using it's
really light shades I don't think they
give the skin a dry or chalky appearance
and another cool feature that this
palette has is that these all pop out
and they do sell individual pans and I
remember when I first did a review slash
tutorial with this I also used it as an
eyeshadow palette it's a great eye
palette too if you like mattes and just
natural shades o feel can find like you
can only use this on your cheeks but
just looking across the board at
everything in Nyx's line this is I think
one of the best quality products number
two I would have to mention the slide on
lip pencils this was a newer thing to me
I remember just stumbling across these
on their website and thinking how long
have these been around because I love
the slide on I pencil too but these just
really were game-changer in my
collection they are just standard
pencils that you sharpen but they've
really mastered a formula here that is
supremely creamy and easy to apply and
easy to fill in your entire lips with
but awesome staying power they really do
lock in they could wear for the majority
of the day and just come off kind of
like a matte lipstick but they're
awesome to pair you know with your
other lipsticks that you have in your
collection and if I had to narrow it
down to just a couple of shades that I
think are must-haves I love this one
called nude suede shoes it's a nude with
like a hint of pink to it I think it
really makes it mesh well with just the
natural tone of your lips sealing in
your entire lips with this shade and
wearing it underneath your favorite nude
lipstick or gloss will really enhance
the staying power another say that I
really think works great is called dark
soul and I love this because I think it
works well with pretty much anything on
the berry end whether it's a medium kind
of more pinky berry all the way to the
darker shade the formula is great it's
really just up to you what colors you
need but those are a couple that I find
myself using the most and like I was
saying before a lot of the products in
this top 5 were all just way up there
for me they're all nearly equal but a
number one that I'm going to name in
this video are the Avant pop eyeshadows
I think Nix took it to the next level
with this formula they are really really
smooth buttery awesome feeling
eyeshadows and NYX is a brand that I
think is working with multiple eyeshadow
formulas I really love like they're
super metallic and prismatic singles
they've got some larger palettes that
can be a little more hit and miss with
the quality within those they've got
some other like six color palettes on
the market that I feel like are a
completely different formula but what
they've got going on in these particular
palettes is something special and I hope
it spreads and I hope this is what they
continue to create shadows with whatever
the recipe is in these palettes it's
working and I am wearing one of these
today I'm using the one called art throb
and you know this has some really bright
intense shades I am wearing as you might
guess a combo of these two shades in the
crease and I really just wanted it to be
soft I didn't want to go like full-on
with those colors today I just wanted
that little like kind of seafoam green
action up there and I think I got it and
then on the lower lash line I've got
some of this
kind of shimmery berry shade and it kind
of coordinates with the lips a bit and I
love it I just love how all the colors
are definitely
what-you-see-is-what-you-get I mean this
silver get-out-of-town you know could it
be any better no and if you're saying
yeah I like the idea of that kind of
quality but I'm a neutral person the one
in Nouveau chic is just dynamite I love
peach and plum it gives you that it
gives you some greens some kind of
steely bluish shades and lilac I love
and then the third one is called surreal
my heart very cool still has a couple of
bright pops but there are some really
cool neutrals in that one and I just
also want to mention that the go-to
palettes these came out right around the
same time as the oven Pollitz and they
look like this and and these also I
think have that very same formula very
soft to the touch
creamy pigmented
what-you-see-is-what-you-get types of
shadows less they put in bronzer /
contour blush and highlight phenomenal
highlights in these palettes now when I
work on these videos I kind of tend to
make a big list of the things I like and
the things I don't like and then I
really try to pare it down to get that
top 5 but I just wanted to let you know
what was going through my head as
additional products that I really really
like from NYX because like I said NYX
has a huge line very hard to narrow it
down to five but some other things that
I really really like the micro brow
pencil just did a video on that
comparing it to the Anastasia brow Wiz
if you're into the ash Brown very cool
brown colors I do think that that's a
dupe for medium brown I love the
control-freak brow gel one of the best
brow gels on the market for great hold
and it's not one of those exciting
products that's always going to like
just grab your attention eyebrow gel but
it is really good I also like the tinted
brow mascara that has great hold as well
comes in a variety of shades the intense
butter glosses love that formula they
smell great they look great really shiny
very vivid and I love the ombre lip duos
as well which are kind of like a chubby
stick with a liner on the other end
let's move on to the bottom five number
five I would say is this HD studio
photogenic
NIC's has a full line of foundations in
this HD photogenic line and they're
decent foundations they would probably
fall somewhere in the middle for me
between a top five and a bottom five
but this primer I've been using it again
and again and it's just a white primer I
don't feel like it does anything special
for my skin in terms of brightening it's
also not especially doing anything for
the texture either I remember using this
the other day and thinking alright it
just left kind of a sticky film on my
skin before applying the foundation but
a big way that I think my skin benefits
from a primer is one that is going to
even out the surface of my skin make it
feel very uniform and smooth so that
foundation can go on very very evenly
and as a result lasts longer because the
application was able to be just so even
and smooth you know that's what a good
primer does for me this one it just kind
of felt sticky patchy I don't get the
point number four for me would be these
six color eye palettes they've got
different names like adorable and this
one says smokey and this one says sex
bum I'm not saying decent looks can't be
achieved with these I mean obviously you
put on a primer the shadows will stick
better they may stand out a little bit
more but I think NYX has just improved
leaps and bounds since the release of
these pallets and one other thing like
the color selection on the smokey I know
I've complained about this before but
it's a bunch of dark shades that end up
looking identical on the eyes the plum
looks like the Navy which looks like the
black which looks like the charcoal
because they all just look kind of dark
and dusky on the eyes and that's fine
for a dark eye but if you were thinking
you were going to get plum or navy the
shades just don't stand out enough
number three product that I would not
recommend from NYX would be the baked
blushes I have one here in the shade
chiffon okay I had one or two pink
shades in the past as well these were
just blushes that like if you've got a
feeling in your head of what a baked
blush is going to feel like you might
expect it to be kind of dry kind of
chalky that is what these feel like some
baked blush is really surprised you and
you touch me you're like wow it's so
smooth and creamy
covergirl put out one I think in there
true blend line
a really nice blush it looks like the
baked style but it feels amazing and
this just has that dry kind of light
chalky just dusted away type feeling on
the other end of the spectrum NYX has
some really nice individual HD blushes
which I would recommend if you want to
buy a blush from NYX but these not so
much my number two least favorite
product from NYX would have to be this
soft focused primer this is a new ish
product that they've put out and it's
kind of like and I don't know it feels
like a balm type thing but it is creamy
and there's a sponge but as I try to get
my sponge in there and really pick some
up and just dab into it it's like the
product kind of balls up like it doesn't
know what to do it doesn't really cling
onto the sponge and that in turn you
know you don't feel like you're getting
a lot on your face so the times I've
used this I've gone in with my finger
and just kind of started dabbing it
around on my face then I found it very
hard to get an even application when you
put it on your foundation on top of it
does not look good like if this gets
into any dry areas around the under-eye
I felt like my foundation was clinging
there even more it's kind of the feel of
a product that's going to go cream to
powder but it never really gets there
and just stays a little bit tacky and I
just don't like that feel for a primer
and the not so coveted spot of number
one most disliked product from the line
would have to be this cream highlight
and contour palette brands are coming
out with cream contouring stuff left and
right
and sadly mixes falls way short for me
because it's just too dry I feel like
the shades are right on the money you
know I look at this and think that's a
nice cool tone you're getting this kind
of pale yellow you know highlight
brightener type thing and then something
with a little bit of shimmer and they
are all just so darn dry they pull they
tug across the skin I don't care whether
you're using a dampened blender sponge
with this or a brush it just it's a
struggle to use and there are too many
other good things on the market that are
going to cost you less like elfs got
cream contouring stuff for example that
works really well this just missed the
mark for me and that is it that is my
top 5 bottom 5 from NYX on
right side of things I have many more
things from Knicks that I love than
products I didn't like that was a much
longer list that I was making but like I
said every brands got hits and misses I
would love to hear what brand you would
like to see featured next time in this
series and let me know what you love and
don't love from NYX in the comments
