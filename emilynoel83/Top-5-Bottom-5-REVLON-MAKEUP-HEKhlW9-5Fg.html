looking over some of the recent videos
I've done and I thought wait I have not
done a top 5 bottom 5 in a really long
time so I thought I would do that and I
felt very ready and prepared to do one
on Revlon I try to do these videos when
I feel like I've tried a lot of what a
brand has to offer and then I just tell
you what I think are the brand's 5 best
products and their 5 worst products and
Revlon has been one of those brands that
has had a lot of like all over the place
with me sometimes I rank and go to an
ultimate like number one out of my top 5
but I'm considering I do have a few
demos it kind of to insert in here and
the fact that I feel like it would be
kind of like apples and oranges to
compare a couple of these things and
rank one above the other I think the
things in my top 5 are equally strong so
the first thing I'm going to mention is
my Revlon Colorstay liquid makeup and I
know they are selling this with a pump
now which is super exciting of course
but I have this in the normal to dry
skin formula I wear it in the shade
fresh beige I'm wearing it today and I
think back to my earliest days on
YouTube and how everybody was raving
about this foundation it still helped
they're still on the market it does come
in two formulas and for a while I was in
that oily to combo formula and I did
feel like it was extremely long wearing
however the drawback of that one if you
are not maybe truly oily it can look
kind of dry on the skin it's a very
matte finish and I have just been
finding I love the way this normal to
dry version looks on my skin and I'm
very normal right now you know if you
dry areas that come and go blends out
easily today when I applied it I just
dotted it all over my face and then
blended it out with a Beauty Blender
works great with a brush as well a flat
top kabuki brush I think gives maximum
coverage for this type of a foundation
what I think is kind of cool about this
particularly in the normal to dry skin
version is that it's a matte finish
foundation that is also catering to that
skin type whereas I feel like for a lot
of people with dry skin you might think
your only options out there are getting
something that is a luminous finish what
if you don't like a luminous finish what
if you've got like a lot of uneven
texture on your
skin you feel like those types of
foundations just exaggerate it but yet
you have dry skin so you need the
formula that works this would be a dry
skin formula that actually does have a
nice matte finish on the skin and the
staying power is tremendous and that is
one of the biggest points in this
foundations paper after had a lot of
foundations lots of drugstores stuff
this normal to dry skin formula reminds
me a lot of one of my favorite drugstore
liquid foundations of all time which
would be the Rimmel lasting finish so I
think this continues to be a fantastic
option and one of Revlon's best products
in their brand now another foundation
that I really like and this would be
number two in my top 5 is their Revlon
Colorstay whipped makeup now this is not
whipped
to the extent that Maybelline Dream
matte mousse is you know you like look
at it and you can see this really moosie
texture when you open this up it looks
like a cream you know and this is about
half used up I've got this in the shade
320 warm golden and it's too dark for me
right now was not able to demo this for
you and frankly it's probably a little
bit on the old side I've kept this for
like reference of the way it feels and
stuff like that but not really for you
so this foundation I feel is very
comparable to regular color stay in
terms of coverage it has nice staying
power but I think even more of a natural
skin type finish it's not quite so mad
it's not glowy I'm not saying that but
it's not matte either and this
foundation has always been one of my top
picks when people ask me what
photographs well an indoor-outdoor I
don't care what it is
this foundation looks fantastic in
photos I think pretty much any skin type
can get away with wearing it and you
know it just does have this slightly
lighter feel as it blends out on the
skin compared to the liquid but as I
thought about this one more and more I
kind of want to repurchase it in a shade
that really fits me right now truly is
an interesting formula in that it is a
cream but it's got this lighter
consistency compared to a lot of like
cream compacts you know but I have seen
this last really effectively on oily
skin in a summertime wedding in the
South this is also performed really well
on dry skin too but I would say if you
consider yourself to be one of the most
most oily people ever
I think your best formula from Revlon
would probably be the liquid in the oily
to combo formula okay third product I
would like to mention is one of the best
press powders in the drugstore period
and it's the Revlon nearly naked I wear
this in the shade light this line of
powder tends to run a little bit dark
but it is some of this smoothest
creamiest just best consistency of a
powder that I have seen and the texture
is so smooth and given that it has that
smooth softness it is able to give a
little added coverage to the skin it can
mattify without looking like powder
really I've really gotten into using
this a lot more lately and I'll just
take my ELF complexion brush and sort of
dab it around my face and I feel like it
just is the ultimate Perfector you know
on top of a foundation it really looks
exceptionally skin like I would say a
downfall would be the shade range the
most similar thing to this is probably
the L'Oreal True Match pressed powder so
if you really like this idea of what
I've been how I've been describing this
powder but you feel like your shade is
not out there you might look too L'Oreal
True Match pressed powder because it
does feel kind of similar to this this
is maybe a teeny bit softer number four
in my top five and like I said these
aren't really in any particular order
but just you know products I love would
be the Revlon Super Lustrous lipsticks
these are so good these are one of the
most overlooked and underrated products
in the drugstore some of the shades in
this line have been around for decades
like there are iconic shades that
continue to be available is a broad
shade range a broad finish selection as
well you can see whenever you go to buy
one of these you look at the butt end of
that lipstick and it will tell you the
shade name the number and whether it's a
cream or a mat or a sheer or shine
actually is what one of these is labeled
but I mean you have a lot of options
here it's definitely a line of lipstick
that's worth exploring the price per
lipstick is not ridiculous and I have
just run into so many shades that are
absolute must-haves so I'm going to run
through those for you I've pulled out 5
and yeah I could have done more what I
want to talk about is actually a their
matte finish of the Super Lustrous
lipstick and this isn't the shade pink
pout I think this is a really pretty
cool pink and it's a fun shade to blend
as well if you want to nude it up a
little bit more you can blend in a nude
or spiced colored liner but it's a nice
creamy matte lipstick then the shade
that I'm wearing throughout the video
it's one that I've discovered I think
within the past year and it's the shade
130 Rose velvet and this is a cream
finish the cream finish is probably my
favorite overall of the Super Lustrous
lipsticks and Rose velvet is so wearable
it's so easy to just throw on it doesn't
really interfere or clash with other
colors that you might be wearing it's
very neutral it's a deep neutral with
some dusty rose mixed in great feel on
these lipsticks there's that little bit
of shine just fantastic next one I want
to talk about is rich girl red I've
talked about this a lot I think anytime
I have a red lip oriented video this one
comes up this is labeled as a shine
finish and it is a little more sheer
than a regular cream finish but it feels
a lot like the creams and I love the
color of this because I think it's a
soft non-intimidating slightly warm red
I think it's a perfect spot on summer
red because you put it on and it's not
so opaque that it totally wipes your
lips out a hundred percent but it's just
more of a casual red you know what I'm
saying how people who are really
familiar with this line and have been
over the years the ultimate maybe iconic
shade from the whole selection might be
cherries in the snow that is a really
really long standing shade and this I
think of as not a true red it's like a
pinky red I am so going to work this
into some looks for the holidays because
it's glamorous it's bright in this video
I am putting out there my commitment to
making use of this shade throughout the
holidays and then the last one which I
know I've talked about a lot is black
cherry black cherry is amazing it can go
so full on so dark applied straight from
the tube but a great way to customize
the amount of depth you get from this
shade would be to apply it with a lip
brush because you can do just a sheer
berry
stayin almost look from this lipstick
and it's so gorgeous or the way I feel
most comfortable wearing this out of the
house would be to apply it full-on
straight from the lipstick and then give
myself one good blot and I will show you
what that looks like
and I feel like I still get depth I see
a little more reddish berry come through
it still feels super comfortable on my
lips but I'm not quite as concerned
about like where's this creamy lipstick
gonna go where's it going to end up in
two hours it's a highly versatile shade
and if you have this and you've doubted
that one bit grab a lip brush apply it
lightly you'll see like it's got a whole
range and number five on my top five
isn't yet another lip product and they
are the revlon matte balms
i love these these are one of my top
matte drugstore lip picks for sure and
they feel really comfortable going on I
feel like my lips look pillowy soft and
almost a little plumped up after I've
worn these which is a very rare and
unusual thing for matte lip colors they
feel comfortable they have a teeny bit
of a minty scent and I've got to top
shades my tip top one overall is sultry
sultry cannot be beat I mean this is
very its mom could see this shade so
easily working in a professional
environment where you're thinking okay I
don't want to wear like just light soft
neutral everyday I want something with a
little more depth but yet the color as a
whole is kind of muted you know it's not
going magenta it's not going really dark
berry it's just a really nice spot I
kind of feel that way about the
Roseville that lipstick I've been
wearing throughout the video too you
know it's just very universally workable
then that balm and sultry though has
more pinky berry to it and then the
other shade that I really like in the
matte balm is called fierce and this is
like a right now color I think it's very
fall it's like your brownish brick red
it's got a lot of gorgeous depth to it
but as much as I like these colors I
think it's just an easy texture they
apply so evenly and I think your lips
just look better for having them on now
we're going to move on to the bottom
five and the first one I'm going to talk
about like this is hard because this was
a product I
really swore by in my earlier makeup
days and I feel like makeup has evolved
drugstore makeup particularly has
changed and improved and it's just
gotten beaten out and it's very very
obvious to me that I think this line of
eyeliner needs to step up their game and
I'm talking about the Revlon Colorstay
pencil liners these are retractable
liners one in sapphire here I remember
trying to use this in a recent video or
a video not all that long ago and it's
just you know dry why it shouldn't be
that way there are so many great
retractable or pencil liners that go on
like buttah and then they smooth out and
can be smudged out and then set okay yes
I expect a lot out of an eyeliner but I
think it's time for Revlon to get on
that level stop these multi pallets
anybody remember when I did the full
review on all three of these different
eyes cheeks and lips palettes not
impress these are verging on a like a
$20 price tag and I don't think they're
anywhere near worth it you're getting
six eyeshadows a blush and four lip
colors two or more like lipsticks two
are like a shiny gloss and I feel like
the shadows
you know the deeper shades have some
intensity the lighter shades not so much
like one matte shade a bunch of like
just mid-tone shimmers in this romantic
nudes palette the blush was not showing
up on me I'm not wowed by the lip
products that are in here and I just
feel like they lumped a bunch of stuff
together that was just really average to
below average it got a berry one they've
got a smoky one that I think just for
the fact that the colors are darker in
there they do show up a little bit
better from the smoky palette it's most
definitely something that I would not
recommend dropping nearly 20 bucks on at
the drugstore another eyeshadow related
fail from Revlon would be these crazy
little shadow links which love the
concept of making your own palette being
creative choosing your shades but I did
a video on these way back when I
actually had to dig this out of my fale
drawer in my closet where I keep some
fails just for reference just for
situations like this where I may need to
pull them out
tell these are being phased out because
I'm not finding them everywhere online
not seeing them everywhere in drugstores
but we're talking just lightly pigmented
shadows that do not blend well apply
well there is this kind of Popham
together slide them in gimmick that
yeah it's ill draw me in but this eye
shadow formula ultimately the formula
the shades look decent at a glance if
those were pigmented that would be nice
you know but this was not one of
Revlon's proudest moments I don't think
the fourth product in my bottom five
would be the ultimate suede lipsticks
these are one of the few revlon lip
products that just did not resonate with
me at all I dug through everything I own
and I cannot find them I must have
checked in the last time I did like a
big makeup purge in here so I'm sorry I
don't have a visual aid for you but I
will try to describe these as well as I
can they are a lipstick they will apply
and make you think you've got like a
creamy thing happening but very
differently from your Super Lustrous
lipsticks they have an odd like I won't
wouldn't call it total dry down but a
dryness develops in those products that
I find to be very annoying and
uncomfortable I've had some shades in
that line that had a little bit of frost
in them too and that did that formula no
favors either Revlon has developed a
high standard for lip products in my
opinion they've got good lipsticks
they've got certain glosses that are
good the Super Lustrous glosses I really
thought were at their prime when they
were in those squared off tubes and now
when they had the changeover to the
rounded tubes I think they lost some
good shades they sheared out some
different shades and it's still a good
formula but it's a little more hit and
miss than it used to be but as a whole
Revlon's had a lot of great lip products
the ultimate Suede's I think stick out
like a sore thumb and number five in my
bottom five would be this photo-ready
prime and anti shine and Revlon you are
not alone in being a drugstore brand
that cannot pull off this anti shine
balm type of product because it's really
like a Mallee face defender is the only
thing that can really do this well and
it's a product where it feels almost
like I compared the consistency or the
fee
to a clear deodorant and you twist your
sponge on to it and you just dab it
right on your skin and you get like this
immediate modification kind of pore
concealing type of effect but the magic
and Mally's product is that number one
it's clear number two the consistency is
spot-on so that you're never going to
pick up too much product out of there
because getting too much of a bone on
your skin and putting it on top of your
makeup can look just like a really bad
cakey mess very easily and so I've seen
multiple drugstore brands put out
something like this first off this is
not really clear it's kind of creamy and
it actually will look white if you get
enough on your skin and it's so creamy
it's hard to keep from picking up too
much and then when you see that
translate like on top of your skin any
little dry area it almost creates its
own dry air is that you didn't know you
had because suddenly I'm seeing makeup
more yeah it may not be shining but good
lord I don't want to look at it you know
they need to turn it into much more of
like a solid product a clear product
something where you're only going to get
the bare minimum picked up on a sponge
and then it's gonna do the job and no
more so I hope you enjoyed this video I
hope this sheds some light on both some
good
and not-so-good from Revlon in my
opinion perhaps somebody else had an
awesome experience with some of those
but I didn't but the things that I loved
I really truly and deeply loved from
this line so thank you guys so much for
taking time to watch and I will see you
very soon bye but wait real quickly I
almost forgot about this I made a few
notes on my list about a few things that
I thought were just outside my top 5 one
of them was my photo ready concealer
stick I think that's a really good
concealer I'm not sure I find that stuff
to be quite as creamy as the new Alma
aged essentials stick concealer but
they're close also if they were still
around the Revlon skin lights why does
this product like come and go from their
line it's a great liquid highlight and
if you ever see that come back on the
market I would say snatch one up and
then
and my I look today I used one of these
Revlon Colorstay quads this is in the
shade called enchanted and I just want
to say like Revlon eyeshadows aren't all
bad there are some brighter ones that
they've put out that show Revlon knows
what a good eye shadow is like there
have been some nice textures and nice
pigmentation and some this one was very
easy to work with it you don't work just
fine I'm not saying these are like a
favorite or one of the best things in
Revlon's line otherwise they would have
been in the top 5 but I know I really
critiqued the quality of the eye shadow
in products like this and I think their
overall better in these quads okay now
I'm really done I'll let you guys go bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
