continues today and we're focusing on
two-faced I noticed a lot of requests
for two-faced in my last video I think
it's a very appropriate brand for me to
feature here because I have tried nearly
everything into face line and I'm going
to be talking about things that are
currently available I'm not going to be
bringing discontinued products into the
mix just because it's kind of
frustrating you know when someone raves
on and on about something nobody can get
their hands on anymore so let's get
started top 5 best products number 5 I'm
going to go with the brow Envy kit I
have raved about this for years I think
it's a really strong brow kit because of
its universal appeal you know the shades
in here you're getting a couple of brow
powders plus wax and also like a creamy
highlight type product but both of the
shades in here blonde and brunette as
you can see I'm definitely a brunette
but I have hit pan on that blonde shade
they're both very cool toned and I've
loved combining them both in my brows
you know maybe using a lighter shade a
little bit more toward the inner part
deepening it up toward the outside
that's just what works for me what I'll
do is just use the little brush provided
I use everything in this kit and the
tweezers might be the only thing I
didn't love in this kit but you know you
can use your own tweezers there's a
little spoolie brush as well but I use
the angled brush I go into the wax and
just kind of you know get the brows
prepared to receive the powder and then
the powder really sticks in locks in and
wear as well all day even this highlight
I've had this for a long time this is
not dried out on me and it's matte so
that can be a really nice thing to you
know take right along the edge of your
brows when you're done and really
perfect that line you know or you could
use it as a base on the eye area around
your inner corner I actually think this
also might come with some stencils and
I've just taken them out so I can use
that mirror there but it's a really nice
all-encompassing brow palette if you're
unsure of shades if you're unsure of
like what textures work good and brows
powders are always I think pretty much a
no-brainer number for a blush that I
love from Too Faced line I just think
this is amazing I've talked about it
quite a few times before but it's the
sweethearts perfect flush blush and the
shade is called peach bee
and I think the packaging is absolutely
adorable and then you look at the
product inside and it's a stunning blush
it's really great three shades in one
you're going to have shimmer in all of
this product but I still think these two
colors here this is what I use as my
blush those two and it's kind of a soft
like neutral pink and then I use this as
the glowy highlight so that's what I've
done today you know I've got my blush
shades right here the highlight on top
of it the more I continue to use this
the more it reminds me of different
products I have from laura geller
because you can see in there it's kind
of domed up and I've used this product
so much but I swear it's not going
anywhere it doesn't appear that the
powder has worn down much at all my
number three product from Too Faced is a
pallet they have so many good pallets
this was really really hard for me to
figure out what I was going to put as
part of just a top 5 from the spring
because there are many pallets that I
love but something that they really
recently came out with is just top-notch
for my personal preferences at least not
everybody may love what's in this
palette but I absolutely do it's the
peanut butter and jelly palette brand
new thing that they've come out with
these colors are my jam
I have for a long time enjoyed the
pairing of peachy shades with plum and
here it's like you're getting that idea
but then with all these warm Browns that
pair so surprisingly beautifully
alongside this plum color you've got a
purple that's a little bit brighter I
will tell you if you want that to stand
out and reach its fullest potential put
a purple base like a cream shadow base
underneath that because it's a really
reflective type purple then you've got
your deeper plum over there and this is
really all based around the very popular
peanut butter shade from the semi-sweet
palette so they put that color in here
the one that's just straight-up called
peanut butter and then all these fun
things to pair with it I saw recently
Alexandria Garza did a beautiful
tutorial with this palette not using the
purples well I guess she popped the
purple on at the end to show you an
option that way but she incorporated
this bananas color and I hadn't used it
yet but I was like wow that's awesome
that looked really pretty on the lid
along with all the warm
Browns if you're more so a lover of cool
colors and cool Browns this may not be
your cup of tea but I absolutely adore
what they've done with this and it's
definitely a big deal
for it to jump into a top five and pass
up the other chocolate bar palette which
I think all have their strengths the
regular chocolate bar the semi-sweet the
bon bons palette I mean there are so
many great ballets my number two
two-faced product has got to be the
chocolate soleil medium matte bronzer I
have loved it for many years and it's
kind of rediscovered for me right now
because I feel like I've used a lot of
different bronzers over let's say the
past few months and I've more recently
been breaking this out for both the
contour I contoured with it today it's
just an ideal tone for me and I do like
how they've expanded the chocolate
Soleil range with the milk chocolate
which is lighter even cooler and then an
even deeper one as well but my personal
favorite for my skin is the medium /
deep matte bronzer is what it's called
smells amazing smells like chocolate
this smells great by the way - my number
one two-faced product is another eye
palette and it's the natural matte
they've had the natural eye which has
been around longer it's a beautiful
palette - and it's gone through a
packaging change and also a change of a
couple of the shades inside but more
recently they put out the natural matte
palette very well thought-out
assortment of colors in here because
you've got your most basic cool matte
row up top then you've got warmer Browns
to work with down here in the bottom and
then you know for me I love this kind of
rosy shade in here a grayish plum this
is actually a really unique color if you
like matte shadows this is one of the
best the textures are really awesome I
feel like for years two-faced was
getting and kind of making a name for
itself shadow wise with the sparkly
really shimmery highly frosty shades and
then you know different palettes that
they would put out I would note time and
time again how the matte shades were
really creamy and rich and nicely
textured easy to blend they practically
I feel silly saying this but they
practically blend themselves on the eye
like they're so easy to work with and so
I think it was great
they took advantage of that great
formula they had put it all into one
pallet natural mat is the perfect name
for it because these are all going to
give you a somewhat natural look your
deepest shade is not black you know if
you're uncomfortable wearing a lot of
you know black or really really dark
blackish brown shades this shade called
six preso is not that intimidating to
work with in my opinion now if you want
a matte palette that really takes you
there with the deepest darkest options I
also adore the Kat Von D shade + light
eye palette this I think is an equally
great eyeshadow formula just a little
softer take on the colors so for my look
today I've got heaven on the inner part
of my lid and under the brow I've got
strapless in the crease risque in the
outer corner and also just a little bit
of this honey butter shade like kind of
blended up just like a transition color
and then cashmere bunny is absolutely
great for a soft lower lash line like if
you want the softest definition on that
area but when you look up really closely
it's almost undetectable it's a really
sneaky lower lash line color but I love
using it there I know I said the peanut
butter and jelly you know that might not
be everyone's favorite thing because I
think the colors are very specialized
they really go into a certain Avenue
with those very warm Browns this is the
kind of thing I think nearly everyone
could pick up and find looks in here
that they love moving on to the bottom
five so the worst products in my opinion
from Too Faced number five would be this
no filter selfie powders palette I
thought this was a really kind of
gimmicky concept they're just very sheer
and slightly shimmery powders that you
can use to top off your different looks
this is sunrise this is totally toasted
this is Moon River they claim that it
would have the look of different filters
almost on top of your skin here's the
little examples of that I mean it's cute
it's kind of a fun idea but getting down
to just the practical way these look on
the skin I didn't think any of them had
enough of an effect of the three I think
the totally toasted color and does look
kind of pretty just lightly dusted all
over your face but still there are a lot
of sheer bronzers out there that would
be cheaper that could do what that does
when it first came out I think a lot of
people were in
sit in it but it's just it's not holding
my attention number two and I believe
this was in my worst products of 2015
video but the Too Faced melted metal
particularly the lighter shades in this
line they come off very frosty on the
lips they can make the lips look more
dry more packed with creases and all the
things you don't want to see on your
lips the regular melted line of liquid
lipsticks I think has a lot of gorgeous
shades there even a couple of pretty
colors in the deeper tones of the metal
collection but the lighter metal shades
and you got to be very careful with
because they can make your lips look
very aged even if they're not number
three and my bottom five would be the
Too Faced lip injection color balms
these are like a jumbo lip pencil type
format the shade I have here is called
bee sting and the issue with these is
all about the feel on the lips I don't
think a lip product should have to feel
uncomfortable to get the job done you
know what I'm saying these sting a
little bit they're a little bit numbing
I applied this just to kind of refresh
my memory earlier this morning and I was
just like oh my gosh you know it's not
worth it there are enough good lip
products high-end or drugstore they're
going to look gorgeous on your lips and
not give you an unpleasant experience at
the same time and I just I hate that
numbing feeling I can take a little
tingle like from the buxom lip glosses i
think those actually feel kind of
cooling with this it's just kind of
sting ii and a little bit painful number
two in my bottom five would be the
better than false lashes system this
really disappointed me I felt like I had
gorgeous lashes the first couple of
times I used this and basically it's a
regular mascara and then on this side
you've got the loose fibers and I think
just in my last video I was talking
about how Milani has come out with some
loose fibers like this that you can kind
of sandwich between your two coats of
regular mascara and I think what was
happening here and something you should
be aware of with any lash fiber that
you're adding on to the tips of your
lashes when you get some of that on your
regular mascara wand and then you go
dipping it back down into your tube and
closing it up you're slowly changing the
formula of the matte
Scarah and that's what was happening
here I think to make me dislike this the
more I used it because this was getting
more and more clumpy more and more
unnatural looking on the eyes if you're
really eager to try loose fibers on your
eyelashes you might go for a cheaper
option like the Milani you see what you
think of it but I think a big problem
with the concept is just the fact that
you're getting another mascara involved
with this and you're slowly changing up
the formula a number one least favorite
product from Too Faced would be this
three-way lash lining tool could never
really get the point of this product
it's like a little eyeliner fork I think
it's got the three itty bitty felt tip
points if you were to draw a line you
know you get three distinct tracks of
color there but I think the idea is that
you can get in really close to your
lashes and almost like dab it right in
there it within the lash line and to me
there might be some people who love this
concept but I'm just thinking you know
give me a regular pointed felt tip or
brush tip eyeliner and let's leave it at
that you know I don't need any changes I
feel like if it's a fine enough tip and
a flexible enough tip it will do the job
across the lash line and when I would
try to you know kind of trace it across
like a normal liner it was hard to get
the proper thickness of line that I was
looking for I don't want to seem to
crotchety as I sit here and say like
don't change the eyeliners keep them the
same it's just not a thing that I think
needs to be reinvented in the makeup
world
maybe something brands could focus more
on is how to keep these pen form
eyeliners more saturated and not drying
out as quickly and innovations in that
way but a nice fine flexible tip buta
brush tip or a felt tip is one of the
best things you can work with I think
that is my top 5 bottom 5 from Too Faced
I would have a couple of honorable
mention products things I really really
loved but it was hard it was hard to
narrow this down to a top 5 and I put it
on myself because I came up with this
video idea for myself but there have
been a couple of really nice nude lip
products that I've loved from Too Faced
this melted new
I think is a really nice kind of tan
type new little bit deeper at first I
was a little scared by this shade but
the more I wore it the more I realized
it really did suit my skin tone and
looks beautiful and then for a soft nude
lipstick the la creme lipstick in nude
beach this is a fabulous formula by the
way it's a very glossy like kind of lip
gloss and lipstick in one it's kind of
what it looks like on your lips because
it's so shiny and creamy very luxurious
feel and the shade nude beach I think is
an ideal nude shade with just that
little bit of pinky peach thing going on
in there and even more recently like
just now I got these in like a couple
days ago they've come out with the LeMat
collection and I am wearing the shade
called sorry not sorry and it's kind of
reminding me in depth as melted nude
maybe just a little more pink in the
color that's on my lips but these have
been very comfortable the few shades
I've tried so far have been great I will
most likely have more to come on these
and more to come on the peanut butter
and jelly palette but thank you guys so
much for watching these videos I'm glad
you enjoy them and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
