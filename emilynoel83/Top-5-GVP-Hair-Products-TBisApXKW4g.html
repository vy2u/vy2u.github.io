this video before I get into what my
video is actually about I wanted to make
a quick announcement about messages if
you click to send me a message and it
goes to my youtube inbox I've been
really really backed up ever since I had
those ten days without cable and
internet and most of that time was spent
without power at all when that huge
storm came through where I live and ever
since I've just been very backed up with
that and not only that but I don't feel
like the YouTube inbox system is really
working quite right it's not really
confirming for me when I send a message
or if I want to delete a message it's
not letting it's not like immediately
taking it away so it's like there's
getting more and more it also won't like
if I've read it and then I want to go
back and like if I read it somewhere
else and I want to go back and check
check on it before something before I
make the reply it doesn't show that I've
already read it it's just acting weird
in a lot of ways and I don't want that
to interfere with me getting back to you
guys on stuff so if you have sent a
message and you want that response back
I would say go ahead and send me an
email and from this point on if you want
you know my feedback or if you want me
to answer a question for you go ahead
and send it to my beauty broadcast email
that's Beauty broadcast at hotmail.com
I'll have it in the sidebar I also have
it in my contact information box on my
channel page it's gonna be a lot easier
for me to get back to you that way and I
think it will just I'll be able to get
through these messages faster and that
sort of thing if you do just want to
make a request I mean you can still send
me things to my inbox but you have the
best opportunity to get a response
basically if you send it to my email
address so thank you for bearing with me
on that and again feel free if you want
to resend those messages we can kind of
start fresh on that so anyway that being
said on this video you might have seen
some of the other ones I've done where I
have taken like my top 10 products and
shown them to you from different brands
like I've done wet and wild Megan
and I want to take sort of a less
typical brand for this because I've been
using this stuff so much and I just
thought I need to put that all out there
for people and the generic value
products brand from Sally Beauty Supply
also known as GBP and these are high-end
products that are it's just the generic
versions of products from like matrix
and John Frieda and she and a lot of
like really great brands I'm know maybe
not John Frieda I'm thinking of
something else
Paul Mitchell there's a lot of Paul
Mitchell products too but basically
they're making the very same items and
if you compare the ingredients list on
the back they will list the generic
value products ingredients and the
ingredients from the actual product it's
based off of and they always they match
up exactly I wanted to highlight five
things that I really like so I'll just
get started on that and again these are
all available at Sally Beauty Supply and
I believe on their website too but the
first one I want to talk about is the
volumizing root lifter it's from the
matrix amplify system and it's the it's
the root lifter it's designed to
increase the thickness and diameter of
the hair and I realize you're looking at
this thinking that's not too exciting on
the packaging and I realize that the
packaging is not that pretty but if
they're able to bump their prices down
so low using the same ingredients and
maybe if part of that is not too awesome
packaging I'm you know I'm still all for
this cost me about around $6 at Sally's
and another nice thing is that Sally's
will often have sales where maybe it's
buy one get one half off or two for ten
or some special deal on that so be on
the lookout for those opportunities as
well but basically I squirt this it has
this special little nozzle here where
you can kind of get right in at the
roots but I just prefer to put this on
my hands
I put it kind of just wherever I want
volume I put it right there you know on
my scalp and then I will tip my head
over blow-dry even if I hair isn't like
soaking wet it you know like when I get
up in the morning I shower at night
before bed and then I'll get up in the
morning put some of this on you know
kind of squirt it on work it in and blow
dry and I feel like it gives me a nice
amount of volume and this is a liquid
this isn't a gel or anything like that
this sprays out just like a liquid so
it's not heavy on your hair it's a
really easy way to volumize even if you
have fine hair like mine so nice the
matrix amplify volumizing system and
that's the root lifter and you'll see
more from the matrix amplify actually
I'll just go ahead and show it to you I
all said the matrix amplify shampoo and
conditioner and I've been using these
for a while and if anyone asks you know
what kind of shampoo to use this is it
I've been using it for a long time the
shampoo plants to generate volume with
each use and on the conditioner it says
provides weightless conditioning for
maximum volume and fix and thickness and
these would typically run you fifteen
dollars a piece for the actual brand but
they end up being around six dollars
each
I got it in a two for ten deal from
Sally's so the matrix amplified shampoo
and conditioner my hair has never been
so manageable when I've used these I've
used it through the winter time and now
we're kind of getting into the warmer
weather but in the winter I usually have
a lot of issues with my fine hair being
very staticky and fly away and I felt
like this just it did good things for my
hair in terms of the volume I was
getting out of it as I styled it but it
was very easy to manage I wasn't having
flyaway issues I was really enjoying how
that you know how it was to style and it
also created no buildup on my hair
whatsoever and you can tell you got you
guys with dark hair I know what I'm
talking about bite sometimes being able
to see a product building up in your
hair it's awful so this stuff definitely
gets really cleans your hair but it also
gives you that little something
extra and the conditioner smells
fabulous - they both smell good but the
conditioner is really really good -
another product from matrix is the gvp
version of the boom freezing hairspray
it's a maximum hold finishing hairspray
fast drying I've told you guys before
look for fast drying on hair spray
products if you're looking for to get
that volume maybe if you're teasing your
hair a little bit in the crown or
anything like that you know you want
something that's gonna dry quickly not
get kind of gunked-up and then weigh
your hair down this is this what it's
fast drying it doesn't weigh your hair
down as much and this stuff smells so
good it's in a really kind of tall
bottle and you may find these hair
sprays in a little different section of
the store then the shampoos and the
styling products but this cost is
probably around the same as the others
you know it's like five bucks and just a
fantastic hairspray it smells great does
not get your hair sticky at all you know
like the feeling if you've been using
your hands to kind of style your hair
and spray your hairspray on and then
your hand feel sticky afterwards your
hand will not feel sticky at all it's
like a magical thing but this hairspray
because you know you'll take your hand
away or you you know and you'll be like
well it's actually smooth and it's weird
so I really like using this I like using
it kind of as I put my if I use velcro
rollers I'll spray the hair before I put
it in the curling iron and they're all
spritz the roller after it's in there
this is great for that you may have
heard me mention the so gorgeous
volumizing hairspray that's good for
that as well but I did want to test this
out and I really like it and I like the
smell a little better than the so
gorgeous stuff but anyway last product
you might have heard other gurus or
other people talking about how great the
chief silk infusion is and it's just
sort of a a protein enriched serum I was
what I would call it that you can put on
your hair and it makes it more
manageable and silky and soft and I
found that I just realized not too long
ago that they sold this with the generic
value
products for this is about $8 here and
you get a large large amount and you
only use a teeny bit I only squirt out
like a tiny bit on my finger smooth it
all over my hair after I've blow-dried
it and before I start styling it and it
just you know if you just wanted to have
that straight hair kind of day I mean
you get a great shine off of it but it's
not over-the-top it's not that greasy
look just don't overuse the product but
it has a really nice scent to it that's
the thing I've been so impressed with
you think well I'm getting the generic
version what is probably not going to be
the same
maybe the scent but no the scent is
awesome on the stuff and if you match up
the ingredients you'll find that the
same fragrance it you know it matches up
from one product to the next with the
little codes and numbers and stuff so
anyway it's this directs you to rub a
small amount in palms and work evenly
through hair leave-in and style as usual
so it's one of those things again to
make your hair more manageable more soft
and silky and I think this would be a
great thing for anyone to have in their
hair product collection so thank you
guys so much for watching this little
compilation of a brand maybe some of you
have heard about it and use it already
for some of you maybe this is totally
new information but just be aware that
there are generics out there for some of
the really high-end brands for hair
products and in my opinion they work
wonderful so thanks so much for watching
guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
