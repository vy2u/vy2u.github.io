video I swear is not an attempt to like
beat myself up but more so just kind of
a look back at the things that I feel
like I've learned makeup-wise the appeal
of beauty and makeup is that it's always
evolved I feel like no matter what level
you're at you can always be learning
something new trying a new product
coming to a new conclusion about the way
you want to do things and it just it's
exciting one night before bed I was just
laying there thinking about how much
things have changed and how how things
were when I started learning about
makeup to begin with and how they are
now with you know access to YouTube and
blogs and all kinds of great information
so I wanted to give you my top 5 makeup
mistakes and of course there have been
many more I'm making mistakes on a daily
basis but these are some things that I
feel like I've noted over time that I've
done on more of a continuing basis they
don't really like talking about like
makeup do's and don'ts because I think
it's different for everyone what works
for someone doesn't work for somebody
else what looks good on someone you know
don't like makeup rules I don't like
putting yourself in a box but these are
just some things that I've noticed that
I've done and that you know I might do
differently as I look back but the first
thing is using too much foundation this
would be something I currently do that I
am trying to fix
um and it's just the tendency to glob
too much of the stuff on especially when
I'm trying a new foundation it's like my
gut instinct is to use a lot and I mean
it really does make a difference in the
appearance on your skin like if you've
used way more than you should've and
then you get a really up close look at
your face like wow that's way too
visible so a lot of times I learn and I
do scale it down and I realize what
works for a certain foundation but for
some reason I feel like I can get too
heavy-handed with that and more
heavy-handed than I need to be with my
skin I consider that to be something I'm
kind of a work in progress on number two
over plucked brows and you're probably
looking at my brows now thinking what I
thought you needed to pluck them more
but really back in the day back in some
time in high school I remembered seeing
a picture of Pamela Anderson and
thinking wow her brows are so thin and
my brows are so bushy like this was a
phase where I really wasn't doing much
with my brows I mean I had gotten rid of
the unibrow that I was dealing with
through most of elementary school but
beyond that like my brows were just
bushy brows that's what God gave me
I reached this kind of turning point
where I thought they needed to be like
super thin like draw line kind of thin
and so I did this at one point in high
school it may have lasted about a year
that I was keeping this up and I just
looking back at old pictures I just
think it does not look good it was
making me look older it really didn't
seem right on my face looking back and
obviously I don't have a problem with
them growing back in from that face I
mean I'm plucking my eyebrows every
single thing I think it's kind of good
to sometimes take some cues from what
your body what your skin naturally wants
to do and kind of go with that so that's
what I have been doing you know for
years and years now after I realized
that the super thin brows weren't maybe
my best look
number three complete lack of brush use
yes back in my early days of learning
makeup I think I started first using
makeup maybe in my late to near high
years like maybe a teeny bit seventh
eighth grade and then got more into it
in high school but I really I mean I
didn't have like a tutorial to turn on
or review to pop on from YouTube to see
like what I should really be doing so I
was just using you know sponge tip
applicator 'z became very comfortable
with those probably wasn't getting great
looks with them but I mean I was making
that work and just any little brush that
might come with something you know I was
making that do for me then one Christmas
like a pivotal change in my makeup life
happened and I'm pretty sure this was
sometime in high school maybe toward the
end of high school my family did this
big gift exchange where people bring a
gift and everybody takes turns like
picking one out of the pile
opening it up and then the next person
can either grab a new gift or steal a
gift from someone that's already been
open and you probably heard of how that
game goes but the gift I got was from my
cousin who sells Mary Kay and it was a
brush set
it was like five brushes in sort of a
Bret black and pink brush roll and I had
like never seen anything like it have
like wow it was a powder brush a blush
brush and three eye brushes and from
that point on like a switch flipped with
me and it wasn't just that using those
brushes was making my makeup look better
but it felt so much easier to do the job
so if I could like give a word of advice
to someone learning makest get a small
brush set that you can start working
with and there are so many affordable
options out there and it will like make
everything ten times easier and I dug up
this morning a few of the brushes that
were part of that set that I still have
I can't find the base ones but the eye
brushes that I used well into my early
days on YouTube where this Mary Kay flat
eyeshadow brush
there's the crease brush and there's an
angled liner brush and it used to have a
little eyebrow or lash comb at the end
of it and I just love these things and
you know there are some things you look
back on that you used to use and your
think oh how did I ever use that you
know that wasn't very good but I'm
looking at these brushes today thinking
yeah these are pretty good quality Thank
You Molly you have no idea what that
brush set did for me number four I
consider this a makeup mistake that I
made consistently and I would just call
this harsh lower liner and I can see
this back in my early videos and stuff
and basically when I would do lower
liner mentally I just thought of it
being done one way you take a liner and
you line and I apparently didn't think
there was much need for smudging out
doing anything with shadows you know I
would just take like a black eyeliner
probably the covergirl perfect point
plus and just make a non smudged out non
smoked outline on my lower lash line
plus in some of those early videos is
like the camera quality was so
and the lighting was so dim dark things
that I did seemed even darker so it just
you know it was not the best look and I
didn't need to be doing that much and so
now like if I line my waterline like I
have today you know it's just smudgy eye
shadow underneath or sometimes eyeshadow
is all I do on my lower lashline we do I
just go on my lash line and draw a line
of eyeliner but it was something I did
consistently for a good long while and
I'm glad I evolved a little bit from
there not saying people can't Rock some
fierce lower liner but that was just a
bit much for me and it happened all the
time as you can see some of these things
have been things I've done too much of
in some cases things I did not enough of
and for the longest time in my life like
I'm thinking all throughout high school
and college I never put mascara on my
lower lashes and it might seem like a
small thing but I was so concerned about
it transferring down and I probably did
do it at one point and had some bad
experiences with smudges everywhere that
I just really cut it from my makeup
routine and nowadays like I always put a
little something there because I feel
like it gives the eyes like so much more
balance you know just having a little
something there on the lower lashes you
know if especially if you're doing a big
upper lash and then there's nothing on
the lower lash I feel like it needs
something and I have discovered things
like Maybelline lash discovery that look
works really well on the lower lashes
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
is it has been a great one for me that I
could feel safe putting there years and
years it was just something I did not do
because I just didn't think there was a
product that could handle it so that's
what I identify as just five of the many
make up mistakes that I've made but
maybe you learn something from that
maybe you're relating to some of the
same things I've done I just thought
this would be fun to share and if you
make videos or do blogs and you'd like
to cover the same kind of topic I think
it'd be fun to watch too so thank you
for watching guys and I'll talk to you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
