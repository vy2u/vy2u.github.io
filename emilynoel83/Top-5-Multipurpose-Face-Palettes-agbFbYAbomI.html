me um so did we all survive the
collection video thank you so much of
you took time to watch that 20 plus
minutes extravaganza of all of my makeup
products but I really enjoyed reading
your comments and answering your
questions so thank you guys so much for
requesting that first off because that's
probably the most requested video ever
for me on my channel and thank you for
watching it and enjoying it um also one
little side note before I actually get
to the point of this video my eyes are
really bright right now I'm doing the
electric challenge five days of using
the electric palette from Urban Decay on
my eyes and I've been documenting these
different looks on my blog so if you
want to see what my daily looks have
been you can check them out there but
it's been fun it's been getting out of
my comfort zone which i think is good
and I'm really enjoying some of these
bright colors this look is actually
orange and purple so woohoo and today I
wanted to talk about something that I
feel like has been turning up in more
and more brands recently not just
high-end but also drugstore and it's
these kinds of palettes that basically
do some multitasking face things you
know it might be blush and highlight or
blush and bronzer or some kind of do or
trio compact type deal like this I've
got a lot of these kinds of products in
my collection so I thought I would just
kind of go through what I had and tell
you about the ones that I've really
enjoyed the motor out of the 5-hour
drugstore so some very affordable
options out there I also consider sleek
basically in the drugstore price range
as well although I do have to order
those things
the shipping if you want to order sleek
which it ships from London and you're in
the u.s. shipping for me was only like
$5 and I think it got here in about 5
days or so and everything was perfectly
intact so that leads me to my first
product the one that I'm wearing today
is from sleek and it's this face form
contouring and blush palette love that
it is so streamlined and it's just a
really great travel type thing too
because instead of taking a separate
bronzer and highlight and blush you've
really got it all there I have this in
light so there's
prynt shades you can get but this is a
matte contouring shade that works really
really well for me the highlight is kind
of shimmery so be aware of that both the
highlight and the blush have shimmer but
the highlight kind of reminds me of the
texture and the intensity of mary-lou
manizer but a little less of a golden
twist to this shades more like a
straight-up
champagne type shimmery color and then
your blush is this shimmery peach where
I use this blush the more I like it
sometimes I will even forgo the
highlight because this blush has some
glow in it but I think it's a great like
kind of light summery blush I also love
the sleek like the blush by 3s the pink
lemonade one it's got like two powder
blushes and a cream all blush so not
necessarily as multitasking as something
like this but if your yes bigger she's
back at it folks and now she has an easy
place to jump to up here what's that
baby girl okay what was I saying
um yeah if you've if you're placing a
sleek order thinking about it I have
really enjoyed the different blush
products I have a link to any sleek
related specific reviews that I've got
down below but I love this guy so sent
them from the drugstore I find at
Walmart among the flower beauty line and
it's the ReadySet glow blush bronzer duo
and I have a couple of these and one is
a lighter pink e'er blush this is a very
like rosy matte intense blush and also a
matte contouring bronzer type shade and
these are intense you know I was really
pleasantly surprised with the quality
and this is the lighter one but you can
see there's definitely some intensity to
those bronzers and the blushes tooten
say I've tried nearly everything in the
flower line but of the things that I've
used this has been probably one of the
things I've been most impressed by and
that I think is like really surpasses
its price tag in terms of quality and
pigmentation so that's a great one you
like creams and you're trying to work in
like a cream contour or a cream blush I
really really like my duo from ELF and
they have
and pounders as well really like the
powders but the creams I mean they're
matte creams there's no shimmer in these
and you can really easily use them with
your elf small stipple brush if you
don't have that get that it will make
your life so much easier for all things
creamy but it's a nice size compact nice
amount of product this is just three
dollars so I think if you prefer creams
over powders for blushes and bronzers
this would be a great thing to check out
but I do not love blending these in with
my fingers it can be done and some
people might prefer it that way but I
really really like using my small
stipple brush that looks like this I
think it just gives me the most even
application of stuff like this another
thing that I'm so glad elf has come out
with recently is the studio blush
palette if you haven't checked this out
yet this is the one in light love the
brightness of these colors they really
are saturated and nice blush shades and
if you've got the deeper one as well you
could kind of pop these out like they
can pop right out of the palette there
and you could mix and match your shades
but in this lighter one you've got like
a light pink a deeper rosy colors bright
coral here does have a little bit of
shimmer in it and then kind of a bronzey
golden a deep peach type color what is
all blush it may not seem quite as
multitasking as far as multiple kinds of
face products ago but I just think to
have that wardrobe of colors is very
handy in this really small palette and
last but not least I love this thing I
know I've talked about this before it's
from Too Faced it's the sweethearts
perfect flush blush and this Jada's
peach Beach and this was not love at
first sight for me when I first saw this
I thought okay is it just gonna be you
know a bunch of shimmer on the cheeks
it's not really going to show up I don't
know about this but this is totally a
great duo blush and highlight and it
looks so good
like I love the level of shimmer in this
is glowy but it's not too much for me
it's a very muted neutral type of blush
color but it really does show on my
cheeks so what I do is I would use these
two shades as my blush and then go into
this part as the highlights plus
I mean the packaging does look super
adorable if you're looking for a little
makeup splurge or maybe like a really
cute nice makeup gift for someone I love
this so I would say those are my top
five kind of multitasking face palettes
I'm seeing these from a lot of brands
now and so I thought it would be a good
time to tell you what my favorites are
so thank you so much for watching guys I
love you I appreciate you so much and
I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
