this video this video is purely a
request it was something that I thought
I could do kind of quickly because I'm
sort of in a hurry today I've got a lot
of things to do but I wanted to go ahead
and do it for you because I thought hey
this is very cut and dry and I totally
have the answer you know it wasn't
something I really had to think about a
whole lot and the question was what are
your favorite Nick's round lipsticks or
NYX however you want to say that brand
it's available at some drugstores if
you're like me you don't have it in your
drugstore and you have to order it off
of cherry culture calm but these are
very very affordably priced like only I
mean they used to be around 99 cents and
now I think they're a buck ninety-nine
so still very very affordable as far as
lipsticks go they're super creamy
they don't have an annoying scent to
them that I can detect I don't think so
no not really um and they just I mean
they're decently decently long wearing I
mean obviously if you put them through
too much they're gonna come off and
you're gonna need to reapply it's not
like one of those long long wearing
formulas but they aren't just great for
the color selection but it can also be
kind of intimidating especially if
you're ordering online like I've had to
I mean I definitely come up with some of
these that I wasn't a huge fan of not
that nobody would like them but I just
didn't like it for me maybe and
sometimes the swatches are kind of hard
to figure out as well so I wanted to
give you some swatches of that I have
done of these so you can see them see
what the colors actually look like and
so I will show you one of those and then
I will run through you know my thoughts
on that particular lipstick here's my
top five
all right this is Circe and this is and
it please excuse me if I'm butchering
some of these names and they kind of
have some exotic names for these and I
may be saying them wrong so we'll just
go with it but this is what it looks
like it's basically sort of like a lip
eraser type of shade you know like it
can totally be your skin tone like this
could be almost a concealer for me
really and it's it doesn't have shimmer
to it I mean it's just a creamy
consistency and since this was the one
that I thought might be the most
difficult for you to figure out how
that's gonna actually look on your lips
this is the one I have on right now so I
put that on and then whenever I use this
I feel like my lips look a little dull
if I only use this so I put this Revlon
Super Lustrous lip gloss in this is
called foiled this is what it is it's
like a nice I love this lip gloss by the
way it's a gorgeous like kind of pearly
golden a nude and just over the top of
that I think it makes the lipstick
really come to life and it's probably
one of my favorite ways to wear a nude
lip is with a little sparkle and a
little gloss over it so anyway that
makes it super wearable just any gloss
that you have really would be nice over
it I think and yeah if you just kind of
want to neutralize your lips and make
your eyes stand out more
circe is definitely a good bet for you
okay next we have Seto and this is a
absolute favorite of mine and it has
been from the start this color is so
gorgeous because it's kind of you know
it's like say you want to wear a neutral
color but you're not really comfortable
going with an all-out nude lip this
gives you just that little bit of like
kind of coppery warmth to it it's got
some little notes of red in there but
this is not a red lipstick I mean this
is kind of think bronzy you know there's
just those sorts of undertones to it and
so it's like bronzy golden neutral
really really pretty on I mean it
complements I think so many skin tones
and like I said it gives you a more
understated lip without being totally
nude so if you like that sort of idea I
think that Seto would be a good one for
you
all right we are edging our way into the
pinks and this one is probably one of
the lightest ones they have this is
harmonica and this is a super light pink
and it does have a little bit of a pearl
to it a little bit of a shimmer um
Seto did as well I don't know if I
remember to mention that but yeah this
is gonna come off a little bit pearly if
you wear it too thick it can be almost
too opaque for me so I like to put it on
lightly or dab it on my lips and kind of
just use my finger to spread it out a
little bit and thin it out and this is
another great one to top off with a lip
gloss any kind of pink lip gloss or
clear lip gloss and your going to get a
gorgeous light pinky nude kind of lip I
really really like the effect it has but
like I said you got to kind of know how
to use some of these shades and some of
them are great when paired with a lip
gloss
next is dull and dull was one of my
immediate favorites from this collection
what you're looking at here is a really
rosy pink it's not like the type of pink
that's like bubblegum bright hot pink
you know that's gonna totally you know
make people instantly look at your lips
and say oh my god she looks like a
Barbie doll but I mean this is just a
nice rosy tone that I think it's going
to be very universally flattering if you
would like to try something that is
gonna bring a little more attention to
your lips I know I've talked about
before like ways to perk up your makeup
you know you use a little bit brighter
color on your lips it will you know sort
of spice up and brighten up your entire
face and this is a good example of a
color to use especially if you're not a
huge fan of using straight-up red and
you know you the light colors aren't
really working for you too much if you
like something that's gonna give you
color but also give you just a really
really pretty pink finish and this is
one of those that's more just creamy it
doesn't have like a shimmery or metallic
finish to it but I love it so much it's
so pigmented the color can be very rich
and like I said you always have that
option of putting it on and then kind of
dabbing your finger over it sort of
smoothing it out and making the finish a
little more natural
all right next up is my favorite read
from NYX this is he be or heave a CBE
and this is a read but if you can see up
close there it's a more wearable read I
think because it has a little bit of
shimmer to it and it's got sort of some
gold any sparkles on there I mean this
is so pretty this is the read that I
will go to if I'm wearing a red outfit
you know red jacket for work or
something like that and I want red lips
this is it has lately been the one that
I am picking up first and now just to
compare it I do want to show you chaos
which is another read that they have but
it is more of a serious serious read
there's the two together this one has a
little bit more of that bluish undertone
that you hear about with red lipsticks
and this one has a little bit more of an
orange undertone but seriously this
really looks red I don't want you to
think when I say orange II undertone
like okay that's the kind of red that's
gonna make my teeth not look white
that's totally not it these are both
gonna come off very red it's just that I
find this one a little bit more natural
this one's great too chaos is is super
fun and you know I Kaos was like the one
I reached for on Halloween for sure but
this one I think is nice to pull off red
on it everyday kind of look and it also
something about it just it's taken down
a notch by having that little bit of
shimmer and not being that straight-up
creamy matte lips guys I hope you
enjoyed my pics from my favorites NYX
lip gloss my favorite NYX round
lipsticks again I'm not necessarily
saying you have to go out and buy all
these I'm never saying that when I give
you my favorites I'm just telling you
what my favorites are and you know if
you're maybe have been looking for
something similar if you've been looking
for that perfect kind of nude lipstick
or or this or that maybe you know this
will tip you off to something and seeing
it's how these are so affordable I think
that you can't really go wrong with
maybe testing out some of these colors
and seeing if you like them because
you're really not out a whole lot of
money if you don't so thank you guys so
much for tuning in for this video have a
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
