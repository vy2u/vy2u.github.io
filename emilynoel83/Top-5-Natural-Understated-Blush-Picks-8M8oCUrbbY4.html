me this video is a viewer request thank
you so much I have it down as mary-kate
in my phone who asked for this video I
had talked about in some other video I
had done how sometimes I really enjoy
those understated blushes typically what
happens is I see a lineup of blushes and
there's like a bright coral or a bright
pink and I'm like oh give me that one
you know like that's the one that really
catches my eye that I think is going to
be pretty on the cheeks but then there
are some more understated blushes they
might not capture your attention as much
at first or maybe they just don't look
that fabulous in the packaging but they
kind of surprise you once you put them
on your cheeks and they actually look
beautiful not just with one particular
look here there but usually a ton of
different looks because they're so
neutral blushes can be tricky that way
because more often than not you're going
to wear them very sheer doubt so they're
going to look probably quite a bit
different than they appear in the pan in
the actual product and like I said these
kinds of blushes they are so neutral and
easy to wear they can look good with
anything from a coral lip to a red lip a
hot pink lip or you can do like I do
today and be absolute dusty rose in
every sense of the word in every part of
your look I was just feeling like it
today the first one I want to mention
first blush and it's been around for a
while I've enjoyed it for quite some
time but it definitely wasn't a blush
where I just first laid eyes on it and
thought oh that's going to be gorgeous
I really didn't know until I started
using it and its benefits Dallas and
this is actually described as a dusty
sunset plum powder and honestly to look
at it in the compact you think I don't
know even in a swatch sure on my finger
you know it's neutral there's maybe a
hint of some pinky plummy tone and that
what's it going to look like on the
cheeks I am wearing it today I actually
contoured my cheekbones a little bit and
then I just kind of put this over and
slightly above the contour so probably
right here in this general zone I think
it looks really pretty in that area it's
a nice way to add a little dimension to
your blush this is the deepest one that
I'll be mentioning and it really just is
kind of hard to define but I can totally
see why they put plum in the description
because it's not like a classic dark
berry wine type plum by any means but it
just has that little bit of depth
that I think is very neutral very pretty
you can wear it just on its own as a
blush I mean I've worn it that way
plenty of times it's also nice it's a
little bit of an eye shadow today I wore
it a little bit up in here as I was
blending out the look I just really
liked it the other blush that I'm
wearing today that's giving me kind of a
glowy look I'm not wearing any highlight
it's just Dallas and then this and this
is sperm wet and wild it's one of the
new Fergie blushes and this particular
one is called brush with destiny and
it's definitely one you might lay your
eyes on and think is that going to do
anything I mean come on now when you see
it here up close you can see a little
bit of that sparkle but to me I'm so
skeptical of really light blushes that
have some shimmer I think is it just
going to turn out to look like a
highlight a soft kind of peachy shimmer
it actually does show up on the cheeks
and I think it gives a beautiful glow I
mean it really brought in some color
more than I was expecting so if you like
the really soft peachy blush is a little
bit of glow this doesn't necessarily
look like it would do much but it
definitely performed better on my cheeks
then it even looked in a swatch or
looked in the pan so now if you're
thinking I like that tone but not so
much the shimmer try the NYX blush in
soft-spoken another one that I look at
them like blue I don't know this isn't
really my bag of tricks I recently
talked about this one I actually talked
about eight different NYX HD blushes in
my review over on the Express channel
and this one really surprised me I think
it looks so beautiful on the cheeks I
think you kind of got to have the right
skin tone to pull this off would look
really beautiful on I think fair and
light skin light medium skin but it's
such an innocent light slightly peachy
look very fresh really appropriate for
spring now this was the blush that
inspired the whole video this is my
Milani blush in romantic rose I love
this blush this one I think you know
that whole rose design does look
beautiful but the other two blushes that
were part of this collection one was
like a brighter pink and one was a coral
and of the three this one might kind of
take a backseat because you're like is
it kind of just dull but I promise you
this is a soft rose shade it kind of
reminds me a little bit of the depth of
Dallas but
more on the pinkie side it's Matt it's
the kind of blush I feel like I could
wear with anything and then finally this
is one of those hidden gems of the
drugstore products that's been out in
stores like forever it's one of the
covergirl classic color blushes and the
shade is soft mink it's the kind that
has the mirror in it and this
rectangular shape beware it has a little
Noxzema set to it we're ducking
old-school covergirl here folks and this
is kind of a glowy blush it has a little
bit of shimmer it is coming off actually
I think the camera is pulling a little
bit more of a pink tone out of this but
this is very neutral that this is the
epitome of neutral shimmery dusty rose
here's a swatch of it right there just
to give you some comparison this is
Milan ease romantic Rose swatched right
there and see how there's a little more
warmth there's like a hair more of a
golden twist on this color but I still
find it to be very neutral and it's so
pretty on the cheeks not like sparkle
shimmer but it does have just that
little twist to it really can't catch
the light even - a highlight it can look
so good just on its own so those are my
five understated blush picks the blushes
that you might overlook especially if
you tend to grab for those bright pinks
and bright peach blushes again the
deepest why I mentioned benefit Dallas a
deeper kind of pink dusty rose with the
Milani
couple of softer peachy options one with
shimmer one without and then this really
great little bit warmer shade that would
look great on a tan that soft pink color
so thank you so much for taking time to
watch this video thank you again to Mary
Kate for requesting it and I will see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
