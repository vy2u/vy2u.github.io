with you today and bring you a video all
about some of the great holiday pallets
and gift sets that are out there this
time of year there are definitely a lot
of different pallets out there that are
available at all times of year that I
think are great things I talked about in
my perfect pallet tag for example but
this video is all focusing on those new
maybe limited edition things that have
come out this time of year I've got
several different categories that I'll
go through top pallets top lip sets top
gift sets and value sets so that's not
necessarily a palette but different
things just grouped together and then at
20 dollars and under category two and a
lot of this stuff I might have a review
on already so I'll make sure I link to
that information below if it's there if
I don't already have a review I'm
probably going to be doing one soon
start out with the top pallets those big
amazing holiday pallets that come out
and I think one of the best this season
is from Too Faced and it's the a few of
my favorite things collection I have
reviewed this this is a great palette I
mean it is jam-packed with a lot of
great shadows in kind of unique shape
you're wanting some interesting jewel
tone shades smokey eye with different
deep colors what I think makes this kit
unique is that I feel like these deep
shades don't just show up dark on your
eyes but the color does come through a
lot of neutrals in there as well
definitely some great cheek products
including Too Faced chocolate Soleil
bronzer which I totally love and I feel
like it's much more portable and travel
friendly than pallets Too Faced is put
out in years past you're also getting a
lip injection color bomb and the Too
Faced better than sex mascara so love
that new mascara that they've put out by
the way another big old palette that I
am so enjoying is the Smashbox wonder
vision mega palette this is a great
palette to give you a total spectrum of
color if that's what you're after that
all these triangle-shaped
eyeshadows and this is a fabulous
formula if you loved the Smashbox photo
op mega palettes of years past this is
that kind of soft velvety formula with a
variety of mattes and shimmers and I
think I said
my review on this is like the colors of
the rainbow a range of purples greens
and blues warm tones neutrals a lot of
these neutrals up here are met so that
makes them great blending shades and
great basics a row of smoky shades that
we all know to be over it looked are the
cheap products here which includes a
matte bronzer two matte blushes and a
blush that has a little shimmer as well
these are great plus there are little
cards that are actually transparent and
you can lay them over any four shades
and it will tell you exactly how to
craft those shades together to get a
certain day this is brand freaking new
and I love it I have just kind of gotten
on the tip of the iceberg of using this
one but I really really enjoy it it's
from it cosmetics and it's their
naturally pretty palette and this is
called actually the matte luxe
transforming eyeshadow palette so it is
filled with a bunch of matte eyeshadows
everybody who's saying hey the sparkles
not for me this gives you tons of matte
options my gosh some of these shades
like this shade called soulful and all
heart I mean those colors are kind of
like moths and lilacs that just blend
beautifully on your eyes these are not
dry kind of cakey looking matte shadows
but they really just mesh right in with
your skin and look gorgeous so I'm
wearing several of those shades today I
wore the violet I went down to this
shade called iconic and then in the
blending part of it which I really think
works well I went to the soulful shade
it's just like the lightest rose color I
think it's beautiful now there is a
shade called transforming pearl I'm
gonna do more on this palette by the way
more of a review but the thought is that
you can take that pearl shade and put it
over any of the mattes to make them
shimmery honestly I don't love using
that shade that much I like just using
the palette as is as maths because I
feel like when you put the pearl over
the top of one of these it just waters
down the color payoff a little bit I
mean it will give it a little more glowy
look but it's not like say a pigmented
rich shimmery or metallic shade that you
might be accustomed to from another
palette so the way I like using this if
I you do use it I will just dab my brush
right into it and apply it around my
inner
corner or take a little bit on my finger
and this is how I get the best payoff
out of this shade and just dab it like
right on top of the center of my lid for
a little bit of pop there but really I
think you're gonna be so happy with all
these matte colors you're almost gonna
forget that one's there I feel like this
is such a safe gift to give someone
because anybody who you give this to
it's gonna get a lot of use out of it
finally four pallets on something that's
more cheek focus more face color and I
really thought my tart off-the-cuff
palette was my favorite and I do love
that I think it's fabulous quality but
once I got the NARS guide board and
palette it's just got everything like
you can take this for travel and you've
got not only your bronzer in for blushes
but also the highlight and that was
really the one thing that I wanted it
kind of thrown into the Tarte
off-the-cuff palette was a little
highlight so you could really have all
your cheek colors all in one thing these
blushes are so beautiful saturated I'm
not very experienced with the NARS line
but I think this is such a great kit it
is pricey I mean this is gonna be a
really deluxe gift to give someone I
blush I'm actually wearing a little bit
of this pink shade and I love the soft
glow that that gives off while being a
matte shade and of course the highlight
in the bronzer now for the lip kits so
kits that only include lip products I
have been using these I've kind of put
them back in the packaging because I
wanted you to see how it would look if
you give it as a gift I really really
love the Tarte pure delights lip
surgence said this is a set of half lip
tints and half matte lip tints so you're
getting such a variety of finishes in
here you're getting some really full
color matte shades that really remind me
more of a traditional lipstick except
they're not drying at all and then the
lip tints of course are slightly more
sheer in some cases definitely more
shiny if you're like me and you've got a
ton of lip products you know you're not
using that stuff up very often so lip
sampler kits around the holidays are so
fun to stock up on because you get so
many new shades to try but not a lot of
each color I wish maybe there were a few
really deep and dark shades but as a
whole this is a very
arrabal kit and i think anybody you get
this too will feel like they can pull
off any of these colors now if you're
saying I am a lipstick girl I'm not
messing around with any of that sheer
stuff or any lip glosses the bite
luminous cream lipstick set is so cool
what you're getting in here are four
different double ended mini lipsticks
and the bite lipsticks are amazing
quality I got like a little bitty one to
try in a kit not too long ago and I was
like oh yeah I need to be getting some
more of this stuff so I have been so
enjoying these different colors you've
got nudes duck bear you got a gorgeous
like kind of purply deep fall type berry
called mulberry again this is a sampler
type set so you're not getting tons of
each product but you are getting a
really great formula to try out and a
lot of different fun shades in that
formula all you care about is that deep
vampy amazing fall and winter lip to get
you through the rest of the season the
Mac stroke of midnight lip kit in violet
is so so pretty I use this in my get
ready with me video recently comes in
this cute little clutch which I totally
plan to use like if I'm going out on the
town I love the white the gold the black
it's very Gatsby to me I just love it
and in this kit you're getting a
gorgeous berry lip liner in vino nice
nice deep color you're getting the
lipstick in dark deed which i think is
also just stunning and it can be worn in
different ways you can put it on really
full color or you can wear it more sheer
just apply it to your lips and dab over
it with your finger or blot it off a
little bit and you get a lighter look so
that's just a great lipstick to have and
then they give you the cream Sheen glass
in art of seduction and this is a
lighter shade as you can you can layer
this over the top of your berry stuff to
give more shine or in its own right this
is a nice just kind of sheer shiny gloss
bag has you've been cute on the inside
so you get those three products in it I
think if you're just really after one
new awesome lip look this is it let's
talk gift sets the kind of groupings of
products that aren't necessary
in Pallet forum but just some different
products put together a lot of these
things come out this time of year it's
an awesome value to buy something like
this as opposed to buying all these
things individually for sure and if you
really want to load somebody up this
holiday season get them the tart bow and
go I thought that he reviewed this kit
this is great you're getting actually a
16 color eye palette in here - lights
camera lashes mascaras you're getting a
couple of jumbo smolder eyes pencils
four of the tarte lipsurgence lip colors
in the lip cream formula i think this is
one of tarts best quality eye palettes I
really enjoy the colors lots of mattes
in there if that's what you're after and
this is just a fabulous grouping of
products and this wasn't a special value
but this is still available you can
still get your hands on it if you want
it obviously give this all together it
comes with a gold bow as well or you
could just give each of these things
individually and/or really split them up
and like Papa lipsurgence and everybody
stocking I don't know but you cannot
miss with this not if you have like a
makeup beginner on your list or just
someone you're not really sure what
direction to go but you want to give
them a beauty gift the bare minerals all
the fav set this is great and this is a
little lower cost than some of the other
gift sets that I've talked about $36 but
you're getting a lot of really cool
basic products in here I love the ready
formula of the blush and the blush shade
is called the one it's a gorgeous rosy
blush and then an eyeshadow duo in the
epiphanies are smaller than full-size
but yet you're still getting a lot in
there you're getting a couple of primers
one for face one for eyes the mineral
veil you can't miss with that is an
awesome finishing powder lash domination
mascara marvelous Moxie lip gloss and
lipstick so these are all things that
are part of the regular bareMinerals
line so if somebody tries one of these
things and falls in love with it it's
not limited edition so they can go and
buy you know a full size of one of these
items later on continuing with the
thought of kits you can't go wrong with
Mally has a never color shadow stick by
be set and you guys have kept up with my
videos you know this is one of my
absolute favorite products from Ali's
line these are the perfect cream shadow
stick
getting five of them the shades are
beautiful at first I laid off of buying
this because I was like I've got a
drawer full of the shadow sticks you
know I these are probably shades I
already have but no these are new shades
these are shades I didn't already have
in my collection there's a gorgeous rosy
taupe shade called firework that's great
around your inner corner a deep plum a
cobalt and topaz they are just stunning
colors the best part about these is that
when you put them on they go nowhere
like you have a little time to smudge
them out but then they are there for
good they're a great base for an
eyeshadow or they can totally be worn
alone twist up so you don't have to
sharpen them but they're the perfect
size if you want to get in there under
your eye for smudgy liner and they're
just my ideal cream shadow stick and the
money you're saving by getting five of
them in this kit as opposed to buying a
bunch of these individually is just
outstanding so they're cutely packaged -
here in this little box I got some great
recommendations for $20 and under and
just so you know this isn't the end of
the holiday gift stuff if you're looking
for more affordable stuff I usually do a
stocking stuffer video which is less
like pre put together gift sets and more
of like little creative idea and also if
you want me to this year I could do the
little drugstore makeup gift bag where I
give you some great ideas of products
you could by yourself and group together
your own little makeup gift bag for
someone that's always fun - for now for
this video five dollar gift that I think
is really nice quality and it's from ELF
it's the beauty book I found this at
Walgreens it's the 10 piece nude eyes
eyeshadow palette and this I vlogged
about it but these impressed me so much
the quality of both the matte shades and
the shimmery shades are just great now
there are a couple in here that are a
little bit flake City on I showed in my
blog the difference between these
applied with or without primer for a lot
of the shades they're so nicely
pigmented it doesn't like seem to make
much of a difference appearance wise but
for a couple of these it makes all the
difference really nice basic assortment
of colors plus some fun holiday shades
you know your emerald green your goal so
for just under $20 it's $19 and it's
from Tarte and it's called the
thoughtful treasures set here
and I've been using this and I actually
popped out the lip product because I'm
wearing that today you hear you're
getting the mini maracuja L which I'm
experimenting with several different
facial oils so more on that to come but
I do like the maracuja all you getting
one of the Amazonian clay 12-hour
blushes and the shade is thankful and
then one of these guys which I had never
tried this until I got this kit but it's
the tarte energy lip surgeon looks clear
kind of reminds me of the it cosmetics
Janousek wash a with this one you put it
on you if you just put on a little bit
like I have today you end up with this
light pink flush to your lips and it
feels so soft and moisturizing but if
you add more you will get more of a
bright pink look mmm it just totally
feels like a lip balm but you've got the
most natural flush to your lips when you
wear it I think that's so cool blush is
gorgeous by the way it reminds me a lot
of the limited edition blush and magic
that came out last year in a little
blush set only slightly less coral a
little bit more on the pink side it
looks great coordinated with this lip
product so right at $20 this could have
gone in the lip category but I decided
to put it here because of its price and
the laura geller
sugar and spice lip glosses this is a
great sampling of colors each shade is
totally different from the next there's
a coral a deep berry a pink a nude
they're all gorgeous on the texture is
not sticky at all even if you're buying
for someone and you're like I'm not sure
if they like lip gloss or not these are
comfortable to wear and the colors are
full-on beautiful also I don't have it
guys but I stumbled across this on
Sephora's website and it is a little
twenty dollar mini lip tars set and let
me tell you when you use an OCC lip tar
you don't need much of that product so a
mini I think could totally do you for a
really long time you get I think it's
four different colors and these are the
kinds of things you can mix you can
create your own custom colors I've come
up with my own little compact that I
will use to mix these on from an old
Physicians Formula I pal they're really
fun if you've got someone on your list
that loves love's lip products that
would be a great little thing to
that's it everybody those are the
holiday gifts that I love I know it seem
like I mentioned a lot of stuff but hey
everybody's got different needs
different preferences you're buying for
different people maybe you want a lot of
different things so I hope that gets you
started with some ideas thank you so
much for watching again I'll link to
extra info that I may have on any of
those products below and have a great
day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
