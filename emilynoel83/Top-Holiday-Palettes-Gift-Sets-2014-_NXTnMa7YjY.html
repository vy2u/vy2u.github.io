holiday pallets and gift sets in this
video I know I've talked about a lot of
them in hauls here and there I've
reviewed a lot of them individually
either on my blog or over on the Express
channel but this video I just wanted to
devote to the things that are my
favorite I do plan to put together a
little bit of a like drugstore stocking
stuffers or drugstore gifts video to
everything that I will be mentioning in
this video is in stock at the time I'm
shooting this and there are some other
things for example a couple of great lip
kits from vite the high pigment lip
pencils and the mix and mingle set that
i love but they are gone you find those
under your Christmas tree waiting for
you consider yourself lucky because
those are awesome
also the lorac Pro mega palette might be
something I would have mentioned in this
video had it been in stock I've got 5
things just like a top 5 of things I
would totally recommend gifts that I
love then I've got three that I want to
mention that would be good things to
either give is a big gift to someone or
they're gifts that really lend
themselves to being like broken up and
would be great stocking stuffers or just
smaller gifts than just a couple of
things I want to shout out too that
would be good gifts any time of year non
limited edition just great things a
couple of things I happen to be giving
as well so to start out number one and
this might be my most favorite item of
this holiday season and it is the
Sephora favorites
give me more lip lip sampler now I feel
like I need to preface this with the
fact that I think you kind of need to be
a lip product addict to really
appreciate what's going on in this set I
know I had posted a picture on Instagram
when I reviewed this on my blog by the
way all of these 17 lip products are on
my lips on that blog post but I posted a
little like collage of all the lips
together on Instagram I noticed a couple
people saying oh well you know looks
like there's a lot of reds or some of
those look similar and yeah there are
there are different color families in
here you've got pinks berries Reds and
news the thing about it
you might have multiple Reds but it's
like this one's a little darker and
there's someone's a different texture or
this one's really warm and tomatoey you
know it's like if you tend to have a ton
of lip products and you justify having
them because this one's just a hair
different it's a little lighter and it's
got a little shimmer if you're that kind
of person you will love this kit because
you will really appreciate all the
different textures you've got like lip
stain type products there's a gorgeous
thing in here from hourglass that's so
unique to me it's like a really opaque
full colored stain there's tinted lip
balms like this one from fresh you've
got an OCC matte really dark lip tar
that's interesting I'm a makeup for ever
lip liner a Too Faced melted a bite
lipstick in Palomino one of my favorite
shade this is $59 if you're considering
this I would say please visit my blog
because I will show all of these on the
lips describe their differences talk
about what I really like best about the
kid another outstanding outstanding gift
that just really took me by surprise I
love it so much it's a smaller thing
it's only 25 bucks
it's from Becca and I talked about
loving this and I think was my last haul
video it's the portable shimmering skin
perfectors you get three of them you've
got opal pearl and champagne glow I'm
wearing the champagne glow right now
that seems to be the one that I'm like
gravitating toward the most and I just
love topping them off on my cheeks like
when I finish my makeup look it just
gives that little extra glow I know some
people have told me they love taking a
little bit of these and mixing them in
with a foundation or moisturizer there's
a wand applicator so these are about the
size of like a Mac lipgloss or something
and I just like dabbing a little on my
hand I take my ELF small stipple brush
get a little bit of the product on there
and just dab it right on the cheeks the
application is so easy I like that these
are glowy but they're not glittery they
just give the most beautiful finished
look to the face so if I were gonna give
these to somebody I would say okay
here's your skin perfectors and also
throw in the elf small stipple brush I
mean just pick it up it's three bucks at
Target or three bucks on elfs website
your friends will thank you later I mean
this is just a great little tool for
cream blushes
cream anything but it really works well
with these next thing that I would
consider to be a pretty major gift the
more I've been using it the more I loved
it I loved every part of it and it is
the Smashbox masterclass 3 this is the
color and contour set it's a really
heavy duty pallet type thing that kind
of opens up like a book you take this
little elastic band off I know I showed
this in the last haul but some get the
look type cards right there two pallets
essentially and then you've got also a
little folder back here with some face
charts in it but back to these pallets
and they each have lift up plastic
shields on there which i think is great
but a bunch of neutral eyeshadows a
bunch of colorful eyeshadows and face
products down here I really really love
what they've included in terms of the
blushes and also the contour stuff
you've got a really cool perfect matte
contour a matte bronze a kind of matte
satin finish highlight Willy reminds me
of my laura geller baked french vanilla
highlight but I swear by and love got
blushes in carnation flush and rosy
today I am wearing all of the contour
stuff and also the blush in blush which
is a really pretty like kind of peachy
nude shade and then the quality of the
shadows is really just amazing it's the
photo-op formula you've got a lot of
perfect basic maths mixed in here some
gorgeous shimmers in terms of the golden
e bronze the topes in here are stunning
over on the colorful side though we're
talking about really pure colors pure
pinks purples blues and greens you enjoy
like those really vivid pure colors
these are pigmented as all get-out you
will love these I was thinking about
what to talk about in this video you
know I've got tons of things that I've
tried and I thought do I really want to
mention another Smashbox thing but truly
I really love this palette and this is
the on the rocks luxe palette filled
with the photo op eyeshadow formula this
masterclass palette is technically not a
holiday release that's been around for a
little while this is one of those new
things that they've put out for the
holiday a gorgeous array
of just eyeshadows if you don't really
care about the face products and your
taste and eyeshadows is maybe a little
more muted than what was in this palette
this is more of a pop of color type
palette you know what I mean you've got
that pretty pink this light green
sapphire blue but as opposed to having
likes a bright purples you're getting
plums and lilacs you're getting a really
good selection of browns and creamy
neutrals there are quite a few mattes
mixed into this color palette texture of
these shadows whether it's a matte a
shimmer one with a little bit of sparkle
it's absolutely amazing if you just want
to give someone the gift of really great
eyeshadows in a gorgeous palette you've
got a massive mirror here and then I
love how the palette is just like a
little bit squishing here really shiny
and gorgeous so I was going to name five
things here at the start that we're just
like my top five gift picks the fifth
thing is another lip kit a little bit
smaller one and it's from Estee Lauder
and it contains four of the mini pure
color Envy sculpting lipsticks cute
little navy bag here by the way this
might be my new little light travel lip
bag but it comes with the most adorable
little baby sized pure color envy
sculpting lipstick this is what the big
size looks like so they are quite small
but the colors are so so good I've
really fallen in love with these shades
but the most impressive thing about this
lipstick formula is that it's a creamy
lipstick it does have some shine on your
lips we're talking I think more shine
than a bite lipstick but the staying
power on these it's like what's going on
with these products because they last so
well it's not that they're one of those
like super drying feels uncomfortable on
your lips but last forever type of
product it just stayed really well they
totally stay within my lip line without
drifting out but I actually took a
picture the other day this was two
o'clock in the afternoon I'm just eating
salads is one of the Messier things for
me to eat around my lips and the product
still looks fresh I had it on since like
eight o'clock that morning I can't get
over how they
maintain shine because that seems to be
the thing that even if I've got other
products that technically we're a long
time like I can still see them on my
lips the thing that they lose over time
is the shine these seem to stay somewhat
moist on the lips and a little bit shiny
even after hours and hours colors are
gorgeous and you'll totally be able to
see that but it's the formula that I
really feel the need to get my point
across about because it's harder to
express that through video but the shade
you're getting are desirable this is a
gorgeous nude that I'm wearing now if
you took my recommendation earlier in
the year when I was talking about the
shade called impulsive that's what I
have the full size of impulsive is a
little more pink so this is gonna be
more of a classic nude I think it's a
gorgeous that's all I have on my lips
right now very opaque for a nude
lipstick you've also got dynamic that's
what I had on in the picture I showed
you and this is kind of like a classic
rosy color that would really look good
on anyone kind of a warm pinkish shall
get ready these are like the Rockstar
super pretty bright fun shades that even
if you don't have these already in your
collection a mini sized and in this
formula would be a great way to try them
and this is envious this is the
beautiful beautiful red and also if
you're a berry lover tumultuous pink
pretty bright
pinky berry shade totally my kind of lip
product these are all just so beautiful
and I know they're many you know they're
little they come actually in a pretty
little box but you also have this pouch
that comes with them as well like I said
at the start three things I want to
mention that would be great and split
them up type kits you could give them to
all together as a great big kit one is
the big tart kit that was the QVC
today's special value have a full review
on the Express channel since this is not
any longer the today's special value day
the price did pick up a little bit on
this but it's three boxes all filled
with wonderful tart makeup goodness
something I really love is that instead
of giving one giant eye palette they
split it up into two which I think are a
little more portable one's a little more
like pinky berry one has some more
classic like brownish neutrals consum
really pretty looks with those not
nearly as hit and miss
some of the tart palates have been that
I've tried in the past another box gives
you three eyeliners granted they are not
skinny smolder eyes I wish they were
they're still totally usable but they're
not on par with the skinny smolder eyes
just think you should know that but two
full-size lights camera lashes mascaras
are in here and then in the final box
two full-sized Amazonian clay blushes a
lip surgence lip gloss and two full size
lip surgence lip creams basically I
think this kid is a great value because
there's tons of full-size stuff going on
and you could like give somebody one eye
palette one lip thing and a cheat and
really split it up however you want to
isn't it cute if you did give it all
together that's how it would come next
thing and this gift wins the packaging
award by a landslide
it's the two face of labelled carousel
set again full review of the Express
gentle but this is gorgeousness this is
composed of three different eyeshadow
palettes two blush bronzer palettes and
a better than sex mascara in here see
how they come out there's two in front
on the back I think that's so adorable
magnetic closures on each one here's an
example of the eye palette so you've got
one that's got kind of a peachy shade
and a smoky charcoal plum another quad
is bronzy brown there's also a beautiful
golden there's one might be a favorite
because I love the tin soldier shade
that's a really really great silver and
Christmas tree is a great holiday
emerald green blush palettes are the
ones that actually say labelled carousel
on the outside and I really really enjoy
these one includes the chocolate Soleil
bronzer and a pinky blush and then the
other has sun bunny dark which I
surprisingly enjoy as a contour and
luminous peach but they all come out and
can go right back in if you want them
too just for display purposes you know
but I just think this is the sweetest
little set the other unsplit them up
type gift that I want to recommend
really like swooped in at the end I'm
like oh my gosh this is such good
quality not that I was super surprised
because it is lorac but these are so
stinkin cute and I got this at Ulta it
was 30-some dollars and it's a set of
four little palettes they come all
together in one big thing so you could
gift them like
or couldn't you just see popping these
in like four different stockings they
are velvety covered little shadow quads
open up like that they've all got their
own mirror and then for pretty
generously sized shadows I'm wearing the
greenish palette today it's green on the
outside but it's called countess and
it's got this pearly white this is a
really pretty rosy shade a shimmery
Brown and a matte teal got that teal
kind of smoked out in the outer corner
this on the lid this in the crease this
in the inner corner and highlight really
just love that shade selection I like
the sort of surprising twist with the
matte teal queen gorgeous for those who
love the burgundy shades this also has a
light pink and a matte light this is the
one called princess so your bronzy
neutral this gold stop it look how
beautiful that is
and then Dutchess is gonna be your smoky
really cool smoky type Palace one has a
dark navy blue the mattes are really
stunning in all of these I mean not that
the shimmers aren't but if you like a
good rich dark matte eyeshadow they all
have them except for the princess
palette I just think those are adorably
packaged just a really giftee type thing
only I want to mention a couple of
things that I think could be great gifts
any time of year there's shadow palettes
they're not limited-edition
they're amazing quality I think
sometimes we get so caught up in the
amazing limited-edition holiday stuff
that comes out every year we forget
about those things that have been around
and that are really great so two things
that I really want to mention I'm
gifting I know the lorac Pro palette
does someone on my list but lorac pro
the original I think it's unbeatable in
terms of basic eyeshadow selection row
of mattes row of shimmer I've used this
palette a lot but you wouldn't really
know it because the shadows aren't
really used up because it takes so
little of each one when you're using
them and then how can we forget about
the lorac unzipped palette I mean this
is beautiful for the person who loves
the rose gold the bronze II shades love
that whole palette and while these kind
of take a backseat during holiday
palette time they are really really
great gift so that is all everyone thank
you so much for watching I hope
gave you some great gift ideas if you're
doing your shopping this weekend or
throughout the rest of the season thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
