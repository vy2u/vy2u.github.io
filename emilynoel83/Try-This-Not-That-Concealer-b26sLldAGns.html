new series on my channel it's called try
this not that and I got this idea
actually just today on the newscast we
do a segment called to eat this not that
maybe you've heard it they eat this not
that books and anyway we do like healthy
foods versus not healthy food and it was
like a light bulb just went off in my
head and I was like make up do this with
make up take different categories you
know like concealers or lip gloss or
powder or eyeliner or whatever it might
be and then kind of go through some
different elements of it showing a
product that really worked and a product
that didn't work so well and you know
obviously this is just gonna be my
experience with these things you may
love some of the notthat's and if you do
you know good for you but I am just kind
of sharing my perspective first ones
gonna be on concealers and please let me
know what you want to see future ones on
just any makeup product category let me
know and then I can kind of like create
these little subcategories you'll see
how this one goes and give the try this
and the not that's not I'm going to talk
about stick concealers I feel like you
see a lot of these in the drugstore but
not all are created equal one that I
really like is from Revlon and it's the
photo-ready concealer and this is a
little bit newer one hasn't been out for
that long but the stick just twists up
like that and I feel like it goes on
much more smoothly than most stick
concealers that can feel kind of heavy
and thick and this one I feel like you
know it goes on real easy it has nice
coverage and it can really be blended
out very effectively and I think this
can be good for concealing maybe some
discoloration on your face if you've got
spots age spots sun spots anything like
that it can be good it can even work
well and on the under eye area too so
that's the try this for the not that
sorry wet and wild but it's the cover
all stick it feels really heavy as it
goes on I feel like the dryness in this
product makes it cling to little wrinkly
areas and fine lines so I feel like this
is really sort of an outdated concealer
product from the drugstore how about
those concealers that really claim to
just cover
everything on your face and really view
everything one that I am so super
impressed with and I know I featured
this in a recent video but it's the
Dalton conceal it concealer and this is
a QVC product it's one in which you're
getting a sponge there's a little extra
cap here and then you're getting tons of
product for a concealer you're getting
about you know a full compacts worth of
concealer here and a little bit goes a
long way but I love the fact that it's
not thick heavy concealer it manages to
be sort of thin feeling but yet it
totally covered
I've got sunspots on my face here and
here under eye area this takes care of
everything so collect kind of all
purpose all over the face concealer this
is gray on one that did not work for me
so well was the mac studio finish
concealer and I mean I know I've heard
people say good things about this but I
just feel like in comparison to the
Dalton one this one I feel like is so
much more rich in its texture and feel
and this one actually felt almost a
little bit dry and a lot heavier
actually on the skin so I feel like if
you can get the coverage you need with a
more lightweight product by all means go
for that about those concealers that
claim to like highlight and brighten I
feel like those are a huge trend right
now and one that I've tried that I've
liked a lot and particularly for the
under eye area I think that's where you
consider using this kind of concealer a
lot but it's the Neutrogena Healthy Skin
brightening eye Perfector a really nice
product here it's gonna be one that you
click out through the bottom here it's
gonna come out through a little brush
tip and I find this to be very
brightening I find the color to really
work well with my skin I have it in
light and it also manages to conceal
while it brightens and we're not talking
brightening with shimmer but you're
gonna use these in a shade that's a
little bit lighter than your skin tones
so you can get the highlighting effect
so you could also use this you know down
the bridge of your nose your brow bone
different areas on your face where you
just want it to look brighter so that's
a great thing then not that is this
two-in-one concealer and highlighter
called match perfection from Rimmel I
have this in light as well and I found
that
shade to be a little bit almost have a
slightly gray cast on the skin a little
bit ashy I guess it also you squeeze the
tube and it comes out through the tip
there and I feel like the consistency of
the product was nice but the shade was
just kind of off for me and it didn't do
the brightening that I hoped it would if
you like a concealer palette that gives
you some different colored concealers
there's a really great value out there
from a brand called essence and it's the
forget it three-in-one concealer I think
I use this in my 20 dollar makeup
challenge because this gave me what I
needed it gave me a few different shades
to work with here you've got is all over
kind of skin tone concealer that can
really help blend out you know blemishes
or uneven skin tone or anything like
that like a little foundation substitute
then you've got a pink one that can help
with brightening and also help
counteract some bluish tone circles you
might have under your eye you also have
a green one here that can guard against
redness I don't find myself using that
one all that much but it's there for
anyone who does want it but like I said
great three-in-one product and a great
price then not that for this is the hard
candy nobody's perfect concealer palette
unfortunately this is not a perfect
concealer palette either um I found
these concealers to actually be really
thin and greasy um they have just a feel
to them like it can blend to nothing
that's on your skin and almost look like
you didn't put anything there and so
while I like lightweight concealers I
don't like him to feel greasy and I
don't like him to you know be like a
disappearing act on your skin you want
them to cover and do something
you're bouncing really dark blue toned
under-eye circles the best thing to
counteract that is a concealer that has
sort of a peachy or salmon tone to it
and a couple of the best that I've tried
and I know I've talked about these
before other Bobbi Brown corrector in
bisque and also I like the benefit array
space I have mine in number two medium
and they both have this kind of a look
to them it's sort of a peachy more
peachy toned concealer than the average
skin tone one both are very creamy and
it only takes a little bit that's
another tip that I want to stress with
conceal start small see if the first
little bit takes care of it and then if
you need to add more add more but don't
start with a whole another tip for
application I love brushes like this
from the sigmax collection one is the
flat angle brush it's the p88 this is
newer for me and I love the way it
contours around the eye really like you
just turn it and then you can get kind
of that hard-to-get-to area on the
inside of the bridge of your nose I also
really love the PA t2 which is the
precision round brush both are great for
getting a really buffed out appearance
to the concealer making it look super
light and super natural so I love how
soft they are really densely packed with
those bristles or tip before you're done
with your concealer check your under eye
area a lot of us have little lines
little fine lines maybe creasing going
on under the eye something you should do
before you leave your makeup area is to
blot over that area with the q-tip
because sometimes within you know a
short time of application product can
settle there very quickly and so it's
important to kind of go over the area
you'll pick up some of that excess
product your lower liner is gonna last
longer because it's not gonna interfere
with that and you're not gonna have to
feel like uh is it settling in there is
it creating more of a problem you're
just gonna like basically blot over the
line and lift away any excess it's a
great trick so thank you so much for
watching guys let me know what other try
this not that segments you would like to
see and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
