today I'm bringing back a little series
that I had going on it's called try this
not that and if you're new to these
videos I basically pick like a category
of makeup and I talked about the
different hits and misses of that kind
of product so I've done like mascara and
concealer and Foundation and different
ones below to all the other ones that
I've done but I felt ready now to do one
on cream shadow a lot of these try this
not that videos I've really separated
things out into little subcategories but
I don't really feel like that's
necessary with the cream shadows so I'm
just going to kind of go through the
ones that I like and the ones that I
don't like asides ones that come in
little sticks and ones that come in the
pots there's not really that many ways
to like break this down and I think
it'll just be easiest to understand if I
do it this way the ones that I'm calling
my try this are like my most favorites
this video isn't going to cover every
single kind that I have if you know I
have another kind that you've seen me
use and it doesn't get mentioned in this
video that means maybe I haven't tried
enough of that particular line to have
formed enough of an opinion on it yet or
it's just kind of middle-of-the-road
but as for the things that I would
really recommend I want to start off
with the elf smudge pots these are so so
affordable I've tried a handful of
different colors I've been really really
pleased with the way these go on I do
have a specific review of then I just
blend them out with I brush as I like
using my Real Techniques brushes and I
can get like a total blend on these
shadows that is very consistent with the
look I would get with powders so I think
that says a lot they're very easy to
work with they don't have to feel like
you must top these with a powder shadow
to make them last or keep them from
creasing and that's a trend you're going
to see with a lot of these cream shadows
that I like so much another cream shadow
that comes in the little pot that I
really like are the Maybelline Color
tattoos and I think if you're looking
for maybe an expanded shade selection
past what the smudge pots offer you you
might look into these they also come out
with limited edition collections every
so often I've got a really fun shade
here it's actually called fierce and
tangy I use this
with a look recently like they've got
some different bright colors that are a
lot of fun to work with as a whole I've
had really good luck with these I found
the leathers collection the ones that I
had to be like a little bit drier than
other color tattoos from just the
regular line that I had used but I love
this one inked in pink is another great
like thing to use as a base for
different pink and moth tone looks you
might like but I'm a fan of the color
tattoos and I have had really nice
staying power with them just on their
own third recommendation that comes in a
little pot like this these are the elf
long-lasting lustrous eyeshadows this is
not something that i really suggest for
wearing on its own and getting amazing
staying power but I really like these as
kind of a topper or an accent to your
look really interesting kind of mousse
like light weight texture yet like a
really metallic kind of wet look out of
them and it's so pretty if you just want
to Pat that like right on your lid after
your eye look is done you guys know I
love my shadow sticks and I have got to
pass these along to you you probably see
me using these in videos with the Milani
shadow eyes and also the Jordana
twelve-hour made to last pencils these
two brands are manufactured by the same
company I am pretty much convinced that
these are the same formula and a lot of
the shades overlap can smudge them out
you can use them really easily a smudgy
eyeliner these could be your whole look
because they're so hardcore long wearing
or you know use them as a base and top
other powder shadows on top to make them
more intensely shades that I absolutely
love one from Jordana is called eternal
white just a great all-purpose shade to
have I know NYX milk is really popular
but this would be like NYX milk but in a
really long wearing format so like I
even use this today around my inner
corner as a bit of a base for the look
I've got going on now so I think that's
very all purple so from Milani I've got
this shade called almond cream this is
another matte no shimmer shade and this
is great in your lower inner rim to
brighten or if you just want to totally
nude like kind of neutralizing look on
your eyelids before you start a look
this is really nice for that to even
beyond those staple kinds of
in both of those lines there's a lot of
fun colors as well a format that I
really really love are the sticks that
twist up that you don't even have to
worry about sharpening they're a really
nice size you know they're not too
oversized they can easily smudge down on
your lower lash line but still the
staying power that I'm after and Avon
extra lasting shadow sticks are so
beautiful they've got some really
gorgeous shades and the one that I love
the most is called amethyst it's kind of
like a smokey a purpley taupe type color
it's so gorgeous look so pretty as a
standalone shade it reminds me so much
of the size and just you know the
functionality of the malyshev err color
shadow sticks that I love so much
replacing an Avon order these are so so
good I would really recommend them and
speaking of the malli shadow stick got
tons of gorgeous colors and most
recently she came out with a matte duo
that's matte Brown and matte black and
I've got to tell you I've been using the
matte black here and there sometimes as
an eyeshadow base but where this has
impressed me even more is the incredible
staying power in my waterline like
absolute all-day staying power of this
matte black I can't say I'm really
surprised by the staying power because
the other shadow sticks have been so
good but the bulk of her line is
shimmery so it was great to see that a
couple came out that were matte and just
really basic colors if you're looking
for some things that I would recommend
those would be the things I would say
hey try this but I've got a few things
that I definitely would not recommend as
well a couple of big flops for me and
from a couple different drugstore brands
these double-ended like shadows Stix
this one is the Revlon Colorstay smoky
shadow stick and I have it in small but
claims on this said like it will last
for 12 hours with no smudging no
creasing and it absolutely did not do
that for me I don't consider this to be
like a long wearing shadow to apply them
sparingly enough sometimes you know just
our standard cream eye shadow can work
still as a base to some powders and
still be effective in that way and I'm
not saying you couldn't use this like
that but
compared to some of the other creams
that I've talked about this just isn't
quite as functional and doesn't live up
to what the brand says it would do so
that's a not that for me
also the covergirl smoky shadow blast
this is another thing very similar
concept they've got like a rounded off
jumbo shadow stick on one end and then a
little bit more shaped one on the other
and I just really was not that impressed
by this when I used this alone on my
eyes I turned into an absolute grease
slick like everything was collecting in
my crease it was not pretty at all could
maybe still be used as a base and you
could get away with it that way if you
were willing to put powder shadow on top
but that's not the way it was marketed
if they make it seem like it's a real
easy just swipe it on and go type a
product and I didn't find it to be that
way for me elf
waterproof eyeliner crayons I have a
couple of these brown and pitch black
and when I first got these I can admit
they they did draw on fairly easily and
I was not able to like wipe them away so
I was kind of impressed by that but they
dried out on me so quick if you can tell
but this brown here is totally shrunk
like in its tube and it will not write
off at all you're looking at elf check
out the smudge pots and I say that again
in comparison to these cream shadows
from the studio liners
just a little bit of product at a big
bulky amount of packaging there on the
shade I have here is called dawn it's
not like a ugly shade or anything I've
used this plenty of times and thought it
was kind of pretty but it's definitely
drying out on me and it's not that
totally smudge free type of thing that
you get with the smudge pots which I
think are so so amazing for the price I
did want to give a little mention to an
in-betweener kind of product for me on
the NYX jumbo eye pencils I remember
when this was like the only kind of
cream shadow type of thing I had I think
they've got some great colors and if you
need like a cream shadow in a real
specific shade you know you might look
to this line but I pretty much gotta
exclusively use these as something that
I plan to top with powder eye shadow
otherwise the look will crease quite a
bit I've also got
be kind of careful to really remove any
excess product make sure I don't have
too much on my lids otherwise sometimes
even with powder on top I'll have some
creases but since those years when I was
first using these a lot so many other
more long wearing options have come out
for a comparable price so I kind of give
this like a average type rating there
are so many brands coming out with cream
shadows anymore so hopefully this helps
you navigate some of the things that are
out there thank you so much for watching
this try this not that video and if
you've got any requests for the next one
you want to see tell me what product
category you're interested in and I'll
start working on it thank you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
