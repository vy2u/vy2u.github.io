tribe it's not that is back yeah a long
time since I've done one of these and
these are tricky videos for me to sort
of come up with the content for because
I want them to be you know a product
that I have a lot of both likes and
dislikes about you know a certain type
of product and then also I try to come
up with enough subcategories in these
videos to really make it worth your
while to watch and you know get a lot of
information out of it so I've been
thinking about drugstore eyeshadows for
a while and formulating my opinions on
some different categories we're going to
talk about singles and like the little
pallets shimmery shadows matte shadows
baked shadows I mean you name it we're
gonna try to cover everything where you
know your requests on these kinds of
videos I've already done foundation
concealer and mascara so outside of
those that I've already done let me know
what you would like to see and I'll do
my best to deliver that kind of video to
you so this is just um powder eyeshadows
that I'm talking about in this video
there are a lot of brands coming out
with new cream eyeshadows so I thought
down the road that maybe a video in
itself because there's already a lot to
talk about for powders off with baked
eyeshadows from the drugstore and I have
a definite definite favorite where these
are concerned
I love the hard candy baked shadows
they're little duo's and in this first
part of the video I'm going to be kind
of talking single slash duos nothing big
though um but these are just so great
for the formula that they are I mean I
feel like they're very pigmented and yet
they feel very creamy they're not flaky
like is the tendency with a lot of baked
shadows even among high-end brands I
feel like baked shadows you know even
though they can say well you can apply
them wet well I want them to look good
when I use them dry to the newest when I
got I couldn't believe I hadn't had this
one before but this is called bad
reputation and I also love the duo in
high maintenance if you like taupe um
kind of taupe the borders on Plum that's
a great one root together really nicely
so you could do you know your whole eye
with just one of these because they give
you a dark enough shade to contour with
and then a light enough shade to be your
highlight or just all over your lid or
whatever you want but these are
definitely great drugstore shadows not
that is the Maybelline eye studio on
these little faked duo's here these are
a really kind of dry flaky type eyes
shadow they're easier to manage if you
use them wet but like I said the hard
candy performs well but or dry compare
these two the hard candy ones I mean I
can just tell there's a there's a higher
quality there there's a much better
formula so I will be buying any more the
everybody needs a little shimmery shadow
now and then shimmery metallic kind of
that shiny look on the eyes and I really
am a fan of these L'Oreal infallible
singles these are so nice so easy to
work with I mean the format which I've
showed in my recent favorites video but
you've got them kind of tamp down there
they're practically like a pigment
that's been pressed down as dry as a lot
of you know drugstore shadows might be a
little bit pricier for a drugstore
single but they do have some really
gorgeous shades
I love bronze taupe for a darker shade
that really reminds me of Mac's beauty
mark do you have smoldering plum and the
ones from this line that do have that
little bit of shimmer I mean they
totally shine they come off kind of
creamy buttery feeling I think they're
great they last a long time on the eyes
and one I don't like the not that the
ultimen rolls eye shadow and again this
is a small duo kind of talking duo's and
just those smaller varieties in this
part of the video but I have this one in
pink chocolate
I was just very disappointed in the
amount of pigmentation this had it
looked like it could be a really pretty
wearable duo but you know it's got that
shimmery finish really dug through my
whole collection to find the worst
shimmery eyeshadow the one that gave me
the least bang for the buck you know and
this one was it or drugstore matte
singles I've got a couple good kinds to
tell you about Milani not too long ago
came out with these and they have I mean
it's a full line of eyeshadows so some
are shimmery but there are quite a few
mattes including shades that you might
wear a lot like a perfect deep dark
matte black also this great matte Brown
of this
called brownstone and just you know the
kind of basics you might need but then
they also have some crazy colors like
this matte hot pink and you know they
really give off plenty of pigmentation
very high quality for a drugstore shadow
and you're getting a lot of product with
these as well if you can't find them in
your stores I know they are online at
the very least at Milani cosmetics stuck
on the other matte kind that I've been
really impressed with are the Rimmel
glam eyes again this is a full line of
eye shadow so not every single kind is
matte there are a couple of great matte
basics including jet black and dusk this
is not as black as black can be this is
kind of like a little step up like kind
of a charcoal type shade but very creamy
easy to blend easy to work with a lot of
matte shades that I've tried even some
high-end ones they can be kind of dry
and difficult to blend so these are very
easy to blend as are the Milani ones so
I really recommend those and as for you
know drugstore singles across-the-board
that I think are bad matte single
products I really don't have just one
kind to tell you about like I may have
tried a few covergirl dud matte shadows
here and there or you know from this or
that brand should say that the drugstore
as a whole is lacking I think in matte
eye shadow selection so for that reason
and the fact that just I haven't found
like a consistent flaw and other brands
I don't have a not that to mention for
the matte but I want to give a mention
to colourful shadows because sometimes
that can be a challenge to find in the
drugstore really good colorful
eyeshadows and the line I suggest you
look to if that's what you're going for
is NYX because they really have I think
the broadest color selection and good
quality colors too I just realized I
pulled out like Christmas colors here
but I mean matte or shimmer whatever
you're going for this is a gorgeous
shade called wild fire and it's just a
really pretty green cherry if you would
ever need red shadow you know they've
got and they have a lot of great
neutrals and a lot of brands do but I
think it's the colorful shades from the
drugstore that you might have more of a
challenge finding so I wanted to say you
know look - NYX if you need that one
special shade they probably have it
and then the drugstore line that I think
consistently doesn't produce their
colors quite as well is probably
covergirl and I've tried plenty of
covergirl neutral shades that I love I
mean hello the shimmering sands trio
that like it everybody owns and loves I
mean that works really well and I
continue to like that to this day but
with some of their brighter shades
I'm just not so pleased with how they
come off like they need to maybe
reformulate a little bit and even in
some of their newer quads and some of
the colors and those I'm like why is the
neutral coming off so much better but
this purple or this pink is not working
as well so like these for example I've
got meltdown mob forever figs your color
is what you want
maybe these are for you but I'm talking
real saturated color payoff I feel like
covergirl lacks a bit in that category
now I want to talk more in palette form
so like trios quads and beyond basically
from the drugstore and in terms of
shimmery metallic colors that I think
are consistently great I would really
recommend the maybelline eye studio
quads I don't hear a lot of people
talking about these I recently blogged
about like my favorite ones from this
line if you want to get a closer look at
even more swatches but these feel really
smooth the shades pop they throw in some
fun and kind of unexpected groupings of
shades and they're always coming out
with new limited edition sets of these
as you would line me I've said it before
but a lot of the Lancome color design
shadows in this kind of highly
shimmering metallic formula so I love
those of an unfortunate thing from
Milani because I do like their shadow
but I don't like the way they've
packaged it and you know if it's not
something you're going to reach for
what's the point in having it and I tend
to not reach for these so much because
they're just hard to use these little
strips these are the runway eyes and
they're teeny tiny strips of shadow here
and it's very difficult to get a brush
on there unless it's a really small
brush and just pick up one color at a
time and you can see they're all real
different colors from one another and I
this one this is called catwalk and I've
got others and they just kind of sit
there because I'm not drawn to use them
because they're kind of tricky to you
now
drugstore Matt shadow palette if you're
familiar with Physicians formulas Matt
quads but I never seem to find them in
my drugstores but I do always see them
at Ulta and this one I have is called
Canyon classics and these are actually
quite nightly non flaky nicely pigmented
shadows the whole collection that they
have of these matte quads are pretty
neutral like pretty safe color they've
actually been around for a while but if
you haven't checked them out you might
want to hit up ulta.com
or your local Ulta store I would also
mention the wet and wild
I heart matte palette but that was like
limited-edition and I want to stick to
things that I know you can find I wasn't
sure whether to mention this next one or
not because it's not a purely matte
palette but it does include some great
matte shades and sometimes that's that's
what you want is just a balance you know
in a quad to not have all four shimmery
shades but have one you know or two
deeper matte colors that can kind of
anchor the look and provide some
contrast so I wanted to mention the
quads from flower Beauty because I think
they're all-around good quality this is
a new brand out at Walmart it's the drew
Barrymore line and this one in foxy
Brown's has a delightful dark matte
Brown there that's really great these
colors are great too
and so is that one I've also picked up
this quad in face the gray and here you
have two matte shades one is a grey and
one is like um kind of a dark bluish
purple for those who are saying you
know just give me some matte I don't
need the whole thing matte I wanted to
tell you about that out for the matte
palettes that are not so good and again
I wish there were more that I could try
and there were more purely matte pallets
out there there are some like L'Oreal
quads here and there and some covergirl
quads where I feel like the matte shades
are lacking but it's not a consistent
enough flaw for me because then there
are some that I really like so I can't
say it's a total you know don't try this
kind of situation but I don't know if
you guys have noticed the line called
profusion I usually see them around the
holidays or just periodically they'll
come out with
little pallets at the drugstore here you
can see it says profusion right there
oops maybe you can see it if I don't
blind you profusion on the front and
this palette says profusion on the back
these are not purely met palettes but
they do contain both matte and shimmery
shades and what I've noticed about this
brand and I've tried other palettes that
they've put out and they do some
gorgeous metallics really pretty like
shimmery shades they got that down but
the matte shades are almost like
non-existent in some of these new things
they've put a shimmery shades are nice
the met shades you can hardly see and
it's the same deal with you know this
palette they've got a few matte colors
in there and it's like they just give me
nothing these a lot in Walgreens and I
thought it might be worth mentioning
because I don't hear a lot of people
talk about these and it might be the
type of thing that like you question and
they're cheap so you think maybe I
should go ahead and buy it I don't think
you know it's a really worthwhile
purchase if like half the palette
doesn't really provide any sort of
shadow boost any good pigmentation just
talking about all around eyes shadows
best and worst my try this is definitely
wet and wild I'm actually wearing this
palette today this is the blue had me at
hello kit but they've got these great
eight pan palettes they've got multiple
trios that are so user friendly the
matte shades are good the shimmery
shades are good I just my complaint it's
always been put out more please give us
more shadows to play with a medicine out
of color payoff and I don't think you
can beat the price tag either I mean
you're paying several dollars for a trio
less than five dollars for these it's
just a really awesome deal I've been
singing the praises of these for a while
this is not news to a lot of you
probably a lot of people who will
contact me and say you know I hadn't
tried wet and wild for years because a
long time ago I thought their products
were awful but things have changed and
their eyeshadows are definitely great
overall not that four eyeshadows is the
NYC primarily the little pallet things
that they sell I don't have one still
here to show you but they have several
shadows and like a base and a cream
illuminator thing don't perform as well
as the new trios that
the brand has come out with and the
trio's aren't even that good so it's
kind of like I mean we're talking chalky
very little color payoff inconsistency
amongst shades one shade might be better
another shade might not show up hardly
at all just tricky to work with and
flaky to that's it guys I hope this was
useful to you I feel like I shadow can
be one of the most tempting things or
the drugstore I mean you know there's so
many shades you want to try something
new all the time but maybe this will
save you a few bucks down the road if
you know what to steer clear of so thank
you so much for watching don't forget to
give me your requests and have a great
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
