whoo-hoo I love this series this is
where I tell you the best and the worst
from a certain kind of makeup product so
I've already done
um foundation concealer mascara
drugstore shadows really pay attention
to the requests from what people want to
see an eyeliner is one of those things
that a lot of people ask me about often
just in general with this video it's a
real combo of drugstore in high-end I'm
not going out of my way to separate
categories it's just best and worst
stuff liquid liner my favorite the try
this is the Milani ultra fine liquid
liner the shade is black vinyl this is
the blackest black totally waterproof
liquid liner I have put this to the test
on my blog and beware not every shade in
this line is waterproof they're all
labeled as such but this is the one that
is truly waterproof the shade again is
black vinyl it has kind of a little felt
tip type of thing going on here it's
very easy to you know navigate across
your lash line not that is for elfs to
do - the precision liquid eyeliner this
is not a horrible product the real
problem lies with the little brush tip
even though I think some brush tips can
be good and do a really great job this
one actually tends to separate just a
little bit right there in the tip and
when you're trying to get one even line
you've got little brush fibers sticking
out makes it really difficult about a
felt-tip pen form of liner this is what
I steer people toward when they stay I'm
new to liquid liner what's the easiest
thing I can use with a pen it's just
practically like you're writing so you
have a lot of control and the try this
for me is the Milani eye tech extreme
liquid eyeliner in blackest black I've
talked about some other felt tip pens
from Milani the color play I still
really like those I know they're not as
easy to find however if you are looking
for anything from Milani even some older
stuff go to cherry culture calm they
really have the biggest selection but I
think this is what's gonna be what
you're gonna be most likely to find out
in stores and again
I tech Xtreme it has kind of an extended
felt-tip there so it's just a little bit
longer it's very very user friendly and
very black and because this tip is so
fine you can practically like stamp it
right across like lay the whole thing
down instead of just drawing on the tip
like lay it down and stamp it it's like
the easiest way to do liquid lion I
swear there's something about Milani I
am convinced they're doing something
differently with their felt-tip pens
because they always last longer than any
other felt-tip pen liner I have them can
dry up really fast
these don't and my mom has had the same
experience she uses the brow marker and
hers it's lasted her so so long even
though she's got multiple backups now
but I take extreme that's great
consequently the not bat is also from
Milani and it's the eye tech bold liquid
eyeliner in terms of just the actual
liner the liquid itself I mean it's good
for the same reasons the other one was
but I just really don't like the way
this one is put together the tip is
shorter here and then it gets really
thick and wide you know around the rest
of the product and therefore it's kind
of hard to really get in there and get
the line you want and in terms of like
laying it down in that method doesn't
work so well with this because it is
such like a thick marker and so when you
want to just use the tip it just can be
a little bit hard to get right in there
in your lashes let's talk about glitter
liners and the try this is the NYX glam
liner aqua luxe waterproof I have it in
the shade glam golden and what I love so
much about this is that it's a very very
fine glitter so you do get that pretty
shimmery effect but without chunkiness
and it goes on with full color in one
swipe really served its purpose for a
Christmas tutorial I did I think this
past Christmas Eve is the I drama
glitter liquid liner in Envy this is
from femme Couture that's something you
find it's Sally's and it looks gorgeous
and I was able to you know build it on
itself to get the line I wanted but
compared to the NYX this is so much more
of just like a gel that's simply binding
some glitter together cream / gel liners
some people really love these they can
be very long wear
but my favorite and this is a new
favorite so thank you so much to
everybody who told me to try this this
is the essence gel liner in Midnight in
Paris so looks like this is a little pot
it's SuperDuper creamy goes on so smooth
and so rich in black and it you know
staying power is absolutely outstanding
with it I love using it with my fine
liner brush from Real Techniques I find
that this is just the perfect size for
getting just the kind of line I want not
too thin not too thick it's great the
l'oreal lacquer liner in blackest black
reminds me a lot of this this one's just
gonna come at a cheaper price not that
is the elf studio cream liner and the
reason why ultimately is that it dried
up faster than any other cream liner
I've ever used
I've had some products way longer than
this in my collection and this one is I
mean you can see how dried up it is in
there like the product basically shrunk
um how about brightening liners for the
waterline lots of people like to use
something like that to make them look a
little more awake or just to you know
counteract any redness you might have
I love the Rimmel scandaleyes and nude
I've talked about this before so many of
you have told me how much you enjoy this
product and this is a really long
wearing creamy liner and it's not stark
white but I'm wearing it today just
right there in my waterline it's a lot
like the Tarte emphasized that is a
retractable one but it also costs a lot
more so this would be my pick then not
that I don't even know if they're still
making this but it's the it cosmetics
hello bright eyes hello
dry pencil if this is your hideout so
quickly as to have a lot of my pencils
from it cosmetics I mean it's just hard
as a raw color coming off I'm pretty
sure this was one of my big fails of the
year get yourself the Rimmel you'll be
happy you did for a really great long
wearing just regular old liner in the
waterline not one of those brightening
kinds like you're doing a great smokey
eye and you want that nice intensity
right in there in the waterline I've got
a couple options for you guys I know
I've talked about it a lot but it's the
best I've used it's the Mallee ever
color automatic waterproof eyeliner I
have these in a lot of shades
so it is a retractable one the starlight
ones are not retractable and I think
you're gonna find that they're creamier
however the fact that this is creamy
enough but just at the steamiest bit dry
I think is what makes it really adhere
to that water line and lasts a long time
you're just experimenting maybe just
keep that in mind that sometimes the
creamiest liner is not always the best
in the water line but this nalli one
I've tested it just directly up against
other liner does there one that's creep
it in there though that I'm loving a lot
is the estee lauder double wear stay in
place I pencil this is a duo it's got
onyx I think it's called and coffee and
sometimes the way I like to use this is
the black and the waterline and then if
I'm going for a smokey look I'll take
brown in in with the lash line and kind
of smudge it out gorgeous love it okay
we're getting towards the end and I know
I've pointed out along the way certain
liners that have been waterproof now I'm
talking about the classic pencil so
retractable or the kind you sharpen just
classic pencil criteria I'm thinking
about what these are you know if they
claim to be waterproof are they really
and how easy do they go on pigmented
enriches the color so I've got several
guys to recommend to you based on
availability
you know you might choose different ones
one of course is the Maybelline master
drama these are such nice liners I reach
for this black one and midnight master
all the time talk about it a lot love
that its retractable just wish the shade
selection was a bit more expanded but
all in all that is a great liner also
the Milani liquid eye this is the liquid
like eye pencil these go on super smooth
ultimate you know great staying power so
newer addition to my collection but the
Sigma extended wear eyeliners are legit
long wear creamy pigmented black shade
called boost is very impressive but
they've got some kind of unique shades
in the mix I need to do a big old swatch
vest on my blog on those but I would
recommend those they work very very well
and you can get them in trios if you
want my not that when it comes to these
waterproof pencils first off it kind of
pains me to say this because this is a
really rich and creamy liner but the Too
Faced perfect eyes the
says of waterproof on there and it's
just not this is not a totally budge
proof liner those other ones I've
mentioned these other three least set to
a complete smudge proof state this does
not and it's just important to know that
sometimes you just want a smudgy creamy
black liner this can give you that it is
not absolutely waterproof by any means
one of the worst eyeliners I've tried in
recent memory is the essence stays no
matter what waterproof pencil I don't
know if I got a mega dud in this but
this goes on like chunky stuff almost
has like little flakes or chunks that
come off not as smooth even line
definitely smudged on my eye I don't
know what's up with that because that
stays no matter what claim it's like
crazy and I know they can do great
things we talked about the gel liner
these videos gonna be fired up sometimes
my old category just wanted to talk
about liners that come in a really great
color range you don't always have to use
black and brown you can reach for some
fun colors and the NYX slide on liners
these could have also gone with you know
being totally waterproof but the one of
the most impressive things is that they
have a phenomenal color selection many
many shades comparable to the Urban
Decay 24/7 s you do have to sharpen them
but they go on super smooth and like I
said all the colors in the rainbow plus
them for the the not that these are
liners that have actually worked fairly
well for me over the years they put out
a good color selection the liner's go on
smooth but staying power wise they can't
hold a candle to NYX at all and it's the
Jordana easy liners like this shade
sterling blue is beautiful but you've
got to set it and even then you're not
necessarily going to hold up to what NYX
can do those are my picks and non picks
bottom line you gotta be able to trust
your eyeliner you know it's one of those
things that can be very obvious if it's
going wrong and and fall in the south on
your face a little obviously eyeliner
would be one of those products I'd be
willing to shell out a little bit more
for if I thought I had to but
fortunately there are many great
drugstore options and I've mentioned
some high-end options in this video as
well just depending on what you're
looking for so thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
