not that video I took some requests on
my facebook page as to what topic you
wanted to see covered in this video and
I must admit I got a ton of requests for
foundation and I got a little bit
nervous about that because I mean
foundation is one of those things that
is so individual it seems like you know
like two girls could try the same
foundation and it might have a
completely different effect on one of
them depending on their skin type or
just their preference and how they want
it to look so I am going to hopefully
describe things well enough for you in
this video that you can figure it out
for yourself what things might work best
for you and what won't I'm gonna try to
get through it quickly I feel like
sometimes with these try this not that
videos that can be like information
overload because I'm covering so many
products but I'll try to keep it concise
we're gonna go through different
foundations for different skin types
different just preferences and
appearance and things like that things I
want to talk about our foundations for
saying normal to dry skin actually this
first one I'm going to recommend is
something that I think can work for
combo skin as well I have sort of
combination skin it kind of changes with
the seasons so it's getting a little
more dry now but it can be more
combination in the warmer months but
it's the Revlon Colorstay whipped cream
makeup I love this so much and I use
this in my TV news makeup routine for HD
do you thinks I like about it the
staying power has proved itself time and
time again I find it extremely blendable
you'll feel the consistency to be just
not as thin as it as a liquid makeup so
that's why I feel like it's something
that can be workable for those of us
with normal even dry skin but this is
just a really great foundation and it
really lives up to the Colorstay name
that it has another foundation sort of
in that same category it is that sort of
whipped mousse like feel only it's in
like a foundation pump here is the
Maybelline Dream liquid mousse I could
see this as being at the type of product
that might work for dry skin but even so
even when I was wearing this in the
wintertime dealing with dry skin it made
me into an absolute oil slick by midday
I couldn't believe how much I loved the
way it looked as soon as I put it on and
then only part of the way through a day
of where my t-zone looked completely
greasy and I knew it was this because I
kind of was testing it out and this was
the only thing I changed so if this
works for you great I just could not
make it work for me it's the Maybelline
Dream liquid mousse you have really oily
skin I think nothing beats Revlon's
Colorstay liquid makeup for combo to
oily skin even as I've taught so much
about the whipped version I really feel
like if you've got the oil list of the
oily skin this staying power is going to
be pretty much the ultimate for it's got
nice coverage like the other one has I
feel like I do have to work a little
more quickly with this one as I blend it
in it's just something about it it seems
to want to set fairly fast as you put it
on your face I wanted to give another
option for people who maybe Colorstay
products just haven't worked for you Mac
Pro Longwear Foundation is another one
that I think has great staying power
great coverage and it just works really
really well for me and not that for oily
skin foundations I really don't feel
like I've tried one geared toward that
specific skin type that's been a total
dud I mean I obviously wouldn't
recommend dream liquid mousse for
anybody with oily skin because that made
me really oily but I put it more in the
category with the mousse makeup as
opposed to these liquids and I just
don't have one yet to tell you about
that's been really bad for me so I guess
that's a good thing
move on to those foundations that claim
to give you kind of a luminous school
and my try this is one that's fairly new
on the market and I was really pleased
with the way it worked and keep in mind
I would recommend a luminous foundation
not for people with the oiliest of oily
skin because it can just emphasize that
this is something normal combo or dry
skin might want to test out but True
Match Lumi healthy luminous makeup I
really enjoy I've tried regular True
Match and I like this so much better I I
don't know if the coverage is different
with this but I feel like it's giving
more coverage and it's giving you like
really nice healthy looking skin with a
little bit of that glow but yet it's no
sparkly like they've been able to pull
off something that it's kind of
surprising it's a it's a foundation that
gives your skin a really beautiful
healthy look but no shimmer and that's
why the not that even though this is a
foundation I think I can wear on my good
skin days and still look good in and
it's not a totally bad foundation but
Revlon Photoready in contrast does have
little bits of shimmer in it and I feel
like if you've got this large pores or
if you've got uneven texture that makes
those problems stand out and people are
into mineral makeup and one of my
all-time favorite kinds simply due to
the sheer variety of formulas you can
get is everyday minerals this is an
older one that I have here I really
haven't been using mineral makeup that
much but I know some people are
interested in this and everyday minerals
has a variety of formulas at their base
I think that's really cool also the
prices are pretty good and if you look
into the brand a little bit more they
have gorgeous blushes really pigmented
beautiful blushes finishing powders
highlight type thing if you like pressed
I also have a recommendation for you
because I know that sometimes just
easier to travel with or whatever but
Mac mineralized skinfinish is actually
really nice I'll use this with a big
kabuki brush should be that added bit of
coverage on top of foundation or you can
wear it alone and it looks really nice
the mineral makeup that I just don't
like it all and this was really a review
I did years ago and I've kept this
around just for the purpose of if I need
to talk about it again in a comparison
standpoint but this is Revlon Colorstay
mineral foundation it claims 16 hours of
wear it is not even close to that it's
got a ridiculous little tiny brush that
comes out of here that can't buff
anything I'm not the Revlon Colorstay
aqua foundation that's out there but
this is just Revlon Colorstay mineral
makeup and I would advise you do not
waste your money on this for powder
foundation and this is another category
where I kind of fortunately don't have a
not bad I haven't tried an all-out awful
powder foundation to tell you about here
but I have two good one on one that I
love is Laura Geller's balance and
Brighton I think this is a wonder
powder foundation again it's not loose
it's it's a pressed powder it's actually
started as a cream it's baked and
becomes this powder it's multiple shades
swirled in together I feel like it's
really color corrective because there's
a lot of yellow in this and the cover
just is just really great and I also
like mix stay matte but not flat this is
another great layering type powder
foundation actually has a natural look
on the skin used it a whole bunch and I
just love it a lot
that's it for try this not that I hope
this was informative for you again
foundations are one of those really
tough things in makeup kind of like
mascaras you know and that what somebody
loves over here another person might not
love so much I think it is really
important to pinpoint your skin type and
kind of go from there
luminous glowy foundations dewy
foundations
I think tend to perform a little bit
better if you've got drier skin that can
handle a little extra moisture whereas
if you're oily you want to go for things
that are mattifying shine control that
sort of thing in the name so it's not
going to make your pores your blemishes
or any other dramas and increased oil
production throughout the day it's not
going to make that stand out anymore so
thanks a lot for watching guys let me
know what you want to see in the next
try this not that and I'll talk to you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
