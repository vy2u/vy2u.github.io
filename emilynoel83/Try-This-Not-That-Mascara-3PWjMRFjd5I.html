back in one piece it was such a cool
trip I got to see so many awesome things
it was just amazing being overseas for
the first time and just being in a
completely different setting tons of fun
and I will definitely have a vlog on
that on beauty vlog cast so I'll keep
you posted when that comes up for now I
do have a little German makeup haul I
got to go to a drugstore and scope out
the makeup it was so cool so I have a
little haul on my blog right now
actually if you want to check that out
but for now I wanted to get back to the
try that's not that since you guys left
so many great requests on the first
video I did for this which was on
concealer a lot of people wanted to see
one on mascaras so that's what I'm doing
now you have a little bit of a cold by
the way I got that kind of right at the
tail end of my trip on the way back home
but bear with me for this video I do
have a lot of different categories of
mascara to talk about so a lot of people
have asked me about like the Too Faced
better than false lashes and that is
actually gonna fit into this video
you'll have to keep watching to see if
it's a try this or a not that it will
start off by talking about lengthening
mascaras and the try this for me is
L'Oreal double extend say two-step
mascara but it really is worth that
extra step because this primer that you
see right here completely lengthens your
lashes so much so I would apply this to
each eye let it get dry and then take
the second step which is your
traditional black mascara the brush by
the way on this reminds me a lot of
L'Oreal voluminous but it lengthens out
your lashes so much definitely the best
mascara for length that I've tried and a
problem I run into with a lot of
lengthening mascaras I feel like the
microfibers in the mascara can sometimes
give your lashes like a funky little end
it's like here you see this beautiful
lash and then at the end it's like it's
got this unnatural little you know like
tip going one direction or another and
it totally is the dead giveaway that oh
those are lashes coated in gobs of
mascara so this doesn't do that it gives
you a nice length without the funky end
my not that
lengthening mascara is the Maybelline
illegal length I actually really liked
this when it was first released and it
was definitely different than it is now
and then it got discontinued for a while
and they brought it back as a mascara
that I'm not really a fan once again has
those fiber false fiber extensions in it
but I don't feel like it looks you know
really natural on the lashes I mean
those funky ends that I spoke of yeah
you'll see those with this this used to
be a really nice lengthening mascara but
unfortunately the re-release that is
available to us all now did not turn out
to be the same thing for my try this for
a volumizing mascara it's not going to
come as a big surprise so I'm not going
to spend too much time on this one but
it's I'll make it up and grow this is
one that I've just really been loving
ever since like the Emily awards back in
January it's a very thick dense brush
with a lot of bristles and I find that
it just gives a lot of volume and length
actually it's great for both of those
things a couple of other mascaras that I
could have put in this category would be
the Mallee volumizing or the tarte and
gifted Amazonian clay mascara thought
since mascara is something that a lot of
people do go through pretty quickly
maybe a lower-cost version is what I
would choose to feature here and
recommend Milani total lash cover
mascara with a three zone brush there is
just too much going on here and not
enough going on in their high places
this is one of those brushes when you
pull it out it's covered with ice Kara
at the tip so you've got to clean that
off but then when you look at this brush
what you've got is a tip there you can
see the very the tip right here at the
end there's nothing on it there's no
bristles there so the part that you want
this that would get into you know your
inner most lashes and really give you
definition there's no bristles there to
help you do it it's just a flat nub
randomly at the end of the mascara which
I don't understand the center part here
is actually like a regular brush I don't
know if you can tell but that's like a
traditional mascara wand
and then only at the top and the bottom
you've got rubber bristles and those are
so spread out so far apart they don't do
enough defining and separating of the
lashes and as you can see upon pulling
it out of the tube you've got a lot of
clumps on those rubber bristles as we'll
end up with lashes that look very teamed
up and clumped together like you got
about five eyelashes and again you don't
have any help from the tip to help you
define it because it is just that rubber
just no I thought I could think of at
the end here and it does not work for me
at all some people really prefer rubber
brush mascaras I think they can be good
for definition and for just getting a
really clean look on the lashes and one
that I really like
not just for volume and you know making
your lashes look great but also for not
flaking and smudging throughout the day
is the covergirl LashBlast volume this
is obviously the tube from the
limited-edition olympics packaging that
they had a target but typically this is
sold in an orange tube it's got a really
big brush to it with rather short
bristles and a lot of them and I think
it really does allow you to get through
your lashes without clumping them up and
like I said not ending up with flakes on
your cheek mid-day not that it's the
great lash lots of lashes mascara this
is a cone-shaped brush and when you pull
it out you end up with the most formula
on the end of the brush that you would
use for your tiniest lashes again it
does not make sense to have a brush that
cannot be completely cleaned off and you
know have minimal product on the area
where you want to put that on your inner
lashes than that it just didn't do
enough it didn't make them big a mascara
to make me feel like my lashes look
great and this just didn't do enough
some people really rely on a waterproof
mascara for day to day and I gotta say
one of the ones that gives like the best
look and amazing amazing staying power
is the Mallee volumizing mascara
waterproof version again I love the
regular which is sold in the white tube
but as I look
what I've tried in waterproof versions
this is probably the one that has the
most hardcore staying power and just a
really great formula in general the
brush is super thick and nice I love
this style of brush but the formula is
great too because it doesn't ever make
your lashes feel stiff gosh I feel like
I could sneeze at any moment here sorry
if it events if that happens but the
knot that is the laura geller at long
lash waterproof mascara this is all time
one of the worst formulas I've ever
tried it is so inky and goopy and just
way way too like liquidy wet time I pull
this out that small defining tip you can
see how it's curved just slightly it
comes out with a lot of that you know
goopy mascara right at the end I don't
know if you can tell but this is one of
those brushes where the the bristles
kind of spiral around the brush and I'm
not a huge fan of those because I think
sometimes they're too spaced out and
they don't separate and define each lash
and I know it might sound goofy to use a
separate mascara for lower lashes but I
pretty much always do and it's the
Maybelline lash discovery I reach for
this a lot because I feel like it
defines the lower lashes without ever
making them seem clumpy and even without
using a waterproof version I don't have
smudges and flakes so I think it's great
it's a very small brush it's just
perfect for getting in there and
wiggling it right at the root and then
kind of pulling it down on through and
you have great great definition there on
the lower lash and when I tried and did
not like for the lower lashes is the elf
exact lash mascara this is a teeny tiny
brush I mean it's as small as they come
but the main issue with me is that the
wand is not long enough from here to
here and I like to do that thing where
you you know you kind of wiggle it on
the root of the lash and then pull
through and it's so short that I have
trouble really getting in there whereas
with the lash discovery you know a
couple swipes through one like right in
here and one right in here can cover
that whole lower lash line
this I feel like I've got to go to a lot
more work to get the look that I want my
last category kind of focuses on new
innovative mascaras and which sort of
yeah I don't want to say gimmick but
which new different idea really Wirthlin
that I think is worth being labeled as
try this is this product from lash
control and this is cool because you can
control how much product comes out on
your brush by physically squeezing the
tube
so you know how like any time you pull a
mascara out of a tube but there's a
little stopper in there there's a little
you know constricted area that the brush
passes through to clean off some of that
product and sometimes maybe you wish oh
I wish it was cleaned up so much more or
I wish there was more product on the
brush when I pulled it out with this I'm
actually this is actually a rubber piece
right here and I can squeeze that feel
the brush come through there
and I have actually cleaned off more of
the product on the breath I can lead you
to have a more defined lash look you
know when there's too much product and
you don't have a lot of lashes it can
really clump up fast the storm is coming
because it's starting to get really dark
outside I use natural light from my
window for these videos so sorry if it's
getting darts but a volumizing and
conditioning version there's a
lengthening one as well and cupcake just
jumped in my seat oh hi okay I'm not
sure what her plan is but she is now
crawling around and it's on the chair
okay the idea that did not work so well
the Too Faced better than false lashes
I'm putting this on my not that list
because I really had high hopes for this
calling something better than false
lashes I mean I know how good false
lashes can be and it's not quite there I
gotta say but basically the way the
system works is you take a first step of
mascara that you put on your lashes and
that kind of gets them primed for what's
to come which is this second step which
is the nylon lash fibers and it looks
furry it's like a furry little brush
here with a bunch of different fibers
and when you put that on your
they sometimes don't all go on your
lashes sometimes they go into your eye
which I found which was pretty
unpleasant as a contact lens where you
paint that on and they kind of stick
sort of to the first coat of mascara you
finish it off with another coat of
mascara and you've got really long
lashes does it give you really long
lashes yes I really noticed that and I
noticed them looking pretty darn good
after my first application so I thought
I still got to try this a few more times
this is why before you review you need
to try things multiple times because the
next few times I tried it I noticed that
instead of looking smooth and long and
you know perfect like false lashes
should look they started to look like
each lash was growing fibers out of
itself like a furry tarantula leg or
something like it was weird
I put on this first coat I went back and
put this on and I think after the
process of this brush come in in contact
with those fibers then going back in and
you know that's changing the consistency
of this mascara it went from being
something smooth and relatively on
clumping to something that was getting
all those fibers back into this tube you
know what I mean after coming in contact
with these on the lash so that's why I
that's at least my assessment of why I
think this stopped working so well as
time went on for me and the lashes
started looking really overdone and
that's a lot for me to say because I
like big lashes sound that this was
looking just not natural and just for
the claim not as good as false lashes so
that's my try this not that for mascaras
I hope you guys enjoyed this I hope this
sheds some light on the good from the
bad I know we all have our own opinions
and mascaras that can really be hard to
find one that pleases everyone but
hopefully through this video you could
see one or two that might meet your
needs so thanks for watching guys the
ceiling
thick brush the breast brush I remember
when illegal lengths was a I remember
when this define your you know smallish
smallest in term it didn't liquidy
formula like this lash last worth game
being labeled as try this smooth Linton
lengthen perhaps the leg of in in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
