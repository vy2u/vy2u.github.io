that rosy aroma like it's so rosy rosy
frozen rose rose rose
hey guys this video has been a long time
in the works I have been so loving rose
scented beauty products over the last
several months I've been accumulating so
many different products that have that
wonderful rosy aroma I just love them
everything from facial mist to lip balms
to different skin care items and I
really wanted to come across with a
video where I could share my reviews on
all these things and then I started
getting really overwhelmed with all the
stuff I had to talk about and finally
the light bulb went off and I thought
you should do this try this not that
style so basically breaking down what I
have into some general categories like
the facial mess the skin care lip balm
tinted lip balm and just going through
and talking about the products that
worked and the products that didn't so I
have four different rosewater facial
mists that I've been testing out and my
favorite to try this I guess you'd say
is this one from glossier and it's the
soothing face mist rose water spray I
love this one for several reasons first
off I think it's a great mist when you
missed it out it's a fine mist but it's
still enough to where you don't feel you
have to go going all over your skin to
get enough moisture on I feel like the
scent is dead-on perfect level of
rosiness and it's kind of a touchy thing
with a facial mist because you don't
want to feel like you're spritzing a
perfume right in your face you know and
sometimes these floral scents can come
off that way so for my personal
preference I want it to be rosy without
being too strong I wanted to add that
refreshing level of moisture and come
out with just the right intensity with
the mist and so this is really the best
one that I've used I do have another
slightly less expensive face mist that I
would put into the try this category
although I don't like it quite as well
as the one I just mentioned it is pretty
darn good and it's the Mario Badescu
facial spray with aloe herbs and
rosewater this one has been living in my
refrigerator I use it every so often and
that's a great way to get a super
refreshing mist a scent on this isn't as
purely rose as the one I just mentioned
you definitely can sense that there are
some herbs in there there are some other
things mixed in creating this aroma I
think I mentioned in a haul that the way
it sprays out sometimes can be a little
bit erratic sometimes if you're spraying
this on top of makeup I can see like
different dots on my skin like it's
coming out a little too much not fine
enough mist I can't really say that
that's been a consistent problem it
really can add a nice amount of moisture
to your skin without having to spray
over it a zillion times another spray
that I like but wouldn't necessarily
recommend is this one from your leek and
this is probably the most expensive one
it's the rose water balancing mist it's
got a really beautiful kind of heavy
matte glass bottle packaging here and
the mist is incredibly fine and that's a
bit of an issue for me because it's like
how close do I need to get to my skin to
actually feel it one mist of this is
usually not enough I don't know if you
can tell if I spray it right here but
the mist just kind of circles all over
the place instead of having some
direction toward your face so that's
kind of the main problem with this for
me I do like the packaging the scent is
amazing it's probably the most intensely
rosy scent very pure I really like the
product it's just the delivery of it in
my last place one I guess you'd say is
this josie maran rosy mist it's not
really like it's a bad product but
compared to the scent on all the others
this is much much more subtle I just
have a little travel-size here that's
probably what I'll continue to use this
for but it's not really doing anything
better for my skin and not smelling any
better than any of the others
moving on to some skincare items first
thing I want to mention definitely a try
this is my Peter Thomas Roth rose stem
cell bio repair gel mask this is awesome
I get a whiff of this I do get the rosy
vibe but it's like roses mixed with
fresh air clean kind of scent like
there's something else thrown in there
but it's pleasant to me and you can use
this actually as a mask like put it on a
thick layer of this gel leave it on for
10-15 minutes and then rinse it off or
you can apply a thin layer this is the
last layer of your skincare and wear it
overnight and if you plan to use it that
way I mean this is a ton of product I
mean I see this overall as a splurge
type item but for as much as you're
getting you can use it in a couple of
different ways and I think that the
results are awesome that this is so
hydrating it's so softening more than
anything like after you've rinsed this
mask off the skin feels so good like
baby's butt type good and I felt some
baby butt but it says cutting-edge plant
biotechnology isolates and replicates
five perfect reparative rose stem cells
and I know I've been talking so much
about the rose fragrance but there are a
lot of skincare benefits to these rose
infused products so I love this I feel
like it really plumps up and softens the
skin another try this item and this
would be like the equivalent to the
touching up with the facial mist you
know if you're a dry skin person maybe
you want the mists to sort of revive
your skin make it look a little more
fresh and moisturized but what if you're
oily and you don't really want to go
doing a lot of that throughout the day
blotting papers rose blotting papers
from Sephora these are the herbal rose
you open them up and then you pull this
little part that has some sticky on it
and it will just pull out one sheet for
you it smells lightly rosy and then you
can just blot this all over your face my
makeups been freshly done so I don't
know if I'm gonna pull up much oil but I
just really love that light fragrance
that they have I don't think in terms of
function they're that different from all
the other blotting papers that are out
there but I don't know it's just a
little pick-me-up to smell that rosy
scent and there are a hundred sheets in
here and it says aromatherapy benefits
help aid in relaxation and tranquility
so I think this is a great little thing
and if you're obsessed with the rose
scent you should have it another
skincare item that I would definitely
say as they try this is the Sephora rose
I mask this was so so refreshing and I
normally do masks and stuff at the end
of the day but I did this I mask
actually at the start of the day and a
couple days ago and I couldn't believe
how absolutely refreshing and cooling
and just invigorating this was basically
you just take off these little tissue
patches and you lay them right under
your eye area you can leave them on for
like 15 minutes or so and when you take
them off there's all this liquid they're
really really saturated and you can just
kind of rub that in but your skin really
does drink it up and talk about
something that kind of plumps up the
skin and really makes your eye area feel
so nourished and I'm not really calling
this the full face mask I'm not that you
know like don't try this one because I
like this too but I felt like I got an
even more potent effect from just
putting the mask on the eye area
this is a typical sheet mask you know
you take it out it's very saturated with
product you put it all over your face
and I don't know it's a little bit more
of a pain to do it's not gonna be like a
perfect fit for every person you know I
felt like some of the sides were kind of
sagging off or whatever and after I took
it off I did blend in the product all
over my face but I didn't notice um
quite as great of an after effect as I
do from the Peter Thomas Roth so if you
were thinking about either of these Rose
masks I would go more toward just the
eye one and also I didn't notice any
like irritation to my eye area it's not
too heavily scented
all right so so many rose lip balm
products to talk about these are lip
balms that smell rosy and also you know
deliver some of these skincare benefits
of rose that's with everything I've
talked about I'm kind of gauging this
stuff by rosy scent and how well does it
actually work and the absolute best in
terms of the rosy lip balms that I've
tried is the Aran Rose lip conditioner I
just have the little try me size here
this is something I'm going to be
getting full size but this is by far the
most nourishing product to my lips I was
kind of comparing it up against my agave
lip mask from bite and I think this is
an even more intensely hydrating lip
balm to put on like before bed you could
even wear it during the day as well you
see it has kind of a peachy appearance
it's just going to be clear on the lips
but it is rather shiny there's a little
bit of gloss happening with this product
it's definitely a high-end kind of
splurge type item but in terms of
comparing this across the board to
everything I've used this is the most
nourishing best rosy lip product not far
behind that I really ended up liking the
creme de Rose balm from Dior this is
more balmy it's less glossy less thick
compared to that Aran product and it has
a great great dead-on rosy scent the
thing that I didn't quite get from this
it says smoothing plumping lip balm I
didn't quite get the plumping other than
the fact that it's hydrating my lips and
maybe making lines appear a little less
evident it has a really rich creamy
texture very smooth it's not at all
thick and waxy it's also not too thin
and greasy either so that one really I
mean it's expensive so I'm kind of like
yeah I don't know but it truly does work
well now rosebud perfume company is kind
of like the granddaddy of the rosy lip
balms and there are a few that I really
like from this line these are going to
be a thinner maybe you could say more
greasy texture lip balm I don't feel
like they're too greasy but that's just
the only way to really describe them in
comparison to some of the richer
products I just mentioned I find these
products that I'm going to mention to be
very comfortable on the lips there is
some shine and
really like the Rosebud sap in the
squeeze tube
I think the squeeze tube is just more
travel friendly I mean I've had some
melting issues in the past with the ones
in the little tins and those are cute
and they're great for around the house
but this is even a little more sanitary
and just more travel friendly but the
standard rosebud set I really like
you're getting the classic Rosie scent
you put it on you definitely get some
shine on your lips it's just gonna be a
thinner type product than the last two
that I mentioned but it's still really
nourishing and nice on the lips and less
expensive also now a couple of varieties
of the Rosebud sap that I also found I
really like and brace yourself this
looks like something I don't know your
grandma might have on her vanity but
it's the bramble berry Rose check this
lady out this smells really freaking
good it's a combo I feel like of rose
and berry it smells so good and I can't
put my finger on anything to really
compare this to that I've smelled before
oh it's that floral rosiness with some
sweetness thrown in I absolutely love
that and while it does look pink it
doesn't seem to offer any color to the
lips that's just gonna be a clear lip
balm I'm gonna be talking about tinted
stuff in a second and another one that I
tried that kind of surprised me that I
like this is the minted rose I first
smell this the mint is kind of strong
but the Rose still comes through and you
might not really think of those two
things together but it really it works
for me maybe not everybody there are
probably some rosebuds that purists out
there who couldn't bear to think of
anything being mixed or changed about
this but the little bit of mint I think
is really refreshing and it kind of like
opens up the sinuses just a little bit
so in terms of the Rose lip bumps that I
did not go for so much and the smiths
rose and Mandarin lip balm this one just
wasn't really doing it for me but I do
think some people out there might like
this if you go for the scent of like a
mandarin tea it makes me think of an
herbal orange ET not really my cup of
tea pun intended but some people out
there might love this stuff and it is
available in the tin but I happen to get
it in the squeezy tube also from Smith's
the mocha rose I thought this might be
it
the thing to try but Rose and chocolate
it I don't know I can't make that really
pleasing to my nose you know what I mean
and the last bomb that I really didn't
go for is this your leek love bomb Rose
this I felt like I was smelling a like a
solid perfume it's that fragrant and it
really does smell good but the texture
makes me think of that as well it's like
it's so rosy I almost don't feel right
putting it on my lips but you could use
this anywhere I think that was in the
description you know put it wherever
your skin is dry you could use it on
cuticles yeah I don't know I feel a
little bit greasy about putting it there
but this is one of those pricier
products that I didn't really think was
worth it
now for the rosy stuff that I would
recommend that has a tint the Bennet
balm I love this this smells so great I
love the Bennet aunt rosy scent this is
just gonna be a great sheer red lip balm
I like the thickness and consistency of
this product I feel like it really adds
some moisture to your lips it doesn't
fade away too fast and it's great if you
want to layer it on top of lip liners on
top of the classic Benetint stain it
looks gorgeous that way as well but I
really really love that stuff my other
try this is a legit lipstick again I've
been trying several of the rosy things
from the Erin line which is kind of a
division of Estee Lauder but this is the
Rose Bowl lipstick in geranium and I
remember instagramming a picture of this
last summer the packaging is stunning I
love that and I'm wearing this in this
video it's such a luxurious texture of
lipstick it's fabulous but it also
smells like roses love that and it seems
like such a classic Rosie look to the
lips this is exactly what I think of
when I think of Rose you know it's not
that pure fire-engine red it's not
really soft pink to me but it's just
that in-between rosy shade classic rose
lipstick now on the downside from Erin
something I tried that I really didn't
go for is the rose lip balm that's just
in this little tin here it appears to be
tinted and I think there is an untended
version as well but it really didn't
give me much color when I put
this on my lips I don't see anything I
also didn't think it smelled nearly rosy
enough I mean for as fragrant as the lip
conditioner was I didn't think this
delivered as much and the texture wasn't
anything to write home about either also
I know some people really like the
Vaseline lip therapy rosy lips but again
this is one of those things where how
many times am I going to smell something
in this video but I mean it's a little
bit rosy but the texture is kind of just
thick and goopy I just find it to be a
little bit annoying on the lips more so
than just putting regular Vaseline on
it's like this is a little different
formula maybe and I just didn't really
go for it and it didn't make my lips
rosy at all so that my friends is my
epic try this not that on Rose products
rose beauty products hopefully this gave
you some ideas on some different things
you might want to try I just love that
scent in beauty products and I'm glad I
did this video because it forced me to
really analyze everything and figure out
which things were better than others for
me in my opinion so thank you so much
for taking time to watch and I'll see
you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
