this video um I was in Walmart today and
I was in the I think it's sort of like
the kitchen slash storage area of the
store where they've got a lot of
different containers and like drawer
organizers and stuff and I noticed a lot
of kind of like kitchen II stuff that
was actually totally usable for makeup
storage and I actually picked up one of
these things that I'm sure if we all
have in our drawers for you know the
knives forks and spoons and other stuff
like utensils and I thought well you
know that could definitely be used in
some way you know with my makeup storage
they also had neat little um like spice
racks but they weren't really like you
know I mean it was basically like a
three-tiered thing like it looked like
little steps and I thought that could be
me for makeup too it just stood there it
wasn't like didn't say like spice rack
all over it or anything but this stuff
was all around you know five dollars or
less and lots of neat little things that
I hadn't noticed there before I don't
know if they're new or what but like
either meant to store different things
in the kitchen or maybe in your bathroom
and then I thought wow that could be
really great for makeup as well whether
it's in your drawer or on top of your
table and it turns out one thing that I
found is definitely cool and might be
used on me later your dinner table or
somewhere in your kitchen and it's from
a brand called mainstays I think they
make a lot of the kitchen eat stuff
that's there in Walmart and it's a two
tier turntable and it was just super
easy to assemble it was I'm pretty sure
it was definitely maybe between three
and five dollars I think really cheap
and I just instantly saw it and thought
I could use this for my makeup area and
it would be great so I want to show you
how it works and
guys you are looking at my little
turntable thing here I will definitely
show you the rest of my makeup setup
once I kind of implement some other
things I'm thinking about some little
changes I want to make but I do want to
focus on this cool little turntable here
first so as I said it's by the mainstays
brand it's the two-tiered turntable and
when you get it it's not all assembled
like this you get these two little like
discs and then there are three of these
I guess you'd call them pillars that you
just snap on assembly is required but
very easy I was able to do it just fine
and I'll just kind of show you how I've
decided to use this you may be able to
use it in a totally different way if you
have a small collection this could be
awesome too for just storing you know
everything you have or like for me I
used a lot of skin care stuff on this I
actually have something I'm going to be
doing a haul on pretty soon yeah Mac
this looses like a little charged water
thing came as part of a set that I got
there recently but anyway I've got like
my homemade mixing medium that I made it
some mary kay timewise stuff some hand
sanitizer my eye makeup remover some
skincare from bee luscious and Mary Kay
silk be ponds just different things that
I used and I often switch off on but you
can see how easily that this thing just
rotates around there and so you can get
like three hundred and sixty degrees
worth of you know items on there you can
that doesn't make sense
if you can get a lot of items on there
and access it all the way around instead
of having to reach to the back of a
drawer you know it's just a matter of
turning it around so I thought that is
so cool
so I enjoyed that and then I thought for
the top what I was planning to do was
putting my was to put my two glass brush
holder things that I filled with like
the Sephora style beads and and I
thought I could sit those up top but
this is actually not super sturdy you
can see if as I touch it here it's got a
little bit of give to it it's fine for
what I and I have a lot of stuff on
there now and it seems to be fine for
all that but for those two
big glass jars with all the brushes in
them it just did not really want to hold
that that well but what I do have on
here it might look a little jumbled from
this angle here but I've got this little
container this thing right here is from
some gifts that I got ages ago from
covergirl and I've got like my pointy
q-tips and sponges and here I've got all
my primers like Smashbox photo finish
and Rimmel my clean and clear Percy gel
and just some different little skincare
things that are smaller and can't really
stand up on their own and then right
over here I've got some q-tips a hair
clip that I always you know get my hair
out of my face with when I'm doing my
makeup I've got my mini little um brush
hold the Sephora inspired brush holder I
don't know if you guys saw my video
where I went through and like showed how
I made these but I have a little one
that I use for like my tweezers and mini
brushes and stuff like that here I just
filled up another one and I use that for
various tools like my lip brushes and
I've got like a mini pair of scissors
and just random stuff this little guy is
like hilarious it's a little like Tiki
Cup that I've just placed back here and
put my cotton balls in it you can see if
I turn it around here I've got like my
eyelash curlers my mac fix+ there and
yeah that's just a nice little way to
store makeup I think I really enjoy it
just for the fact that it kind of
presents everything everything is very
easy to grab and see and it moves around
just really nice so I just when I when I
knew I was going to get it and figured
out what I was going to do with it I
knew I had to let you guys know so
thanks so much for tuning in and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
