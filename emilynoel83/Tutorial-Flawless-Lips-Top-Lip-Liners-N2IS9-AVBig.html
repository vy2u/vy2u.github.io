good day I know on this channel I've
been singing the praises of lots of
different lip products lately and
recently someone had the bright idea uh
how about you show us you know what is
your lip route what steps do you go
through how do you work in lip liner
just take a start to finish and I
thought that's a great idea I can't
believe I didn't think of this it's
funny it always occurs to me to do some
kind of eye tutorial or maybe you know
different steps for the face the lips
just really don't get enough attention
in terms of tutorials and for this I
want to take you through how I kind of
treat the lips somewhat and get them in
really good condition and then how I
work in the color and other product I
think these steps can apply to any kind
of finished look that you're after like
if you love your frosty lip colors you
love your glossy lips
I think these steps are especially
important if you're going for matte lip
if you're one who's dealing with the
gunky crusty flaky lips those matte
lipsticks they're gorgeous but they'll
tell on you as well if you haven't been
keeping your lips in good condition as
you can see the lip color I'll be
demonstrating today ends up giving you
kind of a rosy neutral look but feel
free to sub in any colors you like to do
this first use my elf lip exfoliator I
take this little tube which has like a
gritty brown sugary type substance in it
have all held together in there with a
moisturizing ball I just like to use
this on bare lips and lately I've been
splitting my lips up into like four
section the top lip left side I just
kind of swirl it on there circular
motions back and forth whatever for
about ten seconds and then I just repeat
that ten seconds on the right side of
the lip ten seconds on the lower part
right side and lower part left side for
me that seems to take care of any rough
spots dry skin but if you still feel
some afterward you know go ahead keep
going take care of any times I feel like
this thing leaves quite a bit of residue
on my lips sometimes it doesn't but if
you need to dab some off go ahead and do
that and just to replenish the moisture
in my lips a little bit and kind of prep
them for my matte lipstick I use a lip
balm that has a matte finish and that's
the EOS lip balm since I have here is in
sweet mint so
get a little bit of that on the lip it's
just a lip liner that somewhat
coordinates with the lipstick that I
plan to use for this look it's the
Milani color statement lip liner in
spice and hang around at the end of the
video I'll give you some more lip liner
recommendations but this is really nice
for anything that's even slightly
neutral all the way to nude I really
like this liner shade I like to line
right on the very outer edge of my lip
now some people like to over line their
lips and look great doing it so if you
like to do that by all means go for
reason why I haven't loved to do that is
that once the lip product starts to wear
off I feel like you're over line kind of
hangs around longer and shows more it
looks kind of unusual once I've gotten
all the way around my lips I like to
kind of fill in on the outer parts I
think this helps your lip line actually
blend with the lipstick that you're
about to put on so I do that kind of the
outer corners of my top and bottom lip
then I apply my lipstick and in some
cases if you've got maybe a really dark
lipstick or a really bright lipstick you
might want to pull in a lip brush to
help you get extra precise application
but for this shade I'm using the Rimmel
Kate Moss matte lasting finish lipstick
number 104 it's kind of a neutrally rosy
shade and I just applied this pretty
lightly actually all over my lips if you
load a lot of this on it can almost have
a little bit of a shine to it so I just
apply a light layer it deposits plenty
of color and it feels very comfortable
on my lips if you do feel like you've
gone overboard and certain matte
lipsticks or products you were hoping
would look matte don't look matte give
your lips a quick block I can kind of
get you to that matte finish or take any
kind of translucent powder like the HD
powders from Make Up For Ever or elf you
can dab those on your lips and those
will take away any excess shine you
might have ended up with now I know this
is seeming like kind of a long process
and you can totally stop with that last
step we did with the lipstick but if you
really want to clean up your line even
more one thing that's nice to do is pull
in a concealer that matches your skin
too I just grabbed this Bare Minerals
correcting concealer in medium too with
a little concealer brush and you can
kind of dab this around the border of
your lips it's sort of amazing how you
will pick up on
little areas that could look even
cleaner around the outside of your lid
finally something that always makes the
lips look a little more full and pouty
is to have a bit of a highlight right
here on your Cupid's bow so I just do
that with my finger and with any kind of
powder you could use an eye shadow as
well and using the hard candy so baked
bronzer which is technically a highlight
in Tiki and just get a little bit of
that on there and I find that it just
makes the lips look like they're
protruding even more from the face and
gives you that fuller look when this
little routine gave you some ideas and
how to get your lips in really good
condition whether you want to put on a
matte lipstick or any color really as
your finished look it absolutely finish
the look with some gloss if that's the
kind of thing you like but I wanted to
touch on lip liners a little bit more
since I have had some questions about
that as far as matte lips go a lot of
lip liners can really be your matte lip
color find most of the lip liners in my
collection do not contain shimmer and
they don't have a particularly glossy
finish either so if you want to just
fill in your entire lips and use a lip
liner as your lip color by all means
feel free to do that my favourite lip
liners are from NYX and Milani and I've
got a bit of a range to show you here as
well all the way from nude a little more
neutral shade a very classic pinky shade
read more of a hot pink and a berry as
well now saying you need all these
shades but if you are planning to layer
with a lipstick it's nice to kind of get
in the ballpark with your lip line I do
think a nude lip liner is great for
anyone to have it really creates a nice
base for all those like really nude lip
glosses I love this particular one
layered with the NYX butter gloss in
creme brulee this shade is the NYX
retractable lip liner in nude
I love these retractable liners first
off you don't have to sharpen them
second of all they go on very creamy if
you want to fill in your whole lips with
something like this you can do it very
easily my most used types of shades is a
little deeper than nude it's something I
would call spice who faced actually
makes a fantastic lip liner called
perfect spice and I lost it randomly but
I think I found something that's really
the exact same shade and it's from
Milani
the shade name is actually spice and
just a pencil like this here's the
swatch this was what I used earlier with
this lip look and it just works so well
for a multitude of nude to neutral type
color like softer pink lip colors nude
pink lips
another NYX retractable lip liner that I
love is in nude pink so that's this
shade right here again super creamy this
does not come off with a lot of shine so
you could totally fill in your lips with
this and wear it just as is if you're
wearing a red lip there's not much that
works better for that than a true red
lip liner so I've got the Milani
color statement lip liner the shade name
is true red it's right here I think
these liners also do a good job of not
bleeding outside my lip line but really
really creamy easy to work with like
I've said with a hot pink lip I'll still
find it like this NYX liner in nude pink
still works really well but if you want
something a little more vivid there's
this Milani liner in fuchsia that's a
really full-on color for the deep
berries of fall my favorite lip liner
that falls into that category is the NYX
lip liner pencil in plum there may be a
retractable version that's really close
to this but I just don't happen to have
it I have this one which is just the
regular pencil and it's this nice dark
plum berry shape so thank you so much
for watching this video hope that
cleared some things up as far as some
ideas for sort of a lip routine thank
you guys so much for watching I'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
