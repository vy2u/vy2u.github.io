um this tutorial is gonna be a little
bit backwards because as you can see my
eye makeup is done but I don't have any
face makeup on I've actually put on
moisturizer primer and concealer because
I want to show you how the Lauren Keller
makeup works I did a review on the baked
basics which was a kind of a three part
kit that came with something called
balanced and brighten that's like a
powder foundation bronze and brighten as
a bronzer and blush and brighten and
berry and then they also give you um see
where I said if I can't see where I put
it actually but they give you a little
like mini kabuki brush to which I'm
actually not going to be using oh here
is this little kabuki brush that is like
tiny it's very cut very blunt right
across and I mean it's just I don't have
much use for that in terms of applying
these products so I'm not actually going
to be using it here so just so you're
aware it does come with this kit but
it's not something I'm gonna be
featuring here in this video so anyway I
have gone ahead and put some concealer
like under my eyes and around you know
sides of my nose but you can still see
there's like a little overall redness
around my nose area so we're gonna see
if the balance and brighten can kind of
neutralize or correct that and I'm going
to be using a kabuki brush for that I
was just thinking I'm not sure what
brand this is actually I know it's not
like one of the major brands I think I
picked it up at either Big Lots or
somewhere like that because it is so
soft and super thick so it's like a
really really great kabuki brush it's
pretty big too I just can't remember
what brand it is
so just use you know whatever brush you
like to use if you were putting on a
powder foundation I'm just gonna kind of
swirl it in there and get some on my
brush and I'm just gonna kind of start
with some light coverage and then sort
of build it up so I'm gonna just start
on my nose here and this applies
pretty smooth obviously it's a powder
and I'm just gonna swirling it in like I
would a mineral product just for
minerals and I can tell just a sort of
an evening out that's going on right now
I'm just kind of sticking it in here and
like giving it a twist and it does have
I mean it has some lighter shades like
if you've watched my review you know
this is kind of a blend of yellows and
tans and beige tones but it there is
something about it that is kind of
brightening the entire face here and I
believe this is a medium tone it doesn't
say on the package but I think that's
the kit I got for this and like I said
this isn't really gonna be a review so
if you want the review I did do that
recently so just look through my videos
and it'll be there okay so now I
basically basically put that all over my
face and I can't notice the evening out
that's happened but what I am gonna do
is take my concealer brush that I used
for dry products and kind of just go
around the eye area once again because I
always you know set any sort of
concealer where I do there and it's also
good to go under your eyeliner typically
I would do this step I would um do my
face first and then my eyes however at
any point in time any time after I do
eye makeup even if the rest of my face
is done I would always go under the
lower lash line with some sort of powder
just to sort of keep anything from
running down if it would and I'm just
gonna kind of reinforce any areas around
my nose that I concealed earlier - okay
so balance and brighten step is done
that sort of the powder foundation phase
of this kit and although I have a small
amount here I really feel like I barely
I made a dent into it and these are also
like I don't know if you can tell but
it's like a little dome in there and you
do have a mirror if you wanted to travel
with it although it's tiny next I'm
going to use the bronze in Brighton I
really like this this is a good bronzer
for fair to medium skin tones I've
noticed it's it's pretty subtle it had
some subtle shimmer to it so if you are
like a fair person who kind of stays
away from bronzer because you're worried
about getting kind of a fake look this
is really natural so I don't think you
have to worry about that I'm gonna use
that kabuki brush that I just used only
I'm not instead of kind of swirling
swirling it into it I'm just gonna kind
of Pat the color on to it so I don't get
quite the coverage I would have gotten
with that foundation and I'm gonna just
start on my forehead and sort of go
right along my hairline just like that
and go right now my nose you're thinking
about areas where the Sun would
naturally hit you so I'm going to go
along the cheeks to
I really like this you can probably see
on the video that my skin has like
warmed up since putting this on and it
didn't take much and I'm also blending
along my jawline just so you know I
don't look like a different human being
from my neck down okay so this is pretty
buildable as you can see um I'm gonna
kind of go over my cheeks a little more
here do maybe a little bit of contouring
with this right down here and there we
go so that's the bronzer right and
that's probably my brush it's that's my
lip gloss don't you hate that I got as
far as my favorites here I really like
the balance and Brighton and the bronze
in Brighton but I will show you I will
show you the blush in Brighton in Barry
which it's a gorgeous shade in the
packaging it's got like some some sort
of berry tones and pinks and golds and
I'm going to use my blush brush for this
and what I've generally found with this
is that it's more shimmery than like a
real colorful blush but it's still
pretty I mean I don't mind it but it
does have a lot of shimmer to it so just
putting out here on the cheeks I am
noting noticing a little color like I
said but just not as much as you would
expect by looking at it
it is pretty though I'm gonna just do it
like a light whatever is left on my
brush I just kind of dust that up here
just to warm it up so that is the look
guys that's what you can do with
basically a three step process I'm gonna
go down and pick this up with the laura
geller baked basics collection again
again it is a powder foundation of
bronzer and a blush and so other than a
little concealer that is all I have on
my face right now I just wanted to
demonstrate in a lot of you had asked
you know can you kind of show the
products in action so this is what you
could pull off with basically those
three face products and of course you
could mix in your own usually I do when
I use these I have a contouring blush
that I use that is covergirl cheekers
and golden pink which I really do like
to use as a contour because it has it's
basically matte and has no shimmer to it
but I mean you can mix in any products
you want but I think even so just using
these you get a really fresh look that's
pretty natural and yet still I can see
that I definitely have gotten some
coverage around some areas where I had
redness or just anything you know that I
know I can see here being close up to
this mirror that maybe you can't see
through this video tape so um anyway I
hope it still need to do my hair so
excuse any bad hair that's going on in
this video but um I hope you enjoyed
this and learn something new about the
products so have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
