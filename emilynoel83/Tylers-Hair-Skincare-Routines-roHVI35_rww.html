this video as you can see Tyler has
decided to take a request and he is
going to be talking about the hair
product he uses yes I just said product
because there's only one thing that he
uses intentare beside shampoo twice a
week but the shampoo he uses really
isn't anything to like he'll just use
whatever shampoo so nothing special
there but um Tyler you want to talk
about what you put this is that you use
in your hair Oh surf hair to this green
oh green yellow tub measure the brain
it's from Garnier is the brand and what
would we call this like a a it has
texture paste matte effect this is sort
of like a pomade but it's not one of
those it's not waxy it's not like it's
not like gel it's sort of like a cream
and the smell how would you describe
that snow mmm yeah like if you've ever
used the Garnier products you know that
they have kind of a fruity scent to all
of them and this just to put a little on
my finger it's kind of a it's not it
doesn't have a greasy feel but it has a
nice enough texture to where you could
feel like you put that in your hair it's
going to stay up and you can see Tyler
its heads you know very short haircut
but Tyler if you lean into the camera a
little bit and kind of tip your head
down you can see what he does is
basically just gets it all the way on
the top and maybe done a little bit on
the sides just to smooth it down some
since I left my hair short I don't
really do anything with the signs at all
but if it starts to grow long just use a
little bit just to keep in between
haircuts this one yeah its allies to
grow straight out from his head but you
can see like this it's kind it's stiff
this wouldn't blow anywhere but it
doesn't have that really crusty like gel
look you probably know what I'm talking
about when the hair just looks wet you
know what I mean yeah yeah its job it
doesn't get like the confuse gel it just
gets like solid I'm actually it looks
like it's well yeah I can still touch it
I mean I can still move it around but it
has a strong enough cool there to where
wind or whatever is not going to affect
it at all and it does so good his hair
smells good and this is just I mean a
very affordable product that you can
find for I'm guessing between three and
four dollars i would say probably at a
walmart or drugstore and this isn't a
strictly like men's hair product either
this is something that it's really just
like a texturizing product so if you
were a girl and you wanted just to give
your hair a little more like way or
texture you can kind of scrunch this
into your hair and if you have really
fine hair maybe that might make it a
little less that way but Tyler how long
have you use that long time
like probably at least at least yeah so
would you recommend this or what would
you say to people who have you know
maybe guys that have similar here to you
um I'm will use gel and I like that as
much because it seemed like there was a
period where it would be wet when he
first put it on take me it takes quite a
while before it would actually dry and
then once it dried would be like hardly
you almost hurt to touch this stuff and
this is more of a soft texture and it
dries like once you put it in your to
worry about collapsing or anything like
that you use like what size dollop
depends on how long my hair is good mmm
you're like a dime size yeah maybe a
little more than that okay and then you
just kind of put it on both your hands
or how do you get it into your hair I'll
use most of it on the front because
that's what actually has to stand up so
you just kind of get on your fingers on
your fingertips road to the front and
then we'll just come here able to cross
the back and it's going to pull up in a
couple of little spots and let me tell
you he does not take a lot of time with
30 seconds yeah so I mean you girls like
myself probably know you know it's
really frustrating how a guy can get his
hair the way he wants it in less than a
minute and we have to spend time with a
lot of different products and this is
the only thing he uses and that works
for him so that's pretty much the only
thing you would do this
here so there is that and while people
have asked about that they've also asked
about Tyler skincare routine and Tyler
um you just to let people know what your
history has been so if people are
watching her and they can identify with
this you had had like some kind of acne
related problems yeah quite a while back
though right yea high school early
college okay well it was the worst okay
and you think maybe that was because you
maybe didn't have like either a
consistent face washing schedule that
you were on or you weren't doing it
maybe twice a day like you should or I
mean were you not maybe doing all the
right things with your skin probably
some of that okay that's how you tell me
um and so what Tyler does lately um what
he had been finding kind of gave him a
turnaround recently because he was kind
of having a little bit of that problem
coming I like patchy well I don't really
want to say acne but just some breakouts
at times in some areas and so he what he
was basically doing was probably a lot
of guys do squirting out some face wash
putting it on the shower and then
washing your face off and hoping that
gets rid of everything but I suggest you
use what i use which is these ol a daily
facials quads one side is softer one
side has more of a texture to it that
would be more of an exfoliating side and
don't you feel like when you use this
you can kind of scrub on your face a
little bit and you
kind of like what's the feeling that the
two sides of her sides like a rapid
scribbly okay so usually just do that
first and these are for oily combination
skin is the one that we use and you
don't feel like it okay because in the
morning when you take a shower explain
to people what this is this is just like
clean clear face wash Hey okay what is
that it's just clearing clear um I don't
know what this specific one is but
everyone will use any kind of this is
deep action refreshing gel cleanser its
oil free this is one of the newer ones
they have out and it really deals yeah
your skin has kind of a tingle when you
get done with it so um I used like the
oil free acne wash sort of thing just
just something basic because sometimes
when you wake up in the morning you
don't need maybe all the scrubbing
action that you might want after a day
of whatever so in the morning then
that's step one for Tyler then you use
this actually is that a 920 use this it
day and night no just it not just at
night okay after you wash your face cuz
I do like me get pretty much everything
off in the shower but I don't pay that
much attention mapa dish okay the
so-called mop-up duty is the American
blemish control toner formula 3 this was
something I had but I never used when
they were to is crab I never had 4
yellow food I don't know it's a two
percent salicylic acid acne medication
you probably heard that ingredient
tossed around with a lot of acne related
products so Tyler's use this it's
generally kept you pretty clear you've
got eight minutes okay and moisturizing
what did you notice about your skin
since you started using this ol a
complete moisture with SPF 15 for normal
skin you you had told me this the other
day and I thought this was a pretty good
observation you you said that you think
your skin it's clearer when you want you
know ever since he's been using this in
the morning yeah um and I think why that
is is because sometimes people with the
their skin gets dried out and I think it
can be more prone to sometimes getting
irritated and more likely to break out
at time so if you're using a moisturizer
something that is not this is like this
is not greasy you will when I trying to
say keep your skin a little more supple
and healthy and a little less prone to
the breakouts and now we'll quick 30
seconds clean and clear personnel this
is another thing i use it's just like it
on the spot acne treatment right you
don't put it all over your face they
just use my last pose okay um let's see
anything else anything else we need to
add mmm good we thank you for your
comments and everything for the last
video we had that was really sweet that
I was feeling the love and then I so if
you have any more requests let us know
