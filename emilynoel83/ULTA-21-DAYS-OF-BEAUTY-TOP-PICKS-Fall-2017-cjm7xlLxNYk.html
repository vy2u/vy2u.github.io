days of beauty does anyone else feel
like this just happened I don't know
what it is but I feel like I just did a
video talking about this and now it's
happening again everybody's asking what
are your picks what are your picks and
I'm shooting this ahead of the sale
actually starting so I felt like I had
to scour the internet to find what the
products were that we're going on sale
but I got it now I got my picks there
are definitely some picks I didn't feel
like I was overwhelmed with things in
this sale like oh my gosh there's so
much stuff that I want but I do have
quite a few recommendations of things
that I've tried and also a couple things
that I want too so it's September 3rd
through 23rd and I will link in the
description box to where you can access
the sale and see all the stuff but the
way this whole thing works is that they
do have some Hot Buys which are
available every day throughout the sale
I guess until they sell out but then
there are certain new deals introduced
every single day of the sale so I'm
gonna highlight my hot my favorites
first one thing that I was so excited to
see is a hot Buy and it's something that
I have tried and love and I would love
to get in more shades as well and it's
the bare minerals Gen nude liquid lip
colors sorry I'm looking now I'm just
trying to get all the info they're down
to $13 for the sale and one of my
favorites is a shade called boss that's
what I'm wearing in this video and I
have the many of that thinking about
getting the full size of that and maybe
trying a few new shades as well but just
discussing this formula briefly it
smells really good I think I've compared
it to the scent of the Bonnie Bell lip
lights and cappuccino there are certain
products a few products on the market
that just have that kind of a sense like
vanilla but it's not a real pure vanilla
like there's something a little extra
coming through there's probably like
five people watching who know what I'm
talking about with that reference that
these are like the most comfortable
liquid lip colors out there for sure
I know I've recently talked about the
maybelline superstay matte inks and
those are just amazing they've got
impeccable staying power they're
lightweight comfortable on the lips
that being said these are even more
comfortable in that just a little less
drying I'm not trying to call the
Maybelline ones super drying or anything
but these just have more of a feel of
moisture like you press your lips
together and you can just tell it there
something still there even though it is
a matte liquid lipstick but the one
little sacrifice you make with these is
the staying power they can transfer off
case-in-point my squirrel mug here yeah
some of its coming off but even with
that they do wear super super evenly and
now with the sale you're not paying that
much more than you would pay for some
drugstore lip colors so I'm happy to see
those go on sale and I will be taking
advantage of that another hot buy is the
tarte empowered gel foundation or hybrid
gel foundation this is one of those
underrated products I don't feel like it
gets a lot of buzz I have done a video
where I applied this and it was kind of
a dewy hydrating foundation routine so
I'll link to that below for a little
more info but this is what it looks like
you know it's a jar of foundation as you
can see the consistency is far from
runny we can do the blizzard test it's
not gonna pop out that's just fun to do
but you can blend this in with a Beauty
Blender with a brush I'm wearing it
today it does have really nice coverage
I wouldn't go as far as to call it full
coverage but it's kind of a buildable
medium coverage offers quite a bit of
moisture back to the skin it's the kind
of foundation that I definitely like to
set but I feel like it continues to look
fresh throughout the day I think normal
to dry skin would really enjoy this
foundation I wear it in light neutral
and I think just the added price
markdown gives you a little extra
incentive to try it out another hot buy
on the list are the mini Smashbox
primers really excited about this
because Smashbox has so many versions of
primers so this is kind of a neat way to
get to try some without a huge price
commitment and one in particular that
I'd like to recommend is the pore
minimizing I've talked about this before
as being something that I think really
helps extend the staying power of
whatever foundation you might be putting
on top and I really particularly noticed
that around my nose you can see it kind
of mattifying actually minimizing the
look of pores as you put it on but I
swear there is a prolonged like staying
power effect with this as you wear it
throughout the day if you're familiar at
all with benefits Porefessional it's not
as thick as that this has a little more
slip across the skin it feels like a
lighter layer of product going on so I
really enjoy that now like I said
earlier there are specific deals coming
out on certain days and some of
our online only deals so I'll try to
point that out either on the screen or
verbally tell you when it's an
online-only deal the first one is online
only at September 4th and it's the
Mallee shadow sticks ok just did a whole
video on cream shadows how to use them
and so this would be a great opportunity
to get a cream shadow that I love and
work it into your look-sees Mally shadow
sticks I have been a longtime fan and it
is for good reason these were some of
the first shadow sticks in my collection
that I would use and feel like yes they
actually set they don't move you know
you swatch them out they stay in place
they have such beautiful shimmery
finishes these are a few of the shades I
would recommend we've got shimmering
moth then this one in the middle is
autumn shimmer I'm actually wearing that
on my lids today and then champagne over
here is kind of one of those can't-miss
just adds a little shine you know to any
look or it's a great thing around your
innermost corner wherever you want to
put it I can totally get behind the fact
that these are retractable sticks so you
don't have to sharpen anything and you
know they've got a little width to them
but they're not like unbearably chunky
so you have easy control to just get
them across your lid and like I said
I've got the autumn shimmer all over my
lid it reminds me of like on my skin but
dewy or and shinier type of shade really
so I've got that paired with some matte
shadows in my crease and in the outer
corner and I just used that very
technique that I talked about in my last
video it makes cream shadows so easy
here's another online-only deal that I
think is worth taking note of September
10th the NARS cheeks studio palette is
2750 so that's about half off there this
is what it looks like
mirrored front and then all this inside
I think this is a pretty darn good value
here because you're getting the Laguna
bronzer a good generous size by the way
and then the Paloma contour blush I
don't know if anybody remembers but many
moons ago I reviewed that over on the
Express channel so you've got this matte
kind of contour yet this shades kind of
like a rosy contour some people might
even use that as a blush and then this
great matte shade here which I actually
used is under eye setting powder today
on top of my concealer for blushes on
the bottom here this one is
Goulet I believe it's called this is one
of those rosy kind of shimmery shades
sort of that in from the cold type of
flush is what it gives you a little bit
warmer rustier type color these two
light shades I mean the video won't give
them justice this neutral has a little
bit of shimmer in it some little like
flecks of glittery shimmer and then this
light shade you would not think that
that might show up on my cheeks as blush
but yes it can show up as blush it's the
satiny finish baby pink really unusual
shade and today I've got some of this
actually a little bit lower on the cheek
and then I've got quite a bit of this
shade sort of layered up on the apple of
my cheek just giving myself that subtle
bit of color I've got a mix of Laguna
and the contour blush shade just all
over the perimeter of the face so this
palette can go a lot of different ways
if you generally enjoy NARS products and
this might be a nice thing to have just
travel wise it makes it easy to have
that all in one or if you just want to
start experimenting and get a really
good deal on it that you wouldn't get
elsewhere I do think this palette is one
of the really good deals in the sale
let's mention yet another online-only
deal on September 16th dose of colors
matte liquid lipstick is going to be $9
there's a thing that I have not really
experimented with from that line but I
really want to try so I've got my eyes
on that sale September 16th I'm gonna
mark that down I have tried and really
enjoyed some eyeshadow palettes from
dose of colors and I've heard great
things about the liquid lipsticks I just
like to see how those compare to other
liquid lipstick formulas I like like
Maybelline and bare minerals and stuff
like that you know I'm just curious
September 20th this does not say online
only a matte lipstick Russian red and
velvet teddy
875 each I'm pretty sure I have not
tried Russian red so that may be
something I need to look into but velvet
teddy so funny this is a shade that I
very recently tried and I was like what
this shade is so beautiful why have I
not used this before like is that kind
of warm neutral shade that I think so
many people would love it is a matte
finish and I'll try to go back and find
the picture where I was wearing this but
I just think this is a beautiful
beautiful shade I say it's warm but it
also has like this mix
I don't know a little bit of warmth but
also mob in there as well just a hint of
it I don't know I find it really
gorgeous I couldn't decide which I
wanted to wear in this video the
bareMinerals or this but I thought there
might be a little bit more question of
what the bareMinerals shade was so
that's why that's the one on my lips
today
and then finally September 21st my
baby's birthday Bell's birthday Laurie
Gaylor balancing Brighton that's
regularly 33 dollars and it's gonna be
down to 1650 this may not be the kind of
thing that is always in my daily makeup
rotation but in terms of powder
foundation I think this is a great
product it's really one of the best I'm
like the medium shade in this line or
sometimes it's called regular kind of a
corrective foundation it's swirled with
tones of like tan and beige and yellow
it's matte but it doesn't look like
chalky and unnatural on the skin
definitely has coverage it can amp up
the coverage of any foundation if you
want to layer it on top my mom has been
a big fan of this product sometimes
she'll use like a more lightweight
moisturizer and then kind of rely on
this for more of the coverage I've had
many sizes of these and it's taken me so
long to even hit pan on them or actually
you literally will hit a terracotta tile
because they are baked on tiles it's
really an amazing long-standing product
in Laura Geller's line and there are so
many baked things like baked in my mind
sometimes gets a bad rap because I'm
thinking about things that are dry
things that don't have a lot of color
payoff things you really have to work
with to get them to show up on your skin
this is not in that category this is
smooth even coverage this is baked like
done right so just keep that in mind and
I have it in special packaging here but
I believe when you normally buy it it
will be in a black compact but that's it
folks looking through the whole range of
what's being offered for this Ulta 21
days of beauty sale those are the things
that stand out to me as great product
sets that I've tried and I love but also
like with the dose of colors something I
want to try and take advantage of with
the lower price all the individual
things that I've talked about are linked
below thank you guys so much for taking
time to watch and I will see you soon
