let you know the I look it's a little
dramatic a little something different
today it's part of a challenge that I'm
taking part in and that challenge will
be in a video that's posted on Saturday
so yeah looking forward to sharing that
with you meanwhile I have an Ulta haul I
feel like I just did a haul because I
shared a bunch of new stuff from ELF
that I got and yeah I went to Ulta
recently and guess what there was a
bunch of new stuff there too so this is
pretty much entirely drugstore there is
one thing I'll just get it out of the
way I bought another Mally volumizing
mascara it's the kind in the white tube
I just you know laid eyes on it and I
was like I haven't used that mascara in
awhile and I absolutely love that
mascara for a period of time and then
you know how it goes you just start
trying new things and you lose sight of
those certain products that were
tried-and-true favorites for a while so
I thought I'm gonna try that again but
I'm not letting myself crack it open for
a while cuz I got a few other mascaras
that I need to use up but now it's all
drugstore and first off many new things
that I saw from almay there's a new age
essentials line so I'll get to that but
for weeks I've been trying to track down
this Alma smart smart shade it is
luminous cz primer and it's got SPF 15
in it and it looks just kind of like a
light
glowy primer with a pump I had read some
article I think it was about a makeup
artist who was raving about it and I
just you know got it in my head that I
wanted to try this and then wherever I
went it wasn't either not in stock or
the one that was sitting there had
already been like pumped out and tested
clearly in the store I hate it what
people do that so finally tracked it
down at Ulta and first off I do love the
pump the pump is great this primer is
very glowy I used quite a bit of it I
think I used too much on my skin today
and that's maybe why I noticed all the
globe but it's a nice consistency
it feels really smooth it adds a little
bit of added moisture to the skin so I
kind of feel like some dry skin folks
who feel like they have kind of a dull
complexion might enjoy this it does
really have a decent amount of
whoa happening and I'm excited to be
trying this alongside a variety of new
foundations different foundations that I
have but as far as the aged essentials
line this is the new almay stuff on the
shade and light medium is what I got it
says aged essentials makeup multi
benefit anti-aging SPF 15 so pump style
dispenser again which we love this
foundation is what I'm wearing today it
seemed kind of like a just a straight up
medium coverage to me I wasn't too wowed
by that but what I'm having trouble
gauging is just how glowy this truly is
because I was putting it on top of this
so I'm going to have to use this you
know - a glowy primer to really know
like what is the true finish of this
foundation and something else I noticed
about this foundation and a reason why I
think it might be better for drier
skinned folks is that it never really
set like it continued to have kind of a
dewy tacky feel to it and I just had to
totally set my face with powder if I
wanted that sort of taken away just some
initial thoughts on this stuff I will
absolutely keep trying it I will
probably review a lot of this new almay
stuff like all together just so it sort
of makes sense if I also picked up this
aged essentials concealer I have this in
the shade light/medium it is packaged so
much like the Revlon Photoready
concealer and this though I feel is
maybe even smoother that one is still a
very blendable easy to work with
concealer definitely different from the
drive stick concealers from years and
years ago or they were just like pulling
a stick of clay across your skin or
something this is super smooth and I was
actually incredibly impressed by the
coverage this is all I'm wearing on my
under eye area today I set it with a
little powder I just thought I'm gonna
see how this does without pulling in any
kind of peachy corrector and just see
what this concealer can tackle and I
think I'm really going to enjoy this
because like I said it's non drying if
you're gonna use it up around the under
eye area I don't think you have to worry
about it looking you know too cakey and
dry but it just have really impressive
coverage for me so that's been kind of
my WoW thing for
the new almay stuff so far I also try to
lip-balm the packaging is ginormous I
mean it's not like it's a real jumbo
limo home you know but it's just it's
really packaged up and this is what it
looks like it's at that little pink core
and it's the aged essentials lip
treatment it does have an SPF 30 in it
which is nice if you've ever dealt with
sunburned lips you know that's a good
thing the scent on this it makes me
think of cotton candy which I love so
it's got a very like lightly sweet
enjoyable scent feels really smooth and
creamy going on and something else I
noticed about it like after it had set
on my lips for like five minutes I
looked at my mouth and I felt like I
just wasn't seeing the lines as much in
my lip and it's not that this was really
working as a lip plumper but whatever
moisture this was offering with just
this alone on my lips it really gave my
lips a nice smoothed out appearance so I
do think I'm gonna enjoy that lip balm
as well
ran into some things from essence I do
not know how new they are truly but
they're new to me I had never seen them
yet and they have these little contour
powder powder duo things and I've had to
get this because it reminded me so much
of the Milani sunset duos anybody
remember those from like I don't know
2008-2009 and they had that little like
blush and bronzer combo well this is
more of like a contour or contour slash
bronzer and highlight combo and I got it
in medium and I am wearing this as a
little bit of a bronzer contour shade it
just strikes me more as a bronzer it's
got this sort of golden a tone that when
it sheers out on your skin you see it
more but it's got a very subtle sort of
highlight thing here happening to I'm
wearing that as well so I liked it you
know it was decent it didn't really blow
me away they also have this little say
no to dark circles pencil and I thought
it was gonna be you know a little more
peachy it actually comes off on the skin
very much like a light pink I'll swatch
it for you here you can see how pinky
that is but a lot of color comes off
right so it is a pigmented product it's
very creamy it's not dry but I wouldn't
think of this so much is something
that's going to camouflage dark circles
but
more as like a brightener if you've got
barely there circles it might be enough
for you or you could you know camouflage
your circles with your favorite
concealer or corrector and then use this
like right in that cavern to sort of
brighten up extra I'm not wearing this
today but I was playing with it a couple
days ago and it wasn't quite doing the
job on its own another thing from
essence that I wanted to test against
some other little tinted brow mascaras
brow gels is this make me brow it's the
exact same size as the old packaging of
benefit gimme brow and it's got this
very you know small wand here I'm trying
to see if it has yes it does have little
fibers in here too so I just swept a
little bit of this on after I filled in
my brows with pencil and I can tell it
definitely has some hold I don't know
that it's quite as strong as benefit
gimme brow but I think I'm gonna need to
wear this completely on its own to see
exactly how much it thickens and fills
the brows but just so you know that's
out there and I have it in the shade too
brownie brows and I know there was a
blonde shade there also now these next
two things I actually picked up at
Walgreens but I'm throwing them into the
Ulta haul and this is a L'Oreal quad
it's the color riche pocket palette and
the shade I picked up is French biscuit
a lot of the shade combos seemed like
things I'd seen over and over again like
you know here's a quad of Blues here's a
quad of purples and it was just sort of
predictable this one I thought had some
sort of interesting things happening
because this color kind of appeared to
be matte same with this and then you've
got kind of a metallic bronze II shade
and this really sparkly color and I'm
gonna swatch these out for you I have
not worn these yet on my eyes but I was
so impressed with the swatches actually
you've got the peachy shade the matte
warm Brown kind of like the same shade
of brown but a different finish it's a
little more shiny and then this charcoal
color with some sparkle in it and I love
that that's not just a glittery
overspray that really pretty very fine
shimmer does kind of
translate in the swatch very nicely so
I'm super excited to use this maybe I
could do like a little quick look
tutorial with that but very pleased with
the textures of these and I think
they're going to be nice on the ice the
other new L'Oreal thing that I picked up
is this voluminous base so a voluminous
lash and I thought maybe I'll like this
because I have really enjoyed the primer
side that has been on like the double
extend mascaras from L'Oreal and this
does remind me kind of of that feel you
know it is a white lash primer it's not
one of those loose fiber things you know
it's creamy and I put it on today I felt
like I got a lot of added thickness out
of it I used it and then I put covergirl
super sizer over the top I didn't feel
like this offered a lot of added length
at all and what concerned me a little
bit is you know I have curl challenge
lashes they don't like to be told what
to do or you know stay nicely curled but
super sizer normally keeps the curl and
then I felt like it fell a little faster
after I put the primer on and that's
normally my only complaint about L'Oreal
voluminous regular mascara so I don't
know I'm willing to give this some more
tries I'm willing to combine it with
some other mascaras and see how it goes
but I gotta say I don't have a really
high expectation for that one the rest
of my stuff from this haul boy did I
like run into some crazy good body and
skincare things first thing Neutrogena
age shield face lotion I was just
browsing through the sunscreen area I
wanted something that was a little bit
improved from what I'd been wearing on
my face you know out by the pool and
this has broad-spectrum SPF 110 and I
know I've heard that once the SPF goes
past a certain point I don't know if
it's 30 or 50 or something in there they
say it's not really doing anything extra
for you but my concern has been like
ever since having built I feel like my
skin has been melasma prone up in this
area so sunspot hyperpigmentation type
look when exposed to the Sun that can
happen pretty easily on me so I thought
who cares let's just try it out this
also claims to be water-resistant for 80
minutes
so I've been using it a few times it
seems to have worked well it seems to be
pretty moisturizing just on its own too
so yeah I'm busting out the big guns for
my sentence right now and I don't care
to new face masks that I had to try from
Freeman one is the apple cider vinegar
foreign one foaming clay mask I mean
who's not intrigued by the concept that
I had to try that out and I am going to
probably have Tyler try that one out
with me and then the coconut Glo leave
on bronzing mask when I got this the
checkout girl was like oh I've got to go
find that and try it it says bronzes and
moisturizes so I don't know if we're
having like an actual self tanning
experience with this but it smells great
I think I'm gonna enjoy it but I will
report back saw many many new soap and
glory items in my local Ulta store
including a big size of this sugar crush
body wash you know I love the sugar
crush body butter cream been using that
a lot it's the scent is a margarita
float because it's kind of that bite and
tartness of lime mixed with a creamy
kind of vanilla ice cream type scent and
needless to say I was not disappointed
by the body wash either it's great buck
tried it he's like whoa that is really
good because he smelled the lotion on me
before he's never actually put it on but
I guess he's willing to try it in body
wash form and he loves it so it's just
been a while since I've browsed in an
Ulta store so forgive me if some of this
stuff has been around forever but the
line of products Ulta brand bath
products that look like this this one
says soothed luxe I don't know like what
is the actual label because these look
different from just you know the regular
Ulta body products and this one says
luxurious cleansing body wash lavender
and berries I was just drawn to smell
this one and it smells so good it's kind
of unique I definitely sense both the
lavender and the berries I might not
have thought I would have loved that
scent but it really really appeals to me
and as far as the way it performs in the
shower
you know just classic shower gel nothing
super remarkable about it but you know
it works fine and the
and I got this body cleansing oil get
ready because there's four products that
I got from this Ulta line because it was
buy 2 get 2 free but the body cleansing
oil and coconut plus almond milk and it
says with argan oil and coconut oil and
what intrigued me was the fact that this
is supposed to foam up it says foaming
oil cleanser I don't know it smells
great but to me it just seemed like a
more runny watered-down version of the
body wash it kind of foamed up in the
same way does feel nice on the skin I
don't know that I really came out of the
shower feeling super extra hydrated or
anything so I'm not like doing backflips
over this product but the coconut and
almond milk does smell really good and
then other stuff from this Ulta bodyline
aromatherapy shower tablets these were
sold right by those other body products
I just mentioned and I thought yes I
love this idea
uh-huh I got the eucalyptus and sage and
I got the verbena and lemongrass cool
thing about these you get four tablets
in each one of these and they are all
individually wrapped so if you wanted to
take these with you somewhere you know
you're not gonna risk like getting them
all messy all over your bag I use the
eucalyptus and sage last night
loved it you're supposed to put it in
your shower it says on your shower floor
or shelf where it gets wet but it's not
in the main water stream and as it
fizzes the aroma is released into the
shower and surrounding bathroom and yes
it's it's so great if you were dealing
with a cold or congestion I think the
eucalyptus and sage would just be
perfection for you I've not tried the
verbena and lemongrass yet but I just I
love this kind of thing like making your
own bathroom into a spa type experience
so those are really cool and the scent
is really potent like once you unwrap a
little tab what you're like oh my gosh
it's so strong and then you know it just
kind of sheers out or what's the word
I'm looking for as it fizzes up in the
shower it just kind of lightens up and
it's that perfect aroma I love it
and wow that's it for my haul from Ulta
I did a lot of damage but I felt like I
found some cool new things yes stay
tuned for more coverage on that Almay
stuff because I really want to continue
testing the foundation
just loving that concealer I was really
thrilled with what that was able to do
so thank you for watching guys and I
will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
