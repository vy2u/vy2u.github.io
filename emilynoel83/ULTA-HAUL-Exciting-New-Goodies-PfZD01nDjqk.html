you're here for this Ulta haul video
I've got a really like diverse selection
of things in here actually on several of
the products that were in my video like
my throwback video where I Reaper just a
bunch of older products that I first
started out my makeup life with some of
those things and came from Ulta but I'm
not gonna rehash them because you
already really saw those a lot in that
video with the application and all but
yeah I would say this video is mostly
new stuff I've got the hair very sleek
and straight today so I feel like it's
gonna be a real temptation to get it out
of my eyes I don't know it might end up
in a bun by the end of this first things
first I got this number 7 airbrush away
foundation and I had seen this like
strolling through the aisles of Target
time after time and I just kind of kept
passing it up but then you know ulties
website worked whatever magic ulties
website tends to work on me and I got it
and I got it in the shade cool beige and
it actually is a really good shade match
for me I'm wearing it today this is kind
of what I expected that make up forever
water blend foundation to be like
because it is so so thin and liquidy but
this seems a little more concentrated it
seems like there's a little more
coverage it has kind of a velvety finish
on the skin it doesn't look unnatural
but it really doesn't look that glowy
either that says flawless and smooth
looking skin in every light create your
perfect complexion with this incredibly
light feeling foundation and it says
clever optical blurring powders give a
velvet yet radiant finish like your
complexion has been placed into soft
focus so I'm kind of see where they're
coming from with that it's not like it's
liquid to powder necessarily but it just
has a softness to it that it develops on
the skin and I used a sigma f80 brush to
blend it in because I think sometimes
really thin foundations work very well
with the dense brush especially if
you're trying to build up some coverage
but I found but basically really good
coverage out of this product
surprisingly good for his thin as it is
probably one of the best like ultra
ultra thin I mean look at it just drip
from the little dropper there it's
really really light I think it's kind
buildable to an extent I wouldn't say
it's full coverage but maybe medium to
full would be a good way to describe it
because I think you can like add a
little more over certain areas and get a
little bit fuller look but it will be
interesting to see how this wears
because this is my first day trying it
so this is a whole video you know I will
certainly keep you in the loop on this I
was just really drawn to it and so far
so good I know their foundation I got is
from the Kardashian beauty line it
looked like this line which is kind of
you know on the drugstore side of Ulta
selection it looks like they came out
with a few new things including a
foundation and a palette that I also got
but this says no apologies liquid makeup
I got it in natural beige it has a
little pump right there I was just kind
of playing with this on my hand the
other day because I have not worn it yet
it's not a fowling that it seems to
catch the light a bit I'm guessing kind
of a medium coverage on that as well but
I'm thinking I will show more of that in
a future video as well as this um they
had several different color options in
this no apologies face kit I chose the
one in slay it because you know I'm
always talking about slaying things or
anything not so much but okay here's the
colors you've got a blush and a
highlight and then like a quad of
shadows here and a quad of shadows over
here and what I didn't realize until I
got this thing is that you see this
little like semi circles on the back you
can actually pop each of these chunks of
product out so I don't really have
anything else to put in here right now
because this is the only palette I have
but if you were buying multiples you
could kind of switch them out and make
them exactly how you want them to be see
I just pumped that highlight out very
easy so I'm going to show you some
swatches here and I gotta say it was
pretty dang surprised by the color
payoff with these shadows particularly I
mean the blush and the highlight that
highlight practically feels like it's a
cream you know it's got a really
different texture when you put your
finger into it as far as the shadows I
can identify one that's 100% matte and
it's the shade that's kind of blending
into my skin tone right there it's this
kind of beige shade but I must say the
whole reason why I chose this palette
over the others was the green that green
just really looked pretty and it seems
to swatch pretty well also
kind of a metallic olive but not too
brownish you know it's still got some
punch in there and that like that quad
pulls in the dark plum as well and the
Blues are no slouch either I mean they
all have this kind of creamy smoothness
some shades are more shimmery than
others it seems like some have little
flecks of sparkle in them but how do
they apply I don't know yet so that will
really tell the tale I think but it's
like a 1699 palette so it's really
walking the line from being a total I
think drugstore price range so if you're
interested I may work those into a
little demo or tutorial coming up now
the other palette that I got is tarts
new release and it is a collaboration it
says styled by her Uche and her Uche is
here on the back and she's looking very
glam and beautiful but she's a makeup
artist says she's self-taught and has
gotten her name out there to an
impressive celebrity following her to
correct me if I'm wrong but I think one
of the people who she did makeup for is
Kylie Jenner so I think that may have
helped get her name out there a little
bit more I hope I'm thinking of the
right person here I got an email on this
it was the Ulta like platinum perk early
access type thing and I think that was
ultimately what kind of like got in
there and I was like oh maybe I want to
get this early if I want see what this
is all about it really does look like a
pretty palette and I've kind of steered
clear from some of tarts palettes lately
just because I feel like their shadow
palettes they always kind of put the
same color selection in there so once
you've got a couple of tart shadow
palettes it's like they they always have
those Browns maybe a berry or purplish
color and it's not that I don't like
those shades but how much of it do I
actually need I just love if they'd go
out into just maybe a little different
color scheme for one of these palettes
right like something maybe into the
olive range or is something slightly
different for whatever reason this one
just really caught my eye I thought the
blush looked good and I thought let's
just try it out you know plus I've got
this early access and I feel special so
I bought it I got it it's really hard to
hold it because that metallic gold
packaging really catches the light but
it is a very pretty palette it's got
this like maybe a Python type print on
the
which is really gorgeous so here are my
swatches I've got the blush real big
over here and then all of the shadows
and the top three you know have a lot of
metallic shine to them and they're
really soft they're very very pigmented
and then your bottom ones are all matte
and you've got kind of a peachy mix of
peach and brown sort of in that shade a
nice rich brown that's deep but not too
deep and then a medium kind of Toby
shade the mattes are very powdery so
don't get too excited you know when you
stick your brush into them because a lot
of powder will get kicked up but all in
all I do think the quality of Tarte
shadows in terms of pigmentation and
just the way they apply they apply very
nice and evenly I think they're as good
as they've ever been you know I've seen
Tarte go through a lot of changes going
back to you know holiday collections of
years past the shadow texture has
certainly become richer softer smoother
and I do find this color selection to be
a really nice like summer into fall type
transition palettes so what I'm wearing
today I've got this reddish shade all
over my lid I'll say it's a little bit
more berry than I expected I think in
the email in the picture I saw it looked
much more like a straight-up
red but it seems to apply a little bit
more like a burgundy berry which is fine
but that's what I've got all over my lid
I've got pinch and Kitty in the crease
list this color right here is my
highlight under the brow and around the
inner corner and then I smudged both of
these shades for a really really dark
and smoky lower lash line so I like how
the palette can achieve depth and
darkness but at the same time you're not
getting like world's deepest darkest
brown or even a black in here I'm sorry
my hair has changed like a zillion times
it's it's behind my ear it's off my ear
I can't I can't handle it but what I'm
wearing that as well really really happy
with a nice pigmented matte blush I
thought went on evenly looks really
pretty
definitely pairs nicely with the color
selection so yes I'm happy with the
palette but if you got a big stash of
makeup it's like did my collection
really call for this did I really need
these kinds of shades that I already
have several times over probably not I'm
just going to be honest
myself there and as I was glancing at
this it actually does kind of remind me
of some of the things that are happening
in my lorac pro three it's definitely
not identical but it's just I don't know
what it occurs to me that something
might be similar I like to point that
out and while we're talking about what's
on my face today let's move on to lips I
am wearing a matte liquid lipstick today
which I haven't really been into wearing
a lot of these lately but I got this
bareMinerals meet Jen new duo
I think it was around 15 bucks to get
one of their matte liquid lip colors and
their butter cream glosses so bare
minerals has launched this whole like
big selection different formats
different formulas of nude lip colors
I've had some questions about these so I
thought this would be a perfect way just
to sample and then if I'm interested you
know I can dig in more but I'm wearing
the matte liquid lipstick in the shade
bus so it's this pretty like brownish
kind of deep neutral and I really love
the way this feels it went on I thought
very thin but it didn't have that
intense dry down that some of these
liquid lipsticks have that being said
it's not transfer resistant either you
know I can easily rub off a little color
onto my finger but it just has a
lightness to it and my lips don't feel
extremely dry and parched but still
you're getting a fully matte effect and
it's one of the few matte lip products
where I feel like I can get a good close
look at my lips and I'm not totally
seeing lines galore you know it actually
looks like okay I've got pretty smooth
lips and they just happen to me that
today so I'm very happy with that I like
the color
I like the texture I'm really excited to
get a look at is how is it going to
where is it going to wear off in a dry
patchy way am I going to continue to
feel the sense of moisture on my lips
even though it's a matte lip color that
remains to be seen for me but I'm really
pleased with that and then before I put
this on I was playing around I couldn't
decide which I wanted to wear for the
video the gloss or the matte but this is
the gloss and the shade sugar so it's
really just a nice classic nude gloss
with a little bit of pink in that shade
I found it to have a nice bit of
thickness to it but not quite as thick
and sticky as the marvelous Moxie lip
products which I like those - those have
that kind of
minty vibe and they're kind of thick
they actually wear a decently long time
but this I guess a feels really
comfortable little bit thinner and just
a really pretty shade to get to sample
another new lip product I got was
another one of these color jolts from
Maybelline I pretty sure this was the
shade Erica Jones was talking about in
her favorites video but it's violet
rebel and I already had like a light
pink color in this line and the reddish
orange shade and I really really like
these I think the color payoff is pretty
intense
I like the applicator which is kind of
one of those where the product squeezes
up through yep I really love this kind
of color
I mean it's purpley but yet it's got I
don't know if you can see where it's
sheared out just a little bit there's
that there's a pink eNOS underneath and
when I was wearing this the other day I
felt like once the highly shiny purpley
Glaus wore off I was kind of left with
this pinkish purple type stain almost on
my lips that's kind of a light fruity
scent to it and by the way a scented
thing that I didn't really mention
before Tarte shadows any more or
smelling really sweet they're almost
kind of reminding me of like a Too Faced
chocolate bar type scent just FYI
something else I picked up from the
drugstore side was this Palladio rice
powder and I was in that mode of like
what's old is new again type things you
know there were certain things on my
list that I wanted for that video and
then this thing I just randomly picked
up I never tried this but I'd seen this
over and over again in Ulta in Sally
Beauty Supply I've used the rice like
blotting papers but I thought let's go
ahead and try the loose powder and it's
the translucent shade just opens like
that little square box here and I did
wear this to set my under eye today and
so far so good
I mean it immediately looked very even
very modified see how it wears
throughout the day because just like in
between my fingers it feels like a super
dry powder you know it just has that
kind of like not much of a cling to the
skin it just feels very dry you don't
know till you try so I'll see how that
wears today and then I also have gotten
this laura geller spackle mist and I
actually got this well before a lot of
this other stuff
it says prime set refresh always out to
try a new setting spray and this one I
feel like does not make my skin look
very dewy at all I have sprayed a lot of
this on my skin at different times and I
think wow I still come away looking
pretty mad so if you're not wanting a
lot of additional like glow or doing
this from your setting spray maybe
that's a good option but the thing that
ticks me off about this is like I spray
the pump okay and you know some people
are just like you spray your setting
spray fairly quickly you're not really
thinking about your finger on the pump
if it doesn't get press all the way down
you just have like leakage just seeping
from the little sprayer you know and
it's a little more effort to press down
I don't know how to explain but my hard
candy one I don't even think about it
I'm just bam bam bam and it's done and
there's nothing leaky there's nothing
weird this one I feel like I have to
make conscious effort to think okay did
the sprayer go all the way down and now
all the way back up okay now can i spray
again it's just sort of strange
that's called spackle mist gets its name
from Laura Geller's line of primers that
are known as spackle so I don't love
this over what I'm already using which
is a lot cheaper and that is the hard
candy sheer envy primer missed the last
few things that I have here kind of body
or hair related and I got this new
shampoo it's from shea moisture fruit
fusion coconut water weightless shampoo
lightweight hydration for fine wavy
curly hair and my hair would come in to
the fine department I don't know they
mean your hair needs to be fine wavy and
curly or just one of the three but I
have fine hair and this has been doing
great things I've been doing this and
then my conditioner has been the
moisture renewal from Pantene great
combo feel like this gets my hair so
super clean it sizes up a ton and it
does not feel weighed down in the least
it doesn't start feeling dirty and oily
as soon as with other products I've used
and the scent you know it's all about
the scent too mmm fruity clean just so
fresh like a fresh fruit salad or
something I mean I am so excited about
this one this might be one of the best
finds of the whole haul and then another
things I was really drunk do scent wise
these hemp's lotions okay there's a big
selection of this line in my oldest
store and I've had this kind of lotion
before I've actually got a big one of
the original scent which I think kind of
reminds me of bananas so I love that and
then there's a scent called watermelon
and something and that one's really good
too but then you know Erika Jones had to
go talking about this sweet pineapple
and honey melon and I'm thinking yeah I
would probably really love this so I
smelled it and then I started smelling
all the others I couldn't decide and say
getting one big one I got like three
small ones so I did get the sweet
pineapple in honey melon and that is
just a sea death it is so good is mmm
the immediate scent of fresh real
pineapple if that's not a summer scent I
don't know what is it is probably the
sweetest one that I got and then I had
to go for the white peach rose a and
peony are you ready for more
earth-shattering scent descriptions here
mmm this one the floral comes at me
first
it's soft its sweet there's that little
bit of peach it doesn't quite have that
ultra sweet bite that the pineapple has
but I think the most unique scent of all
three is this exotic green tea and Asian
pear this one was completely sold out I
think in the full-size oh it's so clean
really soft that little bit of sweetness
from the pear and this was the first one
that I went for just applying it all
over oh and it was so light and fresh
really like uplifting I don't know what
to say I feel so overly affected by
cents these days too because of
pregnancy so everything hits me like
whoa you know I really really like it or
I really don't these are three cents I
think are all really good so to review
you've got the very sweet sweet fruity
with the pineapple you've got a little
more floral coming in a lot more floral
with the peach rose and peony and then
something I think kind of calming but
very fresh very clean with the exotic
green tea and Asian pear so a moral of
this story I'm going to be lotioned up
a long long time got some of these dual
tipped applicators you know with the
pointy side and the flat side just
because I didn't have any of those and
at the time I guess I thought I needed
some and masks I have been so into masks
lately particularly sheet masks because
they're so easy you don't even have to
spend time like rinsing your face off in
the sink you leave it on you take it off
you kind of let those serums seep into
your skin sort of rub it all in and it's
like there's your nighttime facial
treatments great so I stumbled across a
new brand called leaders in solution and
it says daily wonders too much fun in
the Sun and I thought this would be
great after a long day outside soothing
and calming masks this is going to be a
sheet mask 15 to 20-minute mask there
and then I got the what happened last
night because you know how is crazy
pregnant women are and this is the
radiance revitalizing one again 15 to 20
minutes any certain claims or
ingredients on here this after Sun one
has aloe and all of extracts to comb
redness and soothe irritation so I think
that'll be awesome
this other one says a spa in a sheet
that was the phrase that caught me on
that and then it contains ginseng and
Artemisia extracts to revitalize and
soothe the skin ultimately both of these
seems like hydrating masks and my skin
can use all the extra hydration these
days I feel like and then from the
Fremen line now I think these were also
sold in full sizes this overnight
brightening mask was in a tub and this
one was in a tube but just to try them
out I got the packets this is the
purifying in shower mask with sea kelp
and probiotics instantly boost clarity
restores balance renews skin so how is
that gonna work you're gonna apply to
drive face and neck before showering
avoiding contact with eyes and hairline
and at the end of showering massage to
exfoliate and rinse so I'm guessing
there's some little scrubbies in this
maybe and this one you're gonna apply
basically like a night cream before bed
it says this mask absorbs into skin so
there's no need to worry about getting
it in your pillow use two times a week
or as often as needed so this is the
hibiscus and vitamin C in the
brightening overnight mask so yeah masks
I'm excited and
that is my whole that wraps it all up
you guys thank you for watching I know
there were a lot of things in here that
it is a true haul a lot of things that
were very new to me that you could
expect to see more of on my channel but
thank you so much for your time and I
will talk to you again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
