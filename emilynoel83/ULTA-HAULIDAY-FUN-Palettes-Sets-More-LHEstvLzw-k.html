today for this little Ulta haul it's
primarily focused in on some things that
might be good gift ideas and a lot of
them I have been playing around with and
can give you some thoughts some little
reviews along the way and I'm just gonna
kick this off with the thing that I am
so so excited about like I can't hold it
back anymore I've been wanting to
mention this ever since I first even
viewed it on the website and now that
I've got it home I am so impressed it's
this L'Oreal set of the pro matte
glosses the infallible Pro matte glosses
the ones I've been raving about I'm like
the idea of a matte gloss makes no sense
but don't let that deter you from trying
them because they are really a fantastic
formula on the lips so I had two of
these in full sizes or I'd have nude
allude I think I'd called it noodle or
because apparently I can't tell the
difference between an R and a D
sometimes but it's new delude you know
what they really could write the shade
names a little bit bigger maybe and I
also have statement nude statement nude
was the first one I tried and it like
opened my eyes to this whole line and
it's so good and the way I would
describe it I mean I think the reason
why they've got gloss in the name is
more about the consistency of the
product right when you take these out
you know they've got this little
applicator even the minis have just this
same kind of applicator and you know
it's kind of that melted down lipstick
kind of consistency but then once you
put it on your lips it is matte but
without that crazy hard dry down that a
lot of liquid lipsticks have like
L'Oreal does make some matte liquid
lipsticks and they are different from
these they are more of a solidified
state when they dry they're still not
awful or anything but these are just
beyond comfortable and it is a formula
where I feel like I can wear a bright
red or I can wear a dark berry and not
be really concerned about it traveling I
just love the flawless look of these
because they're mat so they're super
opaque and super even and you can tell
just with one swipe going on like
they're so so even and full coverage on
the lips but they don't reveal dryness
in the lips so therefore you get the
really perfect looking lip you know what
I'm saying so needless to say when I
uncovered this little gem on altas
website I was like
yes give it to me I can't get it fast
enough because I only own two and here
you're getting eight now from what I can
tell on the full listing of these
products individually on ulties website
there are ten and so looking through the
shade names the two that aren't in this
kit are fuchsia amnesia and rebel rose
everything else in here is an actual
shade that exists in their line and I
love that
I so wish more brands would do that
Nick's seems to put out some big vaults
of many sizes of their products but not
a lot of other drugstore brands do and
so this is what you've got you've got
the small sizes of eight different
shades and you're gonna see me kind of
rapid-fire showing you what these are
the good news is if this full sampler
doesn't interest you you'll at least be
able to see what all these different
shades look like on the lips and you
might pick out just one individually but
the whole shade range is awesome I am
currently wearing the shade Shanghai
scarlet you're getting a great pink in
here of really pretty like watermelon II
hot pink the true red a deep berry of
really nice rich rosy color and then
three fantastic neutrals one is that
nude allude shade statement nude which
is a little bit more deeper brownish and
then the lightest nude which I hadn't
tried until this kid that wants a real
peachy nude on the lips but they are all
just gorgeous consistent it's the exact
same texture formula you know one shade
to the next and I just love having the
mini sizes because for me as one who
does like to sample a lot of things a
mini size is so much more practical
because I'm not always going through
stuff but I like to sample the shades
this is that kind of formula just like
that video I did where I'm like the
formula is so good I won't want it every
shade this is what you want this will no
doubt be one of my top picks of the
holiday season I mean it's from L'Oreal
like don't roll your eyes at it it's
fantastic
$24.99 at Ulta says only at Ulta beauty
get it also I love the formula of their
infallible paints lip colors and they
have a big set of those although keep in
mind there's some more wild shades in
there you might be interested in some of
the purples or the Blues if you are you
might look to that set it includes some
of those out there shades but they are
colors that actually
exist in the pants line so that's
exciting to see let me talk about
another thing that I've been getting
some questions on lately it is this new
it Cosmetics holiday palette that they
put out called it girl this is limited
edition $48 and it's an eye and cheek
palette you might say it's got one of
their ombre type blushes in here I guess
the blush is just called it girl and it
ranges from this really like deep rose
up to a very soft pink I wouldn't
necessarily call the top of this like a
highlighter it's just simply a lighter
pink blush and one thing to be aware of
with it Cosmetics ombre products I've
noticed this in a bronzer I've tried and
also those blush to highlight two bronze
their little compacts that they put out
more recently like they're not
necessarily on braid to the core of the
product you know what I mean if you've
used one of these like one of the shades
is kind of like overlapping on the
surface a little bit so you will be able
to use it but there is somewhat of a
temporary nature to the ombre in these
products I can see how that can be
slightly frustrating with this though
it's pretty much blush to blush I guess
is what I'm saying here so we're not
going from like a blush fading into a
bronzer so whatever you get here out of
this product
I'm guessing anyway they're gonna have
mostly blush shade left over just
something to be aware of there but big
mirror in here and then all these
eyeshadows and they have two of the
superhero eye foundations which they're
really blowing up the idea of just a
matte cream blended out kind of shade or
highlight shade but whatever they're
nicely textured eyeshadows and I really
speaking of superhero I didn't love
their superhero eye palette I mean I
didn't give it a really wonderful review
but I love the eyeshadows that they've
put in here you've got one kind of quad
that's more of a bronzey Brown selection
and then one that makes me think kind of
rose gold burgundy this is the one chunk
that I'm wearing on my eyes today and I
think the look is gorgeous they applied
well lately I feel like I've been
finding so many matte shadows that I
like and shimmers have been
disappointing me it used to be a totally
different story with makeup but like
just finding shimmery shades that swatch
fabulously but yet don't apply as evenly
or smoothly on the eyes but these all
are really consistent really beautiful
shades I mean I
would be a nice gifting pallet to
someone who you know likes it cosmetics
but maybe hasn't tried this yet and I
should also mention the matte shades are
again your eye foundations one is a
little bit more of a true light beige
this one has a little more pinky tone to
it so those are both matte and then
you've got two matte shades on each side
here so this is kind of a matte soft
peachy pink and a matte brownish
burgundy mix and then here is your true
like matte medium brown and matte dark
brown and then these other shades are
just some really brilliant shimmers from
kind of a soft gold to bronze to light
rose gold to a mauve and the packaging
on the outsides like a ton of itty bitty
gemstones packed into the palace so it's
not like glitter fabric or anything it's
actually like little stones so it's very
brilliant I think a really fun gift
another potential gift that you might
want to get for the EOS lip-balm lover
in your life or something to try for
yourself is the Holiday Collection
Holiday Collection the limited edition
3-pack lasting hydration lip care so
this is an acute little box here and you
can see there are three EOS lip-balm
sell is obsessed with anything vanilla
like if you can get her vanilla ice
cream vanilla yogurt vanilla anything
she just loves it so there is the
vanilla one in here that I've promised
to give her after I get done talking
about it in the video that this one is
organic vanilla bean and this one is
natural sparkling ginger really cute
like outer shade there and then I just
instantly take in like ginger ale just
makes me think
ginger ale right off the bat and I've
got another iOS lip balm right here this
is that sweet mint that's always
available and I'm just kind of comparing
the texture the way these feel because I
remembered saying how that sweet mint
seemed softer and smoother and creamier
kind of then I remember these EOS lip
balms being when they first came out and
the ones in this set do feel similar to
that it's a nice soft creamy formula for
creamy might not be the best word but
smooth you know what I'm saying it
glides and then this one the stripy one
is the visibly soft peppermint mocha
says brisk peppermint and rich chocolate
come together in this holiday classic
this I like I'm not as nuts about the
scent of this as the other two I think
the vanilla is
really good scent the sparkling ginger
is a good scent this is not quite a
scratch in that peppermint mocha itch
for me but it is still a really nice
smooth texture somebody out there might
like it I mean I'm not saying it's
horrible like I will wear it but just
letting you know this is out there
available here's another thing I just
had to try because I feel like every
holiday season I get some sort of
philosophy set and I feel like this is a
new scent for this year I've never heard
about it before but it's holiday pajamas
and I have not yet used it in the shower
by the way are you pajama or are you
pajama I'm always pajama pretty much or
I'm PJ or if you're talking to Belle and
she's talking about her PJs if it's a
top and a bottom separate she calls them
PJs but if it's a total onesie it's only
a PJ we have been through this so many
times but this smells really good
you know what it makes me think of
instantly is unisex it's the kind of
thing that I think men or women would
like and I kind of felt that way about
snow angel too it's kind of warm cozy
clean like there is an essence of clean
laundry coming through in this scent but
maybe a little bit of like a I don't
know a holiday berry sweetness I don't
know there's something how do you
describe a shower gel scent alone let
alone when it's named holiday pajamas
but I got this $27 set and by the way
these are eight fluid ounces each so it
comes with that multitasking shampoo
shower gel or bubble bath here and then
also the lotion so I um hoped to use
this but the scent is really really nice
and I think Tyler would like that too
another thing in my haul is again
something that I haven't put into action
yet but I'm going to I think update you
guys on like snapchat or my Instagram
stories as I'm using these different
masks these are just individual little
masks that you can get on ulties website
and they all kind of have a holiday type
theme so I have moisturizing cream mask
and pumpkin cream cake I have the
brightening warming gel mask in
gingerbread cookies it's gonna be a
challenge not to eat these the
detoxifying peel-off mask and cranberry
crumble and there is like an actual
practical purpose for all of these
because like this one says antioxidant
rich cranberry seed oil pore clearing
witch hazel and then I
the strawberries and champagne hydrating
glitter peel-off mask and this has
hyaluronic acid and skin shimmer and
glitter that's a real essential you know
so I thought those would be kind of fun
to try like in the next couple weeks and
let you know how they go and if they
turn out to be really good those would
be a fun stocking stuffer for someone
and this guy this looks like a little
cylinder of tablets here I guess and
they are beauty smarts mask removing
cloths this is from the Ulta brand it
says 10 compressed cloths cloth expands
with water and it says never let a face
mask ruin your washcloths again these
one-time use compressed cloths expand
with water to remove mud clay and cream
masks so you soak one in warm water
fully until it fully expands and then
you just remove the face mask it's a
one-time use thing so I thought that
would be fun to try also gonna end the
video on a slightly disappointed note
because I got a couple of these Revlon
Photoready highlighter palettes so this
is Revlon's latest thing
holographic highlighting palettes this
that's the galaxy dream one and then the
one just called highlighting palette in
sunlit dream and I think these were to
the tune of between like 13 or 15
dollars there were definitely over $10
and you're getting four shades inside as
you can tell from the galaxy one these
are like soft pastel shades I'm kind of
wearing a combo of this shade and this
shade so this one goes like a little bit
of a soft pink shift to that and the one
below it is a little bit lilac II so
I've got both of those on I don't know
if you could actually tell that I have a
little bit pinky toned highlight on but
that's what those are doing this one's
actually a soft greenish gold and the
other day I tried this one which I am
NOT a fan of at all I cannot handle this
silvery grayish shimmer when this is not
hitting the light it has kind of a
grayish ashy look to it I just can't see
that as being flattering but more than
anything it's the feel of these that's
kind of disappointing to me they feel
very thin not super creamy like I don't
know I'm just kind of bummed I'm kind of
disappointed and then the sunlit dreams
one more I guess classic highlight
shades you might expect this is a soft
gold this is more of a rich buttery gold
down
here we got kind of a light I don't know
a little bit of peachy pink and then
deeper one down here that has more of a
bronzey tone and I come away feeling
like yeah they're okay like I probably
like the sunlit dream one a little bit
better just for the shade selection but
they're not as good as anything in that
profusion strobe and glow palette that
the whole thing was ten dollars and it
had what nine was it nine different
highlights all in one and yeah it was
kind of a big bulky palette but
everything was smoother and creamier and
just I don't know how to prettier look
to it on the skin I guess the word to
use might be underwhelmed but aside from
those I think I definitely had some cool
finds in terms of this little Ulta haul
I am so freaking excited that they have
a set of Pro matte glosses that's
wonderful
I would say the second most exciting
thing for me is that it cosmetics it
girl palette because that's really nice
quality in a great shade range and then
my third most exciting thing is probably
the holiday pajamas philosophy set
because that smells so good and I cannot
wait to use that in the shower but I am
very interested to try some of those
face masks because the names are a
little like holiday gimmicky but maybe
they're really good I don't know I will
be letting you guys know so thank you so
much for watching I hope you guys have a
great day and I will talk to you again
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
