if you're into full coverage makeup I
think you're going to be very interested
in this video because it is all about a
couple of new products that are very
very full coverage I have been putting
them to the test here recently and I
have personally had very good results
with them I'm talking about the urban
decay all nighter liquid foundation and
also tarts shape tape concealer so I've
heard some hype about tart shaped tape
lots of people enjoying it and I've got
to say it's working really well for me
also the interesting thing about this
foundation would be the coverage level
is right up there with the highest
coverage foundation I own which would be
the Estee Lauder Double Wear maximum
cover if you have any questions about
what this foundation is capable of go
back and watch my video about melasma
from a couple years ago heavy heavy
discoloration on the tops of my cheeks
this product and this product alone
could cover that up now for the first
time I found something that actually is
on par with that coverage wise a little
bit different consistency wise and a few
other differences but overall I'm
getting a very very similar effect so
basically in this video I'm going to
take you through a little tutorial of
just my face routine with these products
and just some accompanying products that
I put on with it after that I'll just
kind of give you my overall review and
it truly is a review I have been wearing
these products for days now and I've
definitely been assessing the staying
power every day and I'll talk about the
staying power of this particular look so
you'll also have some examples to go on
but these have really already proven
themselves to me as far as I'm concerned
alrighty just taking you through the
application real quick and I have
already applied my moisturizer today I
use my Kiehl's
ultra facial moisturizer SPF 30 it
really does pack a punch it's definitely
a nourishing moisturizer and I have on
this NARS skin total replenishing eye
cream which I've actually been using I
don't know that I've talked about it
before but I've used maybe more than
half of this up by now and it's a very
nice rich eye cream I have my Sarah the
eye cream downstairs which I also love I
think this might be just a little more
heavy duty compared to that
and then on top of those steps I used a
nourishing primer this is the makeup
forever nourishing primer and it just
adds a little something extra
after those two steps and I feel like it
helps lock in the moisture a little bit
better now normally hydration wouldn't
be that much of a concern for me but
I've noticed just in the past couple of
weeks my skin has gotten quite a bit
more dry which is really whip rare for
the summer months but I remember during
my last pregnancy that came on very
early and now it's kind of just now
starting and it's coming across kind of
in the same way it did before like I'll
notice I've got kind of a grayish patch
like on my forehead which I don't feel
so much right now because I'm all voiced
your eyes also a little bit around the
chin or the mouth area so we're new
using foundations that you know can be
thicker that could potentially be drying
you really want to make sure you've
covered those bases in these pre
foundation steps and it really does make
a difference in the way that foundation
wears throughout the day so all that
being said I'm starting off with my
Urban Decay all nighter foundation I had
this in the shade 4.5 has a little pump
style dispenser here and I've realized I
go for one full pump and just a little
bit extra then I kind of spot this
around all over my face
as you can see the first places I dad
the product where the places I was most
concerned about so like under I knows
those are the places where I want the
most direct coverage from this product
and then elsewhere I can just kind of
blend it out and the sponge I'm using I
believe the brand is called swisco and I
got this from Ulta it came with like a
little mini flat top brush really like
in the sponge it's an excellent quality
Beauty Blender type sponge although it's
shaped like that but aside from the
sponge I have applied this foundation
with dense brushes and that works nicely
too
but I do find that it is it has some
thickness to it you know it's a very
full full coverage foundation as you can
see like I was really covering some
stuff up here I had some little melasma
type things peeking through a little bit
there up on the tops of my cheeks and it
the coverage is just amazing truly the
only foundation I've tried that is right
on par coverage wise with the Estee
Lauder Double Wear maximum cover not
just regular Double Wear but something I
would not have been able to get away
with with the maximum cover is waiting
that long to blend my forehead with that
product sitting on there because that
would have already set with the Estee
Lauder and with this I really do
surprisingly have time to get all around
my face even after just kind of spotting
it around like I do now I wasn't taking
like all day to get that blended out or
anything I imagine it would eventually
become more difficult to blend out but I
have no problem just at a normal pace
blending out all over the skin and I
feel like it's two different
consistencies this to me feels like kind
of traditional cream foundation that's
not too thick not too thin it actually
feels maybe a little bit more
consistency wise like regular double
wear to me whereas the maximum cover had
sort of a slip across the skin like you
didn't need to use too much product
because it just like collided across and
then it would set real quick but I mean
just in terms of getting it across the
skin it just seemed to have a little
different feel that this is feeling a
little bit more like a standard thick
ish found
and the coverage is just flawless I'm
looking at my under eye area and I'm
thinking wow there's only one other
product that can do that kind of work on
me and that would be the Estee Lauder
Double Wear maximum coverage shade wise
I feel like this is absolutely dead-on
perfect would not change a thing I don't
know if you noticed like looking at my
skin before I started I had a little
more depth or the look of a more of a
tan across my chest and shoulders than I
did on my face and so I feel like things
are matching up better now but here's
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna bring in an
under eye concealer even though I don't
think I need it that much I could still
use a little brightness here and so what
I've been putting on top of that is this
Tarte shape tape I ordered it in the
shade light/medium so you take this wand
out and it's a pretty big wand I mean I
don't know if we're quite two-buck foot
applicator status but we're bigger than
a doe foot and this thing has a decent
amount of product just as you take it
out loaded on to that little scoop so I
just kind of got a little bit of that
off of there because I've realized while
the temptation will be there to just
stripe this product on real thick on
each under-eye it doesn't require that
much product so you can pace yourself a
little bit I like to get it in my little
cavern right there make sure that area
is covered and then I just kind of
really lightly just dot some on up to
this area and I go just beyond the eye
because it's going to be a little bit
brighter than the foundation shade and I
go down the nose with it
I go a little bit on the upper lip and
then I just begin my blending with that
same little sponge I was using and just
kind of start thinning the product out a
bit but I've used this you know not on
top of such a heavy duty foundation and
I was like well the coverage is really
nice and just very hardcore in this
light medium shade as you can see with
4.5 and the foundation being just the
perfect all-over shade this is the kind
of concealer that is up a notch for
brightness and then I've got some stuff
I couldn't quite get to around the eye
with that one sponge so this is the
Sigma that 3d HD precision brush
and just using that to get right here
hit that little crease that comes under
the eye and you can preemptively pick up
some product that might go there not
that I find this to be bad about like
really settling in the creases but any
product that you put there can
potentially do it so there that is all
blended out nice thing about the shape
tape is that if you prefer a lighter
all-over foundation but you know like
okay god still got this major problem
area that I need to tend to there is so
much coverage in this product and it
wears really really nicely up on the
under eye area and the funny thing is
it's like my skin said okay I'm going to
give these products a challenge I'm
going to be drier than usual and see if
they can work and they still work so
I've been setting the under-eye a little
bit and I don't know that this would be
essential because this product already
you know it does not have a particularly
dewy feel to it it's just barely got the
tiniest bit of tackiness there so I
could probably go on and be fine but I
have been setting it I've set it with
the RCM a no color powder works great
I've set it with the airspun powder
works great haven't felt the need to
full-out bake this stuff you know like
really lay it on thick but I'm just
talking a light little dabbing under the
eye and those have both been really good
and kept such a close eye on them
throughout the entire day so today I
thought I would try a different option
that I sometimes like on the under eye
and it's the NYC smooth skin loose
powder in translucent I'm just getting a
little bit on my brush and take that on
the under eye
we're going full coverage here I'm not
holding back okay and as I had done with
the others I wasn't simply using it on
the under eye I was also kind of going
over my t-zone just in case you know
something happens there something sighs
good oil II you never know and then I'm
just going to pop on my wet and wild
contour palette use the deeper shade
this is in the shade caramel toffee and
just bump up the cheekbone a bit and I'm
not being super precise here I'm just
using my ELF complexion brush
and we'll take a little bit of that
around my hairline all soon
and then for blush I'm bringing in Mac's
mineralize blush and warm soul look at
that beautiful little just I'm not even
try and type glow there I love that and
then for a little highlights I'm going
to go with my Physicians Formula Vegas
strip kind of focus in on the top part
of it
and just finish off the face makeup I'm
using this hard candy sheer envy
hydrating primer mist 12 hour power it
says mmm love the way that step sprays
out just a few miss so here's what
everything's looking like with the full
face done on my eyes I've got on my
L'Oreal quad and boudoir charm and I
just did this bronzy shade like all over
the lid and into the crease and I
smudged some of that under the eye and I
did some of this lighter shade as the
highlight so it's kind of just like a
very easy to shadow look there and then
on the lips I'm wearing my Kate Moss
lasting finished nude lipstick in the
shade 47 so this is kind of the deeper
one that I had picked up if you watch my
last video on the nude lip product
because I'm just giving you a little bit
more of an overall review on this Urban
Decay foundation really have enjoyed the
consistency this actually has amazing
coverage on my skin you know it can take
care of so so much and if you just
wanted to use this in this alone and
build up maybe over certain areas where
you need it even more like this could be
adequate first a lot of people out there
as far as the overall finish on the skin
I do feel like this is a matte
foundation this one was more like an
ultra matte foundation like absolutely
as completely mattified as it gets so
this has a slightly more natural
just overall look on the skin for
staying power they're both very strong
but if you do find yourself having dry
skin or at least some dry areas that
kind of show themselves as the day goes
on this one's a little bit more
forgiving in that respect and this one
is it's a little harder to get away with
this on dry skin because like I said
it's ultra ultra matte you know the
coverage is extremely full if you do
have uneven texture sometimes it can
show a little bit with this product and
this one seems to be just a little bit
more like regular foundation in terms of
consistency but the coverage is
completely there now the shape tape you
know these two are coming together for I
feel like the ultimate full coverage
look I feel like I could get by with a
lesser concealer if I wanted to with
this or maybe even no concealer at all
that being said
use this when the foundation hasn't done
as much dirty work for me and the
coverage of this is very very full on if
you're using a skin tone concealer and
you're tackling areas like a discolored
under-eye or age spots sun spots may you
know heavy discoloration on your skin if
you're using a skin tone concealer to
tackle that it needs to be just
supremely full coverage otherwise if
it's not it simply takes that
discoloration be it the caverns in here
or spots and it just lightens them up
you can still see them that's what I see
over and over again with liquidy
consistency concealers that look a lot
like this but they're not as good at
coverage so that's why I'm often
reaching for some sort of corrector type
product that can actually color correct
the problem areas and that's not a
strategy that likes stopped working for
me or something I don't like doing
anymore because I think products like
your race-based
a pixie correction concentrate lots of
products that had that peachy pigment to
them to continue to work wonderfully
well this is just a new thing that I've
tried and definitely one of the few
concealers that is just you know light
to medium skin tone type color and it
actually covers everything and some
people might find this to be a bit
easier because this is also something
that could tackle the redness around
your nose or blemishes elsewhere on the
skin and whatever the problem area might
be so that is the advantage to using
just a skin tone concealer on I used it
I went very heavy-handed with it and
it's not that that even ended up looking
that bad on me with wear but it
definitely was a little bit more visible
on the skin than it is if I just kind of
dot it lightly on my under eye area and
get the excess off the wand the other
really impressive
side part of this product is the staying
power you know and the way you can put
it right up there on the under eye on
areas that will tend to look crepey will
tend to look more aged than they
actually are and this is just amazing
it's like it fills or something I'm not
saying this would fill like world's
deepest wrinkle but if you've just got
like little fine line or uneven texture
type problems on the under eye it seems
to just really smooth it
out and when I can look at the
combination of both of these products
and look you know five hours in glanced
at the under eye and be like everything
looks completely smooth it's amazing and
the other day my friend Chelsea was over
here if you saw us on periscope thank
you for watching but I had my foundation
and concealer duo on that day for 14
hours at the time we were periscoping
and you know we took some pictures then
and I thought wow everything's holding
up I'm not seeing shine I'm not feeling
the dry cakey patches and everything
seems to be looking good still I really
feel like I've been trying to catch
these products at something you know
what is the downfall what is the thing
that they're doing wrong for me and I
just haven't found it yet and I've been
testing this out over a period of days
and I'll continue to show you how the
staying power goes on this day that I'm
wearing it okay say Gees makeup has been
on for four and a half hours now we just
got groceries it's the same day that I
actually shot the review I just changed
my shirt and put a hat on but um
everything is just looking really fresh
still I don't see any unevenness I'm
gonna see if there's a big line where my
hat was maybe it rubbed a little bit
around the hat line but overall just the
wear around my nose it was just insanely
humid out there and I'm thinking yeah
I'm totally happy with the way this
looks no touch-ups how do you think my
makeup looks okay just a little a tower
check in right now and I honestly can't
see anything that's changed about this
like I'm looking really closely here on
the under eye and well you know it feels
dry to the touch it doesn't really look
that dried out or anything and the
staying power seems to be really good
overall at about 12 hours of wear at
this point and all over the face I
really can't complain too much about the
evenness you know I was wearing that hat
right there but overall everything looks
pretty good the one place I can tell
things have worn down a little as I can
see the redness pretty much just on this
one side maybe I didn't quite conceal
that fully
enough but things look even and
good and not even still all that dry on
the under eyes so yay for that thank you
guys so so much for spending some time
with me today I hope this video cleared
up maybe a few questions you might have
had about those new products on the
market and I know some of us are looking
for just the best fullest coverage and I
gotta say those are two things that
really have been able to deliver for me
so thank you again and I'll see you soon
