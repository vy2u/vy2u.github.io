joining me for this video where I just
kind of show you my current makeup
routine that I've been using a lot
lately I think it's very appropriate for
those who are busy who need a quick look
who likes something that's overall
pretty darn natural this is kind of it
and it really centers around this one
palette and I was thinking about just
using this palette and showing you a
review purely on this but then I thought
well maybe it's more helpful to just
show a full face makeup look and how
this fits in is part of it but no not
sponsored in any way in terms of Laura
Geller this palette is just something I
bought on old his website it turned out
to be fantastic my videos are never
sponsored by the way so you can hang
your hat on that but something I really
wanted to point out was when I was
shopping on oldest site and I saw this
the picture first caught my eye because
I thought is that the french vanilla
highlight because I love that highlight
so much but in the written description
it said that there were three different
things happening here it named different
eyeshadows a different highlight and a
different blush but the photo showed
honey sable french vanilla and
honeysuckle in here and that is actually
what you get so there's an error on the
website in terms of the written
description but what's in the picture is
what you get in this palette called get
ready and go and I think this is just an
essential part of this look that I'm
doing today the eyeshadows are very easy
great for like a one shadow look with
something just a little bit extra
I've raved about the french vanilla
highlight for years as being like the
universal highlight that anyone of any
skin type any age can wear for added
brightness on the skin and there's a
great little blush in here it's very
bronze II and kind of warms up the whole
skin tone and I know it doesn't look
that exciting I mean it's kind of a
no-frills palette right it doesn't have
like a ton of cutesy stuff going on it's
not huge you know it's just a very
streamlined little thing but in terms of
products that you will use or pumps that
I see myself using over and over again
it's extremely handy so I just was
excited to show you how that worked into
my full face look in this video
and in terms of just the way I'm pulling
off even getting makeup done at all when
sometimes it's happening at different
times of day or different places in the
house I have found this little caddy I
think this up at Walmart it's my
Kaboodle's I think I'm going to go more
in depth about that in a future video
but that is so nice even beyond just
what regular makeup bags give you in
terms of keeping some things together
and I can just grab things out see
exactly what's in there but then when I
come back here to the makeup room and I
just stood it on my desk like everything
is totally visible so I don't feel the
need to like undo it totally unpack the
bag when I'm back in here whatever it
just can kind of float around wherever I
am so more on that particular item to
come but meanwhile here's this tutorial
and by the way I'm sorry I haven't
switched out my whole background here
think of it as just a winter theme okay
alright it feels funny sitting down here
to do an actual tutorial again it's been
a while since I've done just sitting
down and talking you through stuff like
this but I'm excited to share with you
just this whole routine that I find
myself doing a lot because it's quick
it's simple but I feel very finished
when I'm done with it I feel like more
like myself after wearing this makeup
than not wearing it so the first thing I
put on and I know I reach with so I
talked about this product a lot but I do
think it's a great multitasker and it
cosmetics CC cream SPF 50 I have it in
the shade medium and I just love the
coverage I get out of this and I also
find that you know it can double as my
moisturizer it really does add some
hydration to my skin so I dab it all
over I can blend it in with my fingers I
can do a brush or you know this is my
NYX Blender sponge here and I really
like blending it in with that also so I
tap that in all over
and if you missed my video about the
wedge-shaped
sponges and the comparison this next one
was in there it does have a flat side
and I just I'm living this one for being
just the one sponge that can do it all
you know it can very effectively blend
in foundation but as you'll see in a
second here it does my concealer too for
my concealer I have been so enjoying
this new one from NARS it's the soft
matte complete concealer and I have it
in the shade 2.75 Cannell and it's just
a really really perfect shade and yeah
it's definitely in my rotation I love my
own estancia concealer I feel like this
maybe isn't quite as like amoliant is
that but the coverage is really good and
yeah it just works nicely under the eyes
or anywhere around my face and if
anybody else has used this I swear I
feel like a little bit of a cooling
sensation when I put this on every time
I've used it I've thought about that
when I just first dab it on my skin so
I'd be curious to know if anybody else's
felt that but I just get a little bit
around my nose and on the under eye area
and then I put my finger on the flat
side of the sponge and I allow this
curved side to be what blends in my
concealer and concealer is huge these
days when you know you're not getting
quite enough sleep the concealer has got
to deliver
I feel like this does a pretty good job
now after these couple of products I
don't really feel like my face is in
dire need of being set
big-time all over with powder I like to
use this Too Faced primed and poreless
powder because it's just very light and
it does sort of I don't know perfect the
skin a little bit it sort of blurs
little lines and maybe texture issues
that you might have so I do like to
apply that lightly on my t-zone and I'm
just using this little elf small tapered
brush then we get into my little get
ready and go palette from laura geller
this is just such a little lifesaver so
basic but everything in here is totally
working and the blush that's in here is
called honeysuckle and as you can see
it's kind of warm there's some bron
genus to it but there's also a little
bit of pink mixed in as well and so I
dab into that with a blush brush and I
just wear this adds my blush and there's
a peach eNOS that kind of comes out in
it but sort of a like I said bronzy tone
as well
and I always say this but there's
nothing like blush to really bring your
face to life you know I might still have
a little bit of an under-eye circles or
I might have you know this or that issue
but blush it's like you just you can't
argue with a good blush pop that on then
I go back to the small tapered brush and
I've got this french vanilla highlight
which I have talked about for years as
being a really great highlight that just
has the teeny bit of glow but it also
has a little coverage it's very
brightening it's great for those who
don't want to attract attention to lines
or you know texture problems
imperfections right up here in this zone
so I love just applying this product
right there and when I do the eye shadow
it kind of acts as an additional eye
shadow as well which I like but you can
just dab it on anywhere where you want a
little more brightness and then with
face makeup done I'm going to do a
little bit of my next dewy finish
setting this feel like the blush was a
little bit glowy but overall there's a
lot of just matte happening on my skin
right now so I think the setting mist
helps and I'm giving myself a very quick
brow I've got this goof proof brow
pencil from benefit I've been bouncing
around to a lot of different brow
products but this I have in the shade 4
and this is the brow pencil that they're
offering these days that has a little
more thickness to it so sometimes I feel
like that is a little bit quicker
approach you know when you're not using
the finest pencil ever
then I use a little bit of my Knicks
tinted brow mascara this is in the shade
black although it's not really black
it's like just a very dark cool brown
and I like the way this holds and
sometimes like if I'm in an extra big
hurry this and this alone will work fine
in my brows just as is I just grab a
little Milani eyeshadow primer and this
is just a go-to in any circumstance
whether it's quick makeup or not I just
love this primer in particular and it
only takes a bit I concentrate it first
on my lids and then pull it up through
the crease and up under my eyebrows and
then back to the laura geller palette
you got this little eyeshadow duo here
in honey and sable and there are you
know several ways I've used this but one
way that I think I like it best is this
pretty sable color all over my lid up
into the crease and also you know kind
of under the lower lash line sort of
like a one shadow look but then I blend
a little bit of the honey around the
outer edge and throw on some of the
French vanilla as highlight and you're
done and you could also pull in
honeysuckle as well if you wanted to use
that for a little bit of a warm you know
eyeshadow twist but if you're not
familiar with my take on a one shadow
look this is kind of what you're going
to see here in this video so take a flat
brush and we're going to Pat that shade
all over the eyelid
and there's just this pretty really
metallic fun quality to this shade
but it's not so metallic that it's
unwearable even people who don't love a
ton of shimmer I don't think would be
too turned off by this type of shade
then I go into that same color with a
crease fresh like my Sigma e25 or
whatever crease brush you like to use
and I start blending that color just up
into my crease working it in from the
inner corner to the outer corner of my
crease and then you get this just
surprising amount of pretty depth going
on there so you just use the one shade
and I'm going to stick with that same
color and I'm using a pencil brush and
I'm going to take it under the eye as
well and this is going to just give the
softest definition if you wanted a
little bit more defined look you could
use like a smudge brush or an angled
liner brush for this I kind of like the
softness of this shade just sort of
wrapping around the eye then I go to
this honey color and I just continue to
use this e 25 brush and I go sort of
just above where the crease is and you
use that kind of as a warmer transition
Ajay's color it's the easiest I look
ever then just grab a fluffy brush go
into the french vanilla highlight and
that can be what you place closest to
your brow and as you use that color it
can sort of blend out the edge of your
eyeshadow then a step it might seem like
you know well what is that really
essential but I do think it's important
especially if you're feeling really
tired or you think you look really tired
is a nude liner and the lower inner rim
and this is just my SK edit in bold
Bordeaux and the one side is a really
super soft nude liner and I like that a
lot
and then some days I do eyeliner
honestly for my quickest look I would
skip it if I really like was trying to
get out the door or I had something to
do I feel like I can get just as good of
a look just as effective of a makeup
look without the liner sometimes and now
if I was doing false lashes I would
definitely not skip the liner because I
want that nice black base to set the
lashes down on but if I'm just doing
mascara frankly I feel like my lashes
stand out more when I don't have that
liner and there's just some lightness
there on the lid and that can kind of
act as a backdrop for the lashes if that
makes sense
and I happen to have my covergirl super
sizer handy so that's what I'm going to
throw on here
really been alternating this mascara
with my it cosmetics superhero basically
if it got super in the name it might be
mascara I'm using but the nice thing
about both this one Andy it cosmetics is
I can apply them on my lower lashes and
not be worried about it like
transferring off onto my lower lashline
or below the eye somewhere they're both
pretty reliable mascaras for me in that
respect
for the lips I think you should really
do whatever the heck you want if you
want to do a bold lip honestly it does
not take that much effort you know
beyond what may be a natural or news
live might require of you you know what
I mean I think sometimes people lay
their eyes on a makeup look that
involves the bold lip and you
automatically think that that person is
more done up but honestly you know it
doesn't take that much more work so if
you want to go bold go gold for me my
lips are kind of extra dry right now and
I am sort of going for comfort with this
look so one thing that I do like to
reach for is this benebalm from benefit
yeah the best little rosy scent I really
love that and it just gives a pretty
like reddish tint to my lips
there's kind of a glossy finish and like
a little bit of thickness and I don't
know something about it feels really
really comfortable and very nourishing
now for the finished look I do feel like
my skin is more even than it was before
my eyes feel a little bit more awake and
I've got something on the lips as well
so it's certainly a look that I would
feel comfortable doing just about
anything in but it didn't take me a long
time and it's just easy products to
throw on whether I'm sitting here in the
makeup room and full great lighting or
if I'm you know downstairs wherever you
know just using a little daylight out
the window whatever the circumstance may
be I feel like it's just an easy look to
pull off and this palette certainly is a
nice little game changer it's very
compact everything in here really serves
a purpose from the blush the highlight
the eyeshadow and I can definitely vouch
for the fact that these laura geller
products last a really long time even in
these smaller sizes like I have certain
things that are this size and the domed
up nature of these products just really
allows you to get a lot of use out of
them and I just think this is super
wearable for pretty much anybody so
thank you so much for taking time to
watch guys I hope this was helpful and I
will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
