holiday gift sets and I've been really
eager to do this video I very slowly
been accumulating some different little
gifty items from drugstore brands lately
and it's taken a while because they just
don't usually come out as soon as some
of the different higher-end collections
but at the same time I still feel like
the holiday shopping season is young I
tend to see even more of these lower
cost items rolling out as we get closer
to Christmas so if there are other
things outside of what I've talked about
in this video that you'd like to see me
try
I am certainly open to doing more this
is just what I've got so far and one
other little announcement elf has come
out with some little $10 pallets called
perfect face palettes they've got
shadows cheek products and lip products
all in one I just want you to know I
have those and that's gonna be a whole
separate video because I need to mess
with them some more and there's just a
lot to talk about there so I think it'd
be best if I split that into something
different but for starters I want to
talk about a little essence kit that I
found at Ulta and this is $9.99 and it's
called sealed with a kiss' it's got four
of their long-lasting lipsticks and then
you also get a liquid lipstick in here
which is actually more of a glossy
finish lipstick not in matte but I have
really enjoyed essences lipsticks over
time you know the ones that are kind of
colored like the actual packaging is the
same shade as the color and the tube
anchors the color called all about
cupcake and different ones and I just
really liked those they're smooth creamy
lightweight lipsticks and then this
long-lasting formula is a bit newer and
I remember when I first tried those and
I thought okay I feel like these are
kind of a step up because the colors are
a bit more bold a little more richly
pigmented but still very creamy I think
they're comparable to the field just the
glide going on they're very comparable
to the Revlon Super Lustrous lipsticks
but I do think they have a nice sort of
wear throughout the day even though I've
got some bright colors in here I've worn
them and I feel like the wear tends to
be pretty even and it's no big deal
really to touch them up if you need to
anyway but you know me I tried them all
on for you so I want you to see exactly
what they look like first off we've got
a shade just called 0-6
strikes me as just a very classic like
mauve nude type color super super
wearable kind of like a your lips but
better type color very easy to wear with
just about anything and then 0-7 is
natural beauty and this is a soft pink I
feel like it's a delicate pink without
being a really light pastel I find that
to be a very wearable shade the next one
is zero four on the catwalk a shade I
already had and I love this red this is
a wearable kind of rosy red if you're
dipping your toe into red lipstick that
would be a great place to start and then
number 12 is called blush my lips and
this is a really pretty magenta pink
I've been wearing it on my lips you'll
continue to see this on my lips
throughout the video gorgeous pink it's
a happy pink you know it just brightens
up the face and then on top of those
four lipsticks you're also getting one
of their liquid lipsticks this just says
zero six on it and the way they describe
this it says it combines the best of
lipstick and lip gloss the impact and
coverage of a lipstick but the
moisturizing shine of a gloss and it is
really shiny it reminds me of like a
liquefied state-of-the on the catwalk
shade so that rosy wearable red that
really does wear a long time once you
lose the shine of that product I mean
you feel like something has really
locked into your lips color wise and it
looks very very even so that's a great
product and I just think all-around a
good little you know $9.99 $10 set
another Ulta thing that I know I
mentioned before but I'll give it a
quick mention again in case you missed
my past videos but it's called the
complexion perfection set I stopped my
dirty sponges back in here just so you
could see actually how the presentation
is it's a pink sponge it looks a lot
like a Beauty Blender size wise very
comparable to a Beauty Blender and then
you get a smaller sponge that I think
reminds me a lot of the Beauty Blender
blusher these are good quality makeup
sponges you know you saturate them with
water they become nice and saw they
become even a little bit softer than a
Beauty Blender brand sponge Beauty
Blender brand say that a bunch of times
but I love this little kit I've used
I've enjoyed them this is nice for your
cream blushes cream contour even
concealers it doesn't get around my
inner corners as well as like a micro
mini does but it's still very
multifunctional there are a lot of
things that could do and then this one
great for foundation they also give you
a matte makeup setting spray which is
fine I know it seems to work well but
it's not really the reason why I love
this kit so it's a $14 set if you're
wanting to try a couple of nice sponges
that aren't sky-high
in price I think this is a great way to
do it did a little digging at my local
Walgreens and found some wet and wild
sets and one that stood out to me the
most is their little $10 brush set went
wild has recently come out with a line
of brushes that I think is very
affordable and very nice quality they've
got this like kind of pinky type fiber
look at the end they're all synthetic
brushes I had tried just a handful of
ones that I bought individually I've got
like a flat top one a fluffier powder
brush a little stippling brush and I've
enjoyed them so I thought let's try out
this set and it does give you six
different brushes certain ones I find
more essential than others I've never
been for example a fan of a flat brush
like this for applying foundation
I even refresh my memory on that opinion
yesterday and I tried it with some
liquid foundation and it's just not like
I just don't like the way that feels to
apply it but padding in concealer that's
good that's a good purpose for that kind
of a brush and then you get another
little flat brush that is actually
intended for concealer and that can do
concealer really well or a nice little
flat brush for patting on I shadow
you're getting a blush brush that's a
really nice size and these are so soft
like they seem to be really legitimately
well made drugstore brushes and your
three different eye brushes you're
getting a nice little blender here this
is great just like pulling in a brush at
the end of your eye look just to blend
out the edges you could apply shadow
with this don't get me wrong but it's
just such a nice size and softness I
like using it to just kind of blend over
the finished look and you get a nice
very stiff flat brush as
well and I instantly thought this could
be a good brush for like let's say
you've put down a nice glitter glue
primer or maybe some sort of cream
shadow base and then you are all about
like packing a sparkly shade right on
top of it this is so stiff this is like
stiffer than almost any other flat I
brush that I have and I think it would
do a really good job of packing those
unruly sparkly shadows on the lid and
then who can't use a nice little angled
brush this could be nice and the brows
this could work well with any of your
pomade type products or use this a
little eyeliner brush sometimes when you
get these little angled liner brushes
there's they're so small there's not
much to them in terms of bristles that
they'll just be very bendy and flimsy
this is nice and stiff so you definitely
have all the control one could need you
know to apply shadow across your lash
line that's the way I used it the other
day and I thought okay that was nice it
was a nice thickness of lines a nice
little brush set I gotta say and I've
been pleased with the other brushes that
I've tried from this wet and wild line
so ten bucks I think is a pretty good
deal to get six of them okay elf elf elf
I placed a big elf order tried some of
their holiday sets like I said I'm
saving those little palettes for a
separate video but they've got some
different gift sets that contains some
things that I have raved about and I
think they're giving you a really nice
value these would make great stocking
stuffers or give a few of them together
like wrap them up stack them put a bow
around them all nice gift first one is
called prep and play lip exfoliator and
color set I've sung the praises of elfs
lip exfoliator forever so this would be
a great way to be like hey friend have
you ever tried a lip exfoliator maybe
some of them haven't it's a great like
life-changing first step before your lip
product type of item it's a gritty stick
and there is like a balm that's sort of
a binder holding everything together but
you just run that stick back and forth
on your lips and you get this great
exfoliation and the one you get in here
is the cherry one I feel like it has
even finer grand
than the original one that's sort of
like a brown sugary type of scent flavor
so it works really well and then on top
of that you're getting one of their
matte lip colors and this is in the
shade wine I couldn't find that
information anywhere on the box or on
the website so you're hearing it here
you're getting wine and I love the matte
lip colors the matte lip colors wear
really well for me from elfs line um
they're not like intensely moisturizing
they don't give back as much to my lips
as say the bite matte cream lip crayons
do but you're paying a whole lot less
for these the color intensity is
completely their you know full-on opaque
color so I really like this set wine is
a great little holiday color for anybody
so that's a nice $5 stocking stuffer
also they have a four-piece med format
set so if you're thinking hmm I like the
idea of these matte lip colors you're
getting four in here the whole product
format I really like because they're a
slim stick so you've got a lot of
control the end pops off and has a
sharpener on it so you can always keep
that tip nice and finally pointed if you
want to but all four shades in here are
total winners you're getting praline
which is just a neutral I have used to
no end I mean that color is fantastic on
its own but I love mixing it in with any
lighter nude lipstick any nude that i
might initially look at and think hmm is
that a little too light is it a little
unwearable I add praline to it and it's
the instant mixer then we're getting two
takes on berry in this kit berry sorbet
is a very pinky berry it has some nice
brightness to it
I've had this shape before I love it and
then the color called wine which was
also in this kit so keep that in mind um
but it's more of a reddish berry a
little bit deeper feel pretty still
festive but just a little darker take on
berry and then rich red is a true bright
red very glam absolutely love it if
you're trying out brighter colors for
the first time and you're like I don't
want to be thinking about it don't wanna
be fussing with it going to a party you
don't want to be wondering if it's
running outside my lip line or something
um
formula will be very easy for you so
that's a four piece kit for just $10 and
then there's another elf kit that I
thought was just a fantastic value as
well and it's called get glowing and
this contains three fantastic items from
elfs line one of them is the shimmering
facial whip and if you have not tried
any of these and you're wanting to
experiment with a cream highlight that
might get you kind of on par with what
the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
liquids are like this would be a good
place to go this shade is called lilac
petal it really doesn't look like at all
but for ages like since the dawn of elf
they've had this shade in their line and
it looks like this it's just like this
soft kind of peachy pink but when you
see this shade shearing out on the skin
it's highly highly shimmery so it only
takes a little bit I like to use it with
my ELF small stipple brush just get a
little on my hand picks them up with the
brush and kind of graze it across the
cheeks and you can go anywhere from
subtle shimmer with that - an extremely
pronounced shimmer the difference
between these and the Becca I would say
is that these can go quite a bit heavier
I think in terms of a glowy look on the
skin but they're really fun and they
don't have an annoying texture they they
don't stay like sticky and tacky on your
skin but then they also give you their
illuminating palette I have loved this
palette and they give you the
highlighting brush if you've never tried
elf small tapered brush which I talked
about seems like in at least every other
video this is a very similar brush to
that only the bristles are a bit longer
there's just a little more give to it
see how it just sweeps back and forth
you could use this for a lot of the very
same purposes that I use my small
tapered brush for which would be like
setting the under eye or you know just
use it with these highlights these are
gorgeous and nothing is too much
nothing's too over-the-top if you are
all about a subtle believable glow get
this and then you've got this little
wild card that you can play with and
maybe even layer the two if you want
something really extreme I'm wearing
this shade today just kind of on top of
my cheeks and I feel like the glow is so
like just subtle
I get the sense that it's making my skin
look healthy without maybe being the
first thing that somebody like looks at
my face and sees like a highlight so
it's very wearable this next one has
like a little bit more of a cooler pinky
tone there's one down here that is the
most subtle of the bunch and I think
it's because it's got so much like just
classic beige in it very subtle and then
you're golden a peach down here in the
lower corner none of these have any
major identifiable bits of shimmer
particles of glitter or anything they
don't look cheap they don't look tacky
it's a nice classy highlight okay
quickly gonna mention something from NYX
here just because yes NYX is a drugstore
brand but no this doesn't really stay
within that really low cost price range
that I've been talking about with other
things so just a little reminder if
you're shopping at Ulta or wherever you
might come across this and I think it's
a great set it's called brighter days
it's like $21 and you're getting a super
nice quality eye palette in here
I will link below to both the video
where I use this on my eyes and the
video where I reviewed this and another
NYX kit but it's a nice like jewel tone
palette everything in there is a really
consistent nice pigmented texture
reminds me a lot of their augment pop
formula and also just the layout in
general of those palettes that they put
out last year you're getting a matte
lipstick I think that's in the shade
called honey moon yes gorgeous matte
kind of Mavi hint of gray in that shade
it's an interesting more trendy color
and then a black eyeliner retractable in
there as well it's a fun set so I just
wanted to give you a little reminder /
shout out on that and then Burt's Bees
did anybody see on snapchat when I was
like look what I found a Walgreens
Burt's Bees limited edition lip balms
they have like a mint I don't know if
they called it mint Coco or mint
chocolate chip
and then they also have ginger spice
which I had never seen ginger spice
before from Burt's Bees but this is the
one I picked up and it's so smooth it's
got that nice like Burt's Bees
smoothness and what's odd about it if
you feel a little bit of that coolness
on your
lips that is very classic for Burt's
Bees lip balms but the scent makes you
think all about like warmth and
gingerbread cookies and cinnamon spice
kind of things so I like that scent a
lot that could be a nice stocking
stuffer and that's it guys that's what I
got for right now as far as the
drugstore kits that I have tried that
really impressed me that I would be
excited to give to anybody on my list if
you've noticed something somewhere
that's really interested you that you're
wondering about in terms of drugstore
sets and palettes let me know like I
said the drugstore stuff seems to
trickle out like all the way leading up
to Christmas so I may have more fines
and more videos on this topic but thank
you guys so much for spending time with
me today I really enjoyed it as always
and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
