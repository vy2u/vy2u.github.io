for tuning in I'm glad you're here for
this video this is going to be something
that I'm pretty excited about I did this
whole makeup look for just under twenty
five dollars I also used only six
products to do the full face of makeup
the idea all started because I just
wanted to do a video showing you this
elf acne fighting foundation in action
but I thought how can I give them more
to see and so I kind of challenged
myself to do a full look under a certain
price and it started with thirty dollars
and then I thought maybe I can do better
than that so I got it down to 25 I did
not factor my brushes into this there
was no way I would have gone under 25
with all the brushes I used but maybe in
the future I'll do another challenge
where I'll keep the brushes in there the
way I started out I already had my
moisturizer on and then I used this ELF
acne fighting foundation in buff which I
just love the texture of this stuff it's
thicker than I would have expected it's
very soothing creamy almost feels kind
of nourishing and soothing on the skin
so I like that and I spread it out
everywhere and I blended that in with my
Real Techniques buffing brush it's very
easy to blend in with your fingers as
well if you wanted to do it that way but
once I got all of that blended in all
over the face I pulled in a concealer
and the concealer I used is the NYC
cover stick in light probably not my
favorite concealer of all time but a
little strategy I use for blending it
out I think really makes it work but I
used it on the under-eye down the nose
really anywhere I wanted to highlight
since this is a bit lighter than my
actual skin tone but first step for
blending I did use a brush I pulled in
one of my up-and-up concealer brushes
it's kind of a full concealer type brush
and I just worked to blend in as much as
I could in kind of hard to get two areas
and then I also went down the nose the
other parts of the face where I applied
the product but then I really wanted to
get this looking very natural on the
under eye area so when I was finished
with the brush I just went in with my
fingers and really used the heat of my
finger to help the remaining product
just melt into my skin and it really
did give me a nice finished effect it
might not be as heavy duty of a job as
you know using a peachy tone corrector
and then layering something else with it
might do but this worked for me for
today and now I'm left wanting to set
those areas and I pulled out something
that in the past I never really liked
it's the cool tone bronzer from ELF
I think I used to look at this in a very
one-sided way and I thought how is that
gonna work as a bronzer but it really
can work as a bronzer and you can also
split it up and use it other ways so I
just used that lightest powder and I
dusted that on the under eye area to
sort of set that concealer and then I
found that if I kind of use a lot of
that lighter shade paired with a little
bit of the brown underneath it I can
sort of create a skin tone powder and I
really do like to set this acne fighting
foundation all over so I did that with
my ELF complexion brush and I just use
that all over and it really worked to
even out the texture of my skin
everything really felt set that way and
then of course I'm gonna go on and use
that brownish tone powder as a contour
and it works great for that I used my
open up blush brush just to take that in
the cheekbones you can take it around
the hairline as well wherever you really
like to go with your contour and then I
sort of isolated that pinky deep rose
color as well and use that as my blush
and I actually think that is a beautiful
blush I was very very happy with the way
that came off so again this product that
I really didn't love at first is
emerging it's kind of the MVP of the
look because for my brows I went to the
deepest shade in here and I just used an
angled brush and quickly filled in
evened out my brows left to right and
then before getting into the eye shadow
I prime my lids with a little bit of the
concealer and this can really work fine
in a pinch if you don't have an eye
primer and you do have some kind of
creamy concealer just keep it very very
minimal and really press it into the
skin and I went back to my ELF cool
bronzer and I went to the lighter of the
two Browns and I just used that for a
natural crease color because the palette
that I pulled for this look does not
have any mattes I would say any fluffy
crease brush is gonna work for that step
and then I pulled out my Old Faithful
wet and wild comfort zone palette
everybody needs this palette it's so
great I used my top two greens in there
I just patted that on with a flat shadow
brush and then for a little depth I took
the definer shade the
really dark brown and I patted that just
on the outer part of the lid I work that
up into the crease as well and there's
so much punch in this shade so much
pigment that I found I could go back in
with a blending brush and sort of pull
that shade up through the crease even
more and then I took that sort of medium
brown shade in this palette and I just
used a smudger brush and applied that on
the outer part of my lower lash line and
then I used the brow bone shade they're
really buttery one just right up under
my brow for a highlight there I also use
that buttery shade as a highlight on my
cheek bones it actually works really
nicely that way and if you're dead set
on using eyeliner and you want to stay
in this looks price range dampen a brush
and go into this darkest shade right
down here and you could just apply that
across the upper lash line and get a
lined effect sometimes when I skip the
liner my lashes can look bigger so I
curled my lashes and I went in with my
super sizer mascara from covergirl it
really just makes a huge difference for
my lashes so I apply that I feel like I
get really good length I get a curl that
holds and then my final step was lips
and I had this $1.99 la girl endless
semi-permanent Auto lip liner in wine
and I was wanting to go a little bit
deeper on the lips and so I thought this
would be the perfect shade so this is
really nice and long wearing I wouldn't
go as far as to say the semi-permanent
but it was really the color I was after
and it was the right price for this look
so this is my finished look I was really
pleased with the way it turned out for
right around $25 I had several products
in here that I absolutely loved I would
say my non-negotiables as I was planning
out this look I wanted to show this
foundation for sure so obviously I was
gonna use that I really wanted to use my
super sizer mascara because it's just my
favorite and also it's really hard to
beat wet and wild as far as bang for
your buck for pigmented great quality
eyeshadows and I knew this could double
with the highlight I would say the thing
that surprised me most for how far it
could go was this cool bronzer from ELF
I'm using these shades separately it was
almost like giving me a second I shadow
palette it was giving me multiple things
that I could use on my face powder wise
so that's a very handy multitasker to
have in your collection but thank you
guys so much for watching I really
appreciate it and I'll see you again
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
