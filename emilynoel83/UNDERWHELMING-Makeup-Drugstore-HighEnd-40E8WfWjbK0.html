on this video the topic is a little bit
different I think compared to maybe what
you're used to seeing because I feel
like we as youtubers can almost feel
pressured to take a really hard stance
on a product we're reviewing like we
either love it and totally recommend it
or it's a complete dud fail don't buy it
whatever and you know I've done plenty
of videos where they are favourites or
they're fails but to be honest here
there are a lot of things that fall in
the middle and when do those really get
talked about when is there a discussion
on those I'm not really sure but you
think about it like just in terms of
grades in school teachers don't just
give aids and F's there are also B's C's
and DS and that's kind of where these
products fall I mean they are things
that I would not repurchase but you know
I'm not gonna totally not use them
either it'll be occasionally used and
worked into looks that I do but I just
don't love them and I feel kind of meh
about it they're just middle ground type
things and I thought yeah I'm gonna
share those because I really have
compiled quite a little container full
of them here so I thought it's time to
share and if these work fabulously for
you and they're Holy Grail products I
think that's wonderful for me again
there's something about each one of
these where they didn't quite meet the
expectation you know first thing I want
to talk about is the newer and sorry
it's covered as much this is the newer
pallet from Charlotte Tilbury the
instant look in a pallet remember in the
Nordstrom sale if you watch that video
that I did I mentioned that they came
out with a dolce vita version of that
palace so there was the original and you
know that sold out and they claimed they
were never making it again and then they
came out with this version exclusively
for the Nordstrom sales so I ordered
this I wasn't able to show this to you
in that video because I was just saying
yeah I'm pretty sure I'm gonna order it
so I did and I got it and you know there
are a few reasons why this didn't quite
hit the mark for me and the first thing
was that the bronzer and the highlight
down here it claimed that these were the
same as the film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow
which I have not only on the other
palette but I have them
individual compact kind of a cool
contour type powder and a really
beautiful highlight and if they are
exactly the same in the original instant
look and a palette but in here even
though they claim to be the same I feel
like they're totally different this
bronzer is much more of like a classic
bronzer type shade instead of being a
cool contour and this highlight is
almost pinky
instead of being that pretty like
champagne color and it just doesn't seem
to have the glow that the other one does
one small improvement maybe with this
palette over the last one it's that I
feel like the blushes are a little more
intense and I like that but the
eyeshadows like I just can't get a look
that I love out of these shadows and I
am wearing all this stuff on my face
today and you know I wore the shadows
the look is fine but it's just one of
those situations where like this shade
you know I wanted a lot more intensity
out of that I feel like I've got to
build that up so much it's weird even on
top of a primer and then you know these
other two shades just end up kind of
looking sort of muddy and I don't end up
loving the look I don't hate the look
but it's just kind of average so this is
what the original instant look and a
palette is like compared to this one and
again the film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow you
can see in this one they look different
from what's happening in here and I
guess I I don't totally mind that I'm
getting a different shade selection with
all those space products the original
bronze &amp;amp; Glow just happened to be
something that I absolutely loved and I
would have liked that to have been
consistent with this palette and in here
you're getting a really like nice
natural eye look and that does kind of
work for me each shade really serves a
purpose and here I just feel like I kept
getting kind of a muddy unpigmented look
but I still can't say I hate this
palette because I do love the
convenience factor I love how many
things have been put into one sadly it's
not in stock anymore this or the
original but it's a great concept and I
wouldn't be surprised if it gets
released you know with yet another color
selection at some point but just be
aware if it is and it says there's
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow in there be a
little wary of that if you have an
opportunity to swatch it out and really
check and see if that's the same you may
want to
that another Charlotte Tilbury thing
that just I really worked with this
product a lot to try to see what is the
huge appeal and I it just wasn't
clicking with me and it's the magic
foundation and I have this in the shade
five medium beautiful bottle here it's
got a nice little pump on it and in one
respect yes it does not look too heavy
it really does have a natural kind of
skin like appearance it walks that fine
line of you know it's not being too
shimmery shiny a natural glow but at the
same time it doesn't look intensely flat
and matte like you're wearing a mask so
it is that nice middle ground as far as
finish goes but I kind of wanted more
coverage or maybe just expected it to do
a little bit more from the coverage
standpoint and again it's not bad
coverage I will continue to get use out
of this because I paid for the product
I've been working with it a lot the
staying power is pretty decent on me
there are reasons why I definitely like
it but I just don't love it I also
wanted to follow up with you on this
almay age essentials makeup and this is
the foundation in light/medium neutral
and I had talked about this in a haul
video along with a couple of other Almay
things and there's like a lip balm in
this line that I really love there's a
stick concealer in this line that I
think is fantastic but this foundation
just kind of left me saying and you know
I could take it or leave it it's like
one of those classic light to medium
coverage foundations that's just kind of
there it didn't really take my skin and
make it look so much more healthier or
give it some wonderful finish but it
gets points for not being like
non-existent it did cover some stuff and
do good for overall evening of the skin
tone but it's definitely nothing I'm
going to repurchase again there was
nothing remarkable for me about this and
while I'm on this kind of fact patient
ranima talk about the naked skin
one-and-done from Urban Decay that says
hybrid complexion Perfector it does have
SPF 20 in it and I have it in the shade
medium so it's got that kind of like it
cosmetics CC cream does where the
squeezy tube is here but you're going to
use this pump to dispense it which I
love pumps because you can be consistent
with the amount of product you use the
thing about this was I felt like I
kind of comparing it to the cosmetics
and there's very little that really
measures up to that product if you're
wanting this sunscreen and moisturizer
and all these things happening in one
plus the coverage nothing compares to
that one coverage Weiss so I put this on
and I'm just kind of feeling like okay
you know it gives me a little light
evening out but I wanted more coverage
and some people might be happy with just
the lightness of this but if you are you
there still would be a lot of drugstore
options that do just about exactly what
this does you know the light moisture
the light coverage I would say I
actually prefer the covergirl clean
matte BB over this or the Rimmel BB
cream with the blue cap just the classic
Rimmel BB cream I would prefer either of
those over this I have to use a little
bit of extra moisturizer under this and
I would do the same for those products
as well because I'm not especially oily
right now my skin actually needs a
little extra hydration but this is
something with you know the high-end
price tag I didn't think it was really
worth it I don't hate it it's not doing
something dreadfully bad on my skin and
the staying power was actually pretty
good but as I've said there aren't a lot
of reasons why this is a favorite either
another product I've been playing around
with quite a bit in my collection is
this bobbi brown skin weightless powder
foundation in beige 3 if this sounds
familiar I did talk about it in a Bobbi
Brown Hall and the product looks like
this it's just a very classic matte
powder foundation the coverage is good
but not as good as it could be I think
part of this products downfall was that
I tried it around the same time I
started experimenting with my Chanel
double perfection Lumiere powder and
this is absolutely outstanding the
coverage is there the absolute non
powder like look is there it's a really
great combination of things happening in
a powder foundation and for this it just
seems so basic you know it was matte the
coverage was okay it's something I'll
continue to use more maybe just to set a
foundation here and there but not so
impressed with it on its own
you know what I'm saying it's just the
definition of men product for me you
know I'll keep using it but I'm not
gonna seek it out again to repurchase
same story here this Urban Decay beached
bronzer I have it in the shade Sunkist
and I was randomly like sentient this
one I'm not sure I assume there are
other shades of this and this is okay
kind of lightly all over my skin it
looks kind of pretty but for my skin
tone you're looking at kind of light to
medium skin tone here and overall it
doesn't have a lot of impact so it's
just kind of like I've got to work a
little extra hard to build it up and
have it be seen on my skin it's not
looking bad it's not having like a
negative effect it is a nice matte
bronzer I'm not calling this a contour
it has the pretty warmth that you would
expect from a bronzer but there are just
I've got a drawer full of bronzers of
much lower prices that can do what this
does with ease these days if I'm looking
for just more of a subtle all-over
bronzer I love that Physicians Formula
butter bronzer you know that's a really
easy one to reach for and this one I
just felt like gosh I'm having to apply
a lot of product for it to even be seen
on my skin and it could be that there
would be a much more proper shade for me
in this line that I might enjoy much
more but this one was just kind of like
also this highlight stick and this
Maybelline master strobing stick this I
remembered swatching it and thinking oh
I'm gonna love that it's like kind of a
cool toned type highlight if you don't
love everything being so golden all the
time which I like a lot of the gold
anyone's but this one is you can see a
little more cool a little bit more pink
so it added a nice bit of variety to my
collection with that and I love the
master blush sticks from Maybelline I
think those have just been so easy to
work with like some of the easiest cream
blushes to apply and blend out even just
using your fingers and the texture this
kind of feels the same but maybe just
the fact that it is a highlight and it
is light and shimmery
when I put this on my skin the dryness
kind of shows in this product I feel
when I put it on the top of my
cheekbones I'm wearing a tiny bit of it
today
it looks okay in a very very sparing
amount but to just kind of go at it and
put it on your skin I feel like it looks
really pretty dry and you know it does
kind of have that cream to powder feel
which in some cases like I said with
blushes can be fine
but I think the nature of this being
light and shimmery if it is a little too
dry that will show on areas where you
might have a few fine lines creeping
through don't hate the product but don't
totally love it either I also got this
highlight it's a stick highlight from
Ilya and the shade is called polka dots
and moonbeams illuminator and I guess
I'm just really picky with texture on
these cream highlights but it looks like
this and I'm sorry but this is way too
dry like it's a creamy stick it actually
feels creamier than the Maybelline it
doesn't have that same cream to powder
nature to it but it's like there's too
much pull with this product when I try
to put it on get it off on a brush it
doesn't come off onto the brush very
easily so then you're kind of left
thinking okay if I'm gonna get product
onto my skin I'm gonna have to sort of
rake it across and there's just too much
pull that way it's too dry the thing I
like about this is that the effect is
subtle it's like a soft pearl and I do
think that can be pretty but just
getting there getting to the finished
look is hard application is not just a
gimme with this you've got to be so
careful I've got a couple of min
mascaras and I've got a lot of you know
really crummy mascaras over time a few
that I've absolutely loved but these
definitely fall somewhere in the middle
first off the Laura Geller style lash
intense lengthening mascara this one is
a far improvement over some laura geller
mascaras I remember trying a few several
years back and they were like the
goofiest wettest most horrible things
for my lashes ever and this one it's
like the formula is a little bit better
quite a bit better than those the brush
reminds me a lot of Tarte lights camera
lashes you know that subtle kind of
tapering toward the tip and you know how
sometimes you can just tell when they're
rubber bristles or when it's like a
traditional old-school mascara wand this
is really hard to tell I swear I'm
seeing some rubber bristles but maybe
they
actually there's some classic bristles
mixed in I'm not even sure but this is
like an easy mascara for me to apply and
put on I guess the finished effect just
leaves me wanting more I want more
length I want more separation I want
more volume you know covergirl super
sizer checks all those boxes for me feel
like it's way better than a lot of older
laura geller mascaras that i've used but
just not quite good enough
and then the balm has this mascara
called mad lash and this I thought maybe
I was gonna like this the first time I
used it it it kind of did okay for me
but the more I messed with it and really
got to looking at the wand and what it
was doing it was just kind of not enough
every time I pull it out this little end
tip is loaded with product but if you
can get it cleaned off and get a close
look at it it's almost trying to do the
kind of thing that like benefit they're
real mascara is doing but on a more
subtle notes see those little spy Keys
at the end with benefits at least those
are long enough when you get them
cleaned off to sort of do something but
these stay so short and they stay so
cooped up with product it's kind of hard
to get a lot of effect I do like the
shortness of the bristles everywhere
else this is definitely a rubber bristle
wand and there is a slight curve to it
it gives me okay length but the effect
is kind of more subtle than I want and
even building it up I just can't get
quite where I want to be but it's not
the worst it's just not the best either
I'm gonna wrap this up with a couple of
lip products here it's the NYX plush gel
lipstick I got two of these one is in
the shade nude beach which doesn't every
product line have a nude called nude
beach so there's your new batch of room
mix and then the red one that I have is
called shark fin and I'm wearing shark
fin right now and these products like I
kind of wanted to like them at first
because I thought oh it's smooth it
feels comfortable and it's got that
instantaneous like comfort feeling that
I like but then I kind of realized oh
they're they're actually really thin
they're kind of slippery they kind of
give me that lip smacker slipperiness
vibe which is fine an elipse Macker but
when you start throwing color into it it
can be kind of a staying
our concern and kind of a you know is it
gonna stay in my lip line concern and
this one has not been on for more than
an hour you know and I can already look
at my lips and just see a little bit
traveling right outside of very fine
lines around my lips and that's normally
not a huge concern for me I just have
really learned over time if I want to go
red on my lips I probably want to be
wearing like a lipstick that doesn't
have too much shine that just doesn't go
too far in that thin kind of you know
run outside your lips direction you want
something that's safe and that is gonna
stay in place so this you know just a
little too thin can't quite manage it in
the nude shade I thought I was gonna
love it because of the way it looked in
a swatch but then the way it looks on
top of my lips is almost kind of ashy
greyish pink nude it's just weird
I like the slim design of the packaging
I like the comfortable glide that they
have going on to the lips I'm just not
totally sold on the way they wear and
the shade so those are just some of my
underwhelming makeup products of the
moment you know it just didn't quite
meet expectations there are some good
points about almost everything that I
talked about in this video but there are
some bad points too and that kind of
leaves it in sort of an average range
for me so let me know if you've tried
any products recently that just you know
they weren't fails and but they weren't
the best either they were somewhere in
the middle do you have things like that
let me know what they are and thank you
so much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
