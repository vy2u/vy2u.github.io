wanted to hop on here real quick and
chat about ulties 21 days of beauty sale
this is something that they do every
year and you may have seen it mentioned
like in your old to add in this ad they
outline special deals special discounts
on certain items it looks like there's
one or two each day and it runs from
September 4th through the 24th and if
you don't have your ad I will link to
the site online where you can kind of
browse through this with me and this
video has nothing to do with Ulta I mean
it's not sponsored by Ulta it was just
my decision to do it and I thought it
would be fun because I have had some
questions about what I recommend from
this sale so I've picked like kind of a
top 5 things from this sale that I would
recommend getting that I think are
especially good deals and just things
that I've really enjoyed I realize I'm
starting this a couple days into the
sale but I didn't really have anything
from the earliest days anyway and the
first thing actually that I'm interested
in that I don't currently have but I'm
thinking about buying in this sale is on
Saturday September 10th
the philosophy micro delivery
exfoliating wash you can get 8 ounces
for $14 that's down from $28 and that is
a really really good face scrub that's
kind of my like standard for face scrubs
because the little scrub ease the little
granules or particles are so so fine and
it just does a really awesome job of
making your face feel so super clean so
I would really like to get some of that
again and I think $14 is a great deal
but in terms of my picks that I have
here to share with you specifically on
Monday September 12th the Mallee shadow
stick extras these are 1250 each they're
regularly $25 each I've talked about her
shadow sticks a lot over the years and
the shadow stick extras are kind of like
a reformulation I feel like there's a
little more moisture in them it takes
them just a bit longer to set but the
pigmentation is definitely there and
they don't dry out your eyes but they do
set for a long wear on the eyes they're
all so nice faces too like for example
for the look I did today I use this
shake called autumn shimmer and it was a
great base for this sort of rose gold
thing I've got going on here so really
great quality cream shadows
if you're looking to branch out into
that kind of world you might want to
check that out moving on to Thursday
September 15th the laura geller baked
balance and brighton foundation is 1650
it's regularly $33 I have it here in
some different packaging that I got from
a kit but I wear this it says regular I
think I'm not sure if they've renamed
that medium but the middle shade is what
I tend to wear in this and as you can
see it's a powder foundation swirled
with different shades my mom actually
loves this stuff she wears two different
shades I think she uses the fair all
over her skin and then the medium shade
like kind of I don't know if so much as
a contour but like on the areas of her
face that she wants to shadow just a bit
more and it is really good coverage this
sale kind of caused me to bust this out
again and wear it for my foundation look
today and I really really like this
stuff it's a nice matte foundation I do
find it has some color correcting going
on these products are baked and kind of
domed up and it just takes me forever
even on a smaller sample size thing from
her it takes me a really long time to
hit pan on it so it's a good value 1650
is a great price there and then the
following day Friday September 16th
Smashbox always sharp Kohl liners are
$10 they're normally $21 and I know I
mentioned these I gave him a little
shout out at the end of my eyeliner
video which was for the most part all
drugstore but I had a special mention
for this and now it's on sale so yeah
this would be a great chance to try one
of these I've talked about it before the
top twists off and so every time you use
one of these you're getting a freshly
sharpened freshly pointed tip and the
shape that I find I reach for the most
I mean I know a basic black is always
great to have but I love their dark
brown called Sumatra from this line so
that's what I'm holding here that is
what I have across my upper lash line
today a nice rich matte beautiful brown
I think I've had this since around like
last Christmas maybe and it still stays
really creamy and smooth and I do think
it's because you're getting that fresh
sharpen every single time you put it on
now probably the best deal the thing I'm
most excited about for this sale and the
thing that made me feel like I have got
to do this video because I love this
product so much is
on Sunday September 18th the Stila
perfect me perfect hue palette is 1950
that's normally $39 I love this thing
this sounds a little bit familiar to you
I did talk about it in a video on
multitasking palette palettes that
include different eye and face products
in one and the way these palettes are
labeled it's kind of by your skin tone
but you don't necessarily have to go by
that I would give them all a good look
but the one that I like the most is for
medium to tan I love the eye shadow
color selection most in here the blushes
are gorgeous I think these would all
wear well on deeper skin even lighter
skin too you know it's just nice quality
pigmented stuff I'm wearing both of the
blushes today I've got this kind of
plummy matte blush a little lower on the
cheek and I went over it with this
peachy blush that has a little bit of
Sheen and then the shadows in here so
many great things happening you guys
know I love the kind of rose gold
peachy type color paired with a plummy
color and this is one of the best matte
wine type i shadow shades that's out
there I'm wearing it on my lids today
like I said I use the autumn shimmer as
a base and then I packed on the rose
gold all over the lid a lot of this wine
color kind of in the outer corner crease
and this shade right here is actually a
great very soft color to blend out your
edges it's matte so it really can
perfect you know the edge of a darker
shade you've got a great like deep matte
Brown in here as well a light sort of
shimmery shade you can use as a
highlight I think it's great going into
fall it's the Stila quality that I
really came to expect from their
palettes like in the light in the garden
or whatever those you know little
cardboard pallets were that they had out
maybe a few years back I love those and
this is that nice buttery rich texture
so it's a lot of good things happening
in one palette and you're getting a
great discount on it so I love that and
then the last thing just kind of rolling
through this list here Friday September
23rd the Too Faced matte lipsticks I
really like these and this sale prompted
me to kind of pull these out of my
collection start using them again
because I'm not really sure what
happened but I sort of forgot about it
I'm going to wear a matte lip I tend to
veer a little bit more toward wanting to
just wear a matte lipstick as opposed to
the liquid lipsticks I mean there are
some good liquid lipsticks out there but
I just find lipsticks a bit more low
maintenance in terms of you know if I do
need to reapply it's very easy just to
touch them up and you don't have maybe
the 100 percent dry down but you still
have really good staying power I've
pulled out a few of my favorite shades
from this line I am wearing sorry not
sorry which as you can see it's kind of
a deeper nude it's a nice fall mood also
you've heard me talk about before the
shade Bachelorette this pretty rosy pink
there's like a little bit of coral in
this shade just gorgeous really live-ins
up the face if you're in the market for
a pretty berry shade the color hey girl
I think is so beautiful really great
fall berry type color and then rebel
heart is a nice red and I really prefer
to wear Reds on the lips when they are
matte but it's just very pure very
pretty so those are my top picks from
the Ulta 21 days of beauty sale if you
are looking at your ad as well and you
feel like I've totally skipped something
over or I've missed something that's
really good let me know in the comments
section and maybe that's something I'll
need to try in this sale so thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
