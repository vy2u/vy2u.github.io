have an Ulta haul to share with you
today it's a little bit of everything
I've got a few little like individual
products that I picked up a few other
holiday items that I'm really curious
about and will likely end up reviewing
for you or doing looks with very soon
first thing I want to mention is this
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer this is
one of those concealers that I get asked
about all the time and it just drove me
to go ahead and purchase it people are
asking is it really that good how good
is it so I got it in the shade light
neutral and this is what that looks like
I do think it is the right color for my
skin and it is a really lightweight
concealer I don't feel like it's that
unique compared to like my Maybelline
better skin that I had been using kind
of in combination with a corrector type
product for the under eye circles when
you're up you know 2 to 3 times in the
night with a teething baby you're gonna
have that so I do like the consistency
of this I think it wears well but when I
first got it I used it without any sort
of added corrector for the under eyes
and I didn't think it was quite enough
like for the real dark areas I felt like
I needed a little bit extra I think
maybe more light to moderate
discoloration this might be the answer
but like I said it really behaves like
my Maybelline better skin which I like a
lot I think that's a really good
concealer I wanted to test out Molly's
new lip gloss I believe these are called
H 3 I think that stands for hydration
something something I'll have to look
that up but the shade I chose was
perfect nude it's kind of took my best
guess for a shade that I thought I would
get a lot of wear out of and this is
perfect nude on my lips this particular
shade has no shimmer and I would call it
kind of a dusty rose you know it's very
shiny and I was kind of surprised at how
pigmented it is for how thin it is it's
a very comfortable gloss on the lips
it's a pretty color I really like
Mally's and high shine liquid lip colors
that come in a little click through pins
and I feel like those have better
staying power for me than this I think
maybe just the thinness of this product
like it wears away faster the packaging
is definitely pretty it's a cute product
and it's just a standard doe foot
applicator kind of like The Naked skin
concealer I mean it's just a like not a
love
for me it's not something I think I'm
gonna go out and purchase anymore shades
of but I just wanted to share with you
wanted to try this from soap &amp;amp; Glory
it's called the scrub of your life I've
been slowly trying so many things from
this line and enjoying them so much I
think I need to do an all-encompassing
like here's what I've used from soap &amp;amp;
Glory here's what I recommend type video
now this scrub I have not yet tried but
it smells kind of like the body wash I
think it's called clean on me but just a
scrub options so I will definitely test
that out let you know what I think and
the other thing I got is just a little
thing here from hips it's their triple
moisture winter berry creme Brule herbal
whipped body cream it's limited edition
and I just thought I've had great luck
with the lotions and stuff from this
line I think I want to try something new
it smells absolutely amazing
I mean it's berry it's I don't know if I
would pick creme brulee out of that
stint but I mean it's really good like
berries and cream kind of scent is what
it makes me think of but I haven't
actually used this on my body yet these
lotions have a reputation for working
really well with me good for sensitive
skin on the body
another little bundle that I came across
that I really wanted to mention to you
guys because I thought what a great
price and this is something that I might
like to give to someone
it's from Nivea and it says give the
gift of care and it's this little pouch
it's $8.99 and it comes with four
different things in here and you guys
know I am a huge fan of the Nivea lip
balms and in here you're getting two one
of them is the tinted version it's
called a kiss of color and care I
reviewed these way back when but this
one is called sheer berry and it looks
really dark it's actually just a
beautiful like berry wash of color on
the lips it's gorgeous and then the
other is just one of their standard lip
balms for when your lips are just
out-and-out parched and you need
something on them this is the kiss of
moisture essential lip cares all of
these Nivea lip balms I tell you the
olive oil and lemon the kiss of
smoothness whichever one you grab for
like it's gonna feel great on the lips
especially when your lips really need
some help and then you get one of these
classic Nivea creams I haven't used one
of these in a long long time
and I would open it up and show you but
it is sealed and it just looks like a
white cream I have found this stuff to
be pretty heavy-duty and you can really
put it anywhere that you're especially
dry so and the size is just it's so
compact I love that and then you get a
pretty generously sized body lotion here
this is a 2.5 ounce essentially enriched
body lotion it says almond oil
noticeably smoother skin for dry to very
dry skin this would be new to me I have
not yet tried this but it seems like the
kind of thing that could be a very
gender-neutral and B it's got the Nivea
name on it I've been very happy with
their you know moisturizers lotions and
different things I've used in the past
so I just wanted to share that little
kit with you if you're looking for some
stocking stuffer ideas $8.99 I feel like
you get a lot and it's the type of thing
anyone would use and like oh I forgot
about this other thing from soap &amp;amp; Glory
that I picked up it's winter wonderland
and it's a set of the hand food hand
creams and I don't know if my mom has
caught on but past few years I've been
getting her little hand cream sets I
think last year I got her some from
philosophy
so mom spoiler alert this one's going to
you babies nothing to look forward to
but this has the three different cents
and I do have a hand food hand cream of
my own and I really like it I like that
it's not too too thick it's not the kind
of hand cream that you put on and you
sit there spending forever waiting for
it to like melt into your skin and not
be so greasy so you can move on and do
other things you know it's like a quick
easy hand cream and this has three
scents in here including the sugar crush
scent which I love in the body
moisturizer it's got original pink rose
which I assume is the same as the
regular one I have and then this one is
called smoothy star and who can't use
you know a little sized hand cream to
throw in their purse or to just you know
keep by their nightstand or something
like that I know my mom is hard on her
hand she works hard she cooks a lot and
she can definitely use something like
that I got to tell you you guys your
questions drive so many of my purchases
when I see that I'm getting a lot of
tweets are a lot of just random
questions on social media about this or
that product it really makes me want to
try it out and so one that has been
asked about a lot is this Anastacio it's
the so
made palette so the latest eyeshadow
palette released from Anastasia and I
absolutely loved the shadow couture
world traveler one which I'm not sure
how readily available that is because it
was a limited edition thing and now the
new ones out but this is what the
self-made palette looks like I've only
used it once I'm wearing it today and so
far I'm not really sure I'm not sure
that I like it as much as the last one
I'm gonna have to use it some more
because I've only used a handful of the
colors that are in here there are some
beautiful shades in here I'm not
critiquing it on that account it's just
like kind of personal preference and I
really like the shades that were in that
last one but when i swatched blossom i
thought it seemed pretty light like I
wasn't getting a ton of color out of it
and so I decided I would try it on the
lids today on top of the primer it did
better on a primer so that's on my lids
with a little pop of the ultra shimmery
pink champagne like right in the center
I've got these two matte shades in my
crease one a bit more peachy one more
dark as far as mattes go in this palette
I mean those are pretty much it sherbert
and hot chocolate because butterflies
seems like a little bit like borderline
satiny finish it's it's close to that
but just so you know that is my
highlight by the way I've got treasure
around my inner corner and then I
smudged hot-and-cold down on the lower
lash line so I guess I am wearing a lot
of shades in this palette but I will
point out this does have two more shades
than the world traveler palette had it's
got a lot of nice neutrals you know but
with a few interesting colors like that
green kind of a bluish purple right down
here but I think something honest Asya
with her palettes always does right a
great brush these are always such usable
brushes there's a crease brush that is a
perfect size I think not oversized at
all and this one has one of those sort
of a mix between a flat brush and a
smudger brush so this works really well
if you want to go lower lashline with
that or you can kind of stick it right
there in the outer part of the crease
too so it's a pretty versatile brush
also this one from Stila so beautiful
was one of those where I wasn't as
impressed until I saw it in person and
it's called the trust and love gift set
was $40 and it's really cool how instead
of opening like a standard
it opens more like an envelope and it
kind of wraps around and then they're
the beautiful eyeshadows you're getting
a lip glaze which I've never been a big
fan of lip glazes this one looks
basically clear on my lips so won't want
wish they gave something else in there
and then this is the steal a huge
extreme lash mascara which I have not
yet tried let's look at it the brush
reminds me a lot of Too Faced better
than sex so we'll see how that goes I
feel like there are a couple of distinct
sides to this palette if you were
looking for an easy way to wear it you
know you've got these kind of bluish and
cool grays and then over here you know
some more peachy shades rusty colors a
plum and I love this this is speaking to
me over here on this side because it
reminds me so much of the happy place
quad from bareMinerals which I
absolutely adore some of these shades in
here can give me that same exact look so
that's the way I was wearing it
yesterday I mean this is just a
brilliant kind of shimmery peach shade
paired with the plum it looks so
gorgeous so if you were kind of wanting
to try those kinds of colors in that
quad but maybe get a little more bang
for your buck with more shadows this is
great also the quality in this palette
I'm so glad that they got away from
whatever they were doing in those square
palettes you know how they put out those
kind of rose gold looking gorgeous to
look at on the outside square palettes
recently and I got one of those and I
didn't think the quality was as good as
I expect from Stila this is kind of like
back to what they were doing before it
reminds me of the textures of the
shadows in the in the light palette in
the garden you know all those little
rectangular palettes they put out they
were so buttery soft and smooth and this
is what's happening here I mean they are
the kind of shadows kind of like lorac
how you put your brush into them and you
do have to kind of tap off some excess
you want to kind of pace yourself a
little bit with these shadows because a
little goes a long way but I kind of
like that in a nice shadow as far as
your 100% matte shades they are here
here and here this one is close it's a
little bit more of a satiny finish this
one up here you know highly shimmery
silvery color this one has a little bit
of like tiny sparkle in it but there's
nothing super flaky like glittery
fallout that you're gonna have with
any of these last little make-up thing
that I had to try I had to try because
I've been keeping up with all of the
naturally pretty palates that come out
from it cosmetics and they do have a
special one for the holidays now it's
this little kit it's $28 and it's a six
color eyeshadow palette plus a
transforming hello light shade and then
a mini pillow lashes mascara I have had
exceptionally bad luck with this mascara
you see how it's got the little ball on
the end I've had this mascara two times
and both times the little ball has
snapped off the end like into the tube
when I pulled it out it's like the tube
was doing a really great job of cleaning
off the product and it just grabbed that
little tip and kept it in there so I
feel like I've never really been able to
appreciate what that mascara is capable
of because of that little snafu that I
have had every time but this palette is
so cute it's not like furry the outside
like the other ones are and it's about
half the length it seems all of the
shades in here are new so you've got all
of your mats and then this shimmery
shade which could absolutely be a
highlight on the cheeks if you want it
to it's not like crazy metallic shiny
but it just gives a little bit of glow
so you can of course layer that with
these shadows you can just use it as an
accent highlighter shade I did a look
with all of them the other day and loved
it if you like the rosy shades I feel
like you've got a couple that definitely
take you in that direction
you've got your kind of deep brown
you've got a couple of lighter shades up
here but you know each shade is really
its own thing I like that if you're
gonna have a small palette like this
there's nothing there's no duplicate
type colors and this one I couldn't
quite figure out if that was a dark
brown or if it had a hint of Plum and I
feel like on camera I may be seeing a
little hint of purple in that one it's
always hard to show these palettes that
are in metallic packaging this is like
28 bucks I think an under $30 awesome
gift definitely a nice one
oh I have to share right now I'm just
some individual products that I wanted
to pick up a couple gifts a couple
pallets thank you for watching and I
will see you again next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
