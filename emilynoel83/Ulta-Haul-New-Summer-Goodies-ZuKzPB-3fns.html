Ulta haul for you and I just realized a
lot of the stuff I'm talking about
actually takes on kind of a summery
theme a lot of new products and a lot of
things that I think lend themselves to
this time of year first off I know I've
talked about loving the original it
cosmetics CC cream the one with the SPF
50 plus and I think has really good
coverage for a CC cream type product
well now there are a couple of new
versions of this that I wanted to pick
up that I did pick up and one is the CC
plus illumination and I got that in the
shade medium and then also the CC plus
bronzer and this says color correcting
bronzing full coverage cream it also
both of these have the SPF 50 plus and
the bronzer just comes in one shade it's
just called bronze it's really intended
to be worn all over the face and I am
seeing more BB and CC bronzer type
products like this coming out I think
that's gonna provide just that all-over
bronzy glow this being a higher coverage
product it almost felt to me I'm wearing
this today it almost felt like I was
putting on just a foundation in the
wrong shade at first that's really what
it made me think because if you're
familiar with this product you know the
creaminess of it has kind of a thickness
going on and I've got another bronze BB
that I'm going to talk about and it's
the kind where it really kind of sheers
out and it's more of a veil over the
skin but this actually does have some
coverage it's very glowy I can see
little bits of shimmer like tiny little
particles in this once I did get it all
like blended out all over I kind of
liked the look I was getting actually
part of that might be that my skin's
getting a bit more of a tan to it anyway
and so while this was a little deeper
than my natural skin tone it wasn't
crazy far off but I could picture you
know like a super fair-skinned person
putting this on and feeling like it's
just not working at all you know like
it's way way too much bronze setting
this with powder kind of toned down the
glow of this a little bit another thing
I really felt the need to do was go down
on the neck and decollete with a bronzer
just to even things out a little bit but
another way I like to use
I was actually wearing this in my last
video mixed in with a regular foundation
just like it was maybe half a pump of
this mixed in with my Rimmel lasting
finish and I loved that it just added
the nicest bit of glow to that product
so I will probably get most use out of
this and by the way it's a pump love the
pump style on these little tubes I'll
probably get the most use out of this as
a mixing type product but if you've
tried this let me know what you think of
it because I could see a lot of mixed
opinions coming out on that one
also just yesterday I was wearing my CC
plus illumination so this is more like
the regular CC + cream just with a glow
and bi glow I mean like miniscule little
shimmery particles in it and that's not
normally something I like at all but I
must say after I put it on my skin I
loved the look I mean it actually struck
me as the kind of illuminating type
product that truly did kind of blur the
pores instead of really sinking in and
making little imperfections more obvious
I thought it actually had good coverage
and everything just looked so even yet
also glowy and those aren't normally 2
things that I really equate with one
another I'm gonna keep trying this
because I really kind of flaked out at
the end of the day and stopped paying
attention to how well it was actually
wearing because that's a big part of it
for me I wanted to have really good
staying power so I'm gonna keep messing
with that also from Ulta I know I had
talked about an elm a smart shade
product in my underrated drugstore
brands video the smart shade blush and I
have it in coral and I'd showed that it
was so funny I'd never even thought of
this before but a few people commented
the blush looked creepy like they felt
the creepy-crawlies when they look to
happen on camera I never that never even
occurred to me but anyway I like that
blush I think it gives a really pretty
peachy glow and I'd mentioned wanting to
try one of the other colors so I did
pick up the pink here if the speckles on
the blush bother you just look away I'll
tell you when you can look back when I'm
done talking about it I am wearing this
today it gave me a lot more color than I
was expecting
and in a swatch you know it gives a very
soft pinky glue
I actually felt more color coming off on
the cheeks than it does in the swatch so
that was like kind of a pleasant
surprise but it's not crazy different
from you know a lot of the pink blushes
that I already have I do like a pink
blush with this bronzy look is that kind
of a blush almost makes you look extra
sunkissed in certain areas you know like
you just got a little extra Sun so I'm
liking this but I don't know that it's a
love okay all you all looked away you
can come back down let's talk about
another thing that I am wearing in this
video it's the smokes palette from
Maybelline and I really wasn't expecting
to come across this by the way this
stuff was all ordered off the website so
if you haven't seen some of this in your
alte store I got it all online but
anyway Maybelline's got the nudes
palette talks about that like a long
long time ago here on this channel then
most recently found the blush nudes
palette reviewed that on the Express
channel just a couple days ago so check
that out now I've already come up with
the smokes palette as well so let's take
a look at this I have a range of
different neutrals again the thought
behind this palette and it's all laid
out on the back is that you can use
these as duo's trios or quads it's all
depending on how its laid out in the
palette so like these four these four
these four I can kind of see that right
and then the duos you know they've
paired in most cases it seems like a
slightly deeper shade with a light or
mid-tone color it was one of my
complaints about the blush nudes palette
I didn't think it really worked that
well from the aspect of trios and duo's
that were grouped together but anyway
you can bounce around the palette and
use it however you want to well I did
was sum of this brown in the crease and
kind of up above I also did some plum in
the crease the shade right here and also
on the outer part of the lid i deepen
things up with this Navy shade also on
the outer part of the crease and that's
kind of where things get a little muddy
because when you get so deep and dark
with colors smoky shades like that don't
expect a lot of actual color color
payoff in a lot of cases they're just
going to look dark and that's definitely
why I ran into here but then on the
lower lash line I really liked this
shade here
this is a really great texture silvery
charcoal type color and I use that it's
kind of a pop on the lower lash line
anytime you take something Shahi Li
shimmery and stick it there on the lower
lash line I love the way it makes the
lower lashes pop a whole lot more in the
blush nudes palette there was only like
one matte shade and here it looks like
there are three on this sort of dark
teal the brown and also I think this
pink shade might be a little bit of like
a satiny matte finish for one look I was
only able to mess with a certain amount
of shades so I'll have to play with that
some more before I review it something
cool that kind of appealed to me from
Smashbox because this time of year there
aren't always a lot of great sets coming
out and this one had a combination of
things that I knew I liked and some
things I wanted to try and it's the
summer essentials kit so they actually
give you in here for $49 a full sized
photo finish light which is a primer I
actually remember really loving but I
haven't used it in quite some time they
give you a little sides of the photo
finish hydrating under eye primer that's
another thing that I have right now
actually in the full-size I need to use
it more
I recall liking it I mean it's one of
those sort of products where I'm not
convinced I need it but I have enjoyed
using that in the past they give you one
of their like kind of self sharpening
eyeliners in Sumatra which is a nice
deep brown you can see it keeps a really
nice point because every time you twist
that cap on it kind of sharpens it and
reshapes it but just a standard you know
deep deep brown and then a couple of
things I really wanted to try for the
fusion soft lights in baked starburst
this just looks so pretty to me this
could be a highlight also like an
eyeshadow palette practically I didn't
use this as ice shadows over the weekend
and I did like the look that I got it
wasn't a very heavy contrast look you
know it's very soft and glowy and
bronzing and there's nothing wrong with
that but if you swirl your finger or
your brush in everything it's gonna be a
soft golden type highlight I've had some
of the soft lights from Smashbox in the
past and I think they're gorgeous I've
been really happy with them so I
this is going to be no exception
included the be legendary lip gloss this
is in the shade core lean and it looks
like just a creamy coral gloss I really
wish it came off like that color on the
lips because sadly it is very very sheer
just watching it out here for you on my
hand see that this on my lips you know
your lips are more colorful than the
skin on your hand and once I put this on
there
it just looks clear so that was kind of
a disappointment a really vivid summery
lip set that appealed to me actually
from the Ulta brand is this thing you're
right here this is the liquid lipstick
and primer said it comes with a brush
and these four products three your
colors and this one is labeled as a lip
primer it looks just kind of like a
clear gloss I got this because I
instantly thought when I saw this maybe
these are similar to lip tars
maybe these are similar to the LA girl
glazed lip paints I thought it would be
really fun to do a comparison type thing
there i've swatched the three shades and
they are super intense and the orange is
called mimosa that one in the middle
which is kind of like an orange e tone
red is ruby red and then pink spritzers
right here definitely remind me texture
wise of the lip tars I haven't worn
these yet on my lips so we'll see how
that goes I just wiped away the swatches
here and you can see is a quite a bit of
a stain is left behind on those it was a
deal on ardell lashes so I ended up with
a couple of them I got some more wispy
and like how the thickness is kind of
varied throughout the strip's yeah
you've got some thicker places some
thinner areas it looks a little more
natural on the lash line a little and
then I also got the 113 s which I'm
wearing now they're not too far off like
lengthwise from the whispies they're
pretty tapered on the inner part kind of
remind me of the red cherry number 43
only longer like they cover more of my
lash line I don't exactly love that one
of the things I think is so great about
the red cherry 43 is just like they just
they stick right on the right part of
the lash line you know and they don't
annoy my inner corner so that makes them
very comfortable these a little more
annoying and then brand new hadn't heard
any
talking about this yet it's the kula
face makeup setting spray green tea and
aloe and what's special about this this
has an SPF 30 it also contains
hyaluronic acids described here as a
weightless matte finish mist protects
the sensitive skin of your face while
keeping your makeup looking fresh all
day and I thought even when I'm not
wearing makeup you know maybe this would
be a nice little way to refresh my SPF
if I'm outside the pool there's
something I don't like about it though
you got to shake it up and it's loud
this would not have been a concern to me
like a year ago at this time but now I
realize if you're doing your makeup and
there's a baby in the vicinity sleeping
you don't want to go like that but it
does give a super fine mist but one
thing I don't like about it is when I
press it and maybe you'll see it
sometimes it's sticks the little pumper
sticks down a bit this was kind of
pricey and I was definitely intrigued by
the matte finish claim also the SPF so
that's gonna definitely get some testing
and that came with a little bonus
product too this is just the classic
sunscreen SPF 30 and it says cucumbers
lastly I know this is an old haul but I
have a few things I think I just want to
throw in here that I found at Walmart
recently if that's okay with all of you
there is a new Maybelline foundation out
it's maybelline superstay better skin
skin transforming foundation has SPF 50
this I hadn't even been hearing about
just totally like rounded the corner of
an aisle and stumbled across it love
that it's got the pump here I have it in
natural beige it's a little teeny bit
dark for me right now but I thought
throughout the summer this may be dead
on it says improve skins look in three
weeks reduces the appearance of spots
bumps dullness and redness we'll see
I've used this once it didn't seem to do
anything really outstanding for me
coverage wise it seemed like kind of a
straight up medium coverage I remember
years ago loving maybelline superstay
foundation so I definitely didn't want
to pass this one up and then they also
make a superstay better skin concealer I
guess with the same kind of claims and I
have that in light to medium and I'm
wearing some of that today
that pretty good coverage I thought it
seemed to me a little bit better than
the fit me which I know a lot of people
rave about Maybelline fit me concealer I
never found that to be awesome coverage
on me maybe it was because I was using
it more in my melasma days or trying to
use it and it was no match for that kind
of discoloration but this is just you
know a wand applicator kind of a thin
consistency but I thought it covered
pretty well as far as the under-eye goes
because I've got some circles it's
talking about the bronzer BB CC products
I found the Maybelline Dream bronze bb-8
and one beauty balm sunkissed glow
Perfector and I got the shade light -
medium bronze so for this product there
actually was a color system so you
choose like what your natural skin tone
is and then you'll get the right level
of bronze I suppose but I did use this
over the weekend and there's a look at
the depth you can see it very quickly
sheers out so it's not a high coverage
product and so it makes you feel like
you can kind of get by with using
something all over your skin that's not
a total skin tone match but you look
nice and glowy it's just not much
coverage so that is my haul a lot of new
things that are coming out for summer
slash just some summery themed products
let me know what some of your favorites
are that you've been running across in
the stores lately and thank you so much
for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
