list ideas this month because I just
thought I want to do something different
with the shopping list ideas because I
mean I recently did the full favorites
tag and that included a lot of like a
lot of the makeup items i'm liking right
now so i thought how can we make
shopping list ideas different this time
around so brought in tyler for some
unisex shopping I Twitter yeah so these
are things that actually I what at first
my idea was I'll share my favorites and
Tyler can share his but then I thought
we actually have some overlap with our
favorites like some different like body
and skin care products and then we have
like even stuff you'd give the grocery
store so yes all kinds of stuff so if
you've got your son or your dad or your
brother or your uncle your uncle grandpa
boyfriend boyfriend great Grandpa's
fiance fiance anyone else would give
engine room postman UPS man plumber or a
contractor just invite them in to watch
this video with you I was skin care how
about that yes it will start with
skincare this is called the micro
delivery exfoliating wash and this was
something I got in my beauty test tube
from QVC and this is like basically a
face scrub it's it's that kind of effect
but it's different right right it's not
as gritty see me I guess yeah like Tyler
has not really liked a lot of the face
scrubs that I brought home that you
typically find because the pieces the
little granules are kind of big in some
of those and this is really interesting
because you it's it's just the tiniest
like smaller than sand you know just a
little bitty particles I guess yeah and
so you scrub those in and it's very
gentle I know everything in the
philosophy line is formulated for as if
you have sensitive skin so this has
really got in my face feeling clean but
it doesn't feel like it doesn't have
that tight feeling you know
it is crest 3d white toothpaste 3d white
toothpaste so as you can see we've got a
fresh box here let's open it up and show
the product but why do you like us to
face so does it taste I think it tastes
better than most whitening toothpaste
what do you sense that whitening
toothpastes are different it seems like
some of them are a little bit stronger
with the mint mm-hmm and this one is
enamel really don't currently use any
other teeth whitening products I mean
maybe a couple years ago I use white
strips and that's one of the most asked
questions I get on formspring is how do
you whiten your teeth and honestly two
times a day with this next item is clean
and clear Percy gel what do you use this
for Tyler spot treatment of acne any
blow just trying to get to focus in here
on the product but yeah if this is a ten
percent benzoyl peroxide medication it's
just a white cream and you don't like
put it all over your face baby Jesus
when if you feel one coming on that's
the best time because sometimes gonna
stop it before it even gets there I find
that this does make a big difference
like overnight like if you if you like
Tyler said if you notice it coming and
you put it on you wake up in the morning
and sometimes I mean it just has a way
of kind of drying it up so if you've got
a larger you knows it if you've just got
like little you know clogged pore areas
that you want need some help with you
know this is really good and it's you
know drugstore right yeah I'm gonna
cheap it as bit last forever less than
ten dollars series we have a degree
invisible stick as the deodorant I use
but I've been known to hijack that yes
it has been hijacked you've used it for
weeks at a time before I think I went a
full month using his urine cuz he gets
them in you get them in a big pet yeah I
get them from sams club in bulk get like
six of them I can't remember how much of
the cost but ends up being pretty cheap
yeah they're turned out to be like I had
ran out of my deodorant he was like hey
I you know I've got an extra one in my
big pack and so I started using it and I
like
didn't notice myself sweating at all
like I am a sweater you know I will
sweat and this you know was pretty good
about keeping it at bay now it does have
that little bit you know how something
smells a little bit you know kind of
like a guy has a dude's much it has a
little bit of a deuce you know but I
feel like I I guess it's my hope that I
like her to make you smell like if you
put it on your not going to smell like
your be over and I don't think yeah and
I wearing a baby for lotion and couple
minutes or something lotion and body
spray and all that to kind of drown it
out I i hope we also wanted to share
some things not necessarily you know
bath and body related but just some
things we like right now so our mornings
throughout the past month that we've
been using a lot and that includes our
curate coffee maker if you're not
familiar with that kind of coffee maker
it's the kind that makes one cup at a
time and use like little cups these
these are called k cups and you put
those in and it brews whatever flavor
you make exactly so and there have been
some new fall kinds that have come out
that we both have been enjoying quite a
bit so what what do you have here I've
got apple caramel pie that was caramel
apple pie exactly a penny on the Apple
but yeah so this is the example of that
little cup and the way the whole thing
works I mean I don't want to get into
the engineering of how it happens but
like a little thing pokes down through
and um it brews the copy it like comes
out the bottom you get a fresh brewed
cup if they taste the same every time
which is cool but yeah there's that time
and then that was probably my favorite
of all of them this is not only also
have pumpkin spice which I like but I
don't might have it all the time maybe
once a week or something like that I
love this and if you mix in you know a
little bit of milk with this or a little
bit of creamer and sweeten it up just a
bit it reminds me of the pumpkin spice
latte from Starbucks Red Baron pan pizza
you know we don't have an example about
don't ever right now but we ate it good
oh my gosh I think I tweeted about this
not too long ago
the best pizza you can make aa in your
home better than the library at least
around here it's better than the Chicago
it's got it I mean is it is a thick
crust pizza the bottom of it gets this
nice crispness to it but it's like you
bite through the Christmas to get that
kind of I don't want to say gooey but
really soft you know later leAndria
action and then you can get like supreme
or and I know they always have pepperoni
but we like the supreme i think is one
of our favorite kinds but it is just so
yummy and a couple pieces it's more
filling i guess the promenade adds good
40 who as a thin crust but you know you
get filled up on a couple pieces
definitely pretty cheap doing yeah
caramel apples sucker yay I love these I
talked about these actually in my full
loves tag video but this is what they
look like because I track some down at
the dollar store but these are green
apple suckers coated with caramel it's
like kind of a hard and caramel it's not
like goopy when you open it but they're
so good Tyler has a favorite to another
favorite dental product actually that
before we go that he needs to share its
these placards high performance dental
floss errs they're cheap though they're
like a dollar for a bag so these are I
mean whenever you walk by Tyler if he's
sitting watching TV if he's doing
something on his computer if he is
looking at his phone I mean I feel like
he is always taking but this is what I
see this is what I see is got that
little plaza delivered to the taste
delightful actually flossing reduces
your risk of heart disease applause
every day we have a couple of apps we
would like to share with you actually um
that we've been enjoying the past month
and they are whatever you doing with
your he's got something on his foot
what's going we're good okay ipad apps
or i guess iphone app sir whatever you
like I've been enjoying twitterrific
lots of fun very nice
visual display and sorry about the glare
but I mean it just you turn it sideways
and you get your sort of menu here where
you can look at replies and messages and
all kinds of things like that but it's
definitely a good twitter app and Tyler
discovered that one you can actually use
multiple accounts on it too if you've
got more than one oh you can't name you
have to the paper and it's like two
bucks a night okay I like it and our
other favorite is Shanghai bajan talk
about a time killer I mean if you've got
if you've got you know a road trip or
you've got something you're waiting on
and you're just like ahh I need to pass
time with something you know I feel like
this is so fun and it's of course you're
matching the tiles you know you're going
through a matching and this one's fun
and i have the i think i paid 99 cents
or something so i could have different
the different art on the tiles so like
if you're a fashion fan you can get your
whole thing in like vintage vogue covers
so it's like got all those vogue models
