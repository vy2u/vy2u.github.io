updated reorganized makeup collection as
you can see on the right before I didn't
have this I wasn't using this set of
shelves to store my makeup so that's
allowed me to have a little more space
on the top of my desk there to put my
makeup on and just gives me a lot more
room so we're going to start on this
section in the middle and we're going to
move to just to the left of my makeup
mirror is this little set of drawers
with some brushes and pencils up top and
these pressures are my eye shadow
brushes that I have here there's a mix
of Mary Kay elf Smashbox you name it
there's a lot of different eye shadow
brushes right there and then I also have
my lip pencils which a lot of brands
here as well I've got a Revlon
wet-and-wild you name it it's probably
in there too and then the first drawer
is just some random tools like some
eyebrows scissors or eyelash curlers
little applicators things like that the
second drawer is just some cheaper low
eyeshadows that just fit nicely in there
kind of small package things like my ELF
and just some various limited edition
items there and then moving down into
the last drawer so my high-end shadows
from Too Faced Smashbox makeup forever
there's also some hip stuff in there too
so just a place where I know I can find
that really really good fall in the
eyeshadow all in one place
moving back behind my makeup mirror this
area here is just some primers and
makeup removers things like that on top
of this little tray here I've got some
q-tips primers sponges things of that
nature just a place I can I know I can
grab all that if I need it and then on
the
um sitting on a desk down below it I've
got some moisturizers some toners eye
makeup remover pants blemish cream that
kind of thing so I just kind of keep it
all out of sight back behind my makeup
mirror there so we'll be over at the
right side of my makeup mirror is this
other little free tour thing
as you can see brushes on top and then
three drawers of face products over here
so on the top I have these are my bare
minerals brushes concealer brushes soft
focus brushes various kinds there and
then and the other thing is just that
mine on bare minerals brushes just some
big powder brushes and blush brushes
concealer brushes that kind of thing the
only other stuff sitting on here like
the kabuki brushes things you can't
really store anywhere else some hand
sanitizer eyedrops a little broken
eyeshadow thing there but in the first
drawer is cream face color products like
cream blushes cream bronzers
highlighters that kind of thing just a
nice area to find that all in one spot
and then the second drawer is reserved
for blushes and you can see there's some
Neutrogena Jane covergirl NYC not a
whole lot of high-end brands here sides
I do have some I have some Smashbox in
there but that is about it for my blush
and then down below I keep my bronzers
NYC wet and wild bonnie bell powder
bronze since they're just a few of the
kinds that I really like and also some
other kinds that I maybe don't use all
that often that I should but knowing
that it's all there in one place helps a
lot now down below my table I have a
bigger four drawer cart
top drawer is a various cream eye
products whether it's shadows mascaras
liners you know stuff of that
consistency basically in the back I've
got cream pencils and
those and stuff in little tubes things
that just really doesn't don't fit
anywhere else and then right next door
to that I've got my mascaras you see the
big lash blast tube there I've also got
some voluminous Neutrogena Maybelline
Smashbox just a lot of different
mascaras there and I really do use them
I try to rotate them every day and then
in the front I've got you can see at the
top there's some cup more colorful
liners and then Mike normal black liners
and cream liners and then in the very
front there are some cream shadows and
some liquid liners and so the second
drawer is a bunch of eyeshadows more in
palette form here you see there's just
one little tray of like say quads and
trios there in palettes and then right
next to that or some little bit larger
sized ones then in front are my singles
I gotten into a bunch of covergirl
singles at one point in time and use
them a lot down below that a drawer of
foundations concealers and powers excuse
me here's a bunch of foundation and
powders and cream to powder type things
right next to that is some concealers
got Maybelline there's some Max Factor
elf as well and then right in front of
that are a bunch of loose powders that I
use from NYC L'Oreal covergirl trublend
and then my very bottom drawer is just
kind of storage I store some extra
q-tips some extra packaging for when I
review things and stuff like that now
this is the big kind of bookcase looking
thing top shelf of that is a lot of lip
gloss but sitting on there in this
little tray on the top left is my
mineral makeup I've got stuff from
bareMinerals ELF Maybelline
Isadora L'Oreal I was really into trying
all this mineral stuff right now and
I've been pleased with a lot of it so
that's all in that little container and
then I've got in another little
container some pallets from like
two-faced and wet and wild
there's just some more that you know
don't really fit anywhere else
now top drawer of that free drawer thing
is my nude lip glosses lots of different
brands here I really like to highlight
some of those in a later video I just
don't have time now but right below that
is my bronze kind of lip glosses it
helps so much to color code your lip
gloss if you've got a lot of it and then
down below that is all my lipsticks
of those of that color family the nudes
the bronze brown tone kind of things
like that damn there's another little
three drawer thing on that shelf just
some random lip glosses some clear lip
gloss and then below that I have my
coral lip glosses again many different
brands many of them drugstore so I know
you're seeing this thing tons of lip
gloss well I don't pay a whole lot for
it

they fit nicely this is my pink lip
gloss family here stuff from Stila
Revlon Jordana pout L'Oreal and below

glossy stick kind of stuff also on this
shelf I've got my ELF stuff in its own
little container also stuff in pots and
jars and stuff like that below that it's
