updated skincare routine video I think
it's a kind of long overdue considering
how long ago I did my last one but I did
want to update you on some products that
have changed some have stayed the same
but as you know I do anchoring for TV
news on a daily basis so I really um you
know do wear some full coverage make up
quite often and I really want to make
sure that when i cleanse my skin it's
thoroughly clean and that it's just
really kept and kept healthy because you
can still have great skin even though
you wear makeup you just need to make
sure you're using the right products
when it comes to cleansing moisturizing
and all that so let's get right to it
I'm using several things from the be
luscious brand that have become over the
past few weeks part of my regular
routine and I really like them and it's
sort of a trio of items here and this
would be my morning skincare routine
when I get up I used this it's the line
is called vibrancy you can see that
there on the bottom and this is the
cleanser it's a gentle exfoliating
cleanser helps dissolve and dislodge
dull surface cells removing makeup and
impurities while moisturizing and
nourishing skin it has antioxidants
vitamins a c and e that help brighten
your skin and i love using that in the
morning because you know you're waking
up i personally get up at a very odd
hour in the middle of the night to do
with the morning newscast so i really
want something that when I smell it when
I put it on my face it's going to wake
me up and I really feel like this does
that and it does have some little
exfoliating beads in there that kind of
make you feel like um you're really
getting your face clean it has a really
strong orange ecent so if you don't like
citrus um I don't know if that sent may
be too much for you but I really love
what this does once I take my skin and I
dry it off I feel like oh my gosh it's
so soft you know it's it's ready for the
moisturizer or the makeup and whatever
so that's the vibrancy cleanser and I
will put more information in the sidebar
about these products of where you can
find them online Tyler also uses this
from time to time and he really likes it
tues really what maybe want to try this
particular line from the be luscious
stuff was because a long time ago maybe
some of you will remember this Revlon
had some vitamin C enriched skincare
products that would be available like
right under their makeup and I loved
them I had an eye cream a moisturizer
and I think a cleanser maybe and I love
them so much and then that all got
discontinued and I was like oh there's
really nothing much like that but with
this vitamin C stuff there is so um
that's the face wash and then they have
the vibrancy NIST and so this is like
kind of lever freshing miss that you can
spray on says after cleansing mist over
face and neck for optimum optimal
results follow with the cream which I
will get to in a moment but this is just
a when you think of you know citrus and
refreshing like this just feels so good
to just give yourself a spritz of that
you could also do it like midday I know
some people use like a setting miss to
kind of miss their makeup afterwards I
haven't quite tried it for this in that
method yet like a fix plus or something
like that because I'm not sure that's
what it's intended for but it's it's
very soothing and but yet energizing and
i really like um you know cuz i hadn't
had sort of one of these face mists in
my collection yet so i enjoy that and
then this is probably my favorite part
of the vibrancy collection it's the SPF
day lotion and so this is I'm use in the
morning smooth evenly over cleansed face
and neck so again it's got that great
scent it's not maybe quite as strong as
it is in the cleanser and it's so smooth
like I I really am cautious of using too
heavy a moisturizer before I put my
makeup on because I really don't want to
I have this image of thing sliding
around and I don't want that to happen
so I really want you know enough
moisture to moisturize and hydrate my
skin but it's a fine line for me
of what may be too much and this is just
great texture as I put a little bit on
my hand here I mean it's just it melts
right into your skin and there's
something about when you put this on I
mean I will wash my face and I'm sitting
there at you know one thirty in the
morning when I wake up before I do my
name is cats I'm sitting in front of a
mirror and I'm thinking oh my gosh I
have to get ready for work and you know
it's so early but I put this on and it
like read this it's a combination of the
scent which is like a mental thing when
you smell that you're like okay I'm
feeling a little bit revived here but
then you put this on your face and it
really helps bring about that glow to
your face before you even start your
makeup and I love that so that is again
these three items the day lotion the
cleanser and the vibrancy missed are all
part of the be luscious vibrancy it's
vir vibr a n dash C part of that
skincare line now for evenings um my
routine is a bit different because I do
have quite a bit of makeup to take off
and I find that it's very convenient to
use the ole a daily facials cleansing
cloths they now have this little pattern
on them and they're very exfoliating and
it's real easy for me to like hop in the
shower wash my face off with one of
those and then you just pitch it when
you're done so mine are I think for the
oily two combo skin i especially need
that when summertime rolls around so
those work really well for me although
sometimes i will go back and use the
vibrancy cleanser and just use like I
makeup remover to take my eye makeup off
because this will remove I mean your
face makeup your face will be clean
after you use this it also of course has
those exfoliating qualities which are
nice um then I use before I go to bed
I've lightly been noticing that my skin
has actually been a teeny bit on the dry
side at times just sporadic it could be
because our weather has been crazy here
and it got real warm and then it changed
and so I of course rushed out and
brought bought a beauty product because
of that night
the ponds dry skin cream it's just rich
hydrating skin cream but it's not too
thick really it's it's actually pretty
nice and that's what I'll use just very
lightly before i go to bed my skin has
remained clear since I put it on I
haven't had breakouts or clogged pores
or issues with that this is another
product i think i mentioned the past the
Clean &amp;amp; Clear Percy gel it's a benzoyl
10-percent benzoyl peroxide acne
medication so if i have any little spots
or is it's anywhere Tyler will also use
this to we'll just thought it on
wherever and it tends to dry it up
pretty well so I'll put that on and then
my eye cream oh I love this stuff I
recommended it in a shopping list video
it's another be luscious thing and I
tell you guys they have some fantastic
products and they are they use a lot of
natural ingredients and this is one of
those um very much natural ingredients
things it's the long T and carrot oil
eye cream from be luscious and the scent
is unmatched it is truly amazing it's
just a a white cream here it's it's rich
but it's not to the point where it feels
sticky or too much on your eye area I
put that on my eye area every night
before I go to bed and I just it's like
as part of my routine and I won't go
without using that now so again I wake
up I don't feel too greasy that's a big
thing for a man I want to wake up and
feel like uh what has been on my face
all night so I do watch that so those
are the main products there and then I
will periodically do a face mask and I
like the Queen Helen mint julep mask I
know the sense like a cult following for
some and other people say they hate it
and some people love it but I love the
scent of this stuff it's like a little
green um like clay mask i believe and it
helped asset's helps dry up acne pimples
rinse away blackheads helps shrink large
pores so a lot of us want that those
sorts of benefits so I do like using
that match my face feels I love how it
tightens up that smells really minty and
then you take it off in your face feels
so smooth
so anyway there is my skincare update
guys I hope you enjoyed it and please
let me know if you have any questions
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
