first velcro roller tutorial I think
velcro rollers are one of the best ways
to get volume in your hair
I have long straight fine hair and
there's nothing like velcro rollers and
hairspray to get your hair that volume
that you want first you're putting it
around a curling iron then you're
putting it right onto that roller and
you're letting it sit there you're
getting a lot of volume up at the top
but then I'm doing something different
down at the bottom so this look really
only involves six of these velcro
rollers on the top part for a smoother
look that has some volume and then more
curl at the bottom is what we're getting
by just using our curling iron here's
how to do it
using our this hot tools curling iron I
think this is about somewhere between an
inch and an inch and a half so it's kind
of a smaller curling iron then I'm
putting them around these larger rollers
you can buy these in packs of maybe four
or five at Sally Beauty Supply or even
walmart sells sets of them if you get a
big kid of them it usually will come
with multiple sizes go for like the
larger couple of sizes that are there
then I secure them in with some little
clips they look like this just little
flat clips I'm not sure what the actual
term for these is but you might have
them in like a silver clip as well like
two prongs on them and that's just going
to help to secure deep rollers down when
you put them on so first step that I
usually do on dry hair is I will apply a
little bit of like a heat protectant
mist and then I also will spritz my hair
with a little bit of hairspray I ran out
of my Tresemme tray too so I'm I'm using
this right now this is not your mother's
she's a tease volumizing hairspray but I
just put a little bit of something on
there because I think it helps my fine
really slick hair especially when it's
clean helps it cling to the rollers
I just kind of grab a small section that
kind of goes across the top of my
forehead but make sure it's not like a
whole lot wider than one of the rollers
is see about how much far I'm going back
not too much and then I take my curling
iron roll that down and just hold it for
a few seconds here and then I'm going to
put it on a big roller and you want to
get that hair on this roller when it is
hot way it's just gonna reinforce the
curl as the hot curl goes around
something that is round you know and
it's gonna curl it more so once you get
it there I take one of my little clips
I'm feeling that clip go against my
scalp and I'm clipping it right on top
of that roller and then I give it a
little spritz of hairspray
I feel like velcro rollers can handle a
lot more hairspray on them I don't like
to really like gunk up my hot roller
sets with a lot of it so if I'm really
looking for a lot of volume I use big
velcro rollers and I feel like that's
really the trick to getting the most
next roller I'm gonna kind of put my
fingers right here on either side of
that roller I just did so I get the same
width of hair and I'm just gonna pull a
little bit of that up directly behind
the roller we just did then I'm gonna
roll that up with my curling I try to
get them wrapped somewhat neatly around
the roller and make sure your hair is
not tangled before you put them on and
it'll help them slide out a lot easier
then I'm gonna grab a section of hair
right here on the side and I'm gonna do
this on each side symmetrically just the
same and I'm gonna roll up the hair and
the curling iron and then pop each side
on a roller
so now that we've got this kind of a
bullet going on we've got four rollers
and we're just gonna put two more in I'm
gonna put one right behind this one that
I did here and it's just gonna go in the
exact same way so again you're just
gonna curl and hold it I'm gonna pop one
in on this side and another on the other
side and then we'll be done with that
part
I know I'm using purple ones here and
there's really no rhyme or reason for
that if I had the aqua colored ones I
would put those in as well I just didn't
have the right numbers so don't stress
yourself out too much on size if it
looks like a large-size ruler like one
of these it'll work really well for this
and then just kind of spray over all
those what do we do with the rest of the
hair well I pull basically do handfuls
of hair this is what's left pull that
around front and we're gonna curl each
side away from our face with the curling
iron now you could go ahead and put this
hair around more rollers if you want to
but I find that if I just use the
curling iron I get you know smaller
curls and then I've got the volume but
still some wave on the top so it lasts
longer for me I almost feel like this
way without making these curls larger a
lot of people ask you know how can I
make my hair hold a curl and sometimes I
think you're using a curling iron that's
too large you want to maybe try using a
little bit smaller curling iron that's
going to give you a tighter curl and
then as those curls loosen throughout
the day that's all they will do they
will loosen but you probably won't
totally lose the curl so just like that
we're getting curls about like then I'm
curling away from my face because that's
just kind of the look I prefer I feel
like it just looks a little more natural
a little less precise you know when the
hair is just kind of flowing back away
from the face as if they have wind just
kind of blew it that way so I'm just
gonna keep on curling on each side
now there are mornings when I wake up
and I do this and by the time I'm done
curling these I might be short on time
so I just go ahead and take these out at
this point but if you can you know let
them sit in there as long as you can so
like if that means going and doing your
makeup and then coming back to these and
taking them out that would be great
the longer you can leave them in the
better I'm just going to go ahead and
let these stay in for about another ten
to fifteen minutes and then we'll take
them out and finish the look so now
after you've left sit as long as you can
you're just gonna take them out
and these larger rollers are giving you
a much larger curl as you can see it's
like a big wave as opposed to the curls
we had down here that are a little bit
smaller but the trick to kind of
blending through them now I'd love to
really get my hands in there and just
break up all the curls
of course you want to make sense of it a
little bit so at this point what I just
do is pull up some of the hair here at
the crown so like a section just kind of
going across the top of my head and just
spray it a little bit from behind and
then I tease that a bit and that is
going to give me even more volume here
by that I mean taking a small tooth comb
and just sticking it in the back of the
hair and pulling down repeatedly it's
gonna give you a little more lift and
then I do the same thing here on the
sides a little spritz of hairspray tease
that a bit as well and you can do the
same thing right over here then just
very lightly I'm just kind of going back
over and I'm kind of working my comb in
a back direction it's got this pick side
at the end that's great for just lifting
and boosting up different areas so I'm
really softly combing it coming it
through the ends and then giving it a
little bit of lift and just turning the
hair back if you got a lot of long hair
like me just turning the hair back you
can get it in that pattern you want a
bit kind of curving away from your face
you've got a little bit of bang like I
do you can see that's just kind of going
right with the hair you might want to
spray that a little so in the end I've
got hair up top that is nice and smooth
and volumize and then my hair at the
bottom has got a little more curl in
there and that's curl that's gonna last
and hang on from you longer throughout
the day because it is a little bit
tighter curl so again we're just using
some velcro rollers just popped in six
of those once you get in the habit of
doing this look that goes by very
quickly and then you just curl what's
left with your curling iron if you don't
like a side part and this look easily
lends itself to a center part as well
because all the rollers were going in
symmetrically we went straight back and
we have the same amount on each side so
you could definitely just split it and
to do a side part and you're good to go
there as well this is a really great
base look for a lot of different styles
just getting your hair this amount of
body at the top and curl at the bottom
can be great for you know some kind of
side swept look that you want to do
maybe it's a side ponytail maybe it's
just a high ponytail or
some sort of updo you're giving your
hair some texture and some curl that's
going to allow it to kind of work into
those Styles a little bit better so I
hope you like this look thank you so
much for watching let me know how it
goes if you decide to try it yourself
and have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
