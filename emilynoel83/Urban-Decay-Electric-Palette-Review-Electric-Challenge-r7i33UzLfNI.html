I know I do a lot of my reviews now over
on the beauty broadcast Express Channel
but today I have something kind of
additional to wrap up this past week and
it's talking about my whole electric
challenge and a full review on the Urban
Decay electric palette maybe you've been
keeping up with this challenge on my
Instagram blog Facebook wherever I can
post I've been posting but every day
this past week I've done a different
look with shades from this palette and
my friend David he's a makeup artist
I've talked about him a lot I think he's
just fantastic it heard on a beauty
broadcast live that I was debating
getting this and he's like don't get it
unless you're gonna like make a point to
use every shade in it like you know for
a continuous amount of time and I
thought that's a really good idea and he
challenged Cristen game to do this as
well because he's familiar with
Kristin's videos and her love of taupe
so we've been doing these electric
palette looks all week and I know many
of you have as well because just looking
at the electric challenge hashtag on
Instagram there's like well over a
hundred pictures on there now so I think
this is so cool and the whole idea was
use at least one shade a day but by the
end of the week you have to have used
all the different colors in the electric
palette in your look for every look on
my blog beauty broadcast net I did like
a step by step like took a picture at
every point in the eye makeup process so
you can follow this and if you want to
recreate the looks or just see how it
all came together definitely check that
out that you need me to point this out
but this palette is filled with bright
shades different finishes as well and
you've got shades like revolt that are
like a straight up sparkly color and
then there are some shimmery shades that
do come off kind of metallic on the lids
a few of those that I noticed really
showing up with a lot of shimmer are
shades like fringe this
he'll also jilted urban and freak down
here at the bottom these three all give
off kind of a metallic finish but then
there are other shades that you look
closely at and you can see some shimmer
but once you apply them on the eyes they
come off more matte and that would be
shades like gonzo and slow burn and
thrash down here they kind of come off
matte on the eyes giannis and savage are
probably like satin finish type colors
but again they look pretty matte on the
eyes as well something I've loved
discovering about this palette as I've
been using it is how some of these
colors while they look so distinctly you
know like purple or blue they can really
take on a life of their own on the eyes
when you start working them in with
other shades blending them on top of
something lighter mixing any two of
these together it's like they're kind of
complex and I really like that it's not
just you know a bunch of flat colors but
the shimmer that certain ones contain
actually give them a very interesting
effect on the eyes and a lot of times
when I review palettes I look at them
from the standpoint of you know how well
could you throw this in your travel bag
and take this and this would be all you
would need for your eye looks and this
is really not that kind of palette I
actually see the most value in this as
like an accent type of pieces already
have already got a lot of neutrals in
your collection and then this is the
thing you can throw in and create
different pairings even like other
metallic colors are really fun taking a
gold and pairing it with any of these
different shades is such a pretty you
know twist on this palette that the
palette alone doesn't give but you can
completely you know dig into your own
stuff and create so many different combo
with every day of this electric
challenge I kind of tried to take a
little different approach so day one you
know utilize a couple of really bright
colors in the palette the gonzo blue and
jilted it showed me just how beautifully
shades in this palette can overlap and
start to take on totally different looks
with some pictures that I have of this
look I feel like that berry color almost
looks like a neon light like reflecting
up onto the blue eyeshadow look like it
really takes on an interesting twist
then for day two I kind of took
inspiration for
the type of look I like to do but it's
more toned down typically I really like
peach and plum paired together and so
here's orange and a really really bold
purple put together and I just loved
seeing how this orange shade kind of
faded up and I put it on top of a
yellowish orange base actually and so as
this color faded up and wasn't on top of
the base it took on almost more of a
reddish orange look so I love that I
just really think those contrasting
shades are fun together and I love
purple on the lower lash line in a lot
of different circumstances so I really
did like it with that look as well so
after going with a couple of days that
were like all out bright all over the
lids on the third day I went with a
smoky look that incorporated some pops
of color so this is a great example of
how just using your basic neutrals and
pairing them with this palette can work
so well throughout the week I've been
bringing in like lighter highlight type
shades but here I also brought in just a
classic matte black and that was really
the root of this look and then at
different levels I added the pops so
your brightest level is like that neon
greenish yellow around the inner corner
and then that little Fleck of green on
the outside and then a very very subtle
blend of blue up on the top border of
the lid on day four I chose to go with a
softer look because I think the biggest
misconception about this palette when
you look at it is that everything you do
with it has to be full-on
bright shout it from the rooftop colors
all the time because it doesn't have to
be and with the addition of a metallic
gold shade on my lid I felt like it
totally softened up an entire look so I
used some of the teal color called
fringe on the outside I gave it a little
edge with a little different technique I
used the tape trick on the outer corner
to really get a hard edge on that shadow
and then blend it up above it with some
pink by the way that shade Savidge is
not messing around I thought it was
going to be a lot lighter than it was
but it really is
a bold pink kind so after day four I
actually had used every shade in this
palette so today it was just like okay I
can do whatever I want I guess so I
chose to work in a couple of shades that
I thought were maybe like kind of
background type colors earlier in the
week and I could really make them pop
today and urban is a fabulous shimmery
purple I love it when you put it on top
of like a lighter base which is what
I've done here you get such a pretty
lilac tone coming out of that I mean it
could be a very soft pastel look if you
really just wanted to use it lightly but
it can also be very intense I used it
more intense earlier in the week as a
straight up like liner type of color so
I love that purple and then I also used
chaos which is the really true royal
blue in this palette and I use that as
my lower eyeliner and then I blended
down beneath that with more of the
purple so kind of a dual on two colored
liner look on the lower lash line but as
you'll see in the step-by-step on my
blog what I pulled in to use alongside
this was actually the Urban Decay Naked
basics palette because you know I worked
in a little bit more of a neutral on the
inner part of the crease and these
shades are all great as highlights or
your lighter colors so again this is a
great accent type of palette I think it
does play nicely with a lot of different
shadows that you probably already own in
terms of what I really would recommend
having alongside this basic like matte
black and matte white creme shadows
whether you're using them from you know
little pots or from sticks I think those
are really useful because it can totally
mess with the way these shades come off
and you can lighten them up and deepen
them up with those kinds of bases and
also just you know basic highlight
shades basic neutral crease colors where
I ever bought this palette I remember
thinking things like would I ever use
that or what I really feel like I was
getting my money's worth out of this
palette but this week has taught me with
every passing look is that this palettes
a lot of fun and it's very very
versatile don't just take every shade in
here
face value I mean I can definitely tell
you what you see is what you get in a
sense because these colors swatch out
very true to color at the same time they
can do so much more with various
combinations of any of these or with
pairings with other neutral shadows and
several of these metallic shades like
fringe jilted urban I mean those are
probably some of the best textures I've
ever experienced from Urban Decay the
the shadows themselves are so intense
but you put your finger into them to
swatch them and they feel like
borderline creamy they're so Ricci this
is something where now even more than
when I started I look at these colors
and I think of them each as individuals
as opposed to something you have to use
all together all the time the brush I
definitely did get use out of as I went
throughout the week primarily this
little detailed side too that was really
great for small areas of liner or
getting around your inner corner people
have said well I've heard these shadows
stain I have not had any issue at the
end of the day getting these removed I
don't know if primers and bases effect
that kind of thing but my equate daily
face wash cloths that I dampen with
water and then they suds up take off all
my makeup including eye makeup I
experienced no change with these and I
gotta tell you guys this challenge this
was not anything sponsored by urban
decay or brought up by anybody outside
of you know like just talking to Kristen
and David and stuff it was purely you
know a fun makeup idea among friends and
I love that I love that this was not
something some kind of campaign that we
were paid to you know play into or do
something like that it was just purely
for the fun and love of makeup that we
did this and I had such a good time I
enjoyed this so much more than I even
thought
getting up starting each day and
thinking okay what am I going to do
today you know what shades am I going to
pull together and create a look with so
thanks to my pal David for kind of
bringing this up to begin with and for
Kristen doing this challenge too and
everybody who posted such great pictures
on
am of their electric palette look I
guess to wrap up my review on this
palette as someone who was basically not
even really planning to purchase this
because I didn't think I'd use it I
really turned to corner I think in terms
of seeing these shades is wearable and
seeing how they can work so nicely into
a lot of the things that I already have
so yeah I would recommend it thank you
guys for watching I appreciate your time
and your excitement in this challenge
with me and I'll see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
