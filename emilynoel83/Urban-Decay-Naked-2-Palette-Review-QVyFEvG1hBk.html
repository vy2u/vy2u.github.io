thoughts on the new Urban Decay Naked 2
palette today and I know that there's
know a lot of talk about this you're
going to be seeing a lot of reviews so
I'll make this quick basically to show
you the palette it is a new packaging
from the original which is more of like
a felt version kind of heavy duty which
I like that aspect and then you pop it
open you've got a big wide mirror here
there's the camera and then you've got
all these lovely shadows you also get a
brush double indent if these nice soft
bristles on it nice blending brush and a
smallish flat brush and then the whole
thing comes with a little gloss here and
this is the lip junkie gloss in naked
did you look at this palette you'll see
that there are three totally matte
shades you've got foxy which is going to
be your light creamy shade T's which
almost reminds me of like a really dusty
lilac type color and then blackout which
is a totally matte black the rest of the
shades are sort of a varying spectrum of
shimmers so you've got one that has
quite a bit of sparkle in it that's
chopper and also ydk is a little more of
a really highly highly frosty shade and
then the others can vary somewhere
between metallic and just kind of a
satiny finish about half baked which is
a great gold which you might remember
from The Naked palette that's the only
one that overlaps with the other naked
pen I got the Naked 2 palette there was
really no question in my mind of am I
going to like the quality of these
shades because I've tried you know the
other Naked palette and a couple other
Urban Decay palettes and I know that
these are great quality colors they're
all gonna be pigmented you know they're
all going to be pretty the question in
my mind becomes how well does this
function in a palette on its own if you
didn't have the other Naked palette you
know is this one lacking anything is
this a complete great palette and I
gotta say I've been using it all week
since I got it thing that instantly kind
of occurred to me was that you've got a
really wide range in this palette of
light to medium tone colors in other
words shades that you
probably wouldn't get like a great
contour out of they wouldn't give you a
lot of depth in your crease they
wouldn't give you a dark smoky cup until
we get too busted and black out it seems
everything although this shade right
here snakebite that can give you kind of
a medium tone crease color but in terms
of the darker tones you've really got to
hear and I gotta admit I don't reach for
a matte black all that often um you know
I'm gonna use it at times maybe to go
over some black liner or something like
that but as a shadow for daily use I
guess I'm gonna go for a shade that's
more like busted but I found myself day
after day this week going to busted this
kind of plummy brownish shade as my
crease color and really that was the
option snakebite kind of as well like I
said but it's not super dark so you've
got all these mid-tone shades it's kind
of like having a team and you've got a
bunch of great athletes but a lot of
those athletes play the same position
you know what I'm saying you need a
little more variation there so I still
like the palette because I think on an
individual basis I think you've got
gorgeous colors in the naked - I mean I
love chopper I love booty call I love
that it's like a lightly shimmery pearly
color without too much
I think snakebite is great I love ydk
talk about a rose gold type color that's
just beautiful so there are some
outstanding colors in this and that's
why I'm really glad I have it but at the
same time when it comes to putting
together a look I find that I'm always
going to the same color for my crease
and that is busted here now is where I
want to bring in sort of a little
comparison because when you look at the
naked one I guess we'll call it which
came with that double ended liner here
you can see you've got actually several
deep dark shades you've got in your kind
of black and slightly navy blue tones
you've got a plum you got a dark brown
so you've basically got three different
segments of smokey eye looks you could
come up with now it's called The Naked
palette it's not called the smokey
palette so I get that the purpose may
not be to get the deepest there it went
on the floor we'll see if it survived in
a second but you know the purpose isn't
necessarily to get the deepest darkest
smokey eye but
I like kind of a smoky look I like the
ability to get you know different looks
with darker colors and here you're
getting you know one to three different
sort of elements there and then some
lighter shades to play with as well then
in the naked 2 palette hey they're all
good I mean if you like lighter looks on
the eye and you also like more topes
kind of gray tones or cooler tones
shadows you might really like this if
you're like you know what I don't even
go for smoky eye shadow looks that much
I just go natural day after day and I
don't need much variation you will love
that you need it well do we really need
the eyeshadow palettes we have no but we
want them so that's sort of the thing
here but this Naked palette what I'm
seeing are more warm tones also more
dark colors here I'm getting more a wide
range of mid-tone colors but only a
couple things that are really kind of
deep and dark you like dark smoky looks
you might find there's a little less
versatility with the Naked 2 but at the
same time it has some individual
outstandingly beautiful colors in there
so if you're a neutral fan it might be
right up your alley so thanks so much
for watching guys have a great day
and I'll talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
