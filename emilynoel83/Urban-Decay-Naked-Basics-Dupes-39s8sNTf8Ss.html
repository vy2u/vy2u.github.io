naked basics palette and this is the
latest thing from Urban Decay it's a six
color neutral palette with mostly matte
color I instantly thought this is
something that could definitely be duped
you could definitely come up with
similar colors and more affordable
palettes or just other palettes you
might already own so I have been looking
through my collection and I've dug up
some individual do also I found these
colors within one entire palette and
then I've also grabbed some other
palettes that have mostly similar colors
to this describe these shades first so I
don't end up doing that over and over
again throughout the whole video
the first color Venus is kind of a
pearly white shade that's the most
shimmery color in this everything else
is a little more matte foxy is kind of a
buttery matte shade walk of shame is
about the same depth as foxy but just
with a more pinky tone to it make it to
just a really light brown faint is a
medium to dark brown depending on how
much you build that color up and then
crave is a matte black but I have
noticed looking up really really close
at it I can note just the finest amount
of shimmer it's really not apparent very
much in a swatch and it doesn't transfer
onto the eye very much but just so you
know I believe that's in there if my
eyes aren't fooling me so that is Naked
basics first off I'll just share the
drugstore shades that are dupes for each
of these colors and this is mainly for
people who maybe just one or two of
those shades appealed to you and you
were just wondering what you might be
able to pick up that was semi dupe for
Venus from the drugstore is milania's
pearl it has just that subtle amount of
shimmer and totally the same color tone
my dupe for foxy is in the NYX eyeshadow
trio it's the shade labeled nude it has
that same kind of buttery tone to it my
dupe for walk of shame is wet and wilds
Brule it's the same color tone same
texture just totally matte
I do before naked2 is back in that NYX
eyeshadow trio I just showed you and
it's actually the shade labeled dark
brown I wouldn't classify really this
shade as being dark brown so don't take
the title too literally I don't think
naked 2 is exactly a dark brown either
although naked 2 in the Urban Decay
palette comes off a little bit deeper
than it appears to be in the palette and
this shade looks a little darker but I
promise it is really really close to the
urban decay can I do for faint is this
Rimmel glam eyes single in dusk it's
just a great brown this one also has a
wonderful texture just like the one and
the Urban Decay palette has in fact this
one may have a little less fallout than
that one brave is your matte black color
in the urban decay palette and I have
found several options for you for that
from the drugstore one is the wet and
wild color icon single and Panther this
is a completely matte bland other one is
from Rimmel and it's the glam eyes
single in jet black this one's very
blendable and finally one of the richest
blacks probably in my whole collection
is this Milani single in pitch black so
rich so I mean it is just as black as
black can be you know a couple years ago
maybe more the Coastal Scents 88 warm
palette was getting a lot of buzz and
this is a palette I still come back to
and use every now and then but this
truly does have dupes for every shade of
The Naked basics palette so I will walk
you through those this shade right here
is Venus this color is foxy right below
that is walk of shame this brown right
here is Naked 2 right below that is your
dupe for faint and over here this matte
black is crave and here's a look at
those swatches
it's always great when you can find
those exact dupes like I've showed you
already but I feel like sometimes there
are certain palates that are just close
enough you know to get you that look
especially where these pretty common
neutral shades are concerned and I had a
few other palettes that I just thought
maybe I'll give these a mention and if
people already have these then they can
kind of see like alright well maybe I
don't need the naked basics or you can
just judge for yourself how close you
think they are but one is the NYX but
naked eyes I feel like in this palette
there are shades that are pretty close
and can give you the overall same tone
of the look that you get with naked
basics so I'll show you those this shade
right here is Venus this is a dupe for
foxy this is pretty close for walk of
shame maybe a little more pinky tone
this is naked too this Brown right down
here is pretty close to faint and this
is your black which is known as crave as
you can see the walk of shame shade on
the bottom a little more kinky maybe
just a little more bold than the one
right above but I think your deeper
shades in but naked eyes are some pretty
good option I also have Sigma's fair
palette and for every shade except
foxy I found a pretty close dupe in here
for Venus is this shimmery shade on the
end called approach
I really there wasn't anything close to
foxy and here the next lightest shade
though called elope is pretty dead-on
for walk of shame act is pretty similar
in color tone - naked - but it does
contain some shimmer so just be aware of
that hich is a good dupe for a faint and
control is your dupe for crave really
nicely textured shades in these Sigma
palettes it does remind me quite a bit
of the urban decay colors you can see
there with that naked - dupe it's been
kind of a hard one to find exact dupes
for the one I found here in this palette
does contain a little bit of sparkle but
other
that those who the color finally I
wanted to mention the Coastal Scents 28
neutral palette this also contains some
pretty similar shade this color right
down here is Venus the shade is foxy
above that shade with a little bit more
of a pinky tone that's walk of shame
over here naked too as you'll see in the
swatch this is a little bit warm for
that shown here your dupe for faint
right next to that is your dupe for
crave and as you can see in the swatches
most the colors are pretty clean on real
proud of that naked do dupe but there
just wasn't anything closer in that
palette so that was my closest shot at
the dupe but you definitely have some
options if you own this Coastal Scents
28 neutral palette that wraps up my dupe
ideas for the Urban Decay Naked basics
palette in a sense I was a little
surprised at how quickly I came up with
these dupes it took me pretty much a
solid hour to do it whereas with a lot
of my other dupe videos where do people
on blushes or different products here
and there I mean it can take me over the
course of days you know I just I work on
it for awhile I get frustrated one day I
come back to it another day but this was
really pretty simple and I think it just
shows how truly basic this palette is I
love the texture of Urban Decay colors
and it is convenient to have them all in
one kit like this but like you saw there
are some other kits where they also have
them and you might already own those
palettes and then if there's only
certain shades you want there are some
individuals that dupe them as well as to
tip if you're trying to find dupes for
yourself sometime don't always judge
just by how it looks you know in the
eyeshadow pan swatching really makes a
difference because there are certain
shades that come off deeper than they
appear or they come off less pigmented
or less saturated than they appear in
the container so that's why I always
swatch to find a jewel this was helpful
for you guys thank you so much for
watching let me know if you've got some
other palette you're just itching to
find dupes for and I will see what I can
do so see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
