Decay's smoked palette I mentioned that
this is a really versatile palette for
the eyes even though it has a lot of
dark colors it has some natural colors
in here too
and a lot of people asked how do I use
those shades so in this video I'll show
you how to get a really natural look
like this and also this look which is
much more dramatic it incorporates some
of the colors in this palette for a look
that is great for nighttime a night out
a special event whatever you want to do
and the transformation between the
natural look and this look is actually
really easy one just builds right off of
the other and the ability to get either
a dramatic or a natural look was the
reason why I chose to travel with this
palette when I went to Germany I could
really only fit one thing of this kind
and so this was what I chose to use to
give me a really wide range so we're
gonna start off with the natural look I
first primed my lids with some Urban
Decay primer potion you can use whatever
kind you want and then I used a fluffy
brush with the color free style this is
a matte kind of peachy color and I just
put it all over from the lid up to the
brow bone to kind of neutralize the
whole area then I took a smaller brush
and I went with kinky which is a matte
creamy shade and I used that just to
brighten up the inner corner then I took
a flat brush and I went with mushroom
this is one of the most versatile shades
in the palette you could just use do a
one shadow look with this all over the
lid if you wanted to but I just patted
it on the outer part of my lid with a
flat brush also kind of working it into
the crease just a little bit with that
same brush take a medium sized crease
brush with a little bit of mushroom on
it as well and just use it to blend back
and forth in the crease this is going to
give you a really buffed out look with a
shade that's a total medium tone it's
not too dark not too lie using a smudger
brush I took mushroom just under the
outer part of my lower lash line to give
me a little bit of soft definition next
I used the liner that came with this
palette it's a 24/7 glide on pencil in
perversion it's a really deep dark black
even for a natural look though this can
be nice to define your upper lash line
so I just went all the way across my
upper lash line next up just give your
lashes a quick curl
I used my lash control mascara this is
that mascara I talked about in my try
this not that video where you can
actually squeeze the tube and control
how much mascara you get on the wand
apply some of that to your upper lash
line and a little bit on your lower lash
line and that completes the eyes for
this natural part of the look I think
this is so wearable and so fast and easy
so it's just perfect for day to day on
the cheeks I went with kind of a peachy
pink glow I used my Malley effortless
airbrush blush and highlight here
there's a kind of a vivid peach color so
a little bit of that a little bit of the
highlight on the cheekbone looks really
nice and then for the lips I'm using my
Nivea kiss of volume this gloss actually
has just a little bit of a subtle pink
color but it mainly just kind of looks
like your lip tone but a little bit
shiny so I think that's great for the
natural look now for our dramatic look
we're gonna play with some of the colors
in this palette it's actually really
easy to get yourself sort of from point
A with the natural look to point B which
is this look so we're gonna start off by
taking a small eyeshadow brush with the
color black out and you're just gonna
pack a little bit of that onto the outer
part of your lid you can kind of work
your way blending inward a little bit
overlapping some of the lighter shades
that we're already on your lid also take
the smudger brush and smudge a little
bit of black out on the outer most part
of your lower lash line I'm going to use
a small crease brush this one's from
essence of beauty with the blue shade
called evidence this color is gorgeous I
love using this in the crease you take
this color a little bit closer to the
inner part of your eye in the crease
you're going to be able to see a little
bit more blue we're going to take rock
star with a sort of medium sized crease
brush just get a little bit of that
color on there and really lightly we're
gonna blend this over the border of the
blue that we used so it's going to be
kind of a fade from blue to just a
little
hint of purple I grabbed just a bear
fluffy brush to make sure I really got
that blended after that just taking my
smudger brush to that same beautiful
plum rock star shade and using a little
bit of that underneath the inner part of
my lower lash line
another way to add drama is not just
with shadow but with lashes so I'm using
my ardell demi wispies I have a full
tutorial on how to apply these if you
want to check that out feel free to add
some more mascara to your upper in your
lower lash line as well after you add
those false lashes then for a nice
little finishing touch with the liner
add some to your inner rim of your lower
lash line your waterline area so as you
can see it was a pretty easy
transformation actually between the
natural look and the dramatic look I
love this palette for that versatility
you can also do smoky Brown looks
because you've got a great matte Brown
and a shimmery Brown down here you've
got a greens kind of a teal green there
are a lot of directions you could go but
these are just a couple of ideas for
easy light and dark sides so this valley
made a couple of little changes for the
face
I added kind of a pinky blush to this I
used my covergirl cheekers blush and
plumbery blow for just a little added
puff there on the cheeks and then I
really really lightly used this lipstick
from Rimmel in dusty rose I thought this
is such this makes it such a fall look
to me giving it just a little bit deeper
lip with this dramatic eyes so I just
kind of dotted that on and then added a
little bit more of the Nivea kiss of
volume to the center of the lower lip
for some added shine there thank you
guys so much for watching these two in
what looks are so fun to make I'll be
sure to do some more of those in the
future thanks again have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
