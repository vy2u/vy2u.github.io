quick review on the brand-new Urban
Decay smoked palette it's always
exciting when urban decay comes out with
a new palette people love Naked 1 and
Naked 2 and those are great neutral
palettes this however is something
that's a little bit more dark and smoky
and the palette actually unzips it's a
really nice compact size and inside it
has 10 different colors plus a liner
colors were looking at range from really
light matte neutrals all the way to
matte black as well as several color I
ordered mine off of the urban decay
website it also comes with a mini primer
potions palette also comes with a full
booklet of looks I mean this is probably
one of the most comprehensive guides
that I've ever seen come with a talent
as you can see there are multiple ways
they demonstrate to use and then the
full step-by-step of how to do it in the
back here they take you through all
kinds of little descriptions maybe
you've heard or maybe been confused by
you know down blending brow highlight
working the crease like all these
different ideas and they even explain
brushes as well so it's really like a
nice little educational manual without
beating around the bush too much here
I've got to tell you that if somebody
asked me to create a smoky eye palette
it would probably look something like
this I mean this in my eyes is just the
kind of palette that I want to have
because I love smoky looks and I also
love the fact that it's not just
neutrals here I like that they said hey
we're going to give you like three
different great sort of jewel toned deep
jewel tone colors with that green the
blue and the purple to work into
everything another point about this that
I love is the fact that it's a total mix
of matte and shimmer you get two really
nice matte light colors up here the one
thing I would like to maybe see in
addition to what was here is maybe one
of these shades they make shimmery
because I do like to sometimes really
brighten up a deep dark smoky look
with kind of a shimmery light shade
around the inner corner so it'd be cool
if they made one of those shimmery but
in either way you get to matte colors
there you get mushroom which is a really
pretty kind of grayish taupe color to
matte colors here on the side which are
a black back door and blackout so a nice
deep dark matte Brown and matte black
and across the bottom these all kind of
have a shimmery to satiny finish nothing
is totally sparkly
there's no shade with glitter in a bar
lust which I love that color it's a
great Brown Rockstar is a nice deep plum
evidence a great blue loaded is sort of
a teal deep teal green and then asphalt
it's going to be your deep charcoal gray
color it also comes with a liner so you
do get some extras with the primer
potion and the liner and the booklet
this is the 24/7 glide-on eye pencil in
perversion and this is a super dark very
creamy I mean it's blackest black in a
pencil and it is very long wearing is
what I feel like I've always been
pleased with the quality of Urban Decay
eye shadows and if there was maybe any
complaint in application it would be
that some of those really glittery
shades do tend to have some fallout but
with these like I said nothing is
glittery and there may be some with more
of a shimmery or slightly metallic
finish a lot of people might say oh this
is a great palette for fall but I say
this is a great palette for absolutely
any time because they do give you enough
light and kind of mid-tone shades in
here to really make it work every look
you do with this smoky palette does not
have to be smoky in other words so
you've got a couple light shades this
mushroom shade right here and this one
if you put all those together I mean you
would have a totally natural neutral eye
look that's mostly net and then you look
down here you can work in these colors
there are so many shades that work well
as liners if you want to work in you
know the plum or the blue I think
they're all really pretty in a variety
of ways and I'm eager to do some looks
with this palette so let me know kind of
what direction you'd like to see me go
with that but to
I am actually wearing a mix of mushroom
the shade here and asphalt and barley'
so I took kind of the mid-tone charcoal
towfish Brown type shimmery colors to
get the look that I have now and I love
using that shade bar lust that that
pretty shimmery Brown looks great just
kind of emerging from the depth of the
real eye and kind of coming up onto the
brow bone just slightly and then I use
this sort of peachy shade called
freestyle as my highlight there but I
love this like I said the only thing I
might add is just a real you know highly
shimmery light color but beyond that I
think this is a super versatile palette
or as the zipper goes I think they
wanted to give it something a little
different I don't think that really
makes or breaks this palette in any way
I know this is really just kind of
coming off as a rave review but there
are some products out there that I feel
that way about and this was really a
no-brainer purchase for me I saw the
smoked palette and I thought I love
smokey eyes I love the way they put this
together and I'm going to really get a
lot of good out of this I'm honest I'm
probably going to use that even more
than The Naked palette simply because it
gives you some options in there more
than just straight-up neutrals you know
you do get some ways to switch it up a
little bit you really don't like smoky
looks and you don't like deep and dark I
don't think you're going to get as much
versatility out of that palette because
it is really rooted in those pretty dark
rich colors but I personally just want
that answers the questions that I've
been getting lately of do you think this
is worth getting do you like it I think
the quality of Urban Decay eye shadows
is superb the texture is beautiful and
rich and it goes on easily it blends
easily and there's not a dud shadow in
this palette so I think that's great
news as well so thank you guys so much
for watching hope you're having a great
day and I'll see you next
