I'm actually on my way from graduation
at Eastern Illinois University where my
sister-in-law stare and graduated today
and we've been doing a lot of graduation

law school on Thursday and so that's

but we had some very very severe storms
through mon and women when i was at
tyler store Thursday night thursday

power is not announced a lot of people
where we live so we're shooting this
video on timers blackberry and i'm going
to keep it short here but i just want to
let you know it may be a couple days
before as a video of we're all safe and
sound pero today the storm rolls through
when we were actually out of town but we
believe our apartment is also fine so
anyway to learn to give you guys that
little update i want anything you want
to say I know this hope I can get this
uploaded I don't know I've never done it
before anyway thanks nice nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
