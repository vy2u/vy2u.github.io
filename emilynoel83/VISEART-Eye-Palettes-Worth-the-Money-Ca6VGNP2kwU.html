doing my follow-up review on my visi art
eyeshadow palettes I know I mentioned
these in my haul of products from brands
I'd never tried before and at that point
in time as I mentioned in the video I
had really only scratched the surface of
these palettes in terms of application
these palettes are $80 each you can get
them on Sephora's website you can also
get them on beauty lish another one
that's probably been talked about the
most here on youtube and is probably one
of the most well known from the brand is
the matte neutral palette I chose not to
get that one just because at this price
I just felt like I've got so many matte
neutral shadows I went for things that
were slightly more unique however I'm
not ruling that out as a future purchase
before really digging into my review on
these palettes I want to show you
swatches first I do them on top of just
bare skin there's no primer used and in
order to pick up product evenly on my
finger I give it like one full swirl in
the powder and then one swipe on my skin
I think that's important to know how the
swatches were done because they do
appear to be so intense you might think
that aw did she just scrub into the
product and lay it on thick but I did
not and so when you see the swatches of
this sultry news pallet I think each
shade really holds its own packs a punch
is worthy of being in the palette you
know because it just is so intense to
feel these shapes they are so creamy
they really adhere to your skin and you
feel it when you stick your finger in
here but just in application it's kind
of hard to explain but as I apply one of
these shades across my eyelid I can just
kind of feel the cling not in a patchy
way but I can really feel it kind of
attached to the lid as opposed to being
something powdery that's just being
dusted across there are several shades
in here that do have some very very fine
sparkle and that would be the white
shade and the silver shade over here and
then these two shades up in this corner
the other shades in this palette range
from being rather metallic like this
shade and your coppery colors here this
gold down here can I find these deeper
shades like the brown the burgundy and
the charcoal to have more of a satin
finish which might surprise you because
I think they can come off rather
shimmery and
really full-on swatch but on the eyes
when you apply them with a brush the way
they transfer from the brush to the eye
are much more of a satin finish for
example I'm wearing a lot of this shade
on my eyes today and you might even
think that's matte you know just at a
glance because it's really not super
shiny at all personally I'm a huge fan
of these two rosy colors in here I love
that there's this really classic peachy
rose gold and then an interesting thing
they did with this gold color it's a
very yellow eight gold so I think you
can take your look in a very different
direction with that type of a shade I've
seen this described in a nutshell as
just being a satin finish i palette but
I do think there's more there but when
you're looking at the dark matte palette
I really think it is a palette that can
be summed up with one word it is matte
there is only one shade in here where
I've noticed a little bit of a
difference in the texture of it like
just to touch it it feels a little
different and I sense that it has just a
little bit of a satiny finish and that's
this color right here I'd love to hear
your feedback if you have this have you
also noticed anything different about
this shade I feel like it has a slightly
drier maybe a teeny bit gritty feel to
the touch not that it makes it any less
pigmented but in a swatch it does have a
little bit of a satin finish there are
some brilliant colors in here the kinds
of shades that you might not often see
included in eyeshadow palettes I'm
talking about you orange over here when
I look at this palette I think wow
that's super unique you know just the
the configuration of shades that have
been put in here I really don't have any
other palette that's like this but what
is so impressive about this um I don't
think I've ever seen a palette that is
so what you see is what you get as far
as these shades translating to their
swatches and looking just like the
palette and I love that I really loved
the thought that if I'm going to put $80
into an eyeshadow palette I'm going to
be able to pull off these exact shades
but what's interesting too is that when
you shear them out you start to get
different looks it's kind of like you
know a really nice deep berry lipstick
it can look one way completely piled on
and then you apply it a little more
sheer and you notice different things
happening with
that and I can definitely see that with
these colors as well for me personally I
find myself getting a lot more use and
just being a whole lot more interested
in the top two rows of this palette I
just find those shades more wearable
more my style
I'm loving the BRIC Reds lately the
Browns are super user friendly and of
course who doesn't love some great like
plummy wine shades and then down here I
do love my greens and I need to remember
how great blues can look on brown eyes
but I'm just not drawn to those as much
that's just a personal preference thing
overall I feel like I've got two amazing
quality eyeshadow palettes absolutely
some of the best that I own in a
nutshell the biggest reason why is that
you can achieve what you see here and
more you know you can share things out
and get different looks you can layer
things and get different looks but these
shadows are capable of being so
saturated and so intense and I'm not
doing this video to do like a comparison
of each of these because they're really
like apples and oranges I mean this is a
completely matte palette this has so
much shine and metallic stuff going on
and going into my purchases I honestly
thought this would be the star and I
thought this would be the thing that is
a little more average I thought I'd find
it to be very similar to a lot of other
things that I had however this is the
one that I've actually found to be the
most versatile I've been the most like
wowed by these finishes I mean just the
textures the feel the way these blend
one on top of the next it's so easy with
this palette and I was watching a
professional makeup artist on YouTube
mentioning this palette and he was
talking about just how versatile this
was and how he would use it on a vast
variety of Ages and I love that and I
can totally see that happening because
some of these shades while they look
incredibly shiny in a swatch and some
are downright metallic shades don't get
me wrong
others definitely have that satin finish
that almost looks matte in application
on the eyes and I know these palettes
aren't necessarily designed to be like
your all-in-one this is all you need
tight palette I mean clearly with this
you don't have conventional highlight
shades in this palette the thought is
that a makeup artist is going to use a
bunch of these different palettes
together or pull in some other palettes
that they have I get that but from a
slightly more
tickle value-oriented perspective I can
do a lot more with this palette I love
having this brown the charcoal and the
warmer kind of rusty brown burgundy in
here those three really allow this whole
palette to go in several different
directions they're absolutely not too
shiny to be your crease colors and they
can definitely anchor some of these
super shiny or even sparkly shades
really really well and when I use these
shadows I feel them I see them all
swatched out I am like geeking out you
know from a makeup lovers perspective
they have done shimmers so well some
shades that might just seem like a
run-of-the-mill sort of filler shadow in
a lot of palettes let's say this color
right here you look at it from this
palette it's like that is the most
beautiful like muted gold you know they
just pull it off so well I'm not wanting
to take anything away from this palette
because again it's gorgeous
the shades are like next level saturated
colors but it's the kind of thing I see
myself pulling into my looks just
occasionally you know just to pull out
that really pretty pumpkin color or just
to work in these pretty brick reds here
and there in combination with another
palette with this one you absolutely can
pluck those certain shades from it that
will be your just pop on the lid and use
them alongside anything else I find
myself being surprisingly content with
using just this palette for an entire
look and loving the way it turns out and
I noticed a wide variety of comments in
the video where I hold these some people
said you know there's absolutely no way
under the Sun I would pay $80 for an
eyeshadow palette and then some of you
were referencing like the amount in
grams of each shadow and if you compare
that to other high-end shadows you're
actually getting a good deal with these
some people are also critical of the
fact that they're just you know a clear
window and there's no real razzmatazz
with the packaging or no mirror on it
but I think these were created more with
makeup artists in mind and just being
compact being small not being over
packaged and the clear window can
actually be a very handy thing if you're
just wanting to find a shadow at a
glance I'm not going to sit here and say
everybody needs $80 eyeshadow palettes
because I don't think they're an
absolute need to be
as I've gotten fabulous looks with
really inexpensive products and I can be
happy with that does my absolute makeup
obsessed self really appreciate what
these pallets are and yes I can admit it
I am obsessed with makeup I get
absolutely giddy when I see you know
these shades all swatched out yes I do I
think this is the kind of thing that
hardcore makeup enthusiasts even people
who have tons of eye shadows in their
collection really think you'll try these
and you will feel like that uptick in
quality it's just there it's undeniable
and while I can achieve similar looks
with other things it may take more
building up it may take more blending
just a little more effort all around
these can very simply achieve exactly
the colors you see here in their
palettes now I did use this palette for
my look today if you'd like to stick
around and watch that I took a flat
brush and I use the charcoal shade all
over my lid and I did use a primer here
because I always do on my eyes I got
that all over the lid
I also wedged it up into the crease and
I'd used more of a fluffy crease brush
just to blend that out a little bit then
I used the third shade over on the top
row just to give myself a little bit of
a highlight and then I chose to use this
really soft blush color with my e36
brush and just take it gently over that
dark border then I went into the silver
which has a lot of star power to it but
I just used a small brush and pull that
in just a little bit on the inner third
of the eye and around the inner corner
and then to brighten the inner corner
even more I use the white and that's
what really makes the inner corners pop
then on the lower lashline I used a
smudge brush and connected up to that
outer V again with the charcoal color
and just kind of blend it inward I also
used a pencil brush over that to blend
it out even more and I finished the look
with an off-white liner on the lower
inner rim and mascara again I think
these are two outstanding quality
palettes I think the question for a lot
of people would simply be are they worth
the money and I do think you're getting
a lot of bang for your buck in each of
these I really can't imagine using
either of these up very quickly and as
people have noted you know you are
getting a lot of product in here for
that amount if you were to go comparing
it to other high-end singles you could
buy that being said
I find the sultry music to be the most
bang for my buck the best value this is
great at matte shades but this is even
better at shimmers if that makes sense
if creamy smooth velvety textures and
eyeshadows absolutely make you go gaga
like that's your thing maybe even a
little more than bold color is this is
going to wow you so that's my review on
these I hope this was useful and I hope
we can generate kind of a discussion in
the comments section from those of you
who have tried these or any other busy
art palate give your feedback and we can
kind of help one another out and help
those who are considering possibly
buying a pallet from this line thanks
again so much and I'll see you guys
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
