I'm gonna start doing some occasional
vlogs I'm not sure how this is gonna go
I have a brand new camera that I'm
playing with for this and then like the
little screen flips up above the camera
so this is all throwing me for a loop
can I show you guys something here in my
bathroom though
this neat little Stanton why do the
walls look so yellow on my camera
they're like a soft like kind of gold
any color but they're not that yellow
okay what if ound this at Ross and this
was in the with the kitchen stuff you
know I have all that random kitchen
stuff but they had this stand that you
would use for like fruit or something
I've got one of these in my kitchen and
it's double layer like this but it's
round and I loved it but I thought I
need a little something for my stuff
here in the bathroom so I've got like
skincare stuff like several different
brands that I'm playing around with
right now I've got my Josie Maran the
ordinary some julep some qatari and then
I've got sort of random larger things
here and toothpaste and deodorant and
some stuff of Tyler's over here but it
works really well in it fits kind of
nicely between the two mirrors that we
have and yeah I'm just happy with it
kind of contains the clutter Nikki how
do you feel about all this
she's still sniffing out the new camera
she's not sure it's cupcake we call her
Baker
Becky Baker cat no but yeah it is Monday
my eye look is super colorful because
I'm doing a full week of like bold eyes
basically so there's that mom and dad
are over here and they are playing with
the girls upstairs while I get a little
bit of editing done this morning so it's
been wonderful having them closer
because there's just there's more hands
to go around obviously and it's kind of
a win-win because you know there's Baker
getting in on my shot they get to enjoy
a lot of grandkid time I have a little
bit of work time but yet I'm still very
much you know in the mix of everything
that's going on
baby apparently these are the foods
she's feeding baby pizza fries ice cream
and cheese
okay guys
pay no attention to the messy kitchen
behind me here I was just testing my
live capabilities for Instagram because
I'm doing an Instagram live tonight's
Tuesday morning now well bits over here
having her breakfast at me and totally
chica are gonna do a like simultaneous
live I didn't even know this could be
done until recently but we're gonna do
it I was like testing my setup and how I
was gonna stand my phone up yes baby and
um just seeing how that was all gonna
work and Baker's like skittering around
she's making me nervous to feel like
she's about to like throw up a hairball
or something I think I got it I got it
down my phone's gonna be stacked on top
of like a box and four pallets and a
little I got a little clip stand thing
and this really seems like a lot like
vlogging and liveing I just told Twitter
it's bring your own watermelon Rita's or
any Rita and bonus points if your name
is Rita also this is my food journal
this is Tuesday 3 13 18 this is what I
am about to have I've been having these
a lot I hope any of y'all who were food
police out there say this is okay it's
fairly low in sugar and high in protein
but yeah food journals real impressive
when the only thing it says at the
moment is protein shake right but this
is also where I'm starting to put my 1 2
3 gratitude points at the end because I
do ultimately like writing them better
than storing them up electronically and
so I just thought hey when I start my
thing for the day I won't forget to put
my three gratitude points
good morning got one kid definitely with
cold one kid questionable perhaps
starting something so last night's live
with tikka went really well that was so
fun I mean we did have like the
technical difficulties you couldn't hear
me at first and we worked through that
and yeah I would definitely do something
like that again
it really just lit my fire don't want to
do more live stuff in general because
it's just so easy these days like the
amount of things that have changed since
I did Beauty broadcast live over on the
vlog Channel you know you can do
periscope you can do Instagram you can
do Facebook lives you can do YouTube
lives I think a lot easier than they
used to be so yeah very happy about that
I feel like I've kind of been failing in
terms of just taking the camera with me
for every little task that I do
throughout the day I'm just not used to
this you know I'm not used to narrating
and showing everything and I know if I
do a week's worth of vlogging I don't
really need to show everything but yeah
it's just been like a lot of normal just
everyday around the house with a couple
kids kind of life here plus YouTube and
all that but if you're watching this
thank you for watching thank you for
bearing with me as I realize you know
what it's going to take to vlog every
day
oh mama do you need a queen x2 honey
good morning
so love I talked about you in my Q&amp;amp;A
video today I said you liked your job
and that marks a good guy you ever had a
good mentor I'm very good mental and I
don't have any idea how to edit video
for you you don't have ambitions I have
had tons of requests bub to bring back
today Friday yeah I was thinking if I do
these vlogs occasionally like maybe if
you ever come up with something that
you'd like to review it could be like a
no-pressure like you don't have to come
up with something all the time but you
could talk about it in a vlog yeah just
randomly you know like very naturally
you know very organic if you will I love
just the continual squirming that's been
happening here constant constant squirm
maybe watching that new legal drama
that's on ABC in the future how do you
feel about idols come back great so far
yeah I've been loving it too I'm excited
for is it gonna be Sunday and Monday the
whole time okay um do I have any other
questions for you at this time anything
I need your insights on what's the next
thing you're gonna do in the SU V or
sube style I don't know if I'm phrasing
trying to and don't you want to do wings
and we're gonna air for him right sube
air fryer the air fryer you're probably
gonna hear a lot about that on my vlog
eventually so enjoy
okay nice talking to you above good chat
oh that get there
I really organized the fridge pretty
well a little while ago and there's just
over there it's a little it's starting
to look a little more cluttered but I
had that thing so nicely cleaned out and
I will mention up here these freshly
meals love these this is like I've been
asked if we're still doing plated and
I'm still like on plated like we have a
plated account so to speak but I've been
skipping it a lot because we're just low
on time it's hard to keep up with these
two and so the freshly meals are like
fresh ingredients good stuff but all you
have to do is microwave it for like
three minutes and many of them have been
good would have been your favourites are
very tasty and not hashtag not sponsored
all right I like the pork carnitas a lot
I like the Southwest veggie bowls I add
just a little sour cream to him that's
the secret I haven't even told bub that
secret until now
yes the spaghetti squash and meatballs
is really good yes and I think there was
a really you know there is a shrimp
scampi that was that was good as well
did you like the meatloaf where was that
and it was awesome
most of we're really really good the
breakfast was kind of strange Susan yeah
the texture of the eggs was questionable
okay here's a taste of like what I drink
in the morning I'm good I'm having the
protein shakes by nighttime I'm a grab
for a watermelon Rita maybe we're gonna
shut it we're gonna shut her in there
see ya
have a good evening yeah yeah you make a
good point there that's why you don't
want to stand in it hey wait a good put
and put these guys down here listy take
something throw them up oh sure oops
phones are ringing ringing ringing
alright listing I'm doing good I am
vlogging I got my pro playing with my
vlog camera in that view I got a bitch
tomorrow okay he says he's in how many
daiquiris did you have binky
can you say Baker hi sweetie are you
doing some oil bird watching you're
going out on a date tonight we're going
to pinch pennies bub we hang out there a
lot yeah especially probably in Tyler's
law school days slash my earliest days
at channel 3 March Madness
is in full-swing of course so there
probably some games coming on TV there
but were you keeping a pretty close eye
on things while you were working really
hard today yeah okay so Wichita State I
think we both had them winning item
winning just that year that was a pretty
big deal for Marshall I guess but you
guys really care about is how my hair is
so beautifully curled right now and
that's because of my t3 hot rollers that
are like my becoming like my right arm
shiny it's got some wave gentle wave hey
everybody it is Saturday morning I am
sick I'm sick with the bug that got
Belle and Eve the last few days I think
Tyler's got a little bit of it too but I
just posted my video which has been a
whole week long project with a bright
eye palette I'm calling it fifth
impressions because I hate first
impressions no I don't hate first
impressions but those videos just here's
what I don't like when a first
impression is sort of delivered as if
it's like this full super educated or if
you you know when you know a person just
got something and it's a way to just
bust out content really quick so with
fifth impressions it's kinda like okay
I'm gonna take this big old pallet that
you couldn't possibly really know what
you think of it just after one try
really because it's got so many
different shades so many directions
so I'm gonna give you five looks in one
video Quick Looks I'm really happy with
the way it turned out
I honestly surprised myself with how
much I liked the way certain looks
turned out but check out the video let
me know which one ended up being your
favorite my nose is gonna like run in an
unsightly way right now so I'm gonna go
deal with that I put on the shirt from
yesterday because I only wore that shirt
for like a couple hours but let's face
it I have also moring shirts
back-to-back days that have weren't been
worn full days so real life here this is
what happens when you vlog you find out
things well I don't feel bad bubs
wearing the same shirt he wore last
night too
he's going through our brackets now we
had a real situation last night what
with Virginia getting taken down by UMBC
which if you followed the UMBC Athletics
Twitter account you'll get the whole
scoop on that respect respect it was
crazy to watch that game if any of you
were watching it was like I kept
thinking Virginia is gonna come back you
know they're gonna do something that
gets it close but it just they never
even really turned it into a super
exciting matchup did you think that like
the boy is a blowout button has Kansas
near him I did have Virginia wedding at
all so bub still got some hope here
Weight Watchers
what are you playing with today yeah
little people's ooh it's awesome because
it has like all the letters here it
tells you the animal noises or it tells
you like a alligator or whatever it is
yeah she's wearing your outfit isn't she
today with the ladies we're talking
about the importance of a firm handshake
nice to meet you
oh yes and what can you do to be extra
sweet and kind oh yes oh yes yes hey
it's great to see you thanks for being
here at mommy's restaurant today
yes Oh Belle is it oh good to meet you
Bob what up firm firm handshake ladies
how many spouses out there have this
conversation
I don't know what do you want to eat
tonight I don't know what do you want to
eat tonight back and forth like that
let's go take a look at Bub's
home-improvement project here well looks
fantastic so far yes sir this little
girl right here that's nice - think this
is her scratching post a couple of times
yeah and so she has gauged out some big
areas you can see what it's more white
couches um so I clean that up a notch
and placed some spackle in there
babbling okay the only spackle I'm
really familiar with this little
irregular speckled primer mm-hmm for the
face so did you get some on the floor
and but that's not on the floor
so far this project is only amounted to
one low strip above's last time
improvement project actually required
roughly no more than 300 strips it's
technically accurate
oh hey but that light bulb up there
actually can you reach it from where you
stood even but it's too short for some
things I'll drink the water here we
don't have any more what whoops oh okay
back to lows see don't you RA yeah I
thought this might be a good place to
unbox my monthly Sephora play box here
so it's the what's your festival Beauty
vibe this is what the little cage that
comes with it says and this is what the
bag looks like so this is exactly how it
comes out of the box I've moved over
here so I can show you better it's a
little bag they come in bags like this
pretty much every time and we'll see
what I got I got this Mirage Oh
nourishing cleansing cream and deep
treatment and butter
okay just little pouches there this is a
Sephora crayon contour eye pencil pretty
kind of taupey brown shade that's cool
this is a little spray bottle here at
blossom and bloom ginseng and biotin
volumizing spray love little sized hair
products especially you know when you're
just kind of familiarizing yourself a
little bit great to just have the small
size there's another Sephora brand
product it says Rouge veloute cream lip
stain I've tried one or two of these in
the past and they wear really nicely
this isn't the shade bohemian purple as
you can see they're kind of a Mabi
color very pretty yeah okay this is
taking me back to like the earlier years
in my channel I got a Lancome Hypnose
drama mascara sample I remember really
getting into this mascara like years ago
and then finally has anyone tried this
from dr. jart
it's the baby
beauty balm multi-action skincare plus
makeup SPF 45 they sent it in the shade
light/medium and if you're not familiar
you know that's kind of crouch down here
if you're not familiar with the Sephora
play thing like you actually do a survey
and you tell them what your skin type is
skin concerns skin tone any information
about your hair and stuff like that I
think you can also say like what you're
absolutely not interested in but on the
other side of that little paper there is
the specific description and how to use
all of the things that came in your own
Sephora play box so just because I got
these things in mind you might watch
somebody else's unboxing and they get
something else because they have
different skin or different preferences
so there's that everybody alright here's
the after
it just looks wonderful you'd never have
known of the cat was scratching on that
at any point in time
great job bub thank you he's cleaning up
before any comments on this experience
it was easier than I thought would be
they'd have to make one extra trip - oh
just because he was feeling guilty about
multiple trips to Lowe's so he thought
it probably sounded better to mix it up
no no the the paint that we had gone bad
yeah it's had been so long so do you go
get some fresh paint but I like it and
while we were at it we touched up a few
other spots yeah
what's next you're having a taco hey
taco Tay what are you having my dear she
just finished up some strawberries and
cheese you ate a bunch of my rice and
beans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
