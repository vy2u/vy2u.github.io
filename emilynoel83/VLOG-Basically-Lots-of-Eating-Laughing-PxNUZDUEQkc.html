what's going dead and consumed by its
work Nikki Biddy and everyone so she's
never heard well we were having a fun
family game and then somebody I'm not
gonna name any names but somebody may
have thrown a pillow or neck pillow from
the balcony we believe it hit that hangy
thing which flipped it over part of the
fixture and turned off the light this is
our activity now Jeff's trying o twist
in it likes getting around whoa wait did
it go on this is really just a party
game that I designed
it wasn't until you got the flashlight
out rides that you realize that it was
that has the chain flip are you tickling
Biddy so it's Saturday
I meant to vlog a little more yesterday
when pop and Jennifer we're here I
blogged a little bit but there is some
time spent in the pool for bub got home
and snacking cheese boards etc but Jess
it's Saturday everybody out there
the pink blooms oh I couldn't wait
another day to give Bob his Father's Day
stuff yeah so I got it early so if we
did three gifts one for me one from
nookie and one from Biddy and we hid
them because hide-and-seek is all the
rage in our house right now
what did you get Bob what's your home um
some awesome replica replica it smells
like a man it's called at the barbers
really good yeah I'd like even more as
it settled in yeah sexy man scent what
else did you get them I got a face
moisturizer but he'd always been one
thing yeah it was Jack Black and it had
SPF 20 just cuz I know you're not
wearing SPF everyday
so all right and I got some coffee here
it's holding called the game or anything
there when you first put them in your
mouth Hank there's a little sweet
coating on these they look like those
boobs they were if he two of them it's
like I don't know if eat the whole pack
it's like two cups of coffee first
sometimes bubs in a hurry in the
mornings all right
doable I mean it's the thought that
counts
to maintain ideal comfort and feel in
your gloves it's not intended to revive
already dried out gloves can you show me
what it is
what did bub just okay it's kind of like
a humidor any golfer will tell you that
after you go out and golf on a real hot
day your your glove is going to be
soaked with perspiration uh-huh so you
put your glove wherever you usually put
it and the next time you get to go
golfing and pull out your golf club
you'll find its crinkly crispy mm-hmm
and it takes a long while for the glove
to come back into playable conditions
oh I'm picturing this it does have a
nice smell in there put your glove in
there
notice it's about the size of your hand
conveniently yep did you get that yeah
got it close it shut store it in an area
where it is above sixty five degrees and
we can come back you're gonna find that
your gloves in perfect condition perfect
playing conditioning so it keeps just
the right amount of I guess moisture in
the glove happy Father's Day really good
hey baby
alright as we like to show you in vlogs
there's some meat prep happening what
was the kind of meat you invite me pick
up okay so we got a couple of those and
my idea for this meal was to make sort
of a nacho slash taco bar with that meat
as sort of the centerpiece the apple
cider vinegar that's the cousin another
story for another day but we've got the
fixin's and that'll be lunch it's a
little coloring happening here
[Laughter]
yeah slightly alarmed experiment we
watch a lot of little huge videos don't
wait Instagram yes enjoying
Jeff doing at nacho style over there as
well it takes the right kind of chip to
support this amount of stuff so I tried
to get one that I thought wasn't too
thin yeah but they're not - right right
just enough delicious enjoying you have
a few tacos over there and how did you
say you handled the sauce on there when
your sous Viet you get a bunch of juices
in the bag mm-hmm just put that in a pan
with a sweet baby Ray's Chipotle
barbecue sauce and cooked it down
pudding then after I pulled the pork I
put that on top so it's the texture of
that like pretty thin nice yeah really
taste good I just used my little nacho
tray here and I crunched up my chips a
little and then I put the meat and every
every option brought taffy movie into
the bank it was the least they could do
they just described a really good
cheesecake to us but they brought the
taffy and there is a twizzler flavor in
here but what did you think of that if
weird in my brain because it tasted like
that it was so good is the texture I
want in a twizzler and they captured the
taste and just the essence of a twizzler
that the rubberiness
yeah like you lose the lose the plastic
packaging that comes with a nacho to
twizzler they have to gnaw through the
buttered popcorn was really good no and
then
butter than popcorn I had a huckleberry
it was it was fine that's fine there's
nothing wrong with it but I'm from
Hannibal you have to have uncle Barry
Finn yeah and then wasn't there one
other kind of special buttered popcorn
is an edgy flavored butter rosemary oh
yes we're talking about the butter drum
lifesaver flavor I was saying that you
like it it's lifesaver flavor because
it's got cheese in it it's got rum and
just seems to think it's like a clear
person yeah pennywhistle's in the butter
what about wild cherry that is why it's
wild every candy that has wild cherry
other than life saver is edgier than
lifesaver
you know dressed up as a Steve Buscemi
doing the Hello Kitty's might I ask how
you got on this topic we were talking
about flavors that were in those old
books of lifesavers that you would get
at Christmastime the ways of I love
[Laughter]
basic welcher is extra extra butter rum
is given to you by a guy who's in Tweed
from the soles of his feet to the top of
his head a bit yeah Street socks a tweed
hat a tweet scarf
he's been involving himself wait
[Laughter]
and my Turbie twist because I've been
out swimming this morning for sure
showered myself ah Laureen yes and then
just swooped right into meal preparation
and I think it was a real success
I feel like everybody really liked I
didn't hear mom say much it was about it
yeah with my why it's for you and Tyler
to sharing meat always gets the most
credit in anything sure but what about
the sides and the concept that's what a
chef does the chef comes up with the
concept the cook you have to source
ingredients you have ice cream all right
thank you
quick synopsis of why we're doing this
cuz I can get a lot of this before but
dad
is an expert serve ice cream we were
thinking about what some of dads main
skills and life might be on this
Father's Day well it could be carpentry
or figuring things out turned out my
main skill as I know how to get lots of
ice cream in a small container at a
Casey's gas it's kind of a specific it's
it's a small thing to know but when you
are getting ice cream in cases it's one
of the most important things you can
know about mom brought these brownies
and so we thought let's have dad prove
his skills by getting some ice cream and
getting it home okay see that I'm
familiar with was right across the
street right my house we're going to the
nearest Casey's so dad can demonstrate
hopefully his skill level with the ice
cream
right now
so I guess this isn't really a fair
or another way the Senators you I ran
them dry would you have gone fuller on
that vanilla yeah but I guess you
noticed it ran out
I also got some edible cookie Mickey
here's the thing
there's two ways of looking at this we
get to the Casey's and I start filling
the cup and I run them dry vanilla they
run out so I figure we'll go chocolate
guess what I run them dry on chocolate
so okay how about twist I run them dry
on twist
all right I'm dry on three all the three
flavors they got they got more no more
left
I still have capacity I think in the cup
Casey's failed my minoz get the joys
walking up paid for and say you're out
of all three flavors is a heavy ice
cream there you go but you could have
gone even fuller on it if it would have
allowed on the way to one of southern
Illinois fabulous wineries I'm in the
back back of the van cuz we're gonna try
to fit more people in this seat with me
backseat gang
oh wait can't meet Jeff there's Jeff
how's the ride been so far it's been
luxurious in clothes that we roll in the
Odyssey
you're back home from the winery it was
a good time we ended up going inside I
can't remember if I shot any video in
there so Bob did you like it yeah I
really did star view yeah we've never
been to starve you before in this hat by
the way
I got this hat recommendation from Aaron
Williams and it's great for being able
to wear your hair up but still wear a
hat also it can be rolled up really
easily just for travel purposes and then
it just velcros see boom hi I'm Nikki
can you say swimming pool
as evening time on this Father's Day and
I am a ghost
no I'm just really washed out there in
the moment you may have seen some really
fun pool clips where everybody was
joyful what you didn't see was what went
down in the bathroom afterwards upon the
removal of the swimsuit a certain
someone just lost it just total
three-year-old losing it tantrum and you
know what like we could carry on this
vlog as though that didn't happen but I
do want to be real with you I mean those
are not moments where I'm ever gonna
whip the camera out during because quite
frankly we're just trying to survive but
this is real life people like this this
is what you will have with a couple of
young kids a lot of what you see on
Instagram especially hung days like
today you know you're seeing the
highlight reel from people and it's nice
it's wonderful I mean I have seen so
many beautiful they've been playing
baseball all day over there
but I just want you to know that you're
gonna have moments of chaos and it's
completely normal and it's just part of
part of life it's the ups and the downs
anyway we came off of a pretty like full
day just having people here and a lot of
activity and we went out to the pool and
tiredest past dinner time like I know it
was kind of a perfect storm for
something to go down why are we in the
car now you might wonder it's it's not
to take anybody to the emergency room
it's not to get anybody it's urgent
counseling or anything like that we just
want food for ourselves now and we want
a little peace if we're honest we're
having a little mandate
hashtag mandate finest drive-through we
can find which is I thought it might be
good to go somewhere that offers ice
cream or shakes I'm saying wanting to do
this for a while now I feel like next
week though because I think we're gonna
need to devote a lot of time in the vlog
for that and I feel like just mentally
editing what I've already gotten video
was I feel like we're too deep and to be
clear not just a dollar
I want the $2 and the $3 part
and then it's just all hunky-dory again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
