I got this dude waking up in Destin
place we're staying the condo here it's
amazing that's the Gulf Coast right out
there we can walk just across the street
to the beach got a great school here we
just got in last night and once we got
in just kind of getting our stuff
unpacked went to the grocery store and
picked some things but right now
bub is on a fishing boat with dad
captain Nick and then
the decade was dealing new good-guy
gradually these guys were just busting
their butts the whole time they took it
as a personal failure if your hook
wasn't faded within like two seconds of
you pulling your line out of water and
hustling around captain's trying really
hard to get you in a good spots you
catch a lot of fish and you did
we have probably an hour left like they
we can keep doing this or we can go try
to get you something you know some big
red snapper something like that yeah
let's go do that
thought to which we got pictures up to
pretty good looking red snappers we were
using white bait the last one we had
last cigar you know something that was
just pulling like crazy and was just
running out line and all that stuff we
said it must be the shark not a whale
like five minute line ended up praying
often about sharks new hospice they were
trying to do something and I ended up
passing the rod off to one to the
deckhands Kenny ended up saying no it's
the best he's fished a lot that's
definitely a shark there was no question
many a zombie ends with a rod says good
luck to you I mean my muscles were like
I was using all my strength this is all
true there's there's none of this has
been extended or stretched as in a fish
story yeah this is actually true I was
afraid that he was going to get so stove
up after playing this monster and that
he wouldn't be able to go golfing the
next day
the word pompano Joe's right now for the
second time in shining evening than four
hours
we just went for a little walk and we
ended up here right here
we're in long sleeves cuz it gets a
little cool in the evenings in Florida
even don't judge us my shoulders are
still sticking out so having a big edge
I asked for a peach dream I got an
island peach so I think they just look
at you here and they say what she really
need said peach what I want to make I
just want to show you what's happening
inside this room
it's amazing we gonna make
but it's frying the fish that he and egg
caught on the boat just yesterday and
what kind of vermilion snapper and a
little bit of white snack
this fish is so good no no yeah he can
not only catch the fish it can cook the
fish

fivesome I was taking it very long time

last shot it went just a little bit past
the green probably what a 30-foot putt
forty forty five feet might have been
seventy rained it for a birdie
these are mystery I've heard very good
things they're kind of go from Zanotti
