till 6:00 in the morning and I am going
to be doing a little like day in the
life type vlog I thought it might be fun
to do one that way I've been doing a
bunch of weekly vlogs which I do really
enjoy but I was noticing some people
here on YouTube like just track an
entire day and I think it's kind of fun
to see so this is really how it starts
I've got my coffee the first thing I do
outside getting coffee is just going to
the bathroom and feeding my cat and then
right after that I come up here I'm
gonna be shooting an eye tutorial today
using the Phoenix Rising palette I had
promised that I had something coming
with that and a lot of y'all were
interested in it I think I'm gonna
really keep it and I look today get all
my face stuff done and just hone in on
what I'm doing on the eyes and maybe
like cheek and lip as well I finished
shooting my tutorial I'm really happy
with how it turned out so keep your eyes
out for the video where you get the full
how-to on this I am also loving this
glossy nude lips so fun this is what I'm
about to clean up this is kind of the
aftermath of the general tutorial here
this wasn't even a full face look though
this was just you know and I look and
here's what we're left with
good morning baby anyone else a member
of the club that doesn't necessarily
always get the clean clothes put away so
it's time to find a new outfit you come
and find it in the laundry room
what's up for you today I have got
pretty much an office day which I need
badly yesterday you were all over the
place
yeah and then tomorrow I've gotta go up
to Mattoon any afternoon Mattoon in the
afternoon just makes me realize I'm not
sure what time we'll be back with regard
to gymnastics
are you eatin eatin okay so a little
breakfast chat here well I eat my
hard-boiled egg
I haven't some tailbone pain lately
truly embarrassed to tell you the reason
why well one part of the reason was when
I was pregnant with Belle I fell down
our stairs just on my butt like a few
stairs and it's really never been
perfect sense but was it last week
I was on like the upper little part of
the stairs before you get to the landing
there's like five stairs and Nana had
bail at the little table in the front
room area of the bar room lately we've
really been into pillow fights around
here and like tossing animals off the
balcony and trying to like hit yeah and
anyway I saw a bail table and I thought
I could head a straight shot and I had
this animal in my hand so I go to throw
it and right as I'm about to throw it I
slip and fall on my butt like really
hard on one step and then I continue you
know insult to injury down a couple more
and at the time like right as it
happened it hurt but then I felt pretty
quickly recovered from it and now this
week I'm feeling I think so much
soreness from that happening not happy
about it good mommy crazy here's my half
gallon of water that I'm drinking every
day
oh yeah that's Grover yep
can you tell me what happened last night
when you went to bed I still fake it did
daddy close the door and who was inside
your room he was closing me and bacon in
my leg what was she doing at the door
crash your hat what did I come do a
Wendigo alright afraid yeah cuz Becky
wanted out she needed to get to things
like her food dish her litter box good
story my color are you coloring an owl
What did he say
coat these are the swimsuits were
returning they were Nicky's um 3t
swimsuits and that one looked you know
good on her but the bottoms were
actually a little big and you know once
they get wet it's just gonna get bigger
but that Moana 1/2 was a bit large so
we're gonna have to exchange for some 2t
sizes her 3t like one piece fit really
well but these are a little large and I
have my receipt so we should have no
problem now mission was accomplished at
Walmart got the suits exchanged for son
little fit and since they were so good
you need to go to the playground where
you going doodle
oh you going on a little breach
yeah I did
see a squirrel gotta love a good
wildlife sighting well lunch time for
the little ladies MIDI had a 15 month
checkup yesterday and it went really
well
she's about 50th percentile on height
and weight so kind of right in the
middle she was really quite happy to be
there until they gave her the shots she
cried briefly but kind of got over that
I'm pretty quick so she had her little
Grover there so it was all good can you
clean off your tray cleaning her tray
was the playground super wet that we
went to you or is kind of muddy if you
go back when it dries out we've had a
couple rainy days but I guess I just
didn't think they were that rainy right
and now they'll stay occupied for at
least a little while while mommy gets
lunch or well mommy does the dishes I do
love using the dishwasher but when it's
just like a few of their little lunch
and dinner plates it's just easier for
me to get them done in the sink real
quick
don't you love planning the cheese off
the pizza cutter Chrissy
yeah Chrissy Teigan had tweeted about
Totino's or as Tyler's former college
roommate Seth called them tortillas but
anyway she was like whatever happened to
those and then she follows up like Oh
silly me they're now being packaged in
little like square bags and then later
on she shows one she's like topped it
with fresh tomato or done something with
it I'm like oh man one of those sounds
really good until the next time I went
for grocery I did get a couple of those
and had one last night that's what
Twitter does to me in a weak moment okay
that's how long that whole story was how
long it took me to get this clean though
do you see the red cardinal in the tree
I see em male cardinal yep people say
that when a red cardinal comes around
it means like a lost loved one and is
with you in that moment who's your
favorite Disney Princess no tonight
dance Friday
do I need to wear a dress too or can I
just be casual excellent I'll be there
what kinds of songs will be danced to
the more colors the better is what I say
one time when I was in first grade I
think they said it wanted everybody to
color a duck and a lot of the Ducks
turned out yellow but my duck had like
probably 12 different colors on it and
they told me I was wrong for doing it
that way said this is the way my duck
wants to be funny the moments that stick
out to you from your to my childhood
school days I also remember
winning a coloring contest though later
on I redeemed myself with a lovely
black-capped chickadee because there was
a bird of the week or something and I
won for the Black capped chickadee I
sleep Oh baby sleep no no I do not
recommend so everyone is still down
napping right now both Bell and Eve nap
at the same time they go down around
1:00 and usually stay till 3:00 or so
you've been napping actually a little
longer these days but I took that
opportunity to finish editing my video
with Jen on the day I'm shooting this
vlog from this perspective they'll be
going up tomorrow so I got some
finishing touches put on that and I
pretty much just need to proof watch it
and then I'll be done
I feel so tired I feel like I could take
a nap right now honestly I'm gonna need
a little boost a little pick-me-up
something to get me through this
afternoon I feel like when I go into
editing a little bit tired I always end
ed ax ting really tight and just cuz you
know looking at the screen can take a
lot out of it but anyway that's what's
happening now I also have myself a
little snack I get those on the Sargento
snacks that have the cheese and then
like nuts and maybe some dried fruit or
something in there and I'll split one of
those so I have like just under a
hundred calorie snack and I can have it
a couple times a day
that's animal crackers and some
freeze-dried pear not sponsored by
Sargento but those are those containers
I reuse them for snack things for the
kids
every baby I didn't get oh I love your
hoes those are great
so it's now like 5:30 ish and my battery
had to charge for a couple hours there
story of my life somewhere a battery
always has to be charged but what have
we been doing the rest of the afternoon
we did a bunch of puzzles Bell found
like a couple of older puzzles that
she'd totally forgotten about and so we
had some fun with that and we colored
because coloring has just taken over our
lives lately because Betty loves it so
much and now bub is not home yet but I
went ahead and had my part of the dinner
maybe I made this maybe it was Bertolli
maybe a little tortellini with some
vodka sauce and bacon
pretty delicious but this is what she
does she gets out here to the table and
says eye color eye color here's your
book she's obsessed with the hello
winter book for whatever reason starting
to look a little gloomy outside we did
definitely have some Sun for part of the
day this is another fun toy that I think
Belle got around Christmastime when she
was like 1 there these cookies that grow
onto the pan Melissa and Doug of course
and then also the I get it the frosting
and stuff comes off too so they can feel
like they're decorating the cookies sort
of can I drop a little mom life tidbit
on you right here I have had the pricey
wife warmers and whatnot for wipe
storage but this thing by far is the
easiest to just get one wipe out of you
know when you go in for it you don't
need five you just want one at a time
this is the thing just get a pampers
container this is the sensitive one I
use the pampers sensitive wipes so I
just have this you can like buy some
initially in this and then just get
refills see there's the wipes inside
nothing fancy I swear it's the best way
to deal with the wipes
aurelion goofy boyfriend and girlfriend
Oh excellent I wish them all the best Oh
Biddy brought the table she thought you
needed a table at the wedding
hey bub what's up I am home I made you a
delicious dinner I heard stories about
this hi Bob welcome home hello it's nice
to be home you have something to show
and tell everybody back what's the deal
with this one it's an iPad pro nice
little smart Keyboard how do you like it
I like it so far
I'm just getting set up and the reason I
got it is I've kind of just been running
all over the place a lot of meetings
depositions things and I find myself a
lot downtime where you know I might have
something
45 minutes away and then I don't go back
to the office before I go to my next
thing but I've got 20 30 minutes to kill
or more right and you a to be pretty to
be able to work because when I'm out of
the office so much it's hard to get it
all done and so that's why I did this
and the real driver of it was I've got a
laptop but I don't necessarily care for
it not the greatest and here the plan is
that I'm gonna be able to basically fire
this up unlock it and get down to
business so I can knock something
Mountain 20 to 30 minutes that might not
be able to do all right
um we're doing pork strips zebra print
boards dress baby whoa you saw these in
my hall sadly I couldn't find them
anymore on oldest oops website when I
went to link to them but I felt a poor
strip was definitely in order for me my
skin is just been kind of funky lately
and bub how about your skin
you got any skin concerns are you just
doing this for moral support
just general maintenance and moral
support I'm good bubs drinking a lovely
key lime Roy like them I'd say that's
the best flavor - it's the most
flavorful I feel like less aggressive
but we're gonna leave these pork strips
on for a bit we will maybe not get too
specific with the details of what was
extracted from our pores but we'll let
you know if it was a success or not that
was one of the best pore strip
experiences I think I have ever had more
stuff happened from that than ever
before for me he didn't wash his face
what did you fall yeah I did get the
mail today
that was when Nikki decided to run
through the grass with her socks on
she's helping I'm like don't
and the Jews all said that she okay okay
you can see it but can you just show it
to her
can you show it to her cuz she was
really enjoying that that would be
really nice if you would let her borrow
it for a minute and then and then she'll
give it back and then she'll give it
back okay thank you thank you for being
a big girl about it

University of Kentucky cheerleader

want to go yeah I want to go mission
accomplished
