morning I have been up working on a
video already and now videos up having
her breakfast what else is going on he
just cleaned the litter boxes cupcake is
now pooping in her litter box again I do
not think it pertained to the anal gland
issue I think yep we just we're just
rolling right now this morning you knew
this was a vlog coming in okay so just
stay with me
got some unscented litter from Petco
before we were using something that we
thought was gonna be like super
unoffensive and gentle you know it's
like a natural litter from Target I
think was where it came from she would
always be in the litter box
she's just starting to poop outside the
litter box so got heard this unscented
litter from Petco I can't remember the
exact brand off the top of my head I'll
insert it but ever since she has been
going nothing but going in the litter
box for everything so I think it was
just a weird little quirky cat litter
preference thing how else was she
supposed to tell me I don't know but
that problem solved what else is going
on here all the trees have leaves on
them it's like they all decided up and
do that while we left hopefully getting
our pool open before the end of the week
that's gonna be awesome mr. David's
gonna I was safe refer to him as mr.
David around Belle but our good friend
mr. David should be out at some point
within the week I didn't get logging
done yesterday just because it was
Monday and I felt overwhelmed playing
catch-up and now I guess I've just
gotten used to the overwhelm because my
suitcases are still not unpacked this is
my super sultry Kim Kardashian inspired
smokey eye after I was seeing pictures
of her last night at the Met Gala her
makeup was flawless I mentioned this in
the video I shot I was like so inspired
I had to go cool and smokey today I
think they said her look was 90s
supermodel inspired and it was it was
fantastic I must say what's your deal
today Betty are you just riding high
after all those compliments about you
and your swimsuit yep no keep lying by
this morning just grape some pancakes
huh
get it sis hey can you say heart where's
your heart huh through 3d I know what
you did can you say carrot all
you got new words every day y'all new
words every day aw well yeah what else
what else
I think man and hopper coming over today
so that means mommy may have a little
bit of uninterrupted editing time later
today okay so as you've probably seen
Nikki likes to do what she calls flying
high that's where I throw her very high
in the air and then catch her after I'd
done that a few times mommy said no
mommy you're too big and so mommy said
oh yeah there are two things geez why
are we so different there are two things
in this house that we do not do we did
not spill queso and we do not tell mom
tell mommy
then she cannot fly so what are you not
doing this house and then what's rule
number two okay don't meet us you can't
you frightened okay who else totally
enjoyed Aaron Williams YouTube mom's
Vegas vacation yeah I need to get on one
of those at some point and speaking of a
vacation I still need to unpack the
girls suitcases last year I put both of
their stuff in this for Destin and we
spread it out a little bit this time
although I put some other stuff in
Belle's suitcase my old suitcase but
there's like so much stuff in here that
they did not wear like here's what would
happen over the course of the day you
know they're in their PJs at night so
that each had like probably a couple
pairs of PJ's that they went through
over the course of the week I brought
like a few little like just kind of
casual dresses for each of them for the
week and that was what they wanted to
wear that's what they'll always wanted
to wear whenever we went out somewhere
if we went to dinner she wanted to have
a dress on so
she's just that way like if you guys see
her in my vlogs and she's wearing a
princess dress that's not like mommy
saying hey you need to put on a princess
dress that's that's all her
unfortunately we didn't have to pack any
princess dresses for this trip but she
just wanted to wear a little dress
whenever we left the premises and
whenever we were home we were like in
swimsuit stuff you know we were at the
beach we were at the pool so the
swimwear definitely got used the little
dresses for going out somewhere but then
like when we would get back from the
pool I would just put them back in their
little nightgown things you've still
like usually sleeps in a full-on sleeper
at nighttime but I bought these cute
little like matching frozen nightgowns
for them and it was the perfect thing to
just like throw on them after bath time
or just you know running around the
condo getting dried off so I use the
heck out of nightgowns the swimwear and
then like some little dresses just for
going out to eat and that was about it
I'm noticing as I get stuff out here I
just have so many little clean outfits
that I planned out and I was like oh
this sure it'll be cute with this like
hardly any of that got worn also off
topic here but is anybody else super
excited for Carrie Underwood to be the
mentor next week on American Idol you
got to watch Sunday Mother's Day it's
gonna be so much fun to watch I hope
they sing Carrie Underwood songs but I'm
not sure if that's what it's gonna be by
the way I have gotten some requests for
a cry pretty tutorial I haven't watched
the whole music video but I know that
her whole look like the look she had at
the last awards show where she performed
him she has these glitter tears and
they're really beautiful personally I'm
not sure that I'm so interested in that
as I am maybe like shooting a message to
her makeup artist on Instagram and
asking what is the coverage of product
or what exact product are you using that
gives her such flawless looking coverage
on her face because there's got to be
some evidence probably I know her injury
was around her mouth area but there's
got to be at least some level of
scarring after that after all the
stitches and I'm just really curious
what kinds of makeup is getting used to
where it seems so undetectable to those
of us who see her on TV and pictures and
stuff by the way today I am wearing my
covergirl super sizer mascara I mean the
length on these lashes is just
ridiculous I love that stuff
you bid honey girl hey girl you're gonna
have to feed your baby oh you're giving
your baby
then you're doing
what's up everybody it is Saturday
morning around 7 a.m. folk lamb because
I was trying out all kinds of different
makeup today I have the Kristin
Dominique Lotte palette on my eyes and I
was pretty blown away by the textures in
that palette I thought just nudged a box
there might be jump this on my lips this
is a cream stain I believe it's called
from makeup geek very bold very summery
but yeah I've missed somedays blogging
here Thursday in particular was sort of
a whirlwind day I had that appointment
that I was in this very laundry room
telling you about before they've gotten
cancelled when I showed up and so that
was rescheduled that was fine
I got boxes to get rid of also recycle
recycle boxes and I should have been
vlogging but I did that bub and I went
to lunch and then we picked out a new
table and it's coming to date they said
it's 7 o'clock they're gonna be here
they're gonna put in the dang hot to
have a 7 o'clock on Saturday morning
like I am so freaking excited here's the
deal we have a wonderful really cool
pool in our backyard here we love the
pool the pool has been amazing you know
we've had to buy a new part here
therefore whatever but cool it's great
but there has always been ever since we
moved in this hot tub that has not
really been working like we'd had it
worked on I want to say three different
times it looks like with the previous
owner she maybe tried to put some sort
of I don't know exterior on it like some
kind of custom exterior wood looking
thing that I don't think really looks
that good on the outside and on the
inside is a legit really nice looking
hot tub but it's just never been very
functional so we went and we picked out
a new one and I feel like a hot tub just
belongs on that space you know and I am
so excited this is kinda like my
Mother's Day present here this is the
most mom Mother's Day present ever so I
was trying to just really get a lot of
things down Thursday Friday cuz I know
I'm gonna want to spend a lot of time
with this hot tub happy Mother's Day to
me the new hot tub is here and we've got
a little power washing and stuff to do
there on the cement around it I think
there's also a wasp that wants to like
live in there something more come get me
our pool is still not opened up I'm
hoping maybe early next week but I am so
pumped to get in this hot tub it's got
music it's got lights it's got fun
little fountains of water I am so
excited and I just need some groceries
need a little bit of everything I really
do love shopping for food at all these I
feel like the produce is always more
fresh fresher the prices are fantastic I
just get through the store faster thing
that ends up driving me to go to like a
Walmart or a target for so many things
is just the fact that I'll need like two
random things that I can't get it all
day you know for convenience sake grab
everything at Walmart I really do love
Aldi and they're getting better stuff
all the time and more just I don't know
more variety all the time I would say
for example here are a few things I love
getting there the sweet potato chips the
guacamole yes get the guacamole
let me turn down the radio a little bit
here let me turn down the Garf the
chicken salads are really good there but
I'm trying to take my healthy eating a
little bit next level just I'm really
trying to simplify I'm trying to cut out
more carbs you know it's the season
we're grilling I think is easier by the
time Tyler gets home it's not like dark
out anymore so it makes a little more
sense for him to go out and just you
know grill some meat or you can sue be
stuff always which is nice also we are
like oh there's some topless men fishing
we are out of diapers legit out of
diapers except for what I have in my
purse like my little to backup diapies
the hey keep in there maybe three I
don't know there's something I would
normally buy at Walmart but I think just
to get us through until I like really
need to go to Walmart for more things
I'm just gonna grab the Aldi diapers
because honestly they're fine but yeah I
cannot wait to get my hot tub on we're
also I think going to probably end up
making a trip to Lowe's at some point
later just to kind of start sprucing up
our outdoor area we really get into that
once the pool opens up and we're a
little maybe behind on pool opening just
with our vacation we took and then we
did the schedule to get open until after
we got back blah blah blah but try to
get new like hanging baskets each year
I've got a few planters that are just
like kind of nasty and need to be
replaced that sort of were here when we
moved in and their time has come to an
end so I think a Lowe's trip is in order
just to get everything all feeling nice
and fresh out there in the outdoor area
but the seasons have been so weird here
it's like we were in winter a really
long time and now it's just hot it just
got really hot where was the mild spring
I don't know mission accomplished it all
D got all the stuff I needed a few fun
other things that I wasn't even
expecting to get even found Bub's
Lacroix and the Burger King because we
just we just need something for today
anybody else do that you get your
groceries and then you're like but I'm
not really gonna cook any of that right
now
I'm gonna need that whopper jr. yes
please I know I'm not the only one I see
you out there
so typically bug is unboxing makeup and
stuff here but today we need bub for
other purposes such as
bub unbag my all day stuff and that
hates all the groceries here's what we
got this is a gigantic bag of tortilla
chips hey now it's party size as soon as
the window stops the chips also stop but
there's a well third of the bag there's
a wallet yeah puffery go I just I needed
some chips and I didn't want to buy the
really really salty round ones okay

lot of things Debbie's strawberries yeah

thanks for your participation as always
there's some boxes on the front step 2
if you want to just keep this keep it
rolling but once it's Wofford yeah let's
let the man everybody I'm hanging out in
the brand-new hot tub I'm loving it so
much I feel like I'm just learning about
all the different little dials and what
they control and everything but it is
amazing it's really starting to warm up
it's not at full warmth because it was
just installed this morning so he said
it'd probably be like close to evening
by the time the hotness of everything
would get where you want it to be but
it's you know a summary type day here so
I'm not really that concerned about the
temp at this point actually but it's
this is so much fun like I could
literally stay in here all day long that
is not an exaggeration that
true statement so we are going to dinner
yeah sort of a split as always it's
gonna grab a little bite to eat and then
we're gonna go to Lowe's and get some
some flowers and such things just
because we just got a new hot tub nope
not that dope new hot tub and we're
gonna probably want to dress it up soon
yeah sure mom we haven't ventured into
the backyard very often but it's now
that we've got the hot tub in their pool
gets open we may not go back into the
house you know we're going to a place
called Essen B's burgers which i think
is like a mini cheese what do you have
to say for yourself what do you want to
eat graduation weekend for us I you
we're early enough which I know the name
dude knack for miniseries and kind of
like teasing it at the end and making
you think I've got a season next part of
that like he's brilliant with that so
watch what like three videos I'm
literally rolling on the wall that has
not happened and since I was a child
probably laughing that was the one I'm
forgiving the exact premise of it but
they had hired Jesus Christ when Tricia
was becoming yeah they brought in like a
Jesus impersonator because his mom is
really really religious and there was
some reason for that he Jesus like
leaves and if he starts he's like
running back they think it's like summer
colors door opens forgot myself
we just found the cutest bench of all
time
do I
happy Mother's Day
shuttles now taking you the winery's we
are on the weekends a winery party bus
we're gonna go out to blue sky hey Nana
happy Mother's Day thank you my dear
and then you'd like to say to the beauty
broadcast family any words of wisdom
I don't know hurting your years of
motherhood I don't have words of wisdom
the older you get the less you really do
know me that's the wisdom is knowing
that you're always learning does that
that's where we're going if you ever
think you haven't figured out you can
forget that okay that's deep we're
getting deep right away making the
cookies Papa looks like he could go play
around a dolphin anymore at any moment
there you go sweetie you'd be more in
the shade there that's nice
bub that's what I like to say got a
pitcher of sangria here
no or a dandelion that's nice thank you
is chaos taking the gift of a child's
clover very seriously
trying to work it in it is a Mother's
Day boutonniere there was that time when
I gave mom one grape Arita and she
thought I'd give it her like I don't
know something really intense it was one
grape Arita they're in small cans and
she just drank it really fast was the
issue she drank it like she was drinking
a glass of kool-aid on a hot summer day
after she's had like a 12-pack of Bud
Light now crazy
we've got a new kind of sangria now
but you say like the red or white better
for above the contacts or bothering and
