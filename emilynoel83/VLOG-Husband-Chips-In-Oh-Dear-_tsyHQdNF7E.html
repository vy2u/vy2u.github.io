never done this I'm gonna try to shoot
this on my phone while eating a Taco
Bell naked egg taco this is probably
gonna be a huge mess but I'm gonna try
it yeah I kind of thought that the egg
was gonna be a little bit rubbery it is
not as bad as I thought and if you use
the MOR tool that comes with it
it's actually not that hard to eat on
time impressed but it is still a little
gimmicky not sure I'd necessarily go
with it again can you further explain
what the heck that was that you were
eating from Taco Bell this is the
official press conference right yeah I
had to kind of go quickly in the car to
that court as it had to rush okay go
into a little parking lot and go after
do they take an actual egg like they I
don't know how they cook it I doubt that
you can cook it on-site they probably
cook it in a factory somewhere and then
ship it over there and freeze it and
unfreeze it but everybody's got their
theory like an egg wrapping this holiday
wrapping around there's like some
potatoes in there a sauce and some
cheese and so the egg is pretty rubbery
not as bad as I expected because you
know they've got it
thankfully overcook it to get it to
where it's gonna have any kind of
structural integrity interject something
as well so you not only use the word
structural integrity but you are also
wearing a tie and your review and so
some might think oh he's just trying to
copy review bro I mean it's possible but
realistically I actually had work that
day in the hotel okay hmm I could see
why somebody might think that all right
but that would not be accurate put it in
this little thing kind of like they do I
think with the
those tacos you know she call it asleep
its asleep and you can just sort of inch
out the big taco a little bit just
enough for a bite easier to eat than I
expected that was kind of my biggest
fear was that it was just gonna be how
do you even hold this thing how do you
get it from you uh-huh
point A to point B right and that wasn't
as bad as I thought it was gonna be good
job on that light bulb by the way well
thank you stuff inside was really good
it's just with an egg I just don't know
that it's possible to make a good egg
that can also be a taco show so they've
got to either overcook it or they got to
put some stuff in there that affects the
taste or something I also tried the
where they call it The Wrap taco or
there's addressed the dressed taco which
was they basically take the gordita
softshell and then just wrap that around
the same thing and it's too much it's
too bratty it's cumbersome okay I'd
rather have the naked dog I'm not saying
I wouldn't get it again it was good it
just it's not something that's gonna
last I love this shot when they do this
shot on Idol and someone's singing and
they go oh good morning friends on this
Tuesday I just shot actually upstairs a
Q&amp;amp;A video and at the exact point that I
was talking about being a mom bub brings
Benny in he's like she woke up early and
I have to go to rotary this morning so
that was appropriate but people will
probably think oh man she just staged
her child to be brought in when she was
talking about being a mom but no I
legitimately feel exhausted after
shooting that video like I feel I got
emotional several times it was just a
lot of good questions a lot of y'all
just trying to dig down into my soul and
really ask the deep stuff so thank you
for that
look at this big loop see my hair didn't
look like this in the video this hairdo
that you're currently witnessing is what
happens immediately after shooting a
video like within seconds of turning off
my camera I've got to take that hair and
clip it out of my face can't be dealing
with that so bub just wants to be the
star of this vlog that and I haven't had
time to really vlog anything this week
but What's Up bub what do you have to
show-and-tell today look
the probably the worst your hours
license picture ever this past week
where we were lying do we need any
better so they made me take my glasses
off because they said something to do
with the glare yeah and so I basically
couldn't see anything then they took one
picture that my eyes were shot
apparently so focusing on keeping my
eyes it turned out the head look like
the biggest creep and the first time I
thought I said it looks like you just
seen the biggest you guy can't do you a
solid and say oh this is a god-awful
picture dude
they don't care ok as long as your eyes
are open I guess and bub lost is Fitbit
it's around here somewhere it's gotta be
hey can I clear up some of this see this
is why but needs me around to get the
little chunks pomade Jalen's seconds
here okay looking good now sharp all
right bub well thanks for cheering today
glad I could provide a laugh at my
expense
yeah test a new thing out at Taco Bell
why don't you whip out the camera oh
well I feel like I have been so off from
vlogging this week like I've ever been
in a real routine with it but I've had a
lot of editing to do I felt like with
the first vlog and then right on the
heels of that it was it's actually quite
a bit of editing when you do like a lip
Tryon video or at least for me there's
just a lot of video to go through with
that stuff so any like little spare
chunk of time I can find I've been
working on that and yes I'm wearing my
bunny ears today I did shoot a video on
this look for my elf video that's going
up Saturday how you doing bitty bear
yeah you slept well last night I've got
one extra little video project that I'm
working on this week in addition to
everything so I'm just I'm trying to get
as ahead as I can be craft time we're
using the stand
that she absolutely loves it you're
getting very detailed aren't you I asked
her if she had a yellow a couple of
minutes ago and she said I suppose I do
I'm gonna make this for you for me oh
I'm excited this one's turning out
really nice ooh I like this worthy there

press hard brown
oh well that's fun okay so for all y'all
who razz me about having the Hamburger
Helper last week this week we are doing
a plated meal it actually came in the
mail and I had forgotten like to put it
on hold or whatever so anyway this one's
really good we've made this in the past
and it's the crunchy chicken Milanese

mixed up a little honey mustard on the
side so that my friends is what's for

bunny ears are a little off-center right
now but now I not only made that dinner
but I did the dishes and then I went and
dried the dishes and I really need a bat

mess
today you go potty do you need to go
potty I'm good for now oh my gosh I want
to take this opportunity well I have the
camera pointed at you and I'm talking
about potty the funniest thing was the
thing that's going around Facebook
saying I gave birth in less time than it
takes my husband to go number two twice
and yeah I wanted to comment underneath
that was yes I believe I've given birth
twice in less time collectively than one
one of my doctors I've been one of your
potty up it says why does it take so
long like I guess because I don't have
an epidural anesthesia no coaching
coaching if people didn't take their
phones into the potty with them they
wouldn't spend as much time there sure
say it's probably true but then there's
magazines and no we don't have any
magazines just because we have our phone
all right well if you just cold turkey
stop taking your phone in there there
would be nothing to read except like the
bottom of the Kleenex box if we just
didn't have television we'd probably
read a lot more books but it's life we
live
excuse me

groceries it's been raining heavily all
week here not a pleasant day to be
loading groceries back into your car
