combs tonight but somehow I had the date
wrong
that was actually July 20 not June 20 so
luckily we found out before we actually
showed up at the venue and checked
yesterday and saw so instead of that we
were sitting down on the couch and
putting the girls down to bed and him
started watching
Trish papist and she was at IHOP or hi I
hop I guess now trying the new burger
and then she also had a really awesome
looking an appetizer sampler and so I
said let's go get one right now and so
that's what we did we ordered it and I'm
gonna go pick it up and bring it back
but it looks awesome
I'm not even really that hungry but you
know what
screw it we're being spontaneous alright
so we're back I didn't realize the
massive food stain last names it papers
Paytas Pete s fun to fill the void
because we thought we had a concert
coming and we were so like you were
talking about it non-stop last week like
oh my gosh there's like maybe a fried
egg on there bacon beans on a spring
patty underneath uh-huh
I've never had a burger with an icon
before coming into those lately
oh maybe I didn't have for you good
that's a good burger good chance you're
gonna flies in the face of our not
snacking after dinner we don't ever do
that stuff what this never happens in
our world
and the spontaneity of it all love the
bun top intro good Bacon's the right
consistency
well you CAF burgers yeah is average the
meat patty I think is average amazing
it's a good life idea I think this House
of burgers things just a big gimmick oh
man where's our burgers are so good we
should be calling the International
House of burgers mm-hmm there's decent
hello vlog you're out here at our old
stomping grounds pinchpenny pub having a
date night I thought we were just taking
a picture
somebody few drinks this is dangerous
huh this is the part that oppa has
carved out for the gentleman among us
more so we were just approached or I was
just approached and they asked if I was
doing okay and I said I think so I
really don't have any say in the matter
last night after date night we went to
Ulta yeah and it's kind of a throwback
you know we always used to go out and
have dinner and then when you're like
Walgreens just get comfy I mean mitties
already doing a harmful in any way yeah
you've had a lot of stuff come in
actually throughout the weeks that I I'm
sorry everybody but I kind of had to
deal with an unboxing I had to get going
with them and it's our dragon so we had
a system it's okay though we've got a
couple things for bud to talk about one
is this alcohol one is my Sephora play
box so fun and the play box T's is
really on the verge with me because I
was not that impressed with my last one
I'm about ready to cut it off and I
think this box will tell the tale if I'm
impressed with this box I will let it
keep going if I'm not I'm cutting it off
I must say your eye makeup is just
really killing it today I don't know if
everybody is or not
the first thing is just a big-ass sponge
I had never seen one this big this is
why I've never purchased this off the
website because I would never have the
scope of how massive this was and
something about it these expand so you
have like a basically small nerf
football and it's a body sponge though
so you can apply the various parts right
I could use like my liquid highlights
and like get them all over and I'm just
I'm kind of excited about it I'm super
ripped what Oh like stuffing like oh I
think you're gonna like stuff the sponge
and just you know make it you want me to
do muscle contour and you can make yeah
boobs looks figure I assume you can
apply the same concept to my biceps I'm
not sure how you know about all this but
that's fine we'll move on next this
super dope chocolate bar makeup
revolution London rose gold chuckles
yeah so Chuck a lot really cool
packaging because it looks like you got
you know just like a chocolate bar that
melted out in the Sun or something it
left in a hot car shade legend it looks
really pretty dirty rich I'm not a fan
of clear plastic sheets so that won't
live very long in my collection but I
got in there and swatch them a little
bit on the way thanks they look good I
love the packaging there are a lot of
ladies this we open out the makeup
revolution where you run through fingers
punch the finger sponges I like that
idea
I've never used a sponge like that and I
want no you don't want it okay are you
gonna have the finger sponges you want
the finger sponges its Ulta brand by the
way I guess it's kind of a gin
store-brand yeah and they have to some
good sponges I have a history of doing
good sponges for me so ok so then we got
a real Techniques expert concealer brush
and I don't know a lot about concealer
brushes but what strikes me is it's a
very short very short bristle to me that
says got a lot of control
exactly yeah precision and what I really
like about this brush is looks like
that's kind of a tacky rubber and so
really good grip yes I feel like the
performance of this brush will be pretty
good this was a practical purchase that
I can use and I don't regret it my first
impression of this brush is that it's
awesome I've been taken out of the
package or used it
this is a questionable purchase hunch
cleansing water no wash type like one of
those micellar waters I think I had you
using one for a while yeah would you
wash your face with something else and
then finish with this a lot of those
kinds of waters claim to take off your
makeup but oh yeah Eretria
it's my ray-ray oh and what am I missing
just take my word for it look in the
mirror or something I know it that's a
youtuber but I'm not super familiar with
her channel ray and then read backwards
yes baby
that's pretty good yeah I like the
configuration mullet chai brownie bite
that palate makes me hungry you know
that makes me want to do what eat the
entire McDonald's dollar menu teeth I
meant to go in for that that's that was
a legit medium beige bareMinerals
I wanted to try bare minerals powder
foundation again so I go invisible that
is what you would like to refer to as an
impulse purchase so dead no no I have
Invisibles already and I love them and
they're like a ponytail holder and these
I think these are like teeny tiny ones
so I'm not really sure how I'm gonna
work those in but I will color
and liquid concealer like a nice pink
shade
good Pete speech it's not paint it's not
gonna match your skin tone right
I find peachy shades work really well on
discolored like dark circles or my
melasma like any kind of discoloration
dark spots it has a little better effect
on it than just a regular like beige
concealer $4,000 well is it really so
this is a ten dollar a month like
Sephora's subscription box thing good
point yeah they'll give you some points
and this whole thing will tell you
actually the ins and outs of what's in
the bag but if we want to be surprised
look you can probably use this bag for
some things we reach one and grab in
grab something Oh
living proof nourishing styling cream
okay hair product I haven't done my hair
yet today so what we do with this Betty
want some Jesus she says me me me you
ready baby you're an animal okay she
says I want to see what else is in know
what do we got here
Clinique take the day off makeup remover
for lids lashes and lips I do like that
stuff you shake it shake shake shake I
don't hate that that's in there it might
be worth the $10 all right we'll see
they're doing okay so far do that and
this is based on preferences bub like I
do a little survey and he's gonna learn
they kind of know my skin type and skin
problems Club W soul that's the genera
wanted
I didn't love that stuff well I mean you
could put it on your butt but you can
put it like all over your body like
lotion as I recall it irritated me a
little bit but all you want some - me me
me me oh yeah
so basically bubs just gonna take on all
the stuff I'm in in me that's fantastic
you love it yeah I have that scent in a
spray that I wear sometimes does it seem
familiar yeah maybe that's why I like it
so much
what up we're done wait no there was
this that she pulled out in that there's
one more in there my whole my whole deep
butter and nourishing cleansing cream
okay take that out cuz it's been a
single melted mat I don't seem to face
Oh what shade is man long wearing
lipstick this is pretty I like some of
those this paper cost more than $10 but
queen bee I don't think I have that
shade Betty loves handling beauty
products really what's that
this is a cover FX perfect setting
pepper oh by the way everybody I showed
in a previous vlog I gave some of that
to my mom and she did use it and she did
really liked it so I made just stuck her
up again by giving her that other sample
cuz I have the full size already alright
well well what support boy box hang on
you can have the lotion and the hair
cream mom can have the powder
Betty can have that as a teething device
but my issue isn't normally like the
value because I do feel like they gives
me plenty it's just like I don't know I
always wind up getting some things I
already have or and the fun of it to me
seems to be like I want to try stuff I
can't use
they do this for golf they're like
little golf box here look at these there
this is what that liquid lipstick looks
like by the way that two-faced kind that
was into the play box the queen bee I
believe it is a lot more purpley than I
was expecting but that's okay it really
Gordon days with my eye look we are
about to embark on a blog topic that bub
has been proposing literally for weeks
my original idea somebody's selling
their flamingo okay no I had no part in
this idea this was all bad I don't know
why he wanted to do it like why were you
really did you hear something new about
the dollar
he's crazy idea we've been watching a
lot of shame - awesome Riley Garrett Oh
pumpkins likes carrot vests because a
few people have told him he looks a
little bit like Garrett I've pulled up
on my phone because sometimes you know
you and you go through a drive-thru and
you feel like the menu like they're
holding back on you I hate that forties
would you go through driver and they
leave stuff oh no so Hardee's is the
worst day
got their own stickers you know they're
like two for three or their whatever for
whatever's and then you get to the
actual building yeah there they stick
them on their windows but then when you
get to the actual you know menu order
and then where to be found
yeah and I think that's by design they
suck you in and then you're like I don't
know what the deals are maybe the number
two right so we're gonna feel it spying
and we're probably not gonna finish
everything every menu except for the
breakfast items yeah we're not gonna do
the breakfast are we getting close kid
knows how to build drone it oh yeah
hi just a second boys can we get a
cheeseburger happy meal with nope it all
and no time the end and then one triple
cheeseburger a new classic chicken
sandwich one bacon McDouble of two piece
chicken tenders and then a cheeseburger
a McChicken
and a large Diet Coke thank you very
much
so we actually ended up adding the large
fries didn't it fries on the dollar menu
didn't have any sign of the dollar menu
mm-hmm
we're horrible
such Incredibles is the toy theme did
you watch the incredible no I've never
seen it did you
right right you want to see the first
Incredibles first you know what to
expect from the second one okay here's
what you're gonna get if you get to the
one two and three dollar items not
including the breakfast tea thing so
that's that new classic chicken sandwich
and McChicken triple cheeseburger single
cheeseburger and the bacon dresser
I want to try this chicken sandwich I've
never tried it has some kind of a it's
got pickles and a sauce that's tricking
sang-gu normally for pickles no this I
don't maybe not quite enough sauce on it
for me but I'm gonna also try one with
the chicken strips the chicken strips
look like this I guess these are those
new buttermilk they just give you too
too long there should be a $1 Adam no
good I like them both can do this
I have no interest in eating the turbo
cheeseburger why do you think that I
feel like you need a t-shirt that says
not too shabby because I think you say
it'll work merch I also honestly don't
have much interest myself I'm not a huge
fan of bacon on burgers I feel like you
always got really no into them with your
teeth mmm this has the it's not like a
barbeque things just a bacon double they
can make double that smell Jen love
bacon but I agree on a burger it's very
very I go back to the chicken sandwich
very vigilant about how you put that on
there so I'm cutting with somebody I'm
talking about to pass out I'm starting a
fast right after this he's literally
he's not just saying that to be funny
he's 6 p.m. to in one hour no food for
72 hours somehow you got turned on to
Tim Ferriss his new book tools of Titan
burn a brown tweeted about a brown and
so she said hey you need to get this so
I got and I started reading at number
and doing this stuff in the past but one
in the chapters is on fasting okay
anyway good and another resonated with
me I've done I've those from 24-hour
fasts before you want a full day without
eating anything and this book recommends
like three to five days I read the same
chapter but I'm gonna try the three I
don't feel compelled to do this try the
three one of the things that they say it
does is is reduce joint pain and
inflammation and I've got a lot of that
both my knees a pain both my shoulders
have quite a bit of pain we have a
decent amount of back pain which I'm
doing a lot with yoga in 45 days or so
to try to to try to dial that back but
I've in my hands
hila just doing pains in all my fingers
so I want to see if this does anything
for that and I figure since he's gonna
do it and I'm not really gonna do it
I'll see you like I'll just see how it
responds to it and maybe just maybe I'll
try it to Lucy there's that messy bacon
now let's also mention here a McChicken
I I like to make chicken make chicken
was kind of a big pregnancy craving
actually with Biddy like Betty is
probably 60% make chicken sandwich just
in her makeup um so one of those is in
here I will have a bite I mean I make
chicken isn't make chicken it's not like
a freaking delicacy but I think when
you're craving it when you're craving
salt I like the little bit of spiciness
that it has there's more spice to me
even with that kind of whatever sauce
that was that was not Big Mac sauce on
this southern or the some classic
chicken sandwich it was some kind of
like it's a little bit tangy you know
but it's definitely not Thousand Island
but there's more spice on the McChicken
than the classic chicken sandwich with
chickens in double cheeseburgers were on
the dollar menu up until what about 2005
I'd either get it make checking the and
the double cheeseburger or like chicken
in two double cheeseburgers McDonald's I
was like kind of my go-to order it's
like three bucks the only thing we
haven't bitten into yet is just your
classic cheeseburger which to me I find
this more appealing than the triple I
just there's something about that I
don't I use don't like that much that
many patties it awesome
I would also often get may have number
two which is two cheeseburgers I'm I
like starting at full anybody this is a
lot you said we had to finish this all
right really
uh-oh battery that's what she said we're
not gonna finish this um
but of what you tried that you hadn't
yet gotten because you know a McChicken
is a classic a single cheeseburger is a
classic but of the other things like
what would you order again I'm liking
this triple cheeseburger okay I liked
the chicken sandwich I thought that was
actually pretty flavorful but it wasn't
quite as spicy as the big chicken but if
you want that different kind of I know
there's a little Piggly dialog oh I
can't put my finger on oh I can't either
I like their chicken strips I think
they're pretty good oh boy
from their naps oh hi Betty Bob hasn't
eaten all day
no it slipped 3:30 in the afternoon now
yeah it's you're comin on
24 hours without eating luckily our last
meal like Gorge myself of McDonald's
dollar menu items but doing okay doing
