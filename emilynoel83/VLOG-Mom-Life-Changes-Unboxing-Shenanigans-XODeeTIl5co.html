morning to you did not get around to
doing any vlogging yesterday just trying
to really catch up and get a lot of
video related tasks done I'm sitting
here at the table with Biddy and she's
coloring she just can't get enough of
crayons and just generally flipping
through coloring books you know what's
going on in our world this week well
more travel but not for me bub is
actually in Vegas for a couple of days
at a legal conference I joke with him
that they only had those things in fun
places I told him he really needed to do
some vlogging while he was there so
we'll see what he brings us I also may
assign him some PR unboxing when he gets
home but as for me this week I mean it's
a lot of it's a lot of kids stuff a lot
of makeup stuff and that's just the name
of the game can you color
I can do it yeah I did that
no this is a tiny guitar except for a
little Easter ukulele ukulele drop
that's the new thing here's a fun fact
about Nana that some of you might not
know she can play the guitar
specializing in steel guitar
could you play a regular guitar if you
had to like fit so only steel guitar how
many comments is it going to take in the
comment section to get you to bust out
the steel guitar again for us when we're
back at your old house but your sister
Jody played that we call it back then a
Spanish guitar what she's just a normal
guitar and then Claudia played accordion
classic accordion steel guitar guitar
trios was my dad was trying to get a
group I loved the steel guitar we play
then we say somebody here likes
quesadillas and guess what she also
likes to dip in her Southwest ranch
are you doing cowpoke
family dinner here
family outing did you just order your
meal what did you ask for
[Laughter]
flamingos in Vegas
the room I got is it has just been
remodeled you can smell they've just
done some construction work you know how
that it isn't it's perfect you could
probably convinced me that I'm the first
person to stay in here though I doubt
that 50-inch flat-screen TV they didn't
have a coffee maker which was a little
disappointing but it's a really nice
modern looking room and we'll change
lounge wine bitch flamingos there since
we are at the Flamingo when I first got
here I thought that was the closet turns
out it's an adjoining room
I didn't knock to meet my neighbors
there's the bathroom nice sink area it's
emotion yeah me I really want this in my
house to have a little pumps on the wall
it would be pretty awesome my only gripe
with the shower
it's a borderline impossible to get the
correct temperature reminds me of a
slightly embarrassing story first time I
ever stayed in Vegas there's at Caesar's
Palace and I couldn't get the shower
work and I just thought it was broken
and I actually had to call down and they
sent up a maintenance person and they
said well they've been in there and
however I can't get to open well it
turned out I just didn't know how to
work the shower
and I had to pull something or something
like that so they say if you ever start
feeling like we're pretty smart just
gonna try to turn on somebody else's
shower hey guy it's happy Thursday to
you the day is underway I have shot a
video that will be going up Saturday on
my channel may have remembered that I
kind of teased this idea in my last Q&amp;amp;A
video someone had asked if you've lost
all your makeup what are the first 10
things you would repurchase you know to
replenish the supply I decided instead
of just listening those things I would
actually apply them all to the face and
create a full face look with them go in
the extra mile so that's what I've done
so far this morning I got a little bit
of editing and other things done before
Biddy woke up and
she's doing so good sleeping through the
night can I just rest my elbow on
something here for a second she had
really gotten into a rhythm for a long
time where she do great through the
night and then she would wake up at like
sometime in the five o'clock hour or a
lot of times in the four o'clock hour
wanting to eat and now I've weaned her
that happened about officially like 100%
two weeks before my trip so I guess I'd
breastfed her for a little over 14
months and she was getting down to just
like that morning feeding a lot of
people say the last feeding they end up
taking is like the nighttime one before
bed but we'd sort of gotten into a
regular routine of just having some milk
and a cup and she was good with that but
that early morning time and Bell was the
very same way it was like that was when
she really thinks she needs someone
and since tapering off from nursing her
then I think somewhere along the line
here she's realized it's not worth
waking up now that I'm not getting
nursed at this time the weeding process
is emotional it really is like you start
thinking oh my gosh is this is this the
last day that I'm gonna do this oh my
gosh you know if I start thinking about
too much I will cry I'm a big crybaby so
sorry it's emotional there's an
attachment on the part of the baby to
the mom but also like I don't know it
just becomes so routine and I mean you
guys know like I started off when I
first started nursing Bell I mean go
back and watch on my vlog Channel story
about breastfeeding struggles like it
did not start easy but it becomes like
so second nature and so just part of
life you know but at the same time for
that whole time you don't really feel
like your body's totally your own and
now I'm starting to feel like my body is
my own again so that's nice
anyway as a result of weaning her she I
think she's sleeping way better like
just such a nice long stretch basically
the same way Bella's sleeping now I
wasn't really planning to give that
little update there but there you go bub
will get home very late tonight from
Vegas his flight comes into st. Louis
it'll be great to see him it's been so
like lonely at night like I just I don't
like sleeping in the bed alone I don't
like you know after the kids go to sleep
yeah obviously there plenty of company
and we're doing stuff right up and
go to bed but it's like in that alone
time after they go to bed
Baker's like knowing something's off
here and so she comes up and she really
snuggles with me the whole time until I
go to bed but also in the plans today
I'm gonna take the little ladies to the
playground this morning to play with
Stanley and Richard and Anna it's going
to feel I think like a beautiful
spring-like day today yesterday was kind
of nice weather-wise here but I think
today is as far as the forecast goes set
to be one of those first beautiful
spring-like days it's taking a long time
for spring to get here and hopefully
it's it's here to stay
I know it's spring because my buddy
Francisco is coming over today to help
straighten up our landscaping we've got
just a ton of landscaping around this
house that was here when we bought it I
wouldn't have known to do all the things
that they did but now that it's here
it's like okay we're gonna keep that up
you know we're gonna try to keep it nice
can you say yellow ten toes where's that
little tummy tummy tummy oh you know be
sly get it maker in it there's been a
lot of pouncing and a lot of activity
out here that I haven't captured so I
think this might actually be at the
stage where she's inflicted pain and she
just wants to watch it suffer behind the
bar
there's the Rumba what is it it's a
freaking be a wasp it was making it oh
my god it was making so much noise
earlier you guys like that but horrible
buzz I thought someone was running a
mower out there at nine o'clock at night
I'm just trying to innocently sit on the
couch and edit my video and we got this
kind of drama this is what happens when
both leaves for a few days my house
saying got in here dude what if I just
tried the room but on it would eat the
bug with my luck as soon as I would turn
it on the bug would find a way to like
fly out and kill me
happy Friday everyone woohoo Friday it
is windy as can be outside let me show
you can't quite tell at this very moment
the grass is looking so good we're
getting treatments on it I think for
about a year and a half and it's really
paying off when we moved in here like
there was all this really impeccable
landscaping oops hello but the grass was
like just chock-full of weeds and you
know when it's mowed down nicely you
can't always see him but now it's like
really lush and green and we're so happy
with it lawn update that's what
everybody wants but this home finally he
got home I don't know exactly what time
it was last night because I was sleeping
gave him a big hug when he came into bed
but it was like I don't know between
3:00 and 4:00 a.m. probably closer to
4:00 a.m. I'm thinking because his
flight kept getting pushed back I would
just get these periodic texts from him
last night when it was the airport it's
gonna be another hour another hour I'm
not really sure what was causing it it's
been very windy here and he said it was
very windy in Vegas as well but other
flights were going off so I don't know I
was starting to get worried that it was
gonna be one of those hangover
situations you know where they call the
line they're like you know we're gonna
just stay here a little longer and you
wonder why are you staying in Vegas a
little longer no but I don't think he
was having a whole lot of fun he was
eating hot dogs in the airport and
receiving awesome tweets from me and pup
we were sharing some fantastically
entertaining material I must say but
last night while I didn't you know have
anybody to socialize with after the
girls went to bed I entertain myself
with a night probably regretful retail
therapy Hall which I will no doubt share
with you in a future video and I edited
the video that will be going up on
Saturday morning it is uploading now
it's just got a little ways to go yet
but I think it's gonna be awesome this
is one of those great questions that I
had in my Q&amp;amp;A video are you about to
toss that overboard you wouldn't toss
that overboard would you it pancakes
there there you go and I try one
sometimes this really gets her
interested in eating something if she
sees me eat it you're nice love is so
much oh it's so good mmm no you should
try one highly recommend no not for you
or biddle look at this little outfit you
know but the Widow jeans the onesie
that's all my favorite hand-me-down once
he saw you want to see you're so cute
hey guys it is Saturday morning and I
need to head out and get a couple kind
of like outdoor floral type things from
Hobby Lobby I'm hoping I find what I
need there I'm also hoping that I happen
to catch it at the 40 or 50 percent off
price I don't know if I'll get around to
getting it actually put in place by the
time this vlog is that but maybe for the
next one I can show you what I do
outside with some little floral type
things and then I need to pick up some
groceries and something that's really
going to inspire I think some of my
choices that I make I watched Lisa J
makeups video about her weight loss
journey and it's very inspiring and she
actually had done a video a while back
on her weight loss and now it was more
how to maintain it her most recent thing
and I feel like I'm in a place right now
where I'm just I'm looking for something
I'm looking for something to like kind
of hold on to and say like this is gonna
be my new lifestyle change like just
eating healthier I feel like I'm in a
place right now
with my routine where I'm doing a lot of
things right but there are still things
I could do better and improve upon more
and so she kind of inspired me to
jumpstart that idea more and I think I
mentioned it a couple days ago on here
like with weaning having a baby who's no
longer breastfeeding you feel like okay
my body is my own now I can make some
more decisions that are more about me as
opposed to almost being scared to do too
much when you're helping to provide part
of a baby's nutrition you know so anyway
if you haven't checked out her channel
do so for the makeup stuff if nothing
else but also on top of it I think she
just got a lot of good life advice it's
very very helpful favorite blanket hi
showing to Bakey oh she likes it thank
you I'm back there's some unboxing there
were some requests that I do this again
it cosmetics a suitcase it kind of thing
au revoir bye bye adios I can't tell
what that says got on any case though a
trunk for when you're traveling or
something that little sampler CC cream
that's helpful gives all the prices and
wonder the information now let's get to
the good stuff
makeup for removing cleansing wipes
those will be good to keep around for
wiping with swatches off later great for
entertaining babies heavenly lux wand
ball powder sounds inappropriate sounds
like something to prevent chafing for
makeup purposes maybe there's some ball
powder and you got some Bible I under
eye cream appreciate the rhyming there
bye bye pours bronzer bye bye pores
pressed powder by by the lines serum bye
bye redness
skin relief treatment moisturizer still
haven't solved the ball powder mystery
but maybe somebody could explain that to
me like a dog or a bear
what's a backpack see how practical this
thing
pretty good walk around town with one of
these let's add a nice little hoodie
with it Mac Mac Mac nickel nickel panda
there's a panda on there okay so it's a
panda now it's all coming together
Morel slow but I don't know what Niko is
that's don't think that's how you put it
on little haphazard application there
somebody needs to get to the sizes
straight I'm not going to be a bull wear
mediums oh that could be fun
peel it and then so I don't just put it
right on there I'll save the rest for
and when I'm bored or something kids
might get to the good stuff no riot if
you've ever been to a panda riot I don't
know where I was going with that
they open the wrong in yeah
yeah well panda on top this is called
sugar coat oh I bet it's flavored
it's glittery let me see rough
application feels good tastes good
my ridiculous boy look right now on the
scale of 1 to 10
I'm guessing these are all kind of the
same thing just different days see I
shouldn't have gone should've jumped on
the white so quick color I don't hear
different limits and on top looks like a
concerned panda - okay look at that how
cool is that I was painting the inside
of the product I don't know how that
works with your colors I guess my bride
knows better than I do all the two tones
know if you knew this about pandas but
they have just really what various
lashes some more color than their but
you don't have to go through each one of
those details alright so get some
Physicians Formula
I think that might not be accurate I
mean they're probably as a physician
involved somewhere down the line but
don't really know that physicians are
really in the lipstick business getting
much of it sent it all off of that
organic wear treatment treatment
treatment where they live ray I have no
idea what this is oh I was looking at
like the French side I guess it's
organic wear lip treatment no words just
doesn't seem to match up here we've got
some make sure I'm reading the English
bar 24 karat gold collagen serum and see
little gold flecks suspend it in there
I'm wondering if we'd be like filter
this out and just sell the gold off and
how much does this cost like $1,000 how
do they make money off of this
little very strong scent to this one
either and then will flower a
brightening facial oil stick don't slick
that must be the oil I'm going I'm
glittering we'll see how my cheeks feel
here in a couple hours
more Mac stuff huh strobe body lotion
yeah no idea what makes it Astro Body
Lotion very minimalist packaging this
stuff just became available to skin
finish powder just finish your stands
with it you got kind of a gold and then
sort of a rose gold color every time I
look at the word skin finish it looks
like skin fish okay we got a prepping
prime fixing gold lights look at that
and that cool hmm that's fun
smells nice nice and refreshing you look
like a lot my face feels really wet
right now might be dripping no cools
that face settings / eh I used last time
but I feel like I could just sit this on
my dad's can just shake it up and look
at it every so often kind like a snow
globe in the bottle really fun cool
things happening in there we go one more
just didn't work on scepter paper a lot
of gold glowing things in this set of VR
packages must be the trend this time of
year or maybe not
that's a good Groundhog Day oh hey you
might tell us a little bit about your
trip to Vegas oh yeah I uh did a quick
week trip in midweek trip to Vegas just
there from Tuesday to Thursday a little
longer than we planned cuz our flight
kept getting delayed got home at 4:30
yesterday morning which was exhausting
but it was good a good conference now
met a lot of new people together with my
boss Mark little lot of connections I
think had a lot of good my favorite part
about Vegas is the food my favorite
restaurant in the world is Nobu and
they've got one in Vegas at Caesar's
Palace and it's incredible but I am very
very happy to be home cuz I miss my
girls
