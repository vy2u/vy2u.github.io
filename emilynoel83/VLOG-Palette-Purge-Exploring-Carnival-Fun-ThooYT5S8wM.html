day's just getting going I'm up here in
the makeup room getting ready what I'm
wishing I had like another royal wedding
to watch or something on TV right now
because that was so awesome it's
Memorial Day weekend there's sort of a
carnival thing going on not right in our
town but in our area and I thought it
might be fun to take the girls to that
I've got a video going up today that I
am so excited about it's where all the
makeup I put on my face had to come from
the back of whatever drawer I was hoping
up and it was really fun and really just
eye opening I think another tasks that I
want to tackle if I can get to it over
the course of the weekend is kind of
cleaning out my makeup room closet which
is a real wreck and just continued
cleanup here in the room although the
room itself isn't too bad but if the
closet could get cleaned up it could
absorb a lot of the clutter that tends
to build up elsewhere in the room you
know what I'm saying but yeah that's
what's going on right now so hope you
guys are having a good weekend too what
I used on my eyes today is something
kind of new that I'm playing with it's
the latest petite pro from the Z art and
I believe I got this one off of Beauty
lish yeah I'm pretty sure that's right
but it's this one that has the Greens
involved in a little bit of purple too
and at a glance I remembered thinking
hmmm does that look kind of similar to
the first one but the greens definitely
take it in a different direction and I
really like this color bring this light
kind of seafoam I don't know springing
green there I think is so pretty and
actually really wearable you know the
larger palettes from vizhi art get kind
of like a bad rap for being really
expensive although I do think they're
packing in a lot of product of good
quality but these little palettes the
petite pros can be kind of a nice way to
dip your toe into the brand and get a
different color scheme because while I
like the theory palettes those are the
six color ones that are half matte half
shimmer they're very monochromatic and
they just stay in the same sort of
family which can be fine and nice and
all like I absolutely love amethyst
deeply in my soul but the petite pros as
you can see kind of have a little bit
more color versatility a little more
variety and
and the pants are very small so I don't
know I have all three and I was kind of
thinking of comparing them and in
letting you know about my favourites I'm
pretty sure that's gonna be an upcoming
video for me on my lips is one of my
favorite pink glosses it's the Becca Glo
gloss in camellia which I was raving
about in that video where I reviewed
them I noticed a few questions asking
for dupes of this shade so I will keep
my eye out for that for you so I got
this book because Brene brown
recommended it she did some tweet about
her top books or book she's reading now
and so I'm like okay that sounds really
compelling I went ahead and ordered it
off of Amazon it's that thick y'all it's
gonna take me a while
you ate all your grapes can you eat some
pancakes now thanks my heart I'm so glad
you guys are enjoying the video that I
posted today plus the ad will tell you
some crazy ways to lose that stubborn
belly fat
sometimes haters don't wake up early on
Saturdays and that's fine zip it
girlfriend
zip it this is what she wants everyone
she wants my leftover pineapple fried
rice kid likes Thai food she got a lot
of it while she was in the womb say rice
right mmm
can you say please good no now say thank
you good girl in the van this morning
taking a solo trip to Ross I'm looking
for a few dress options for an upcoming
event and I love looking at Ross because
I feel like it's just a great place to
find some diamonds in the rough I found
like just some great shirts and just
general stuff there too but I always
feel like they have a good selection of
dresses and petite dresses so I'm gonna
look into that but I've also wanted me
to check out the dress socks and golf
shirts for him and I told Belle do you
want to come with me but she was too
gung-ho about getting into her princess
dress this morning and watching some
cartoons
so far how cute are these little babies
for the girls always what happens you're
looking for things for yourself and then
you find cute kid stuff those are so
rough I ended up going with this dress
this didn't really serve the purpose I
was looking for like in terms of the
event I'm going to with bub for the
Trial Lawyers Association it's just
something I don't know I like the sleeve
on it I like the little floral detail at
the bottom and I thought I'd probably
eventually use that for a lot of
different reasons it was very comfy too
also this little number for Biddy I mean
come on $6.99 who could turn that down I
did find bub to doll shirts one is Under
Armour know it's about half price of
what it would have originally been it's
nothing too fancy but use that doll
thing right and then I also found a Nike
one yeah the vent Thank You situations
got little snaps instead of not cool oh
where are you going Little Miss little
bows Oh kid bows Oh
all dude well it's now nap time and it's
been a pretty fun field base so far we
had lunch we had some playtime where I
you know was once again the master of
hide-and-seek several times over see I
like to really mess with people and
switch positions while they're looking
sometimes so I like rehidden
in the midst of their search and it was
just hilarious Tyler realized he had a
flat tire on his car so he's getting
that dealt with we also got the hot tub
water tested he took that to be checked
on because they told us to do it after
two weeks we got to start recapping some
of the manly things Bubba's done before
we start forgetting cuz there's been so
many but what have you been today
that would change the tire you know
about to change a lightbulb
I was driving to take the pool water in
for a sample and my little alert said
zero psi and your rear driver's side
tire yeah like it had to be a mistake
because my friend was not have any
problems driving like that so I pulled
into the driveway and sure enough
flowers can be jacked it up in the 100
degree heat took it in changed it are
your hands
rough or everything they're still silky
smooth it's very smooth hands everyone
okay
we're gonna go to the carnival tomorrow
right we have yet another weekend of
missed opportunity people who are
supposed to come stay with us couldn't
do again dude sickness time get well
soon
various everybody order my not and I
will track it for all eternity sweet
princess bedtime stories everybody they
love this book at any time of day
which is your favorite story in there I
love I love one I like the one about
Tiana that funny line yes yeah y'all had
a scuffle with a little bitty you know
in a big nobody yo Oh
hey she really likes to turn the pages
too you know
let her turn some honey
there's a little groundhog hole under
that tree stump what you gonna say to
him neat little clearing back here tell
me about this hole do we think bunnies
maybe okay don't poke down in there we
don't want to disturb anybody okay
that's a really good stick good good
height of stick thank you very much
found some honeysuckles ah no some yummy
here's our little rock where we like to
sit oh you see an airplane yep I see it
yeah not only are we looking for nature
we're looking for the man-made wonders
as well I spent pictures great I tell
you guys what seriously nothing makes me
happier than these nights just walking
around watching her get a kick out of
picking clovers and dandelions and stuff
and just enjoying this beauty everywhere
the tall cottonwood trees the Sun
setting the honeysuckle I mean it's just
gorgeous all the animals the deer that I
think call this place home back here and
walk through our backyard
clovers mostly
very nice ready set go look he would get
the rest takes a lot of hot air to do
that when you get just anywhere in the
vicinity of this area that is so thick
with the honeysuckle doesn't that smell
good what do you think's back there that
would be a good place for a small animal
to get into now blow real hard
see I think this would be a pretty place
to take some pictures this cute little
area yeah let's go swing up the big girl
I'm coming down the hill
we're taking a peek into my makeup room
closet and those white cubby holes were
filled with pallets also above in a
little area right up in there - don't
you love just the hanging vote but we're
talking like old pallets I just really
have not taken the time to get into this
closet in quite a while and seriously
look around and as soon as I did I
thought oh my word some of this stuff is
so old
I'm literally only keeping it for I
don't know nostalgic purposes which what
purpose is that really serving me so as
you can see there are a few things over
here that remain I'll point those out to
you as well but I wanted to show you
what's in this box
also I threw out just an entire garbage
bag full of other maybe less notable
things but I thought it might be
interesting for me to point out some of
these things that you might remember me
talking about on my channel like years
ago sorry guys I know this is like
really rough really impromptu but here's
something do you remember when everybody
had this big old thing when elf put out
more neutrals than anybody could ever
possibly like dive into and I really use
this guy there's a lot in there from
cool to warm to berry and purple and
every highlighter type shade known to
man I don't use that anymore and I
really don't have a desire to dive into
that and mount of shades at once you
know I can't spend too much time on all
this because I've got a box full but I
just wanted to quickly show you you
remember the lorac palette that is so
cute and it was filled with these things
look like chocolate bars there and some
of them there was like a lip palette and
eyeshadow palettes and eyeliner palette
in there you know obviously some cream
stuff that I would never touch and put
on my face again but I kept it because
it was so cute the Urban Decay stuff I'm
getting rid of advice to vice vice
Limited as you saw in my last video and
also this one which was strictly sitting
there because you know it's cute wasn't
this like kind of an anniversary type
palette really pretty shades in there
actually
it's beautiful but I'm just I'm not
using it this is one of the most
hardcore decluttering episodes I've ever
had because it's easy to throw out an
old foundation it's harder to throw out
a palette that you feel like personally
attached to like one of the first I used
on my channel and you know like this one
whoa stuffs falling out but that one
from its heart here's another tart the
Too Faced summer I this is the first you
know go round of that palette I have
loved this elf palette the variety in
there you know used a lot of it this is
probably a great walk down memory lane
for some of you guys and the Stila did
this little like you know book set of
palettes that look like little actual
paint palette Smashbox with their photo
op eyeshadows one holiday season they
had this beautiful collection there
there was also a smaller version of that
that I've also gotten rid of and
toothpaste the Holiday Collection that
said everything nice on it
countless you know Tarte Holiday
Collection stuff going way back this Too
Faced holiday thing that came in the tin
tarts original showstopper palette like
I think the first palette they put out
in a circle like this and they're still
making that style of palette might be
like her the second or third to face
palette I've ever owned this sweet
dreams I'm just kind of guessing here on
that but this was a holiday thing as
well very pretty
oh I loved this palette from Smashbox in
it like warped somehow like it's not the
magnets don't stay down I absolutely
adored this palette if anybody remember
me raving on this thing and I've got
like a big ol Mary Kay put in here a big
Sephora blockbuster palette this Paris
palette from Sigma I thought was so
beautiful but you know it's got to go
I'm just not using this stuff and I
can't afford to take up the space with
it and it's not as though guys I was
really like looking through this stuff
continuously and constantly finding it
worthy I just wasn't really looking at
it I was letting it sit on those little
shelves not really even acknowledging
its existence here in the makeup room
and just not taking the time to really
analyze it and say okay it's out I've
got some things from Coastal Scents that
are going bye-bye and these
I might feel the most emotional about
these are probably some of the first
pallets that I seriously reviewed on my
channel you know like I just I really
remember these videos and I remember
getting these products here let me show
you this palette from Coastal Scents the
first large palette of this size I ever
had I remember I bought this one and
some of the first PR stuff that was ever
ever sent to me way way back in the day
was like this shimmer palette and I'm
pretty sure they sent me the warm
palette too and quite a few palettes
after that but like I remember reviewing
this stuff early on on my channel and
using the heck out of this shimmer
palette just doing all kinds of
different shadow looks and tutorials
it feels nostalgic to me and I think
well you know you've got the old videos
if you ever want to go back and watch
and I don't need to feel like a wave of
guilt for getting rid of it but it just
you know it's kind of like really
seriously saying goodbye to some things
that were very prominent in my channel
in the early days so what am I actually
keeping after looking through a lot of
stuff of that kind of era you know in my
life what am i holding on to I got a set
of malli eyeliners here these are like
brush type collections this might be the
first to face palette I ever had I would
have talked about it and the earliest
earliest days on my channel it was a
gift a Christmas gift from my sister
when she would give me you know a lot of
makeup tech goodies and that was kind of
my initial exposure to Sephora stuff you
know was what she would get me for
Christmas and this little guy you know
there's stuff underneath as well I loved
using that I loved the novelty of it
obviously it's so old I'm not going to
be using it now but I will keep that
because that really has meaning to me
also this is sort of from an maybe a
eyeshadow inspiration since but I loved
this feminine palette here from Urban
Decay I wish they would do something
kind of like this again but I don't want
to like forget about this beautiful
color scheme that's in here and I may
one day like really want to recreate the
kind of look I could get with something
else and I just didn't want to let that
go all so why am i keeping this original
version of natural eye well this was the
first Ulta purchase I ever made
I remember it vividly going to the Ulta
in Fairview Heights that's outside st.
Louis and I'd never been to an Ulta
before and I'd watched some videos on
YouTube of a few people talking about
how great this palette was and I got it
then it is a beautiful palette it's not
like I'm keeping some sort of eyesore
around here you know it looks great but
yeah I feel deeply that I need to keep
that it's not gonna go through
everything nitty gritty style here but I
am keeping a few larger palettes like BH
Cosmetics and Coastal Scents including
this big 252 ultimate palette from
Coastal Scents because it's literally
like every shade you can imagine and I
feel like you know it's that library of
bright and just every color of the
rainbow and as opposed to keeping a lot
of large palettes I will keep that and
just a few of these smaller ones that
have like those Coastal Scents hot pots
in them because I think those are just a
really great formula some of them I
think great dupes for other types of
shadows so those can hang around for a
while they're not incredibly old or
anything and I don't think there's
anything wrong with them but what came
out of that closet last night is all
this stuff and then an entire garbage
bag full of other things too what it all
points back to really is time because if
I would have just taken the time to get
into that closet quite a while ago you
know this could have happened a long
time ago really we're gonna still be
going to the carnival although a very
dark thunderstorm is approaching let's
hope it's just a spotty shower and it's
here and gone but I wanted to let you
know the earlier in the week pup was on
the road all you want me to hold you as
I was saying um pup had let me know that
she and Jeff were on the road and she
had forgotten all her makeup so she was
in an emergency so here's what she told
me she said do you have anything I can
pick up from the drugstore a concealer
and eye shadow that could double as brow
a powder and a mascara and she said she
did have like a lip product in her purse
so she didn't need that so I gave her my
four picks and she went out and found
him hey everybody this is Kelly
Emily sister aka pup and I'm staying at
a hotel with my husband Jeff for the
next couple of days and as soon as we
got here I realized that I had forgotten
all my makeup at home so I quickly
texted em to sue she had any
recommendations for emergency makeup
that would get me through the next
couple of days and she shot back a great
little list immediately so tomorrow
morning firstly I'm gonna get all that
stuff and try it out and hopefully that
will do the job I'm sure it will again
so thank you and I will see you on the
other side everybody so I found all of
my sister's recommendations at a CVS and
I'm ready to go thanks boo these are the
products that I'm recommended sure you
all recognize them and here is me before
okay this is me after I think the makeup
did a great job even though I've got
some pretty unflattering hotel lights
that I'm dealing with poof I love you
you're amazing you are a wizard I think
and couldn't have done this without you
obviously thanks again twos I want to do
more of this I told her afterward like
can I just start up some kind of makeup
hotline where people can just be like
hey I'm in an emergency I need this this
and this here's a picture of my face
here's my skin type go and then I could
give them the stuff and they can go find
it you know what's up gang we are going
out we're going to
oh yeah rides food carnival atmosphere
what we're here for
got some corn dogs free ketchup and
mustard it
my foundation on pretty darn decent
staying power really all things
considered I'm wore my YSL long wear
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
always a good idea in situations like
this but I got very sweaty that has your
makeup holding up we got some ice cream
from Dairy Queen I got a s'mores
blizzard Bubba summer berry cheesecake
blizzard this is the first time we've
gotten very clean since well the first
time this year it days real good I'm
really liking it and I made this new
friend here who really likes my ice
cream the other day that bub was really
busy doing a lot of manly tasks like it
was changing times changing light bulbs
but in the midst of that but what did
you pick up from Walmart cousin Carlton
froze ace for those of you who haven't
picked up on it yet it's it's just bros
a but it's frozen it's a wine slushy
it's a wine slushy but it I mean it
seems sweeter yeah next we know it's
definitely sweetened it all but
obviously it was not frozen no if your
own walmart sells booze they've got the
little rack with different things like
pina coladas and daiquiris and Stephanie
just throw them in the freezer take him
out and he'll love him thought for a few
minutes or do what I didn't run him
under hot water for a little bit break
it up and massage it with your hands so
it's smooth and pour it in a glass
seriously
yeah this is we just let me always split
one but there's another one waiting on
us if we're decide to take it up in the
lunch this would be a great pool drink
yeah this is a recovering from the fair
with two kids drink thank you so much
for watching this vlog and we will talk
to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
