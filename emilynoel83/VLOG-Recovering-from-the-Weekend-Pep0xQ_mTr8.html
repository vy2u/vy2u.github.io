on the vlog I wasn't sure if I would
really have a vlog this week because I
didn't vlog throughout the week I was
preparing for this trip which started
midweek Wednesday backing it up a little
bit Tyler and I had to go to Chicago for
one kind of top-secret duty involving me
which I can tell you about in the future
and the other thing that coincided with
that was actually on the Trial Lawyers
Association big dinner and sort of a
program for the new president who is
Bob's boss mark and so we got to be part
of that it was super fun great time was
had I was so glad though to get home to
the girls cuz I missed them so much like
seriously every night laying in that
hotel room bed when I was gone is like I
miss them so much I was thinking about
vlogging while I was you know doing
stuff for the trip but it sort of
amounted more to a lot of Instagram
stories so I inserted some of that into
that and get ready with me video that I
posted and then I thought I'd just kind
of pick up today and just hop on here
while we're getting back to normal so
we're out of everything there's kid food
and stuff my mom and dad watched them
over the last few days and like they
have everything they need but Tyler and
I also need to eat and we tried to like
you ever do that before a trip where you
try to really like eat everything up so
you don't have stuff sitting around
unused for a few days like in your
fridge so we got to a really good place
with that we were very cleaned out
actually did like a little fridge clean
out everything's looking good there but
we need some food to put in it you know
for nourishment also a bunch of boxes
arrived like PR related stuff while I
was gone like a lot over the course of
just a few days so I think maybe this
calls for another unboxing that's
probably gonna be the bulk of this video
I would just point out a few things of
note that I found well at Walmart
getting everything under the Sun I saw
these kits these favorites kits for
Walmart Beauty and several of them like
there was an eye one and a lip one they
actually looked quite good but I already
had a lot of the things and here I do
have a full-size make it dewy but I
don't mind having a small spray for
travel and they had these other glow
related things so I thought that would
be fun to try also I have had just some
pesky breakouts around my nose that just
don't seem to want to go away somebody
chimed in when I was first dealing with
this and I had just stopped nursing and
they said well it's probably a hormonal
shift you know that's happening there so
I could just wait to ride it out or I
could buy some news so I got this little
girl here IV no favorites for clear
complexion I had heard the cleanser
being recommended so I knew I was gonna
go after that but this came with the
moisturizer so I thought why not I also
picked up these products from Neutrogena
just because I'm kind of getting
obsessed with solving this problem and
y'all covergirl has a lot of new stuff
so I got a lot of that and it will
definitely be a topic for discussion in
a future video I do have a bone to pick
though I'm assuming this was a local
problem
maybe not happening everywhere but those
pallets were all labeled as four dollars
and change I think and they ended up
being nine dollars and change I think
that's a pretty significant difference
for a drugstore palette coz like thought
I was getting a really sweet deal but
not so much
it's for little otter what do you call
this mango got some tart but a month
since I've known mr. thing oh that's
cool
you wonder if that's gonna be a massive
mass or if there's like a second you you
got all those kids contained oh that's
even cooler
no come look at this mm-hmm so much I
have everything in there so sparkly look
these are like little flower stickers
check out there's a little star you
could use that to hang them up like like
barbecue tools anyway these are called
pretty things in fairy wings all right
this is the love trust in fairy dust
jasprit a little flower on the inside oh
it smells good you smell it can we think
oh my gosh yes we will make sure mommy
there's a video on this because this is
pretty darn cool very impressed sorry
you got a few more tart items to burn
through they've been busy see the change
and celebrating world ocean day I put my
fins up in the air sometimes saying a
flood about some more fun in Oh ciao my
full contact sport
oh well canvas bag they don't want they
want you to use less plastic bags for
the sake of the turtles I think I'll
just use this when I go get my groceries
oh this is gonna be some dope stuff I'm
just guessing that looks like there's an
app that matches your skin tone and then
you got all these different options
there's a nice little chart to help you
out as well
increase lasondra I can see learn press
and melt with your feet
let's seems like a lot of fun all these
so I'm assuming everybody's got one of
these that six best for them otherwise
wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to
buy all these this looks like a very
fancy toothbrush Oh thirty different
shades but a bit a little pyramid oh
yeah shimmer and shine microphone seemed
like a great idea in the store didn't it
hi baby smack I think I'll Leah had some
songs like back in the TRL days
now we're getting into like you know the
kids distracted neat like got a brown
color to the whole signature
okay these appear to be lipsticks really
pretty packaging that looks like a nice
- milk chocolate lip stuff it's got a
plastic you know dear Lord protect my
head blueberry pies and a little mini
palate a lot of shimmery colors a couple
of mutual dumb shades are darker some
paints are lighter and some other colors
are brighter baby girl bronzing powder
I'm in a distresses lost and trying
games I take to do right off or a mercy
earth Mercier looks like I know there's
to be written to you I'm not sure she's
gotten the memo that I did the unboxing
he's dead it takes a while to update the
database is sometimes you're Emily
Mercier foundation primers innovation at
its finest as a makeup artist or Mercier
realized primer is the essential first
step to creating a flawless face soon
thereafter you were the first beauty
brand to introduce primer to the
industry I'm starting to get bored sort
of a packet about the primer and oil
free and in an oil once oil free they're
the ones oil right almost by definition
what gloss all over everything I'm not
used to wear anything that's in frame
around yeah probably not gonna match my
tone where does it not even match to it
got an SPF 30 in it but it feels very
silky smooth now I'm prime for my hand
makeup we've got software foundation
it's like they've only got about 12
shades I'm just kind of phone in at a
Dan there's a couple of bouncy balls
I mean careful with those choking hazard
fasteners they had a lot of bouncy balls
all
it's often swag nothing says badass like
a pair of heart sunglasses over my
existing glasses looks like it's all one
product for just different shades of its
if I can find mine I'd say I'm probably
a one
is done this is not done I'll let you
all be the judge not sure what I do when
I get into the beard line I have a
foundation at that point I'll figure it
out and do a future video and didn't
make my fence on the first open it the
whole box looks like one of their
foundations be it like a bonus water
bottle
put perfect for my foundation but you
know I got to take them one at a time
monkey here cream to powder makeup seems
like skin preparation is the theme of
this
all right work sites better it seems
like it was easy to do I don't know if I
did it right but nice that they had the
wool and spongy thing and that he is use
my fingers last anyway so I'm gonna go
play with these super cool new lip
glosses cuz they're all over the place
and there's also this awesome lighted
mirror that you just take with you since
the battery's running low I'm just gonna
do that by myself love you both but this
is in the freezer section now found it
at Walmart today it's a macaroni and
cheese meal I split it between the girls
and they are really enjoying it just you
know for those days when you don't want
to take a real long time just throwing
it out there she ate her broccoli right
up and we always start with some fruit
and veggies so she's already had her
strawberries and grapes bidding
meanwhile is still working on some of
her fruit but what do you do that nugget
tenderizing it for yourself take a chump
take it Sean why you dip it in the
cheese from the mac and cheese that
might be good take it from an old pro
yeah and guess what bubs picking up for
me sushi so unlike me but it's pretty
familiar with sushi has been dirty for a
few years now by the way you're always
wearing that shirt or some form of mom
in the barrel right anyways I said bub
start me out and get me some fish we've
never eaten this place before we think
that's the ridiculous role that was a
special one oh my gosh isn't it which
would be the California rolls was with
the Philly rolls those are the same
avvocato rolls
how do they look just edit glance that
no small but they're the simple one so
okay the little back story here in case
you didn't see to get ready with me

tried sushi for the first time
little trip and I absolutely loved it
and I began immediately looking up local
places and try the ridiculous roams
California or they've set some stuff on
top mmm now is it good where is Nikki
she's over there reading a book you try
one of these I'm a little scared of
those to be on I see but they're good
they're tasty there's nothing bad about
okay okay oh it's like you're laughing
and it's like constricts the facial
muscles okay take two
I'm gonna sit these things down if
you're tired of the chopsticks then put
them down and just you know get with
your hands I feel much better this way I
feel a lot more control to gums up for
the ridiculous roll don't get
intimidated just stuff it in there baby
