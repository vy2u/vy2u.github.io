cute today you're under Armour skirt
with built-in shorts no damn Joel me
we've been to a three-year-old to just
casually show you her shorts under her
skirt well I'm talking to you guys on my
phone right at the moment because my
camera is charging up we're gonna be
going over to Nana and Papa's house
because I'm gonna tear through Nana's
makeup and find the stuff that she's not
using that I've given her and sort of
pushed some things to the forefront she
has asked me to do this because I've
given her a lot of makeup over time but
she's compiled it in a drawer I think
everybody's got a drawer and I'm gonna
look in her drawer okay ladies get up
and go I like how you've matched your
dog's leash today yes you know you look
so nice in this peach room not that you
don't look nice in other rooms but I'm
just saying I think it's a flattering
wall color to be surrounded by well I
think it is you haven't seen in this
room before I missed some past blogs
this is the like playroom type room here
so like I said the reason why I'm coming
over here to Nana's is to dig through
some products that she has and a lot of
it's things I've given you right it's
all thank you we're gonna look through
and kind of see what's next in line that
she could maybe start using or start at
least rotating into what she's currently
got there might be some real gems in
there that she's just kind of like set
aside and should you stay with what has
worked
she's gonna lead us in the direction
this would be my drawer I like that
you've got a little makeup table over
there oh yeah and then she's got a
drawer my makeup table full of oh man
it's Elena could you tell me a little
bit about what you think you're most in
need of right now in terms of anything
new so I can put some special focus on
that like is it base stuff brow stuff
lips
I've never been totally thrilled with
the brow uh-huh things that I've tried
there's what I'm using right now I'd say
it does as good as anything I've tried
oh the goof proof brow pencil from
benefit is what she's got in shade three
okay
what else did she have in here you've
got the superhero mascara and lash
paradise
these are exactly what I've been using
that one but what about soup that's what
I'm gonna do next oh good have you tried
the lash paradise you know these two are
waiting
okay good this is one about done and
this I've been enjoying for going over
my eyebrows oh yeah those employees yeah
what have you been using on your brows
pip I'm using so tell me Mom what thank
for in the end of the eye oh it's a
little it cosmetics ensel yeah what do
you mean edge of the eye
no right in here Oh outer outer like a
bit of definition yes and this I don't
know what I'm doing with that in there I
haven't really I have one of those and I
didn't like I didn't like it oh I kind
of keep it over here then this is my 20
time magnifier that a person cannot
stand to look into and this is the
special 20 times yes and it is
practically distorted I mean you have to
what do you use the 20 times for what
type of tasks require the 20 time mega
for the reason I did it was because when
I went back home back to the old house
mm-hmm
I took this one and left it I can't find
them in the stores this particular
magnification okay all they're showing
you is this alright and it's just so you
have to get just so and it seems like it
distorts okay so now you take this one
well not everywhere I go this it's ten
times enough I think it's just about
right
okay in other words you can't stand this
is yourself any more deeply than 10
times and 10 times is depressing but mom
you're doing it because you where
readers norm
like to look up close so just do my
eyebrows to put on my lipstick this is
five just the this makeup mirror to flip
around and it's not it's just not enough
anymore and I do need readers in the top
number yeah so it's really simple I have
to think about I know currently using
the Too Faced Born This Way concealer I
use very little eyes shadows right now I
just I'm kind of busy here's my powders
I use this L'Oreal I hate to tell you
but I use a baby powder I know you use a
baby powder it smoothes the tackiness
like this this morning are your worship
as you put on your your makeup it's nice
but if I tried to put on some blush I
think it would be kind of streaky or
wouldn't look normal so I go over I just
feel like we could do with a better of a
mint for your next powder gave me that
well then I go over it with this you
know I I do my neck and my forehead you
use that this is what I have not been
using and you gave me that I think
Russia's roll out of this what is it
like he's got a peachy tart oh my gosh
oh my gosh
mm-hmm viewers and are you satisfied and
I'm heading into that one but I felt
like it was a little rosier but that's
okay you can and she's always liked a
peachy Wow so that's a little dark
okay whoa give you maybe another option
but I don't think you need to be there I
like that one your highlighter the laura
mercier guys it's the candle glow in one
and I gave her my little AOA studio
brush because I thought that really
mimics the size that I like I think it
targets the product where you want it
she's been using this this is subtle
gloww subtle but buildable and you don't
want too much and sometimes in different
lighting like it I think it looks good
mom I'm seeing a little Sheen there's we
could go even more you could go you end
the Knicks doing things but you also
have one of these which is good
prep and prime yeah the lavender okay
colors I never get to you're a hardcore
user of the outlast from cover I roll of
some of these shades of lipstick you've
given me they will end up you know I've
got to do quite a bit of work so what do
you tend to do you'll put you'll start
the day with an outlast yes and then do
sometimes layer up not not too much she
says this 570 when my papaya my papaya
is her signature shade good to have the
space to have a little overflow and
we're not seeking to get everything out
but I'll just pull some things that I
think could be beneficial alright we'll
see you guys bye bye we'll see you a
little bit alright guys I've gone
through the drawer I've picked some
things out we're even gonna declutter a
few things all right I'm done what we
didn't point out was that she uses the
secret sauce not just talking about your
secrets yeah your secret sauces okay
secret sauce and then the CC cream she
wears the shade fair in that that's like
everyday kind of morning yes her
coverage and moisturization underneath
okay first off this little brush said
yes I feel like these might be perfect
for some of your needs mom powder this
to blend your concealer okay
padding in karate learn around your eye
like that's a good size too can I fit
that eye area okay I like that um this I
know sometimes don't you kind of smudge
an eyeliner it's small it's like a
smudger yeah when she kind of likes to
sometimes take a little something and
you kind of need to work it out you
could use it with a powder or to blend
out that pencil that you're using this
is just a very basic like I just want to
throw a little something around the eye
area and then this we're kind of combing
through the brows is just a general
spoolie brush I mean you might have this
on the end of other products but that
would be very nice to keep together
I found this concealer this buy buy
under I remember pot from it cosmetics
and light it seems like it would be a
really good shade
I'm not saying you really need a lot of
insanely new it's not a it's never been
a real big thing for me over the years I
think it's maybe my skin color something
about this it's a good coverage product
and I feel like you could just dab it on
your inner mouth I would wonder and also
here I tend to have a little like a
little depression okay
well that can be kind of brightening and
maybe just something that you want to
try against your more liquidy doe foot
applicator concealers also this this
seems like it had been used and put back
in the box this is a fantastic powder I
don't think it was by me this is the
hello flawless powder from benefit and
this is a very good coverage just take
your finger on that and feel the
smoothness nice like it's really smooth
when would you have me I think you could
use that as a coverage product in itself
if you don't use the CC cream someday
and you want to like blend it in all
over for powder foundation also just use
that as like your setting powder you so
you want to smooth things out before you
would put blush or a highlighter on it
that would be good truck just give it a
don't run like that one there I don't
remember that but I have so many things
in there also this here from cover FX
this is a little sample size I found of
their loose powder and there weren't
hardly any loose powders sitting around
in that drawer this was the only one
because we talked about baby powder and
maybe there's something that I think
could be an even kinder to your skin
than that I'd like you to just try this
this is a sample size there don't feel
bad about just using it and if you end
up liking that type of thing I mean
their other grainy when watching the
laura mercier the Maybelline fit me
loose powders I think are very good but
this is a lot like it and I think you
should just just one day try that
instead of where you put baby powder and
just see how it goes and how it looks I
don't know if you've ever looked at this
but this is from it cosmetics moment
it's got a little bit of a bronzer a
blush that I truly think would be an
appropriate shade and also it's got a
little highlight at the end mmm yeah
another option it might be a little more
pronounced than the
another one that I gave you yes I like
those three the other things that are
going on here in the middle of the bunch
are a couple of brow products I wanted
to ask you if you've never used this one
here there's this Stila stay all day and
it is another marker type thing did you
know that this is a marker oh yeah I
think I remember buying that for you on
ulties website a while back and it's a
subtle seeming blonde kind of cool I'd
like to hear how that performs against
the Milani this is from the balm and
this is called ferocious brow pencil in
blonde look at how fine the tip is on
them okay nice well and the last thing
sitting right here this lipstick now I
know you're a die-hard into your
covergirl outlast but if there are days
if there is ever a day month that you
don't want to use that and you just want
something that feels more like a lip
balm and you're really not caring too
much about how the wear goes that is
from L'Oreal it's called color riche
shine and can you flip it over so I can
see the shade name sparkling rose really
fruity so what do you think Nana what do
you think about the rest of the stuff
that's still in there except there are
three things these are so own I remember
these lipsticks you got you've got to
let these go I don't even want to tell
people how old those are but you on the
upside mom you didn't really need me to
declutter anything in there everything
that was in there everything left in
that drawer I think is usable it's okay
it's fine but then like these I think
maybe you brought them from the from the
old town safe travels here when you
there - there - I
some lip products a creamy product like
we can't we can't keep those online I
did pick up some things from the old
house and I well I think we need to put
those in there yeah no it's not healthy
proof that your mom is old school we
always in the out boys yes it's a
special edition Love Actually yes I had
one that actually the hinges broke and I
had to go this one cuz I got to keep it
but I thought I've got to use that so
might whooping yes yes she's just the
nicest little girl ever okay gang I just
had a major brush cleaning session here
look at all those shiny clean brushes
whoo even the white ones my word I am so
proud those looks so nice these really
dense brushes from Sigma even the little
ones sometimes those can be tough to get
super duper clean but I usually will be
clean my brushes at the sink but today I
used my fast option here my cinema
secrets makeup brush cleaner nothing
cleans the brushes faster than this and
makes them dry faster too so if you're
in a time struggle in a pinch and you
really need them quick and able to be
used again soon the stuff you put a
little bit in a glass and then you
literally just wipe it off onto a paper
towel and you wipe wipe wipe wipe wipe
until no more makeup is showing up on
your paper towel and some of these were
quite dirty and now they are just
pristine so yeah it's nap time right now
so this is what I'm doing you ever get a
wild hair about something
oh you call it a wild hair bulletin all
right well my most recent wild hair came
about when I was thinking about doing a
cheese board and I guess I just seen
some people showing like pictures on
Instagram where it looks so appealing
like a fun little way to to eat some
cheeses and and wines and fruits and
stuff and I thought I want to do that so
I got one off of Amazon and that came
it's adorable I'll show it to you when
we get home and but then Bob and I
started talking and didn't we have the
idea at the exact same moment actually
about Aldi and we're like let's see if
we can take this bougie little idea and
make it an Aldi thing and because
because our all-day here in town you
know they sell wine so we started using
bougie in everyday conversation but like
wouldn't it be fun to see if we could
come up with all the components of that
just like real quick running out to all
these much more cost-effective we've got
a fifteen dollar Amazon cheese board at
home then we're gonna try to fix it up
with stuff from all the and we're gonna
get sovaldi wine that's right pair it
with someone's how you doing back there
a little presh
you're doing good how's Betty doing not
crying or anything all right
Lupita crackers
Cecil they have Triscuits original did
you sit there thin
just some kids in a wine section no big
deal people actually probably add this
video is not sponsored by anybody
not all me not this sweet little thing
here that I got from Amazon I think this
is so cute it's got all your little
things here it's it's there but this is
kind of what we ended up with from Aldi
we got a couple of the lines say please
but we got a Pinot Grigio we got this
red wine that bub saw was rated pretty
high there and yeah this is just fun
like we're gonna have probably when we
assemble it we're gonna keep it kind of
pared down like we're just gonna cut off
small chunks of stuff here what for two
people but it'll give us sort of an idea
for like the next time we've got a
little shindig little gathering over
here what we can do so we got some pita
crackers and some Triscuits and pretzel
chips got the prosciutto and the
bite-size salami ended up with buda brie
and this rustic red cheddar some honey a
couple kinds of Olives I really like
olives and some pears we already had the
grapes
mmm that helped the damsel in distress
dude before we got into all day poor
lady had a huge box she was trying to
carry and couldn't get it buck was gonna
collapse an owner took care of business
good job so check the receipt because we
got some other things and all that stuff
was about 50 to 55 bucks wine included
with two bottles of wine included suds
I've never had all the wine cuz I think
the last time we bought it I was
probably nursing and pregnant but you've
like two different kinds of triger
they've got some like 87 89.1
for less than $10
yes what one book can you say mama love
can you say Dada Dada love can you say
baekje love oh can I have a kiss yeah
that your tongue tangy dang she says
love whoa
please excuse whatever my ears doing
back there well we haven't blogged a lot
today we've got a main objective and
that is putting together that's a big
advocate for taste testing is that
doesn't seem you fishing dad we've been
working our tails off today it's been
non-stop
types of things did you do do you think
you want to do it again sometime
it was that night and for everyone yeah
we had showers as well it's the moment
we've been waiting for all day we just
want to assemble this game cheese board
very minimal dinner and preparation for
this so yeah we're gonna kind of get the
stuff out to get it ready to go and
we'll take you along as we assemble the
board
incorporate more for shooting them every
aspect of noise within like sweep
tensions a little bit at depending
matters to me
so here's our adorable finished cheese
board bub you want to take us on a
little tour of what got actually put on
here sure we have some sliced pears
mm-hmm some prosciutto which will be
around some dry aged cheddar her pete
nessip occurs some salami grapes sweet
potato chips we thought those look cool
I think that's a fun character for this
very aesthetically pleasing grapes Gouda
or prosciutto futures some
jalapeno-stuffed almost blue cheese
stuffed awesome black olives some Brie
and everything so sorry I am so excited
that's ready to post will contend with
this
mmm wrapping the brie and the prosciutto
okay and how much fun is this gonna be
like the next time we do something here
you know we're gonna sit something like
this out we can make it bigger we can do
different varieties of things now what
do you think about the wine it was
pretty good it was like a $6 88 89
points very good hmm try some of that
Gouda I hear another episode where I'm
Marshall and Lily and Barney and Robin
over mm-hmm as couples for the first
time as couples and they're super
awkward even though they're home at like
thousands of times before and Marshall
just keeps handing her like offering up
tray and they don't sleep wasn't this
Gouda these are really crunchy mm-hmm
