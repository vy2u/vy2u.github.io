I'm just making a little Hamburger
Helper literally yes
Hamburger Helper I had a pound of ground
turkey that I wanted to use I didn't
really know what to do and then I had
this in the cupboard it's the crunchy
taco it's actually really good but we
haven't had this stuff in ages so I
thought now's the time I'm chatting with
you at the end of the day on Monday
because this morning was kind of busy we
had preschool screening for nugget Nikki
Bella whatever her name went very well
the guy who was doing her language
skills said she was amazing it was a
good morning but my hamburger helpers
just bubbling away over here this is
crunchy taco Hamburger Helper made with
Turkey I did burn it although that's
never happened before I don't know
what's going on I did cook it in a
bigger pan than they advised and they're
like okay cover it simmer it for 20
minutes that's exactly how it sounds on
the back of the box and so I do that and
I check it you know like a conscientious
cook and the whole thing is like stuck
to the bottom does have a nice smoky
smoky I don't do that I think I caught
it just before the situation got really
bad I figured I would have tasted it
because you can see the black Tuesday
everyone this one wanted to wake up
early so I had my eye makeup coming up
here with me kid she's just going
through a little basket of items they're
just sorting through don't work I mean
while just try to the backtalk palette
which you saw briefly um the day it came
in and I've been neat playing with the
blushes on and off in this thing for a
little while but was only just now able
to experiment with an eye look with this
for the first time so I'm very happy
with it I love these kinds of colors
there's only one really dark shade in
here so that sometimes can limit the
versatility but like I said just my
first look so I'll know what I think
about it a little more I think after a
couple more looks and I see
how different I can make them maybe also
I'd like to point out I'm always
pleasantly surprised by this guy my
garden avb the one for oily combo skin
light medium that coverage is always
nicer than I anticipated so and stuffs
getting knocked around so I noticed some
questions in the last vlog about what
exactly the vlogging camera is that I'm
using and so this is what it is I can
link to this bundle or whatever it is
below but I like that it did come with
the memory card like a little tripod
little case and basically everything you
need and I am loving this camera so far
because it's exactly what I wanted I
wanted something simple that I could
easily like hold it in my hand had the
flip around screen just turn it on with
a couple buttons no messing with
focusing and everything like that so
it's a very good uncomplicated but I
think good quality camera so love it
also here's a little teaser here's
something to look forward to on the vlog
we're going to take Belle to C Mulan Jr
that is gonna be so fun so live it in
person on stage me and Tyler and her are
gonna make a little date of it this
Friday we're gonna go out to eat first
and then go see the show I think she is
going to absolutely love it she really
gets into any sort of life music we've
taken her to see and I think this will
just take the cake and it'll be younger
kids like not tiny kids but it's like a
youth young people theater group in the
area that's putting it on so I think she
will really get a kick out of this I
think this little Miss is gonna hang out
with Nana while we do that the best
thing because it's gonna be like 7
o'clock when the show starts and I know
Belle can totally you know handle that
things are kind of winding down in
Biddy's world around that time der
mantel situation here now I got these
bunnies I like to put these up every
year because I think they are so
stinking cute and I got them from Target
probably two years ago and I don't
remember how I managed to hang these
before I would like them to hang down
lower you know kind of drape a bit
then what every time I try to do that
they flop like the the bunnies don't lay
so you can actually tell their bunnies
so I had to pull in a little tighter so
they kind of stick there I don't want to
like adhere them to the fireplace or
anything but I'd like it to look like a
little bit more of a casual low-slung
drapey action there I also would get
some different chairs in this room these
are just kind of like old little bar
stool chairs what you're finding is
nobody's gonna mess them up and I don't
have to be worried about them but we've
got some sort of plans to revamp this
little side room in the future can you
say hi hi hi how are you today okay
on this Wednesday I'm peeking at you a
beacon yeah bell bell yeah I tell you
what nothing wakes you up on a Wednesday
morning like here in the garbage truck
starting to go by your house and
remembering that you did not take the
garbage down so I hear it going by and
before it picks up on our side of the
street it goes all the way down and
around the cul-de-sac in the back and so
I knew I had a couple minutes like thank
goodness I heard it going past I was
like oh the garbage isn't out so I
hauled ass down there with the garbage
hands and we got like a steep incline to
our driveway and it's a little bit long
and so the really heavy full garbage can
darn near toppled me over but I got it
down there and now the garbage went out
don't you love those little thrills
early in the morning at least they came
conveniently after I finished my
Instagram live which was fun I just did
that impromptu style I didn't know if
I'd had the time or if Biddy would stay
sleeping long enough for me to actually
do it but she did
someone was looking over my shoulder as
I was editing the part of the video
regarding the trashcans
he would like to issue a rebuttal so
yeah I forgot to put the trash cans down
on Tuesday night which is what I usually
do owning it good but the reason that I
didn't frantically run down to bring the
cans down was because I was naked at the
time I had just I was just walking out
up the stairs from technically you were
in a tent in a towel and it appeared to
be very cold outside so I did not want
to cause that scene of me sprinting in a
towel down our driveway see here on the
blog we want to give you the full story
we don't want to just make one-sided
accounts of situations we want to allow
people to come on and clear the air
clear the air okay avoid any issues any
harsh critic fortunately bub I'm no
damsel in distress you know I'm capable
strong woman
that's right able to take those cans
down that's right successfully she don't
need no man to take her trash cans down
we're gonna go over to Nana and Papa's
house for a little bit today have a
little playtime over there I'm very
excited because I have a new bookcase
set to come in we've kind of outgrown
the smaller bookshelf over here and not
to mention the fact that like Bob and I
have books that we would like to keep on
a bookshelf so basically this this
bookshelf over here sorry I can't be
bothered to stand over this bookshelf
I've just gotten an identical wood and
we're gonna scoop that down and and just
kind of butt them up side-by-side I'll
be able to have a spot for the bigger
kid books and you know just other stuff
and books you can never go wrong with
the bookshelf like you will never regret
a bookshelf purchase because you can put
countless things in there it's a Better
Homes and Gardens book case and I really
like the one that I had but I thought
Walmart's not selling those anymore I
mean I got that almost two years ago
probably and then lo and behold I look
online they have it she's got a
monologue going on over there she loves
to get behind that little toy tub and
just chill there she desperately wants
to be talking full sentences right now I
did shoot a video also before the live
on this look so this will go up on
Saturday but anyway I'm gonna go play
with a little bit we'll check in later
here's Nana they hike to the find people
watching the vlog we're here at the
peach room it's very cute we've got some
artwork here by aunt puff aka Kellie
Eddington got some you know Disney
cuteness I found these at Target and I
thought they were so cute the way they
were kind of sketched looking and we
loved the Disney Princesses we also love
this quote from Cinderella hi Pippi how
are you doing Pippi Pippi basically
loves me she thinks I'm really an
exciting person to see although I don't
know why but I know I've shown some
snippets of this room on like my
snapchat and this and that but the story
the previous owners use this as a
nursery ride was already painted peach
and just so happens to be pretty perfect
for a couple little kids in here so they
got the pack and ploy and you're justing
KACE little table and chairs this thing
folds out actually to be a neat little
like sort of a twin-sized lays real down
low on the floor type bed which would be
perfect for Nikki to sleep on sometime
still want to say hi to the vlog you
never know when you're gonna walk into a
room in your own house and be fishing a
hot dog so here's a Nana and Papa's
house store this is a little entryway

special someone back here are you gonna

very excited about this
Oh bub did you hear the Easter egg hunt

it's gonna be really rainy tomorrow so
they're gonna have it on Sunday
are you somebody was offended in the
last vlog that I had did not have Loyola
going further but I am here to tell you
that I'm wholeheartedly rooting for them
as I have adopted them as my special
team actually we are SIU fans we always
and si use conference we've got a
support you know an MVC team that's
still in the tournament and they're a
fabulous team we're very good we got
nothing but respect for some one person
yeah so yeah we are definitely hoping
they go all the way I mean our brackets
are screwed our practice got screwed a
long time ago actually it even helps SIU
because there's a revenue sharing
program with the valley so that's that
you makes money
the further lawyer goes interesting she

special little coat on she's got on a
dress she packed her purse she requested
tinted lip balm
I mean girlfriends got it together I'm
just gonna eat here
because then when they're from 2014
I am so excited about laundry I can't
even tell you how excited
Oh
very low light situation here but just
want to give you the real reaction after
this this was so much fun during the
intermission Nikki stopped and said this
is the best night ever they were so good
nobody in the thing older than 18 Oh
incredible I thought acting and singing
I mean they were harmonizing and just
well they were they're doing
choreography with those bow staff things
and singing at the same time like
perfect it was so much fun to see all
night you're staying up all night
uh-uh non-stop entertainment I didn't
feel like there were low low or anything
and oh I loved okay you guys know if you
watch Mulan you know about the Avalanche
that takes out the Huns and they I
thought brilliantly like took this sheet
across it and they kind of like played
with the lighting a little bit - that
made it seem kind of like crazy and
something was going down but they pulled
this sheet over the Huns army that they
have there and I thought you know how
else on a stage would you give the
effect of an avalanche like it was so
good we loved it so way to go art starts
good morning friends Saturday morning
just got my video posted it is a rainy
Saturday around here full face of makeup
revolution is up so happy about it I
played with the new Bobby Brown Krystal
drama palette on my eyes today kind of
like it although it's giving me vibes of
the Too Faced white peach because of
just a few little kind of cool by lucky
tones mixed with a little bit of yellow
a peachy warmth it's kind of interesting
I do like the quality of those shadows
thinking about doing like a new palette
roundup type video at some point here
but I just got to go to Walmart to get
just like everything you know you have
those shopping trips or it's like I need
a few things just a little shopping
I need like everything everything kind
of started to run out at the same time
set milk I've got a lot of milk but
literally everything else I need so
gonna go take care of that bubs watching
the ladies so off we go
Bob what's up what's you're working on
today here gonna sue me some chicken
wings what have you done here these are
just salted and peppered
then this is still heating up but it's
okay to put them in there this is the
water man subete style is what's
happening here y'all I don't know how
familiar everyone is with this but this
was something Tyler got for Christmas a
couple Christmases ago I think and it's
pretty much changed the way he thinks of
meat how to cook meat the tenderness of
it all different kinds it's really
raised your standard doesn't it yeah
it's pretty much the only way I make
meat now
you can cook it at the perfect
temperature temperature control you can
have a basically your whole steak is
completely medium-rare top to bottom
then you just kind of finish it in a pan
I'm gonna grill really hot it's just
easier just control so this is the first
time you've done the wings so how long
will they stay you're gonna do them at
1:58 actually I might be I need to
double-check that temperature but just
for two to four hours
yeah
okay what just happened here is bub his
sous vide the wings how long three hours
or so at about 158 okay then took him
out they were is still in their ice bath
still in the pouches then was kept him
in the fridge until they were ready to
cook only put them in the airfryer for a
total of 13 minutes they look pretty
good
wait there's a big storm at the castle
alright well we'll talk about that in a
moment
meanwhile he talked the wings in some
sweet baby Ray's wing songs okay and
they're pretty darn good
no like maybe a little bit more crust
but the meat is fantastic
like really tender and every time better
than you'll get not some of this
business on a fork because I got to keep
my fingers somewhat clean to operate my
precious camera but the tenderness
comes off the bone like just falling off
the bone as pup would say fot be falling
off the bone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
