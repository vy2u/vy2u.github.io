as a guest of makeup revolutions to the
Alta GMC it's the general managers
conference for Alta so it's a huge event
they basically invited me to go with
them so I'm going what does
Tyrannosaurus Rex do stomp stomp
no wait I'm going to Houston you are
actually going to be at home
we just left early this morning and the
first task on my home with these two is
to get metal dressed and have some
breakfast so
so far I have achieved that Bell is not
up yeah a ton of the calm before the
storm you're just waiting for Sioux City
then trying to bury all right Nikki what
have we done today so far really and
what did you do at the office did you
get a present oh who gave that to you
yeah market but too young did you say
thank you then what's there we're going
to Sam's Club right let's go
okay so it's lunchtime and this little
kid just refused to eat until I put her
bib on I forgot to put it on and then
you she pointed at it and I was probably
sitting Buddha sitting in front of her
for like three minutes she hadn't
touched it I thought she just wasn't
hungry and now she's going to town just
needed to have her bib on first how's
your lunch going
I made it to Houston every what I said
it was gonna vlog and now I'm here and
I've got my complimentary beer first
hotel I've ever checked into that says
we're offering complimentary beer just
for checking in here's my outfit of the
day a little travel glam a little
jumpsuit room is super nice they said I
was supposed to have one bed but I'm
here way way early um like way before
check-in so they're like do you want to
so you can get in now I'm not sure
bathroom lighting kind of leaving
something to be desired here but we'll
work with it and it looks like this is
the prime place to stay if you are a
Houston Astros fan because Minute Maid
Park is right across the way so I really
hadn't eaten anything yet today so I'm
starving and it's like 2:00 in the
afternoon wait I did have a granola bar
really early today and some pretzels
Huntington but I got this Frito pie
brisket Frito pie it is so so delicious
I'm at the Marriott Marquis in downtown
Houston they're treating me right folks
it's all I can say I feel like this is a
very appropriate filter right now but no
I was up at 3:00 because I had to drive
an hour get on a little plane fly up to
Chicago get on big plane fly down to
Houston yeah let's just cover my eyes
but thank you so much to makeup
revolution for having me as their guest
at this event this is gonna be so fun
tomorrow that's the day I'll be at the
conference which is kind of like right
across the street from the hotel so
that's exciting
Suns coming up in Houston got my rollers
in got my breakfast ordered got my
makeup pretty much on except for the lip
which is a big factor with today's look
cuz I think it's gonna be red but it's
gonna be a big day here's my finished
look for this morning another jumpsuit
easy enough to wear problem is I'm not
fully zipped in the back yet so I'm
gonna have to find someone out the
hallway to help me there but I also
really felt I needed to wear flats today
I think it's gonna be a long day I do
have a bunion I do have hip issues so I
just I need the flats this is kind of a
classic look I like to go for sometimes
the red lip the full false lash but not
too dark otherwise on the eye and then
my kind of classic Bush hairdo
and gone for a few days
the Houston and we have a bit of a
backlog of PR packages
there's some stuff stuck on the bottom
urban decay we've got some mascaras
they're different colors I guess and
what are these like eyebrow pencils
that's nice 1 for 7 glide on so that's
it seems to glide on oh yeah see that's
like a purple makeup setting spray so I
guess kind of like hair spray for your
face that's what I would describe
well tarts friends and family sound like
a rewards program or something special
code holy cow it looks a little small
even on a normal medium-sized person
that's very short was this the
sweatpants
now we're talking okay this little
number shiny bling alligator pattern on
it I'm sure different shades they smell
awesome
I got me hungry the toasted palate
tardes Pro Glo double doors on that one
like the feel of the outside of these
it's like some tacky you know hold
something sliding off lights camera
lashes a cigar-holder mascara doesn't
come out of the sheath I guess on marble
lipstick seems to work appropriately la
colors it's not a brand that I'm very
familiar with obviously target urban
decay right my wheelhouse and
illuminating skin enhancer light
reflecting drops over here they come
this there's like a little eyedropper in
there yeah
he's dropping out you know look it makes
my skin look better I like that tone I
guess you can go with all kinds of
different shades
zip it on up alright looks like we got
something from Smashbox and Nicole
conceal oh I don't know her but it
appears that she likes oranges and music
and photography where all the citrus on
here
buy more water collaboration with
Smashbox hydrates preps and sets yes
that would be about the first thing you
do right moisturize first I really neat
box though you have to give it a few
priming pumps refreshing I'll try the
other ones later got slightly damaged in
shipping tech of a lot of pencils
they even include plenty of sharpener
those are different sizes or just need
multiple sharpener so how that works are
you gonna help all the way from white to
black and everything in between flashy
tones and then to some purple what's
that peach transition into red and then
purple and then some deeper Purple's
can't see anything that they're missing
when this one's a reverse lipliner I
guess it's just backwards or something
I'm gonna go on a limb and say this has
something to do with a brow product over
the counter that's a fanny pack does
everybody like my orange hoodie with my
reddish or see if they've included is
enough girth on this fanny pack for me
just empty upfront good place to keep
your wallet your keys fan fax you know
you get kind of a bad rap but I can see
how this would be like super useful also
operates really good as a birth control
device see they got the colors on top I
mean it seems like you're gonna have
pretty outrageous eyebrows whichever one
of these you'd go with
I don't pay probably not something I'm
gonna wear on a daily basis might be
something I'll wear for my next driver's
license picture so everyone I am back
I've returned home after my trip and
something we said we wanted to do is go
through some of these comments I just
want to hit you with a few of these
comments that people have been giving on
the video about your driver's license
now let me preface this by saying I
think that many of them are laughing
with you not at you you're fully aware
that it's not a good picture right it's
a terrible picture
alright maybe the worst with driver's
license picture of all times he looks
like they hit him with a hot cattle
prong I could see that I didn't expect
that license photo to be that bad
then I died when I saw this a mug shot
picture right there or commit a crime
because on everybody will see that
picture and a student that I definitely
did it okay I'm currently sneaking and
watching this at work and I totally lost
it when bub showed his license I'm
crying and people are asking me if I'm
okay
literally hundreds of come on about your
driver's license but how do you feel
that much I just hope I don't become a
mean
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
