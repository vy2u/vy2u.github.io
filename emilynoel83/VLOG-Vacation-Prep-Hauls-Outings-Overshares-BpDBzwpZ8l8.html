vlogging to kick off this week's blog
we've had part of my door come apart and
Nana is coming up with some little fix
here she's a carpenter in her spare time
Papa what did you actually buy from the
store for this thing I real sure because
all the directions were in size 1/2 font
and you can read them without it's crap
done it's craft time carpenter when she
grows up she's watching mana with much
admiration the deal is here that this is
gonna be fixed like we had the
appointment with the people who will be
eventually fixing it but in assessing
the situation the people who are fixing
it gave their assessment of the
situation I think that loosened it some
and caused it to kind of come apart in
the meantime cause you can't just snap
your fingers and have to fix it people
come and get it all perfect
the temporary fix is what's happening
now what she's some more some more goop
isn't working yes she doesn't know if
you had some duct tape or athletic tape
or something we can maybe tape the board
so that you know well know well that's
the glue is drying please can I get some
tape and tape that up while the glue is
drying
[Laughter]
carpentry backgrounds are apparently
more extensive lit up bar never been
good at fixing anything I usually make
it worse middles trying to pick up some
stuff Oh daddy here's a tip Nana I got a
tip for you it's a literal tip actually
not a not a advice tip that's the tip
but he doesn't know what to think the
cutest well how are you doing that so
I'm on my way to an outdoor inspection
for a case that I've got and this is
what the weather is like right now yes
that is snow
this is not gonna be fun hello everyone
really exciting stuff happening
community broadcasted quarters today I
am doing a collaboration video with Jen
from Jen loves reviews so I had dinner
with her last night it was so much fun I
just feel like I can relate to her so
much I see eye to eye with her on so
many things so she had the idea to do
this months back and there are a lot of
people raising their hands to say hey
can I come to Southern Illinois and do a
video with you but she did she said that
heart of gold on this one so she's
coming over to my house this morning to
the makeup room we're gonna shoot a
couple of videos one for each of our
channels and I'll keep you posted on
social media as to when those will be
showing up for you guys to see but I've
redone my setup here to make it like a
two person a two person set if you will
so I've spread out my lights a little
bit I've backed up my camera I've got a
little like table here I thought she can
kind of have that whole desk side
because she's got some fun plans for one
of these videos where I think you know
she can use that I pulled out this
little like TV tray for myself here I've
got some materials in that caboodle that
she told me to get ready but yeah I
think this is gonna be awesome it's fun
to have you know a special guest in
towns and she is very special if you are
not familiar with Jen loves reviews you
need to look up her channel subscribe
and then you know you can thank me later
hey good morning everyone today bill and
I are going to the dentist I have a
checkup and this will be her first
appointment so they said that she should
come and kind of watch me get it done
and then it'll be her turn
so got plenty of books for her to look
at how are you gonna open your mouth
alright you passed the test you're in
good morning guys how about here really
undone laundry room chat Saturday
morning I'm realizing I really haven't
vlogged much this week like again you
know it's gonna I'm going in for when I
prop the elbow somewhere it has just
been a week a week of a lot of activity
starting off with Monday like first
thing in the morning
I had a doctor's appointment just like
it was a sort of a one-month but coming
really not one year but coming very late
you know several months late like
doctor's checkup at my ob/gyn I'm
definitely not pregnant but this is just
like a standard checkup and I get there
and they're like oh no your appointments
actually been cancelled we had tried to
call but your voicemail was full then I
had this whole revelation about deleted
messages on your iPhone that actually
like apparently have to be erased
because I was diligently getting rid of
things and they were all staying on my
phone so there's that but I had gotten
all these like confirmation texts and
stuff leading up to the appointment so I
just kind of assumed the appointment was
on you know but whatevs it was off so I
come right back home and then by evening
I got to go out and eat with Jen from
Jen loves reviews because she's in town
to do like a couple of collab videos
with me here in my makeup room and so we
did that and
I would have looking back I would have
loved to have logged like a little bit
that night but at the same time I'm so
glad I fully enjoyed that moment like I
was in it and we just talked like we
must have been dinner for several hours
but it could have gone on way way longer
that was such a good night it was like I
don't know I felt like I was talking to
a person I'd known for years and it's
there's this odd feeling with youtubers
where you watch them and you do kind of
feel like you know them but yet we were
talking about things that were so
outside the realm of just you know
beauty YouTube videos I enjoy her so
much and I told her then when we shot
the videos the next morning she came
over here it's like I need to vlog about
this and I told her I had my camera here
and what I do completely forgot to pick
up the camera and vlog although we will
have two amazing videos to show you of
what we did together but I didn't mean
to vlog that day and again we just got
caught up talking but Jen is seriously
wonderful she puts a ton of work into
her channel you see you know day in and
day out all the things that she's
posting and just all that super
informative makeup content but cupcakes
scratching it's something she probably
pooped outside the litter box and that's
why she's going to the vet today Tyler's
taking her I'm gonna leave more of that
story for him to tell but what I was
trying to say about Jen is that you know
her you know from a youtube stance and
what she's doing here and all the
informative wonderful content she's
bringing as a as a person she is just
absolutely lovely
but can I tell you about the amount of
makeup room cleanup I did ahead of this
visit that she made I told her I was
like it's never been this clean never
ever like and I do have some stuff
stashed under a chair and perhaps under
a desk but like I got my act in gear
knowing she was coming and I spent
probably a full week just on and off
because you know I can't I've got kids
here I can't I can't take a whole day
and do make up room so bits and pieces
every day for about a week I got that
under control
anyway um there's a lot of there's a lot
of behind the scenes work to you know
make my room feel acceptable for Jen I
wanted it to be good for Jen I don't
think I had actually any scheduled stuff
on Wednesday but then by Thursday
we had bells first dentist appointment
and she was really excited to go she
they set her in the chair and were
showing her like all the tools and gave
all the tools funny nicknames and she
touched them all and you know like I
think she was kind of into it and then
it came time for them to really get down
in there and do some cleaning and she
freaked out a little bit she didn't like
cry or have the meltdown which was
entirely possible it didn't come to that
they were just like oh you know we we
this is sort of what we expect for the
first appointment just kind of
familiarize them with the room and what
we do and just sort of be in the
environment a little bit more than
anything so they thought it was pretty
much par for the course she said from
what they could see cuz they took her a
little mirror in there and did some
picking around on all her teeth and
stuff they said everything looked really
good that night we had gymnastics and
then yesterday was just like finishing
up video stuff because I was a little
off video schedule wise this week I
didn't get anything posted I had my vlog
Monday which was very very late on
Monday in case you missed that didn't
get a video posted Tuesday instead put
it up on Wednesday because just all of
our activities between me and Jen here
Tuesday so I posted Wednesday Thursday I
hear little footsteps somebody's awake
and somebody's found me I stepped in the
room with juice put some deodorant on
there did I catch you in the middle of
something were you not expected to see a
show going on here in the laundry room
I'm gonna let bud tell the full story
about why that's all I'm gonna say so I
think the point that I never got to
there on my little monologue in the
laundry room was that I'm making up for
lost time today for not getting a lot of
blog and got throughout the week so you
guys see some really mundane stuff it's
all kind of just everyday life I mean
happen here on the vlog nothing too
glamorous but but it's gonna be real
down and dirty today cuz I'm gonna try
to get the camera out a lot
are you done with your play yeah we've
got a whole like little people community
happening here you put somebody on the
slide you guys get your house all set up
don't you he sticks in right now look at
this
right so I'm about to take cupcake into
the Vette cupcake has a little bit of a
problem where she needs to have her anal
glands expressed every so often and yes
I'm I'm sure it's as horrible as it
sounds and we have pretty medicated her
with something to calm her apparently
she doesn't like having someone stick a
finger in her butt so we're gonna run in
there
should be a pretty quick procedure she's
gonna feel better after hopefully and
stop pooping on the
you say hi
we're back here have any situations you
need to update a song okay so really
activities brought cupcake into the vet
they said she did just fine expressed
just perfectly was in and out real quick
I had to take the van in this here van
to be serviced and then they got there
they said there are a couple of recalls
they need to look at as well so it ended
up taking about two and a half hours but
they had a really nice waiting area and
had a TV at the Cardinals game I had my
laptop so I worked for the whole time it
really wasn't that bad it's productive
two and a half hours and now we are on
our way out to get some dinner with
everybody here we need to get stocked up
on things for our trip we are going to
Destin for a week and we can't friggin
word it's gonna be so fun
dinner check and target check we he was
trying to get out of there without
paying for his beloved Lacroix which
let's open up the comment section for
discussion on that who likes it who
doesn't like it I could go either way I
think it's ok I don't love it we were
doing self-checkout and he forgot but
then he a local couple and their two
children are arrested for shoplifting at
Target tried to steal two eight packs of
Lacroix he relates to it so much well
you are legally blond but you like
better but legally blonde one or two so
we went to target we got some things
that our trip related i also saw this in
the one spot area and i thought it was
so cute I'm like I'm gonna just get this
for myself for Mother's Day just to
ensure that I get that I got a couple of
sunscreens that I think Bob and I could
also use here SPF 50 with the spray and
also the spreadable kind some very cool
sunglasses
I really have wanted heart sunglasses
for a while and I finally found those I
also got some that Bell or Yves could
wear a cute little bow belt a little Sun
Hat from last year still fits her but
he's just too small now so I got that
and then just a couple of kind of
bumming around t-shirt type things for
nugget here I got her a trolls one and
we know she loves Peppa so I got those
two I got three T just for longevity
sake and a lot of things I think at is
he is working for right now but I think
that'll be okay also we got these sweet
little cover-up things for both of them
they are so precious they tried them on
last night and they looked super cute
nice but
real pleased at Target last night with
the kid
swimsuit selection so I went off to
Walmart today and I took care of that we
will cut to a little fashion show right
now montage
also took care of some other essentials
at Walmart with the trip and mine fold
up wagon thing we saw somebody down
there with one of these last year and
they put you know all the beach toys the
tool or everything just went straight
across to the beach it look really easy
and convenient so I almost didn't find
it I swear I looked through all the
camping area and I found collapsible
everything's but couldn't find a wagon
and it was up front so climb on divers
got some size for diapers we like the
Pampers Cruisers for Betty yay done
extra extra cooler a zipless so just
kind of little tray in there I think
that's gonna be awesome yeah
because sometimes you know some people
be at the pool some people be on a
fishing boat maybe and we need a couple
coolers I thought those would be good
really for anybody but they're BPA free
they're microwavable and dishwasher safe
it wasn't sure if I had shoes that small
as hand-me-downs
for bidding on those little open pj
Ariel little baby float I thought we
could just take and blow up there and
individual water detergents smart yes to
keep on hand in the in the wagon in a
purse or wherever that you can wipe pans
you can wipe surfaces another couple of
babes
I like those big ones a diaper cream in
a tube that we can take extra toothpaste
be home toothpaste home to Facebook
three and one for bad shoes he likes to
keep it multi tasking I do that's my
favorite kids sunscreen and I thought
just in case the Coppertone does this
wrong I know I like those for YouTube
them I can feel the excitement more for
me I really like the scent of that you
know so the silverware um yeah that's a
trip trip snacks
sunny days snack forest no he really
likes these and they are great because
they don't crumble like some other ones
they hang together you won't have crumbs
all over goldfish pizza the adults may
need some goldfish on this boxes boxes
to take with a lot of grocery things I
think we're just gonna have to pick up
there as far as fresh fruit and I also
want to show you guys what tikka stands
you probably know about tikka on
instagram but he and I did a live thing
on Instagram actually it was probably a
couple months ago and she sent me these
beautiful plates that she designed for
Lennox
I love the bunny design I think that's
so sweet and if you turn it around but
you can see that it is her her
collection there and I think that's so
impressive and it was so kind of her to
send those my way
keep the earth clean it's not Uranus
that's funny
nokey don't tackle you gotta watch out
for the tack one see the change se a
that seems to be some sort of pun
like a mason jar the turtle told you it
was but the turtles 500 million plastic
straws are used in the US alone puts
marine friends at risk and kids in the
ocean I'm like getting the turtles noses
it's tough and it really messes with
them environmentally
you got a nice metal like you know
non-disposable straw that you can use
kind of look like candles mmm looks like
they're all about the same just
different colors lancome classy right
here your packing materials flower
petals apply for 30 minutes before
bedtime and see the results for yourself
skin is plumper firmer and simply
glowing with health we need to sleep
when you use this you gonna look just
fine little masks and we're have to try
those out later they all the same no
sweet thang family masks are in order
this is an advanced genifique
concentrate active a to verde to win in
his youth activating concentrate
everything oh I see you got like a
little eyedropper there
so that's very thin those um pretty easy
tip you're not going to need a lot
because that little maybe half of
eyedropper pretty much got my whole face
covered we've got a pretty big face do
feel much younger like this kind of the
container out and it was darken and
fades into the light stuff the
nice-looking packaging classic cush
gara launching 420 so that just came out
on Friday one hint for high voice I
think there's a marijuana theme to this
took me a while there but I'm caught on
now
the soil you do that get high off the
stuff
we're giving you the goods okay that's
what I smell them like a candle milk
makeup is partnered with our fav
cannabis connoisseurs for a total push
experience light up with these
accessories and a message to percentage
of the kids with this you can light this
cannabis hemp oil infused candle it
smells pretty good sound like a hockey
puck also the mattress
okay that's weak what they make these
matchsticks out of but it didn't burn
into this matchstick at all you're gonna
need to light that candle pretty quick
won't I always keep an empty your kroy's
hanging around just in case you have to
dispose of any and flammable materials
yet these two pins that they push on
them that's if you have like a formal
event and you want to pin that to your
lapel so people know about the weed
makeup that you use more la girl dare to
glow luminous blow brightens illuminates
brings out a radiant call two of them
Nettie finishes you dare put the two
together that would be bold because that
would be a powder and a cream
am i illuminated one side versus the
other not illuminated illuminated I
don't have the fortitude to do both the
powder and the and the cream baby steps
