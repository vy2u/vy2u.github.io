I'm not even sure where to begin today
okay I didn't vlog all week long because
I knew I had a very exciting weekend
coming up my sister Kelly aka pup and
her husband Jeff are coming for the
weekend and I'm so excited about that
and I knew I'd be vlogging about that
and that was kind of feeling overwhelmed
like last week we had a big weekend but
I also vlog a little throughout the week
it was just a ton of video to like go
through and edit and I'll just focus in
on the weekend for this vlog now here's
what's going on we are now going on 24
hours without water here this is an
issue affecting numerous counties and
towns here I think it's like some
175,000 people are without water like
I'm not talking a boil order if nothing
comes out of the sink and I guess what
happened is the water district where our
water comes from had a huge break in a
line and I saw some video on Facebook
for something's like this massive
looking pipe that had to be restored and
replaced and they had to do some kind of
bypass just to temporarily make it work
but I mean we've still been without
water now for 24 hours think about it we
can't flush toilets we've got to come up
with some extra water we're think about
taking it out of the hot tub to just
flush toilets so you just fill the bowl
until it starts to go down
I've never had to deal with the toilet
in this manner bubble essence we had to
buy a bunch of bottled water yesterday
Tyler had to go to the next town over
that isn't part of this situation
because Marion which is near us has
completely like shut down they ordered
all restaurants bars and hotels had to
close because of this so people are like
having to leave their hotel rooms have
no water you know at the time even the
water situation in Carbondale like at
the nearest Walmart was running low
because so many people were coming from
where we live and points east to get the
freaking water so it's kind of a
ridiculous situation right now like what
do we do I take what bottled water we
have and filling up cupcakes you know
water dish with that but she really
would love to be drinking out of the
sink nobody's really as bothered by this
situation as cupcake is Becky's confused
she wants her sink water the news is
like referring to this as a water crisis
and what they were saying this morning
was that a big repair had been made
overnight like around 4:00 o'clock this
morning but it will take
time for the water to get tested where
to start flowing at full power from the
treatment facility to all of the
communities that are served by this
treatment facility and fill up the water
towers and reserves everywhere like it's
going to take time for that to happen
how much time we don't exactly know yeah
so hopefully pups still ends up coming
there will be an interesting weekend no
matter what happens but ya know what
Benny okay and we're gonna take water
from our precious hot tub which it can
afford the live sound needs to loosen
actually my little plant hanger that was
right there
fell off last night during a bout of
heavy rain we're just we're falling
apart here people
I think bub looks great I just told him
I'd never know he was goin through a
water crisis I'm doing the best I can I
don't feel right though if you're used
to having a shower in the morning and
you don't have one just it doesn't feel
quite right your Seinfeld episode about
this oh they have the low-flow showers
and creams like I'm not Kramer this is a
Mother's Day gift Shane Dawson and all
of you look at these two cuties we're
just trying to get through things here I
usually don't feed them super sugary
cereal however I did find this one bag
of tricks in the cupboard and I just
thought today's the day that bunny is
gonna be me when the water comes back on
like I've never actually been this
excited about the prospect of being able
to do laundry but I really need to do
laundry and I really need to wash dishes
and I'm gonna do those tasks with joy
now when the water comes back it's
almost nine o'clock by the way so we are
now probably at like 25 hours without
water because I think it was like 8
o'clock yesterday morning when it
completely shut off it's 10 o'clock we
still don't have water pop and Jeff are
not going to be coming which bums me out
a lot I've been looking forward to this
all week since we decided it was
happening I mean we'll reschedule and
make something happen but it's just like
of all things of all unexpected things I
guess it goes to show you can really
take water for granted but it's just
hard I mean nobody can really take a
shower
like even when the water does come on
which they make it seem like it could be
a whole other day you know before it
comes on there's still these like
advisories out to conserve water and
stuff like that because they might run
into more issues down the line or
something and we'll be under boil orders
but we have still zero water and so it's
just not a good time there would
obviously be much better times to have
visitors when you can offer them you
know glasses of water showers toilet
flushes so we're gonna do it another
time this is gonna be an interesting
blog for the weekend because I'm still
gonna vlog the week and even though I
hope to have much more fun vlog
featuring pub well it's not all cupcakes
and rainbows is it Nucky did somebody
throw a fit for no reason what are we
gonna do next time when we feel that
like we want to throw a fit and take
some deep breaths does it feel better
and you slow down and you give somebody
a hug and you say and we say I'm not
gonna throw this fit anymore you know
and it's aren't fun are you and I
thought let me say about kindness does
it make you want to be kind
uh-huh because princesses don't throw
hey fitzy I love you I love you tons its
335 and we've got a trickle of water yep
it's not coming out full blast but we're
happy to see this there's a deer you see
the deer oh there's this friend another
deer look Minnie there's a deer out here
come see see usually they come by in
like groups oof anywhere from five to
seven I'd say we are watching brave and
waiting for daddy to get home with some
yummy pizza
this is hair that needed to be washed
like yesterday I'm not even sure if a
shower is really gonna happen tonight to
be honest because of the low pressure
like it's only cutting out it may be I
don't know half to a third of the way it
normally comes out of the faucet but all
in all I'm glad to have some water back
I'm thrilled I was able to do a sink
full of dishes not a bad Friday night
really but it would have been more fun
if pup was here we have just had the
water shortage on a different weekend
good Friday night dance party
very typical around here when you can't
really drink the water drink a
watermelon Rita girl gotta do it sissy
doesn't grab a doll huh I used to love
this Sun
easy cowboy Stan wooden rumbling
no yelling in Maidan started
Oh
Oh see the lights of our hometown and
Brotherhood figure in my arms maybe see
how sorry I am well shouldn't be so hot
my own
where's Betty something fun to watch
while I'm doing my makeup this morning
Royal Wedding
check it out everybody that's pretty
good coming out fast don't want to waste
it a bun okay there we go got today's
video up Nikki and I are going to head
out to Target and get a few things right
nook nugget what are your thoughts on
the Royal Wedding did she look so
beautiful what did you think of the
Royal Wedding Biddle was it good
are they in love I've got a little
companion going to Target with me today
say hi we are gonna get a handful of
random things I tweeted on like
Wednesday that I had a strong urge to go
to Target and never went my makeup geek
stuff that I talked about in my video
like that was about I don't know a week
and a half ago I ordered that from
targets website so it's always more
satisfying to just be in target for a
bit I could have used a shower like two
days ago I don't really want to push it
they say we're supposed to still be kind
of consider water conservation mode
right now but I got a notification on my
phone saying that the water system is
almost at full power we're still under a
boil order and stuff but it's almost
like coming out with the full pressure
so I think by tonight I'm gonna be able
to get myself a shower and that's gonna
feel really good probably gonna see a
lot of people in our area walking around
in ball caps because their hair is so
dang greasy like mine well I forgot my
phone in the car when we
and to target but we did get what we
needed and of course some things we
didn't look he got something she needed
a few of the things we got from Target
and some of these LED pathway lights
this is a 6-pack brought almost six back
and I'm gonna put him somewhere on that
little patch of grass near the hot tub
some sweet Cajun trail mix love this
salsa I also got some more like paper
plates and paper bowls just because I
wasn't sure if the water pressure was
maybe going to be kind of in and out
that way I can wash pewter dishes more
undies for Nikki I absolutely love the
honest hand sanitizer it's great with
kids and just the quick drying nature of
it is so good so I got one of the
grapefruit scents and two of the
lavender this little outfit that I'm
about to show you I got this in both Eve
size and Belle size this skirt how cute
is that and it would match so many
things you know but it's got the little
built-in shorts underneath and I just
think they're gonna be adorable and the
shirt that could go with that or just be
warned however isn't that cute can we
bring you home a little trade little
Sesame Street phone okay next request
the ladies are eating I'm putting on a
concert if it seems like I'm higher up
than usual that's because this is my
stage Aurora would be I know you I
walked with you once upon
I know you the gleam in your eyes is so
familiar a gleam and I know it's true
that visions are seldom what they seem
thank you before this Nikki had some
strawberries some apples and some
tomatoes and now she's having some corn
dogs that we picked up from Target you
just buy these frozen mini corn dogs and
it's the first time I've tried corn dogs
in the airfryer and they turned out like
nice and crisp on the outside no added
oils or anything like that and they end
up nice and crispy done in the middle
did it you're really down in these quick
I cut hers up a little smaller what with
the only four teeth situation little
false lash haul that I got here from
Lady mass comm I'm really becoming
pretty certain that my favorite style of
lash out
cocoa washes these are the style risque
that I bought the most up so I have
three risk aids here actually a fourth
down here I just love them I don't have
to trim them they're nice and full and
these are the ones I was wearing in the
Instagram picture where I got a lot of
questions about what lashes are you
wearing so those are the ones a couple
other Styles I ended up with here baby G
and Monroe there's baby G and Monroe yes

grow note so hose so hose sorry so hose
are big so hose aren't playing so update
on the water everyone it's about 7:30
and I just took a shower a long-overdue
shower but the water was cold so I don't
know what the deal is with that I'm
about to begin googling why that really
stinks I was so looking forward to a
good shower and then once I realized it
wasn't gonna warm up I couldn't wait for
it to end so ah little lunch today we
got some pork chops and some oven
roasted zucchini and
mushrooms are you trying to get golf
tips that's how she tells someone she I
got a video shot this morning about a
bunch of different foundations full
coverage foundations it's kind of like a
foundation try on video it's like
nothing I've really done before so I'm
pumped about that finally got some
laundry done because I figured now that
were pretty much I think getting water
at full full capacity at full pressure I
thought I'd be able to do that plus I
got some notification on my phone that
they lifted the advisory to conserve
water so did some laundry had a huge
thunderstorm rolled through here it
wasn't like terribly windy but it was
super heavy rain and really loud thunder
which started probably within a
half-hour of the girls going down for a
nap but amazingly they slept through it

really long nap today what did you hear
