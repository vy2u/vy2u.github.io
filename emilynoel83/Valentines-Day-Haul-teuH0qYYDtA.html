this video I hope you had a really good
valentine's day mine was really fun um
Tyler and I went to st. Louis for the
weekend and went to a hockey game we got
to see the st. Louis Blues which is a
super exciting game we had so much fun
we got a nice dinner and the next day we
went shopping so you can kind of tell
that like part of that trip was you know
really expand for Tyler the other part
was fun for me the hockey game was
awesome though it was like it a tie game
went into overtime then they went into a
shootout and hockey is pretty fun to
watch even if you're not like a huge
sports fan at really keep your you
really stay interested in the game as
you watch it's very very fast-paced but
anyway the following day we went
shopping and I got to go to a lot of
stores that I don't normally get to go
to because they're just not around where
I live so I went to a Sephora and the
mac store and the lush store actually so
that was my first experience trying lush
stuff so I'm going to just kind of tell
you what I got it's not like maybe the
most super exciting stuff I don't know
it's exciting to me so I thought I would
just share it with you and maybe you'll
get an idea of what will be coming in my
upcoming reviews and tutorials and all
that so let's get started first I went
to Sephora and I realize I could buy
this stuff like online but there's just
something about getting to be in the
store and look at all the stuff you know
hands on and see what it's all about so
one thing I got there was a bronzer from
Too Faced and it was actually in this
kit let me get that out and show you the
glamour revolution palette that my
sister gave me for like Christmas and my
birthday and it looks like this and I've
shown this to you guys before but it has
this bronzer in here it's the chocolate
Soleil bronzer right down there and it's
a matte bronzer but it's just a little
bit darker than quite a few of the other
bronzers that I've tried so I thought
you know I really like it so when I get
the sample size products are like
specially packaged things like I'm much
more likely to
seek out that item in the store if I've
gotten to try it and really decide if I
like it or not so that's what I got I
got that bronzer it's matt bronzing
powder and the packaging is gorgeous
like look at this this is like kind of a
mirrored like really dark packaging and
it's matt bronzing powder with real
cocoa in it yeah that's what it looks
like they're so it's a little bit darker
it works great as a contour because it
is Matt and it's so cute like on the on
the mirror there there you can see my
camera hello but the mirror says why be
pretty when you can be gorgeous it has
that little phrase there and there's the
bronzer um like I said I used it today
kind of just contouring just around my
face and it has a really good smell to
it too i don't know if that is the real
cocoa in this but that's kind of
fascinating that the food product is
actually worked into this i'm sure it's
not like a lot of cocoa but um it's in
there either way and so just a nice
matte bronzer that gives me a little
different color because i feel like a
lot of the matte bronzer more for like I
don't know I feel like a lot of them
work really well for fair skin but I
wanted something that could just provide
a little more contrast and the only
other thing I got Sephora of course I
saw like tons of things I wanted but I
kind of restrained myself but I got one
of the Stila for pan compacts just an
empty one because you may remember from
the video I did where I talked about the
four individual shadows I had they came
in this set that i got from Beauty
ticket but they did not have a palette
to put them in so you had the four
shades but you didn't have the palette
and they are a little larger the selah
shadows are then you know your average
like st. Mac or the Coastal Scents hot
pots or whatever so I just got this
empty palette and it has a really nice
large mirror it's pretty big palette and
I just was able to it was magnetic so
these all just went right in there and
so that's kind of I think I'm going to
use them the
shadows a lot more having them all
contained in the palette and smudge
easier to travel with them and not worry
about them getting broken because they
were in just these little plastic
containers so the colors i have in there
by the way our kitten which is a really
popular shade and wheat and i believe
that one is go lightly and that one is
mystic the blue so all really pretty
shades they're all very shimmery sorry I
just thought it was going to burp it was
trying to conceal it if it was going to
happen but whatever anyway really pretty
shades and that's what I got at sephora
so I was looking a lot of different
things that I wanted but I just didn't
go ahead and get more than that now I
went to the mat counter which I think
with Mac like I've looked at their
website so much but they just have so
much color variety and I feel like it
really the brand really comes down to
colors and shades and I just really like
to see that kind of thing in person if I
can and of course other people's youtube
videos helped a lot getting to see the
products demonstrated and just more than
just a little swatch on a website so
anyway I went in there knowing I was
going to get a couple of new eye shadows
from Mac and somewhat products as well
because I've only tried the lipsticks
and I wanted to try a few other things
too so I ended up getting another
lipstick I got the mac viva glam five so
that's what I have on now that lipstick
and it's just a really pretty nude shade
it's got some kind of like it's kind of
like a pinky golden a neutral shade and
it's not one of those super light
neutrals that like erases your lips and
I was looking for something sort of a
lip look that I could come up with that
was going to be something I could really
wear for all occasions because if I'm
going to shell out a little more money
for it you know I want it to be
something I'm really going to get good
out of so i thought this I wore this
today on the air so i used the viva glam
five and then with that and the makeup
artist that was helping me told me that
this liner in world is the shade and
it's a nice neutral liners
all works good with this lipstick and it
does it's just maybe a hair darker
provides a little bit of definition with
that lighter colored lipstick and I
think it's so neutral it would work well
with a lot of other lipsticks that I
have so nice to get a nice liner and I
haven't noticed like any issues with
this feathering or like going outside my
lip line or anything like that and
another thing I was really excited to
try was a lip gloss so I got one of the
mac lipglass lip glasses and the shade
is nymphet and it just really caught my
eye as soon as I saw it it's a really
really super pretty pink with a lot of
gold undertone and it goes on very sheer
to wear it on its own but I warrant on
top of this look and it really brings
out the gold and the entire look so um
yeah I really like it I like the way it
feels I don't think it's too sticky I
think I've heard of some people saying
these are pretty sticky but I don't
think it's too sticky for me and I do
think it just kind of helps the whole
look stay you know it doesn't feel like
it's sliding all over your face so that
was nice to get and I got to New
eyeshadows one is embarked and a lot of
people I've just heard from many people
that I like to watch on youtube that say
this is just a good classic neutral
shade to get in your collection and I
don't have a lot of mac eyeshadow but I
feel like I'm trying to build up the
basics you know I have carbon I have
sketch you know it's just some your
basic shadows and so I thought this
would be a nice complement to what I
already have and it is just a matte
shade a nice matte brown and it was
sitting next to I think was sitting next
to sketch and it looks like it could
even work really well with that it's
almost like i don't know i don't want to
say it's a plummy tone but it seemed to
really work with that shade so yeah I
got that one and I got night divine
which is a velox parole shade and it's
just really pretty and I have that on
today actually it looks kind of like a
really dark charcoal in some lights and
then it really hits the light and it
looks like
practically just silver but I am wore
Naked Lunch on my lid um I night divine
kind of in the crease and up in here a
little bit in carbon kind of right in
the outer corner so I like that look at
some point maybe I'll just do like a
matte collection video because I don't
have a lot I could definitely fit it all
into one video for sure and go through
all the different shadows I have and
maybe I could take some of your feedback
on what other things I need if I'm
trying to build up my collection there a
little bit but as you can see i'm
talking about a lot of high-end stuff in
this video but you guys know that i love
the drugstore stuff and I always will so
it's not like I'm converting or anything
entirely but I just I like to really be
able to experience the whole makeup
spectrum if i can and i think i can give
you a little more perspective in my
reviews when i do them anyway last thing
i have is a couple of things the last
thing is a couple of things that's weird
i went to lush and i really didn't know
what I was gonna guide honestly just
went to look around because I don't take
a lot of bass I mean I shower I need to
get that shower done quick BAM you know
done with it I don't really do a lot of
soaking in the tub so i decided i would
get one of these they're called massage
bars can they have like cocoa butter in
them and a lot of really moisturizing
ingredients and what I got is peach oh
it smells so good it's like a really
citrusy scent you don't just smell peach
but you get a lot of like I think
there's grapefruit and and just really
really good sense there and it's cute
it's one of the really cute and massage
bars but anyway you could just put this
on like you get out of the shower and
you can kind of you rub your hands on it
and you get this like moisturizing kind
of cocoa butter feel to it and I like
just putting it on my hands honestly
around my cuticles to its really
moisturizing there and I haven't really
tried it beyond that I haven't like used
it all over my body yet but I was
reading and some infirm
Nation about it and it said like you
know it would be good to use something
like this after you get out of the
shower all over your body really locks
in the moisture but it's really great on
your hands and then you have that
wonderful scent on your hands and the
scent is so like I don't want to say
it's incredibly strong because it's not
like you know you're gonna knock you
over strong smell but it's just a really
fresh scent very energizing it be the
type of thing i'd like to have on in the
morning you know to really get me gone
the smell on your hands and it smells so
good and so that was all i was going to
get I was checking out and the girl was
like would you like to try one of our
lip balms and asking me a question like
that is like uh yeah I'd love to try one
of your lip balms so anyway I got the
bomb in a honey trap and I really don't
know a whole lot about this I didn't I
got one of those little it's like looks
like a little newspaper they give you
and has info on all the products and i
had read this but i don't really
remember what all is in it i think this
may be like a cocoa butter type product
as well but you put your it's very hard
like you it reminds me of the feel of
like birth the Burt's Bees lip balm
that's in the little tin like this and
it's you just kind of got to warm it up
a little bit with your finger but when
you put it on it's very moisturizing I
mean it's kind of has if you get get it
really warmed up and you put it on your
lips it has almost a thick feel to it
but I like it it's doesn't have a real
over-the-top set it's just kind of
lightly sweet um I see where the honey
thing is coming from and it's not going
to be glossy or anything like that like
I put it on last night before bed and I
woke up and my lips felt really soft so
um anyway guys that is my hull from
valentines day and my trip to st. Louis

Valentine's Day thank you for the
Valentine's wishes on Twitter and my
