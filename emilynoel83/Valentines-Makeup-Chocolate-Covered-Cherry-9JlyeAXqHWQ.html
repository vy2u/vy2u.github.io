this is going to be a Valentine's
tutorial we're getting very close to the
holiday I know it's one of those
holidays that some people love and some
people hate but my theory is that
there's no reason why you can't get a
little glammed up for it either way the
last year's look that I did was very
sweet it was all about pinks it was
really light and feminine and so if
that's something you're interested in
definitely check out that video so this
year I was like maybe I'll just ask my
Valentine what he wants to see as a
Valentine's Day look and he said
something with the smokey eye so that's
what I did but this is actually
something I'm calling chocolate-covered
cherry because I'm utilizing burgundy
and brown together which is actually I
think a really wearable combo and I'm
merging a drugstore in high-end also a
really old classic favorite palette of
mine and something brand new so I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial we're going to
take you through face eyes and lips so
keep on watching
starting out for the face I just used my
NYX HD studio photogenic foundation so
this is a new one I'm trying I plan to
you know use it some and then review it
but my shade is oh three natural so I
just blended that all over and then I
used my Sigma f80 brush to really get it
all blended and I used my dream Lumi
touch concealer here from Maybelline
relatively new product my shade is nude
and I just went over any area like my
under eye and around my nose that I
wanted to do some brightening and some
concealer there's some added coverage I
used my full coverage concealer trick I
have whole video on this if you want
more info but basically I'm using a
product from bare minerals called bisque
the shade I'm using a summer bisque and
you can just kind of Pat that over any
concealer you have and I feel like it
gives it mattifies the area more it
gives a little more coverage and it can
really be used on top of any concealer
to just boost it up and make it a little
bit more you know full coverage you kind
of set the whole look but not take away
the glow I went with my bare minerals
foundation a medium beige just really
lightly just went over everything this
is not the matte formula so I think it
kind of maintains a glow but it also
helps lock in your foundation for
staying
I went kind of all over with a light
dusting of a light tone bronzer this is
Rimmel's sunlight it's matte and I just
kind of went all over the face just to
perk up my skin contoured my cheeks with
kind of a little bit warmer blush this
is covergirl cheekers and Sierra Sands
so this can be a great contour just
gives the cheeks a little bit more
dimension I thing I went for a really
deep rosy blush that I think just gives
you that little bit of a flushed look
shade is red vino and I know it might
look a little scary but used lightly I
just kind of put it on more the outer
part of the cheek so as I smile you know
it's kind of right out in here and I
think it just came off really nicely I
love these Milani baked blush for a
little finishing touch on the face I
used my lorac perfectly lip powder in
spotlight this is a great great color
for highlighting but not looking too
shiny so if you're concerned about that
this is a great one to just go on
cheekbones down the nose Cupid's bow
anywhere you want first we're gonna
create a base on our lid using some of
the Maybelline Color tattoo shadows
first one is pomegranate Punk which is a
gorgeous burgundy shade so I'm just
gonna pick up some of that on my finger
and just basically smudge that all over
my eyelid really like the longevity of
this white shade which is called too
cool and so I just get a little bit of
that on my pinky it's like each finger
with these can be a different brush so
to speak but I'm just gonna pop that
right here around the tear duct and just
use your pinky to slightly blend that
both under the eye and above the eye and
you'll have just the right look so I'm
gonna take one of my favorite quads of
all time which is from covergirl and
it's called drama eyes I'm just gonna
take this red shade with the sponge tip
yes sponge tips can be used and the goal
with this color is to make this the sort
of the burgundy pop right in the center
of the lid so just kind of Pat the color
in there don't worry too much about
smudging it to this side or that side
because we will have shadows kind of
sandwich that on either end next I'm
gonna take a brand new palette for me
this is the Too Faced natural at night
and it's got some wonderful warm Browns
that I thought would play into this look
so well and since I just picked it up
I'm really excited to use it but first
we're gonna go with this super shimmery
almost pinky shade right here it's
called a night light so I'm gonna pick
that up on a small breast top the base
we put there on the tear duct area and
kind of blend it just a little bit on
top of our burger using a flat brush
we're gonna go to Coco Starr right here
it's a great matte brown tap that on the
outer part of my lid here and then you
can see I'm just flipping the brush over
and pulling that Brown up slightly to
the crease and we're just kind of going
all throughout the the crease here then
using just a bare brush I'm gonna blend
out the border of that shade there's the
most gorgeous warm Brown
I think some burgundy notes in it right
here it's called Eclipse and this
particular shade really attracted me to
this palette it reminds me a lot of
twinks from Mac if you need sort of a
dupe for that also the red shade you
could use cranberry in place of the
cover girl drama eyes color if you have
cranberry from Mac that's a gorgeous
color but as you can see it doesn't take
a lot I'm just taking a little bit of
that shade and that becomes sort of the
halo around this look you can see when
my eyes are open it's just visible
that's another edge we're gonna want to
buff out then I'm gonna use a wonderful
matte kind of butter cream shade here
called spotlight just take a little bit
of that with your fluffy brush and this
is gonna be the border between our smoky
look basically in our eyebrow under the
eye I want to go back to this red
burgundy color in the covergirl palette
you can just use a liner brush and in a
not so precise way I'm just kind of
lining my lower lash line with that then
I'm gonna take a liquid liner this is
that new covergirl like 24 hour line
blast I think it's called so just kind
of a liquid liner pen and I'm gonna go
all the way across my upper lash line
thickening the line as we get closer to
the outer edge of the I'm going to take
my Mally ever color starlight liner in
midnight and basically just take this
all through our inner rim this is a very
rich dark liner so I love that touch
here for the smoky look we're going with
and then I'm also going to just take a
little right here on the outer edge of
everything and see how I'm just kind of
connecting that up gently with the
liquid liner it just creates kind of a
nice finish back to Coco star this
wonderful matte Brown picking some of
that up on the very tip of a pencil
brush and we're just gonna take that
over the outside there it's gonna take
away the look of any actual pencil being
you next we're gonna curl the lashes I'm
going to apply some atomic volume
mascara from Sephora
this is kind of a thick rubber brush
mascara and this is just kind of
prepping the lashes for false eyelash
using Maybelline lash discovery really
wiggle it at the root of the lash where
it's you know really growing out of your
lash line and then just kind of lightly
pull it through to the end I'm gonna use
these lashes from I'll or these are the
natural light super fullest you put on a
very thin application of Revlon
precision lash glue and I'm gonna let
that get tacky for about 30 seconds and
then place it right on my lash line I
just grabbed the blaschkas in the middle
and center my fingers up with the center
of my eye and place them as close to my
lash line as possible you just kind of
use your eyeliner as a guide here and
then secure them in both the inner and
outer corners after that apply one more
coat of mascara and you're done the lips
I wanted to go with something a little
bit lighter I really wanted the
attention to go to the eyes and for the
lips to just be something that looked
kind of plush and full you know so I
used my Revlon lip butter in creme
brulee and this is gonna give a nice
little natural bit of shine so I didn't
use a gloss with this look just went all
over with creme brulee then I wanted to
create some dimension and this isn't
really taking away from the nude lip
aspect but it's just deepening a little
bit here on the outsides and leaving a
nice amount of lightness and therefore
the look of fullness on the inner part
or the center part of the lower lips so
I used this big and healthy lipstick
from buxom the shade is Fresno it's one
of my favorites for transforming lighter
shades into something that I feel like
works with my skin tone so I just kind
of applied that on the outer portions of
the lip and then blend it over it a
little bit and you can use your finger
to just blend over it if you want but I
feel like what that does is creates a
sense of contrast with the lips and it
makes the fuller part seem full and like
the theory behind this look because it
is kind of like a guy doesn't
necessarily care to see a zillion in one
colors put together on your eye but
something about that smoky look and the
lashes I think is really an attract
if thing and what I like about this look
is that as you look dead on you know
you're just seeing this kind of smokey
halo of warm brown around the eye but
then you look down and you've got a nice
little warmth of some red and I think
it's one of those kind of hot twists on
an eye look that you can't quite put
your finger on you know a significant
other maybe can't but you know you've
done something a little bit special and
so I just really like that twist on it
and I'm also really enjoying the natural
at night palette from Too Faced and then
of course merging that with an old
favorite which is my covergirl drama I
so thank you so much for watching I hope
everyone has a happy Valentine's Day you
have a Valentine or not I mean take it
as a day where you can share your
positivity and your love with those
around you so thank you so much for
watching guys and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
