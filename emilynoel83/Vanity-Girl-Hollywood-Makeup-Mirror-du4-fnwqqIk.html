me for this video still in my work
clothes but wanted to knock out this
quick video to let you know about my
makeup mirror I mentioned in my
Christmas and birthday haul video that
this was one of the big gifts I received
for Christmas and it was from Tyler and
he knew I was wanting a great new makeup
mirror and what I've been using was sort
of this oval-shaped Revlon mirror which
was okay but I mean the light just only
got so bright and I felt like it really
wasn't bright enough for what I was
looking for is just kind of small and I
mean a lot of times people will ask me
you know what's a good makeup mirror and
like well the one I'm using is average
but I haven't found the one that is just
you know amazing that really makes
putting on makeup easy and gives you all
the light you need well not too long ago
I stumbled upon as I was just doing some
searching online the brand vanity girl
Hollywood and so they do these nice
tabletop mirrors and also full vanity
sets as well that give you plenty of
light this mirror is really similar to
the lights that are in our makeup area
at the station we have kind of a little
area with light that simulates the
lighting that we have from above during
the newscast I'm a news anchor if this
is the first video of mine you're seeing
and I'm under some very bright light
every day and I found that often I'd be
sitting at home doing my makeup before
the newscast getting to work and finding
all the adjustments I needed to make
because I was doing it in lighting that
was not bright enough so this totally
takes care of that problem I've got
plenty of space to see myself it's a
fantastic quality mirror not all mirrors
are created equally and this mirror
itself is great but the lighting the way
I can adjust the lighting is wonderful I
guess all I would caution you about is
that this is a this is a large mirror
it's definitely something that you need
to have the space for if you don't have
the space for it and then you just think
you know we get it home and then it's
like this is not gonna work so you've
got to definitely allow yourself you
know full desktop space for something
like this and also it's a pretty costly
mirror
so it's definitely more of an investment
than you know something like a just a
Conair or a revlon mirror that you pick
up from the drugstore is going to be so
just a couple things to keep in mind in
terms of the assembly on this I do want
to say that came in a very nicely
packaged I mean this came in perfect
condition and it came in a nice big box
everything was packed up really nice and
tight and it also came with a full
little pamphlet here of instructions on
how to assemble it and it is it was
heaviest what I got to say it was a very
very heavy mirror but I was able to pick
it up on my own and get it put together
assembly wise all I had to do was take
the mirror and screw it on to this base
and basically that was a pretty easy
procedure you use a little allen wrench
that they give you you know I'm I'm all
in tune with to Olson I know my allen
wrench but you just screw it on in three
different places and then you screw in
the bulbs which they send you seven
bulbs so all six to go into the thing
and one extra so it was very very easy
then you just plug it in and you're
going alright here is the makeup mirror
as it sits in my makeup area I have an
l-shaped desk that comes from staples
sorry not every makeup item is very well
organized around this yet but it really
allows me the space for this size of
mirror and I mean as I sit in front of
it you can see all the space if I get up
as close as I normally sit I've still
got tons of mirror space around me so if
you wanted to use this on sort of as a
mirror for doing your hair I mean if you
wanted to have all your hair stuff with
you I think this would be also a very
good option because I've got tons of
head space and I'm not sitting
especially low you know I'm sitting
right up to my desk and I've still got
plenty of room to see what's going on
there you can see the bulbs are pretty
large there's a closer look at the base
of it it really looks kind of like a
counter top and then you can see right
back there see those those little screws
there's three of those and that's what
really anchor
on there it's got the cute vanity girl
logo and as you can see the oval really
takes you back there so I mean you can
see I've set a few of my EOS lip balms
back there so you can set some things
out I've got a couple of Sigma brushes
and stuff so this is usable area this
also acts as a bit of a space here if
you wanted to use that to sit something
but I'm really really impressed with the
size it's just like I mean when Tyler
saw who's like that's like a big plasma
TV and that really is kind of the
feeling you get now over here I want to
show you right under the right hand side
you can see this knob and this is how
the lighting goes you hear it click and
you can just make it as bright as you
want this is me under the ultimate
brightness we'll take the camera a
second to adjust but I think this is
usually what I use when I'm getting
ready in the mornings and then maybe you
know if it's something other than the
news I'll take it down to brightness of
about like that which is still quite
bright one of the things that I can't do
was this mirror that I did with my other
mirror was that it was small enough to
where I could really get in and kind of
tilt the mirror forwards or backwards or
side to side a little bit and get in
really close to it here I'm not gonna be
pulling this massive mirror you know any
closer toward me so I'm just gonna you
know either have to lean in or what I
think is very handy is to have a smaller
mirror like this this one's from goodI
and you can just set it there or you can
easily grab it hold it and you know look
into it I'm not sure how this is showing
up like there were too many mirrors plus
a camera ah but you know you can hold it
up there and get a closer look at your
whatever you're doing on your eyes I
mean often times even with my smaller
makeup mirror I would take this little
thing this is a little makeup from
philosophy it's called the supernatural
and you know I would hold that kind of
up close to my eyes so I could really
see what I was doing so I recommend that
really in any case but with this kind of
a mirror you're definitely going to want
to have that you know smaller mirror
that you can grab and look into and
really get
close to see what you're doing well
thanks again for watching everyone again
I'm very very pleased with this mirror I
have just had so much fun putting on my
makeup being in proper lighting for it
and it's also gonna be great because
when I do tutorials now I don't have to
be limited to only times when I have
natural light coming through my window I
feel like this can give me adequate
night even at night time and often times
when I get ready for the news since I'm
an early morning news anchor I'm getting
ready when it's pitch-black outside so
this really gives me all the light that
I need so thanks again for tuning in
have a great day and I'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
