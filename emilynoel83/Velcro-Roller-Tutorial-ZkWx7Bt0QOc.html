gonna be showing you how I do my velcro
rollers how I use them in my hair
first off I'm just gonna run you through
the products I'm going to be using them
to be using my Revlon curling iron here
is just a skinny one I'm not exactly
sure what the size is but it's a pretty
small one and also I've got this little
basket that I use that I put my stuff
and I've got some clips these are
available at Sally they're available at
Sally Beauty Supply and they're just
clips that go over your rollers and then
I've got several different kinds I use
these large ones this these are other
another Sally product these are for fine
hair just the big size and then I have a
group and these are goodie brand and I
got them a while back from Walmart and
basically it's a set that you get of all
these different sized rollers and they
just kind of fit one inside the other
but I put them all in this little basket
I will go through and use some of those
different sizes so just whatever you
have I'm gonna show you there's other
brands that sell you know velcro rollers
so if you find something comparable you
know big rollers small roller you know
medium roller that's kind of the
terminology I guess I'm going to be
using here as far as styling products I
am going to be using a heat sort of a
heat protectant spray it's they beyond
the zone turn up the heat
it's Flatiron protection but it can also
be used to where when you're using
curling irons and then I'm going to be
using my so gorgeous volumizing
hairspray
that's another Sally product that I'm
going to use once my rollers are in kind
of spray all over and get more volume
alright so step one is kind of getting
your hair parted and deciding you know
where you want the volume and what I do
I have sort of you know my hair's a
little shorter here I have Peniston
likes long bangs there so I tend to like
to leave those out of this whole process
and pull back some of the hair straight
back that's right behind that because I
like to have a little poof in the crown
so this is going to give us some volume
the whole purpose of using these kinds
of rollers is to give us basically more
more volume
and so I'm going to pull up a strip of
hair that's about that much and you may
not be able to see this because my hair
is kind of long but I'm gonna take my
curling iron and I have to stretch my
arms all the way up to get it all in
there and then I'm gonna just roll it
back like this so you can see I'm
rolling it backward and just hold that
there for a little while let it get hot
and then I'm going to be taking one of
these larger sized rollers and I'm going
to quickly put it in there right after I
take it off the curling iron and the
reason why you want to do that
there's my curl it's because it's hot
right now okay that hair is hot and we
want to take advantage of that heat and
when you put it on a roller it's going
to now you know take on the shape of
this roller when it's hot you won't have
that effect if you put these in and your
hair is cooled off alright does that
make kind of make sense to everybody and
by the way I did spritz on some of the
yiamas own heat protectant spray before
I got going here and now that I've got
that in there another thing that I
forgot to mention but you may want to
use some of these little clips this is
another cheap cheap Sally product if you
feel like that's moving around on top of
your head you can just kind of clip that
in there I'm just flipping it on top of
the roller and on with the hair that's
underneath and then spritz some of some
of your hairspray all over that and when
you take it out you're going to find you
have a lot more volume so next what I'm
going to do is go directly behind that
with about two more rollers so I'm going
to go go about that with the exact same
process you may not always need to use
the clips usually I just need it on the
one that's right on top of my head like
this so I'm going to go ahead and put in
those couple more rollers and I'll join
you again when I get started on this
guy's I've got three rollers now and one
on top of my head one another large
sized roller right behind that and a
medium sized roller behind that and the
whole concept with this for my hair
anyway I want to have a live lift up
here so I'm using larger sizes and then
I want more curl towards the bottom so
using smaller sizes down here we go I'm
gonna grab out about that much hair
close to my face and instead of putting
them in going like horizontally I'm
gonna actually put it in vertically and
I'm going to curl my hair so it's
curling back from my face okay so I'm
gonna get my curling iron on that and
curl it back like that and this is gonna
kind of give us that look that's really
in right now where your hair is kind of
you know coming away from your face and
also for me with these layers around my
face helps to keep my hair out of my
face by rolling it back this way so hold
it in there in your curling iron for a
second I'm gonna put my roller in here
and just roll it up like that and you
may want may or may not need to clip it
in mine's holding in pretty well on its
own and just spray it with a little
hairspray and there you go
so guys right behind this roller I'm
going to put two more smaller sized
rollers so just vertically like that one
behind the other
heading back like that so I will join
you again after again so I've got my
three rollers here one two three going
back in that direction they're all
vertical and then I'm going to do the
same side here but I'm just going to
demonstrate for those of you and a lot
of people have this kind of like longer
side bang thing going on so I'm going to
pull out some of that here that I don't
exactly want to include in this roller
so I'm going to kind of pull that
section down and pull up the section
closest to that right here I'm going to
pull that out and put a medium roller in
there I got to pull it out of its little
chunk here that it's it oh yes the fun
of rollers and so this is the size I'm
going to be using so I'm just going to
once again put it in this is where you
may have some challenges in terms of how
it all went in in terms of getting all
your hair all your layers in the curling
iron at once so it doesn't have to be
perfect and that's the beauty of rollers
is that you get it you just get it up
you know get your
here in there and you know you'll be
fine
so immediately after taking it off the
curling iron that's the big key get it
rolled back there just like that give it
a spritz of some hairspray and you're
good and I'm going to go ahead and do
the same thing I did on this side to
smaller rollers going one after the
other back towards the back of mine okay
guys so this is the amount of hair I've
got left I've pulled it around kind of
equally on each side I'll turn around
and show you what I've got going on here
so far in terms of the curler look so
it's basically one two three one two
three and then so I just did one lower
one here one lower one here and one in
the middle in the back so now that you
officially look like an alien eye you
might be wondering well what's gonna
happen here with this hair what I
generally do with this is just while my
curling iron is still out I go ahead and
give it a curl just so it gets some
curve to it
it's stuffs falling there with those
layers and then just kind of what I do
since mine are long enough so I just
kind of hook them back here so they're
out of my face and I can keep doing my
makeup or whatever I was doing and then
it'll all work into the finished look so
I'll go ahead and let these stay in for
about 15 minutes or so you can leave
them in longer basically the longer they
stay in the more tight of a look you're
gonna get the more these are going to be
able to do their job so and I will come
back and join you when I come take them
all right guys it's time to take out the
rollers this is kind of like unwrapping
a present to me I'm always excited to
take them out and see what I have so
just kind of unroll them and you'll see
you've got kind of a nice like spring
curl like that that's basically what
these small rollers are gonna do all
over your head these medium ones are
going to give you more of a you know
bigger curl like that just kind of
curving back and that's how everything
is curving back the same way so that's
really great about these and then I'll
take out a big
back here so you can kind of see what
you get from that it's like a big curl
like that basically in most of the lift
there's a lot of lift here at the roots
from those big ones so I'm gonna go
ahead and get all these out of my hair
and I will join you when I get there
guys got all the rollers taken out that
little step stool here so I can stand up
higher and show you what the ends turned
out to look like again it's I'm really
happy with how this always works out
because it's like I love that kind of
turned back look to the hair it's all
coming back and so the next step after
you get through it you want to just kind
of brush through the hair kind of get it
all working the same way you can kind of
direct it back and get all the all that
hair just kind of meshing with one
another and you can totally stop at this
point and kind of you know go with what
you have I think that's a really pretty
look but if you want just a little more
volume kind of pull it back in the same
method you did for your first roller
pull it straight up grab your rat tail
comb just tease it a little bit there in
the crown tease a little bit right over
here on the side of that tease a little
bit over on this side
oops
just thought I'd take you through a
styling option here while I'm you know
got everything out and I'm doing this
look and then another thing take start
taking the area that was your bangs and
kind of start combing those back just a
bit too little back combing can go a
long way in this style I fan and then
take some of that volumizing hairspray
to spray it all over take one of these
little hair pins you can find these at
Sally's and they are the ideal thing to
kind of tone down any teased hair that
you've been working on I love using
these so much so we're just taking that
hair and just smoothing it out kind of
boosting it up in some areas this is
pretty much my everyday look for what
I'm doing the news or well doing the
news that's what I do every day so kind
of got it turning back on each side the
only challenge I find the hardest part
for me is dealing with my little bangs
here and trying to style those in in
such a way that they're not getting down
in my face but yet they're kind of
framing the look so that little pin
works wonders just for a styling tool
and then once you kind of got that how
you want it once you got it how you want
on the side absolutely spray it one more
time
spray that all over
Spray in here once you've got that kind
of how you want it just like so
and then kind of work around with these
sides a little bit spritz it down at the
bottom and there you go there's a look
that you can easily pull off with velcro
rollers it really helps you get that
volume here that we've gotten the crown
but it also is really good for the
bottom of your hair to kind of give you
that uniform little you know
curly-haired look there so thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and have a great
day
they'll hold it in there in your curling
iron for a second
whoa oh my gosh
something just absolutely sparked there
did you guys see that all right
everything's fine but there was a little
spark there I'm not sure how my curling
iron is still on so we'll just go with
this but something totally sparked here
the curling iron is still on and
everything's fine but
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
