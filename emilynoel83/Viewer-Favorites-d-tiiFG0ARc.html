for this video I have something I have
to show you look at this little guy it's
a little llama it's from my sister I
forgot to include this in my birth miss
hull if you haven't seen that video you
need to check it I was pretty funny but
she likes tuck this in one of my gifts
and i just love llamas like I think
they're just so kind of crazy and cute
and I just love this little guy it says
douglas on it so i'm not really sure
what that means if that means anything
to the stuffed animal lovers but i just
wanted to share him he's not going to be
I can't be my little beauty broadcast
mascot here at my desk but anyway I'm so
excited about this video I mean I was
pumped to do the emily awards but this
is something that's so unique because so
many times you'll see people getting on
youtube and say these are my favorite
products well i think those are great to
watch and I think we all really like
watching them but I was pumped to do
this because I got on my Facebook fan
page it's facebook.com slash beauty
broadcast not necessarily a fan page
with just like a page for beauty
broadcast that's different from my
personal page and I asked what of the
products that I have recommended on my
channel over time what sorts what things
have really worked well for you so like
a success story sort of if I counted
every email that I've had saying you
know I tried this and it worked awesome
if I wish I had counted all those over
time because it's you know I get a lot
of great feedback from you guys letting
me know what things that I've
recommended have worked and so this was
a neat way for me to sort of get once
again a sense of that I got tons of
comments on this and I just got dozens
of products brought up that I've
recommended some I was like oh yeah I
did recommend that o.o like a long time
back but basically what I've compiled is
a list of the top 10 things that you
guys all put down as the most successful
products that you've tried that I've
recommended so it's sort of like viewer
favorites from the products I've brought
up in my videos so here you're going to
be seeing not just what I like I mean
they're all products that I
like because I've included them in
videos before but what has worked for a
lot of people so that should really tell
you something from this it'll also have
a little comments scrolling as I talk
about each thing across the bottom just
you know thoughts from people on the
different products taken directly from
my facebook page so that's exciting so
first off number ten is actually three
products tied for number ten and I'm not
going to get into too much detail I've
reviewed all of the things I'm talking
about talked about that at some point in
time or another so you can just go on my
channel search through and find links to
more info but at ten the three-way tie
is two faced shadow insurance one of my
favorite favorite eye primers I'm glad
to see that's Kyle on the Milani
minerals blush in specifically in my
time but I think some people found
shades that they enjoyed themselves as
well but this one has gotten a lot of
love it's like a peachy pink blush from
Milani that's available at Sherri
culture calm and also in tenth place is
the almay one coat nourishing mascara
triple effect this is that neat brush
that has like the longer bristles and
the shorter ones to really give you not
only a lengthened effect but a thickened
look as well that's that brush talked
about it in the emily awards and so many
of you have really really gotten behind
this mascara so that's nice to hear that
it's really not only worked for me but
it's worked for you to number nine the
palladio herbal tinted lip balm i'm glad
to see this hasn't been out there for
that long like i haven't been talking
about it for that long what I have
talked about I've been very passionate
about it but it's nice to see that it
has also caught on amongst the viewers
there's a lot of different shades that's
available at sally beauty supply it's
just known for being very moisturizing
but also having a lot of great color and
getting almost like a lipstick finish
but a definite lip balm feel it's one of
the few products that can really pull it
off and give you a you know both both
ends of the deal there number 8 the elf
eyelash curler probably one of my most
talked-about tools are most raved about
tools because I just feel like this
really is user
they easy to hold on to it fits your eye
and you just get really nicely curled
lashes with that so love my elf eyelash
curler and it's only a dollar as well
number seven you guys love the Revlon
Colorstay foundation this really has a
following and it's neat because it does
come in both combo to oily skin and
normal to dry so there's two
formulations and a pretty good color
range as well and there's also an SPF
with this so this all-around has a lot
of there's a lot of reasons why I think
this product worked for a lot of
different people so glad to hear your
feedback on Revlon Colorstay coming in
at number six for you is the Rimmel fix
and perfect primer this is probably my
favorite drugstore primer I like
Smashbox photo finish but I like this so
very much as well really gives you a
nice smooth canvas to put your
foundation down on helps it last longer
and helps it go on more smoothly so glad
to hear your feedback on Rimmel fix
imperfect and then coming in at number
five is a palette from Coastal Scents I
guess this is the one that really caught
on with a lot of you and it is the 88
warm palette I don't show you too much
by showing you the top of the palette
but that's what the inside looks like
it's just a you know neutral heaven for
those of us that like the neutral shades
of course you can get smoky you can get
bronzy and brown and everything in
between so that's a much-loved palette
so I'm glad that's worked so well and
it's not really that big of a surprise
because it does have such a great color
variety in there if you can't find some
neutral shades in that palette that you
like then I don't know where you're
going to find them in at number 4 is the
NYC liquid eyeliner and this is a really
really great liquid option that is so
cheap in the drugstore and what you're
working with with this is a small brush
applicator it's very very fine and this
has really great staying power it's very
bold and black so I've really
recommended this for people who are
really trying to pinch pennies but still
come up with a great liquid eyeliner
that's not going to flake out on them
and
it's going to wear well throughout the
day number three is rimmel's lasting
finish foundation I have loved this
foundation I am so glad it's worked well
one of the downfalls that I have heard
about this over time from people is that
the color selection there's not like a
ton of shades to choose from for some
people if they do happen to have your
right shade that makes it easier because
it's like okay I'm either this this or
this and you know it's easy to pick I'm
200 soft beige but this is a mineral
enriched foundation it's a 16 hour wear
that's kind of what revlon colorstay
promises as well so both of these work
very well in terms of staying power this
goes on extremely smooth and you might
find it even easier to blend than Revlon
Colorstay I think I think rimmel has a
little edge on it in terms of that
aspect that the Revlon Colorstay has two
different kinds of formulations and it
has a greater variety of shades but
either way you can't go wrong with those
foundations they're from the drugstore
they're very inexpensive and you're
going to find something you like among
those in at number two revlon colorstay
liquid and pencil liners some people
didn't specify that didn't specify they
just said i like revlon liner or you
said I like Revlon colors you know
liquid or penciler I can't talk anymore
so but you like these liners so I just
lump them together you might be
wondering what what makes that revlon
colorstay liquid liner that much
different from the NYC and the truth is
they're not that different I just
dropped that someone pick up there
they're quite a bit they're very similar
um revlon colorstay you're going to get
a few more shades out of this like
there's a black shimmer and white brown
and I think some other colors that you
can get this in but this is sort of a
matter of preference with application to
with the NYC you're getting a really
long handled applicator and it's a brush
and with the the Revlon Colorstay few
like to hold closer to where you're
applying that liner at like if you'd
like to be in closer and maybe have a
little
bit more control you have this tip that
is not a brush it's just like a felt tip
sort of that goes down and your little
ink well as i like to call it and then
of course the revlon pencil liners you
know if you want a great long wearing
look you put one on the top lashline
being the liquid and then you put the
pencil on the bottom top it off with a
powder and you are good to go for the
day I am really I over the past year
I've really branched out in terms of the
different colors that the pencil is
available in and feel like I'm
conducting here there's a teal shade
there's blackberry black brown black um
I think there's a navy shade that I
haven't tried but um good good liners
now we are moving on to number one and
for this I gotta say I have some
bittersweet news first off I'm happy
that NYC smooth skin bronzing face
powder in sunny it's a matte bronzer and
I'm glad it has worked so well for so
many of you this has gotten a huge huge
response you can just tell by mine yeah
this is a loved product this is a matte
bronzer that for the Mifare viewers out
there you guys love this even if people
have a little deeper skin tone this is a
great way to still perk it up by wearing
it all over your face it's not going to
get you shimmery and shiny it actually
has sort of an oil absorbing quality to
it which is sort of unique with all the
different bronzers there are out there
however I noticed I heard from my
sister-in-law Sarah who has a YouTube
channel you should check that out but
anyway I heard from her and that she was
having a hard time finding the NYC sunny
in her stores sure enough I was looking
at my local walmart the other day and it
was not there and this is kind of sad I
mean this this isn't sad on a scale of
like what all the sad things that are
happening in the world right now but to
make up lovers who love this product it
has said um because this is getting
discontinued I know that for a fact
because I called NYC I decided that if I
was going to bring this up in this video
I owed it to you guys to know for sure
whether it's getting discontinued or not
I stayed on hold for about 10 or 15
minutes
on the line with NYC makeup and they did
tell me it is getting discontinued I
asked if it would be replaced with a
similar product but she said well no we
have the mosaic bronzers and we have the
Sun to Sun bronzers which is like a
really dark shade and a really light
shimmery shade together and one the
mosaic it's like a bunch of different
colors mixed into one and so I was
really bummed that I told her I was like
I'm sad because that like she really
wanted to hear this but I was I told her
you know like I've recommended this to a
lot of people and it's got a really big
following so I'm sad to see that it's
you know saying bye-bye at the store but
the good news out of this video is I'm
going to give some recommendations to
the many people out there that love that
in my see bronzer and as you see this
start to fade from your stores and maybe
you're not at you picked up the last
couple but we all know we go through
them fast and you want some other things
to crime so I'm going to give you some
recommendations in place of that that I
think are pretty pretty close one of the
closest ones is from Rimmel it's the
natural bronzer this is something I
think I recommended to my friend kaylee
who we were in a store that didn't sell
NYC and I wanted to get her something
like that this was what we went for she
loves it it's the natural bronzer it has
natural minerals in it as well there are
a couple of shades here they're nice I
have two and they look very similar
shade wise Sundance has a little bit of
shimmer to it I don't know if you can
see that but there's a little shimmer
it's not a lot it does not come off as a
lot on your face but it's a little bit
so that's not exactly like NYC smooth
skin but sunlight is pretty close and
there's no shimmer in this so this is
sunlight let me open up my smooth skin
here they are very very close to the
same same type of shade so there's an
option for you another option you have
as well as from Milani the sunset duo's
have a really nice matte brown
with them they come with a little swath
of blush which you can see I didn't use
much of and then the bronzer there's
lots of different shades they're all
really good some have varying depths of
how dark that bronzer is but it's matt
and it's very easy to use they also have
just a regular bronzing powder in light
that's extremely close to the NYC smooth
skin as well when you're talking matt
bronzers and a lot you just showing you
the side by side here is going to tell
you a lot in terms of how close they are
there you see these are very very
similar products and if you are
definitely on listening to this and
you're definitely on the fair side of
things consider the elf warm bronzer
it's a studio line product available on
their website and no this doesn't look
at all like NYC but these colors blend
it together together will give you that
sort of light bronze that is good for a
fair complexion so hopefully you got
some ideas from that I will continue to
be watching out for either places that
have that still have the NYC sunny or
products that are very comparable i was
at meijer near my sister's house last
weekend and they still had some NYC
sony's so but yeah definitely sad to
hear that go but I I got your back
everyone I'm going to be watching for it
so thank you so much for responding to
my facebook question that I posed about
what are the best products that you've
tried that I've recommended so happy to
hear that so many things have worked
well many people posted more than one
thing and that's awesome and I'll
continue to keep an eye on emails see
what's popular and maybe update videos
like this again because i think it you
know it's nice if I like it or whatever
but it's really cool to hear that one of
these things has worked well for lots of
different people so thanks again so much
for tuning in guys and have a wonderful
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
