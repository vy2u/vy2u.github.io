not important Shelly hi everyone we're
back it's me and Tyler again I thought
it involved Tyler in this video because
he had a few spare moments and um I'm
here for no functional purpose at all
what I was just sitting over there he's
actually gonna kind of be my Zanna white
here in a second we've we've had a
pretty good weekend didn't we yeah it
was good wasn't driving lots of driving
we had to drive like eight hours to Des
Moines to go to a wedding of a couple of
our friends from college and it was
really really fun but it was like a
total of sixteen hours on the road so
that's kind of why I didn't get any new
videos up but I do have some that are
waiting to get up the hotel didn't have
any internet what's up with that it was
a really nice hotel but it was like I I
didn't get wireless there and I don't
quite know why um but you can imagine i
tried for you guys so this won't happen
not sure the laptop we had to carry the
laptop bag which was kind of heavy but
anyway um what else we get new
announcements and he hitting new
announcements Oh join the facebook fan
page for beauty broadcast Tyler has
whether he wants to admit it or not it's
true I think people are confirmed I
think people are more fans of you than
you are a beauty run kids don't even
have a fan page maybe I need to work on
well you can get there if you don't know
how to get there um go to your Facebook
page you have to have a facebook account
to which a lot of people have and
there's a little search box in the
corner of your facebook type beauty
broadcast and my page will come up and
you can save the advanced search page
don't didn't facebook at the new thing
where you can do www.facebook.com you do
that I'll look into that by the way so
so that then it'll be even easier to get
there
but anyway what I do there's I update it
with all the pretty much all the new
videos I do so it's kind of like a wool
&amp;amp; blogs and just random stuff so it's
kind of a one-stop shop to learn more
about what's going on with Beauty
broadcast so anyway expect many more new
blogs and videos this week right right
ok well now let's get to the results we
have four winners as I said and Tyler go
ahead and show them what they've won
runaway collection run away run away no

run away is it I'd be a little more
interesting they're the nails from from
Revlon those pretty little nails with
the decorative tips and what are those
three yeah we got some we got three
revlon fantasy lengths false eyelashes
and they're all different aren't they
we've got flirty intensifying and lush

offending anyways so that's your price
