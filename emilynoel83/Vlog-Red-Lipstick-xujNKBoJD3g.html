this video it's a vlog as you can see I
haven't really done one of those before
but I guess that's what people put when
they're you know kind of going off the
makeup topic a little bit which I am
today um I just kind of thought this was
necessary to bring up because it just
it's kind of been affecting me and I
haven't done videos for a few days here
and so I thought maybe um many of you
who have who I've kind of grown close to
and who have really been my friends
through this YouTube adventure I thought
you might be interested or care about it
so I thought I would bring it up my
grandma recently passed away um we all
called her ma who she was such a nice
lady and um and I've been at her at her
funeral and gone back home for a few
days her cut really not as long as I
wanted to because I had to come back and
go to work but um it's just it just was
a very sad time for me and my family um
she was nearly 90 years old so I mean
she loved a really long life but um she
was just a would just one of those
people you don't forget you know and so
I guess I just wanted to bring that up
and let you know that that had happened
and she kind of inspires me too because
she kind of got me thinking about
something that mom and I had talked
about because she had gone up this this
is my mom's mother I don't know if I
said that but um she would kind of take
care of her and get her ready for the
day and she said that ma always felt
better when she had her lipstick on and
her blush on and she just felt a whole
lot more confident and and perked up you
know it just it just kind of raised the
way she felt about herself even in this
picture I know she wasn't feeling well
here but she had her lipstick on and her
hair done and that was just the way she
always felt best and I kind of thought
that isn't that true isn't that true and
in life just I mean I'm not
trying to make too much light of a
serious situation but I just thought
that's one of the little things that
I'll remember about her and it just kind
of got me thinking that that's not just
her i think that's everybody and so it
kind of made me feel good about what I
was doing here with these videos and
things like that because I think my mom
had told her i was doing him and she
thought that was really neat and um so I
guess this one's for her so um and then
so I chose to do a topic about lipstick
man and I really would like to you don't
just kind of honor her and I I thought
you guys would care and because I feel
like you care about me and I care about
you all my subscribers so thank you um
thank you for tuning in and thanks for
watching this and um for now I'm going
to go on and go on with my video now so
um it's about red lipstick because I
know that I've had quite a few questions
like what's some good red lipstick you
know and so I thought I would just go
ahead and suggest some for you today
because like I said this was something
mall really liked this lipstick so um
I'll go just go through a few the one
that I'm wearing right now as you can
see it's like a true red shade and it's
from nicks or NYX and the color is he be
a chibi e and this is available at
cherry culture calm and as you can see
it's a true red color but it does have a
little bit of shimmer to it and actually
a little bit of gold undertones to it
which I'm surprised because it's almost
like a warmer red instead of a cool red
and I generally gravitate towards cooler
tones of red but this one really works
nice and I feel like it's not over the
top I feel like I can you know get away
with wearing it and not be too too loud
with it I guess so i just wanted to show
you that one in case you thought well
that looks totally red not you know a
step down from red
another one to show you this is chaos
from NYX and this is that's my serious
forehead shade this this one just is you
know all out red there is no shimmer to
it it's just a creme lipstick and so if
you're going for you know fire engine
red that one that one is the one but
like I said for a more wearable one on a
daily basis I like he be there it just
adds a little little hint of shimmer to
it and a little bit of a golden the
undertone that makes it more wearable
for a lot of people another option that
is available probably right at your
local drugstore or walmart is NYC in
sheer red and it is their ultra moist
lip where so i think this runs only
about a dollar so but as you can see
this is a little step darker just by
comparison with you know these other
shades it's just got a little more
darkness to it and just a slight bit
more of a berry tone but it's still red
and i didn't i wanted to focus this on
red not on like berries Burgundy's or
anything like that I really wanted to
keep it at red and I thought this is
kind of right on the verge of it so I
wanted to tell you about that so if you
like it just a little step darker that
would work another good lipstick is this
Maybelline I think this is moisture wear
lip color in scarlet simmer this is kind
of close to that nyx he be shade only
it's got let me just compare it i'm here
together side by side um it's got a
little more of a darker burgundy
undertone to it whereas this might be a
little bit more of the orange undertone
this this might have more the blue
undertones i know it's kind of hard to
look at read and think blue undertone
but that's kind of what people say about
it and then those blue undertones often
make your lips or your teeth look really
really white and this one is I mean I
feel like it's making my teeth look
white that chaos shade but it could be
the special kind of white strips I have
which I'm going to be doing a video
on and I'm really excited about those so
anyway those are just four lipsticks
that I like that are red and then i have
three lip glosses and i find that red
lip gloss is kind of like true red lip
color lip gloss is kind of hard to come
by and so I have a few and the one
that's my very favorite unfortunately is
not a regular part of Revlon super
lustrous lip gloss line the shade is get
ready and the reason why I'm still
bringing it up is because I think it may
still be available at your local big
lots if you check that out they often
carry some discontinued or you know
holiday shades of of Revlon super
lustrous and I like wearing this one
right on top of that but I think it
makes a great red lip there and yeah the
shade is get ready and if you look
closely at it I mean there is some
shimmer to it it's just pretty it's
pretty alone to you wouldn't have to
wear that over anything that could be
kind of like a liquid lipstick but like
I said I'm bringing it up in case maybe
you do run across it elsewhere and and
you know one to look out for it's a it's
a special find if you find one you know
one or two get them both because you'll
want them this next one is from number
seven boots number seven I think is the
brand I found it at Target and its high
shine lipgloss in lust number 30 and so
this is just an ice cream color it has
very very fine sparkle to it and if i
were to swatch it for you can see it's
kind of got that nice creamy texture but
you can see the shine and when i turn my
hands so that's a really really nice one
too on of the two this one is less
sparkly and more just to cream the
sparkle is very subtle but if you do
like more Sparkle and you're going on
the very very very affordable side wet
and wild mega slicks in red sensation I
really like this color I don't wear it
as often because i feel like the glitter
is slightly more than i want on a
regular basis but it still works
and it would be the second it would be
this one right here and you can see it's
got great shine it actually comes off a
little bit sheer I know you can't it
just looks like two red stripes on my
hands but it's slightly shearer than the
other one and just does have some kind
of I don't know if you can see there but
it does have some definite red glitter
in there so um anyway that's sort of
just my pics on red lipstick and lip
gloss um like I said it's kind of an
inspired recommendation video I guess
you'd say just thank you so much for
caring everybody in for watching this
video and and I just I guess at times
like this you know you just really try
to you think a little bit more about
every day you have and how much are you
really enjoying it while you're here you
know and I know this video is getting
kind of deep but um I just you know just
something to think about so anyway thank
you guys so much for watching and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
