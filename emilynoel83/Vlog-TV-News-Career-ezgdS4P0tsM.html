into this video I'm just gonna warn you
upfront this is not a makeup video so if
that's what you were hoping for you
might be a little disappointed here
although it is on a topic that has been
requested quite a bit and I decided I
would try tackling it in one video
although this may roll into numerous
videos but basically it's how do you get
into the news business what does it take
and so I thought I would begin to answer
that question here because in case
you're just tuning in to me for the
first time I am a news anchor slash
reporter at a local TV station where I
live and it's a really fun job it offers
some amazing opportunities to meet new
people and go great places but there are
some things you need to know and some
things you need to be willing to ask
yourself before you head down that path
so first off I just wanted to start by
giving you some of those questions to
sort of you know food for thought um and
the first thing is do you like doing
something different every day because
that is generally what the job of a
reporter is you know you go in there and
although your title is reporter and you
know maybe your shift runs from 9:00 to
5:00
it may be drastically different from one
day to the next you may have to stay
light you may be called in early because
something big happened you may have a
story all set up and planned and then
something bigger came about and you have
to switch gears so you know are you a
flexible person would you enjoy doing
something different every day because I
think to a lot of people you think oh
wow something different every day and
you see that as a really great thing but
in actuality it's a challenge and it can
be stressful so just be aware of that
you know sometimes I long for that you
know day to day some consistency with
each day and I've gotten that more so as
I've gotten into full time anchoring and
then kind of reporting on the side but
it is it is something to get used to so
be aware of that also are you kind of a
naturally curious person are you you
have that inquisitive nature to you when
you hear about something or someone
tells you a story you instantly kind of
have some questions like well why did
happen or how did this happen are you
comfortable going up to people and
asking them questions just meeting new
people and introducing yourself I mean
we have stories where we do something
called mos is there man on the street
interviews where say we want people's
take on gas prices so we're gonna go up
to a gas station and you're gonna walk
right up to somebody and say hi sir my
name is Emily I'm doing a story on gas
prices I was just wondering if you'd
give us your opinion about it and
sometimes you're gonna get shot down
sometimes people won't even look at you
and they'll walk away from you you have
to be comfortable with that and keep
that smile on your face and move on to
the next person you know so you have to
have sort of that persistence but that
willingness to ask questions be curious
about a given topic not saying that you
can't learn those things and acquire
those skills but if you do have that
natural curiosity and a willingness to
ask questions of people it will help you
in this career um another thing this is
a big one are you content with working
your way up with not getting that
initial position you wanted say you
really wanted to be a reporter or an
anchor but you know where you lived or
where you wanted to live or the
situation you were in that was just not
available at the time that's exactly
what happened for me with my husband
attending law school where we lived we
knew we would be in this town and there
was one one TV station within driving
distance for me so I had to make that
station work and at the time they did
not have a position open that I truly
wanted but then I asked myself how bad
do I really want that position and if I
wanted it bad enough I would take
whatever I could get to get my foot in
the door prove to them that I was a good
worker and then worked my way up into it
and it's exactly the way it worked for
me so you have to be willing to go
behind the scenes and do they do the
camera and editing and all these other
tasks that you might think oh that
really wasn't what my goal was well you
know it really builds a lot of character
and a good work ethic if you can if you
are willing to do those things and step
up and say you know I'm just learning
you know and that's you have to start
somewhere and many people in this
business who have made it big will tell
you that they did not start big so
that's a good thing to keep in mind
there we kind of talked about the having
confidence being able to watch just walk
up new people and approach people meet
new people and really make them feel at
ease that's another thing it's not just
a matter of going up to someone and
asking them a question but making them
feel like they can talk to you like they
can trust you that's another one of
those skills that you sort of learn in
time also you just generally enjoy
writing and you have a creative side to
yourself I have always liked writing so
doing stories I mean writing is a big
big part of it I think people see the on
camera side of this so much you know
they see a reporter standing in front of
a camera or doing a live report where
they're you know showing you how deep
the snow is or whatever and it just
seems like a whole performance aspect
but it's not there's a lot of writing
that goes goes into you know what a
reporter's job or an anchors job is so
you really enjoying that helps if you if
this is what you want gonna get into now
that I've gone through a few questions
that you might want to sort of have in
the back of your mind if you're thinking
about a career in news I want to give
you some tips if you know this is where
you want to go and you're maybe in high
school or college and this is something
that you want to study my first tip is
to watch the news daily and I'm not just
saying watch CNN news or the best news
you can come up with watch your local
news watch anything you can really get
your eyes on because it's a good idea to
not only watch the good things but the
bad things because you see what you like
and don't like about the way other
people do things watch you watch the
news with a different perspective turn
on the news tonight and and don't just
watch what stories are doing it or what
the person's wearing or what their hair
looks like think about how they say
their words how they communicate with
the other person they're on set
with the way they changed their tone for
a serious story or a sad story to
something more conversational and happy
see how these things flow together I
used to watch the news as a very very
small child like when I would get ready
for school I remember I would sit down
you know if I was eating my breakfast or
something I would sit down and just
watch the news and so I got a sense very
early on of what I liked and didn't like
and so I think that helped me develop
the way I am in news so that's something
that you can start at any point in time
so if your high school or if you're a
college student and you're thinking this
is something I want to do turn on your
news and watch it also read your
newspapers because it never hurts to
start getting informed getting a feel
for general terminology that you would
never think you'd have to know about the
difference between a sheriff's
department and the police department and
just all these little little terms that
you deal with when you're covering local
news in small towns and counties around
you know reading a paper will sort of
get you in tune with that get all the
public speaking experience you can and
high school that's gonna come from
speech classes so treat those speeches
through them more seriously than maybe
some of your other classmates would and
do the same in your college classes just
anytime that you are out in front of
people
seize that opportunity some of you might
be involved in sports or things like
cheerleading or dance I was a
cheerleader in the past and I found that
that helped build a lot of confidence
for me that I might not have already had
otherwise had so take advantage of those
confidence building public opportunities
College you're gonna have obviously
those journalism cat classes
broadcasting classes that you want to
take but a little-known thing here is I
think to take a wide range of classes I
went to a liberal arts college so that
meant that the philosophy there was you
take many different courses in a lot of
different areas and at the time you're
kind of thinking oh what do I need you
know this class for that class for but
in actuality
in news you have to know a little bit
about a lot of things and in some cases
a lot about a lot of things so if you
take a wide range of courses you're
gonna be a more well-rounded person and
I mean think about it you could be
reporting on any number of topics so you
need to know you having a basic
knowledge is going to serve you very
well so really spread spread your net
wide in terms of classes that you take
get an internship if you're a college
student you need to have an internship
before you graduate if you're at a small
station like I interned at in my my
hometown it was a very small station
they wanted their interns to really do
the work of reporters it was not paid
don't plan on getting a paid news
internship but the smaller the station
that more chance you're gonna get
hands-on work I was able to create a
resume tape which is something you'll
leave when you apply for a job it's
basically a tape showing all of your
work all the things you've done on
camera your stories and things like that
and I was able to create my resume tape
based on my internship some people may
do that based on their college station
that they work at but that internship is
giving you real-world experience at a
real station and that will really be the
the turning point in your mind as to
whether or not you want to do this
seeing what it's like at a real TV
station so definitely get that before
you try to pursue a job and it will help
you a lot also great for a resume too
this is one of the biggest things have
persistence in job hunting do not give
up the first time you're told that
there's no openings because you can
really get your foot in the door
somewhere and do a good job and just
show that you have a willingness to
learn any any skill it was it comes back
to that where I said are you content
with working your way up you kind of
have to be in this business and that is
one of the biggest things I can tell you
so thank you guys so much for watching
let me know if you have any questions
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
