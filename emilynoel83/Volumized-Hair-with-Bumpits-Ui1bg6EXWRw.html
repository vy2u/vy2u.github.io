looks with bump it's in the past I'm
going to link to those in the sidebar
but I've shown how you can wear your
hair half up in a ponytail with a
headband with the mini bum pants and I
realized I didn't do the no-brainer
which was just how do you wear your hair
down with the bump and so to see how I
pulled it off keep on step one is to
figure out where the hair in your crown
is so what I did first is go ahead and
part your hair wherever you like to part
it if it's a side part just go well
actually this is kind of something that
the style is designed to be a side part
that I'm going to show you here so go
ahead and part your hair on the side I
like to use just any comb like this to
do that with and then right behind that
part you can see I've got it parted up a
few inches there I'm just kind of
combing straight back from the hair
that's behind that sort of like in that
zone right there okay I'm going to
pulling it back and I'm kind of throwing
it over my hand okay and I'm not pulling
back too far I'm just pulling up about
this much so this is where it stops this
is where it begins pulling it straight
up in the air just kind of smoothing it
out and I'm going to take that same comb
that I used to part with and I'm going
to rat it about five times one two three
four five and keeping that fairly close
to the roots of the hair there I'm gonna
give it one spritz of hairspray again
this is for a really kind of long
wearing bump it's like to really hold it
in there once you put the bump it in I'm
gonna place it right behind what I've
pulled back and I'm gonna wiggle it back
and forth a little bit there's little
teeth in the bump it's that are designed
to really grab onto your hair but you do
have to kind of wiggle it around the
little tube really make us say
especially if you have fine hair like
mine so do that pull the hair down okay
and now you've got volume so go ahead
and give that a couple spritzes of spray
here - - and now we're going to think
about what we're gonna do for the mini
bump that's because we've got this great
volume in the crown but two other places
where I want volume are right in here
and right here okay so I'm gonna pull up
this hair that's sort of right in this
area here on that side of the part I'm
gonna give that a little tease
one two three four five mini bump it
very small just like that put it right
behind parallel to the to the part so
the parts going this way that's the same
direction that bump that's going wiggle
it back and forth really get it right
there like you're giving yourself a
scalp massage and let this hair come
right down over top see how now we've
blended and we have like a seamless sort
of shape going on here I'm using a
hairpin like this you can buy these at
Sally's I use these a lot after I what
kind of tease my hair up at all and then
I kind of use it to sort of reshape the
look so that can be helpful when sort of
blending this all together but after you
do that definitely give it a spritz of
hairspray and back side is done on the
other side here I'm pulling up the hair
right here sort of half of what was
going over this bump itand but I want
the height still to continue to be sort
of in this dome right here on our crown
and surrounding areas I'm going to take
my comb rat it a little bit right down
there next to the roots okay take the
mini bump it place it right behind that
hair we're keeping it parallel to this
part that you're seeing going right
there kind of wiggle it just a tad get
it right down there in the crown and
then we're just smoothing the hair down
on top just like that I like to use a
little pin because it doesn't do too
much with the hair in it and it doesn't
interfere with the bump it's okay so you
can kind of give your hair just a little
bit of lift with that pin if you want to
and just pull the hair wherever looks
right to you you know kook I kind of
like treat this is my middle section and
then it's all kind of coming out from
there so that is my hair down look using
the bump it's you can see all the way
around that gives it a little more
blended look you'd think you could just
have your hair down and toss one right
up in your crown but if you have fine
hair like mine anything that's not
laying on top of the bump but kind of
wants to go flat to your head so that's
why we put the mini buck that you'll
remember right here right on right there
and right there and then the big one
right in our
any sort of situation where you feel
like this may not be secure there are a
couple things you can do you can take
bobby pins and actually bobby pin the
bump it to your head if you wanted to
that's an option or just do a half up
style and kind of secure this back like
that you could make a little ponytail
out of it or just have half of it up
this is a style if you're doing a dressy
occasion and you really want to have
that look of body and volume give it a
try so thanks for watching guys have a
great thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
