going to be a quick and pretty easy hair
tutorial on how to get some waves in
your hair some curls but also some
volume as well I'm going to be using a
new tool that I have that I'm really
liking it's from Bed Head and it's
called the rock and roller I bought mine
from Target I think it was a little less
than 30 bucks and it also does come with
a little glove I'm not so fond of using
the glove because I just think it's hard
to grip my hair with it but it does have
that if you want to use it when you're
wrapping your hair around but in this
video I'll show you how we ended up with
this style and also a little variation
on the look as well okay so for my first
step I'm just going to pull up part of
my hair so I don't have quite as much to
work with as well at one time with this
wand there are a few different looks you
can get just with this as far as
twisting your hair around this I usually
like to wrap away from my face and you
can go on top of the bubbles if you want
maybe a little bit bigger wave you can
go in between each one if you want more
of a tighter spiral curl for me I just
kind of start wrapping my hair and
whatever it does is what it does just
going to start on this side pull out
about this much hair if you did a really
big section you would get looser waves
all around if you do smaller sections
you're gonna get tighter waves that
tends to be the way it is with any
curling iron you're using and so then I
just start wrapping around here and now
here's the kind of curl we're getting
you know you can see it's wavy it might
be a little irregular and I think that's
kind of what this is all about you know
it's funky waves I think the packaging
said so a little bit different and I'm
just gonna continue that all around this
half of my hair so I just wanted to
mention that I do have two other wands
they are the Remington t studio pearl I
believe I got them from like Target or
Walmart and they're the light pink ones
I have a larger size in a smaller size
and I really like those but one thing I
do run into when I use them is that
because they're sort of cone shaped
they're just smooth and tapered at the
tip sometimes my hair will go all the
way to one end
the wand and so then you just end up
wrapping the hair on top of itself a
cool thing about this is that because it
has these segments when you wrap your
hair it ends up you know starting at one
point in the wand and going all the way
to the end without shifting or rolling
on top of itself and that kind of thing
so I don't know if that makes sense but
it does make this easier to use so I am
just gonna continue wrapping my hair
around all right so now I've curled each
side here um so I'm gonna undo my clip
and then I kind of at this point think
about how I'm gonna part my hair if I
want a side part for example I go ahead
and part it off because I think it kind
of affects the way you curl the hair you
know like curling away from your face
and you know getting just the right kind
of curl you want right around your face
so I do go ahead and separate that at
this point then you could do a middle
part of course or whatever you want but
then I just go on curling and again I
try to keep it all going the same way so
I'm once again curling away from my face
this part right here I usually don't
want this to be quite as curled up as
the rest of my hair so for that I don't
really wrap it it's tight like I'm just
not holding the hair as tightly so it's
just around the whole wand and then not
holding it on there too long either so
you can see that turns out to be just a
little bit looser wave so now here we
are all over the head with a lot of
tight waves so I like to loosen this up
just a little bit when I style it so I
just brush through it all everything
instantly starts to look a little more
volumize and I still want the hair to
have a nice amount of shine so something
I love using a product I love using
alongside any sort of curling I do is
this product from got to be and it's
called kinkier I think I featured this
in a favorites video and it's gloss and
define curl cream so I just get a little
bit of this product just a small amount
here and I kind of rub it between my
hands and then I flip my head over and I
kind of work my fingers in at the roots
to my hair because I think this
volumizes my hair a little bit more
there's your Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader
move by the way and then I've still got
some in my hands so I just kind of go
over my hair and kind of scrunch it up a
little bit so there's your nice shiny
waves with some body if I'm really you
know wanting to get a style in place
before I go out or something what I'll
do is just tease it a little bit in a
couple of places first of all section
off like maybe an inch or so inch and a
half on the side of the part I spray
just a bit of hairspray there at the
root and then with my fine toothed comb
just gently tease a little bit right
there and then you can kind of comb down
over that and you can see you've just
got a little more lift there right at
the room and I do the same on this side
just kind of take that top section of
hair on this side of the part little
hairspray right at the root
and then give it just a little tease so
if you like to have the illusion of like
a little bit of a bang going across here
you can work with that a little bit
easier at least with my fine hair
whenever I tease it then I can really
start working with it and it'll start
doing what I want it to do instead of
what it wants to do so I just wanted to
point out one little variation you can
do like once your styles at this point a
little something you can do if you want
maybe some more structure to your hair
or you really want it a little bit back
from your face I like to take just a
couple of sections here like I'll take
the front part about this much hair
right here right off the front and then
I kind of like to twist that back away
from my face a little bit to right about
here on my head and then I take a few
bobby pins just a couple actually I put
one in to really secure it and then I
like to overlap one because you know who
wants it going anywhere then I do kind
of the same thing over here I just pull
a little bit of the hair up from above
my ear and then some of the hair from
that top bang part that I had going
across the same idea I'm just kind of
twisting it back and pinning it sort of
right back here on the side of my head
and I'm gonna take two bobby pins again
and get those in there and overlap the
other and then if you want a little more
lift up here you can take your comb the
end of your teasing comb and just give a
little bit more to this top part if you
just want the look of a little more body
and then just give that a quick spray
and you're done so I hope you guys
enjoyed this little two in one tutorial
I feel like whenever I use this wand the
curls really do last a long time I can
get second maybe even third day hair out
of these curls and that's saying a lot
for my really fine hair that doesn't
even like to hold the curl very well
thank you so much for taking time to
watch and I'll see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
