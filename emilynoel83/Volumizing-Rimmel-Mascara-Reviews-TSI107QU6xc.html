today on actually a requested review on
Rimmel volume flash mousse mascara but
because I tend to like to put products
kind of up against one another I think
it makes my feelings on the reviewable
clearer to you all when I compare it to
something plus instead of just hearing
about one products you're about two or
three so I'm gonna put it up against
another mascara that Rimmel has it's
called extra super lash mascara it's
been around for quite some time the
price difference here this is going to
cost you the volume flash mousse is
around six dollars and this extra super
lash is less than two dollars okay so
there's the difference there is to run
down the claims I guess this volume
flash mousse mascara is it says it's an
air whipped volumizing mascara they do
have volume flash without the mousse and
I haven't tried that before I just was
really curious because they've got like
mousse foundations mousse quash mousse
eyeshadow I thought wow mascara that's
crazy
so the color I have is extreme black
here's a look at the brush you're gonna
get kind of a traditional volumizing
mascara type of brush now the formula
that is on there it is like to the touch
to put it on your skin you can tell that
that is a lighter formula and they say
it's mousse it it is sort of that
lighter air whipped kind of idea there
as far as this other mascara it's extra
super lash it's just a says build a
natural to dramatic look super lash
separation suitable for sensitive eyes
this product can really be as much as
you want it to be if you want to put
several coats on you're gonna get big
lashes if you want one coat it's going
to be a little more natural now I don't
know how well you can tell but at the
tip of this mascara wand it's a little
bit smaller and then it gets a little
wider out towards
the end and I really like that because
you can get in very nicely to your
smaller lashes shorter lashes in on the
inside towards your nose so what do I
think about these well the concept of a
light a lighter weight mascara sounds
like a good thing if you're going to put
it on if you're gonna curl your
eyelashes logically you would think well
if this is lighter it's going to maybe
hold that curl not weigh them down not
straighten them back out again so I
thought that was a really neat concept
and I can tell I put this on this volume
flash mousse when I put it on it is
lighter even after a few coats it's
still lighter but it doesn't necessarily
build on itself in the greatest way you
know how sometimes you put on one coat
or something and it looks alright you
put on a second coat because you want a
little more volume and you get a funky
end sort of thing going on this doesn't
give you an immediate funky end if you
know what I mean you know there's little
like microfibers that are almost not you
know following along with the curve of
the lash they're like sticking off in
the wrong direction but as this wears I
have had some issues noticing that later
on so that I found to be kind of a
little disappointing about it and then
my question is I kept using this is how
important is a lightweight mascara is a
lightweight meant Matthew claims to be
lightweight really going to be that
different from a traditional mascara
because you know you put it on your
eyelashes are always gonna be you know
extremely extremely light they're you
know you're there your eyelashes they're
tiny tiny hairs and so anything you put
on them is gonna give him a certain
amount of weight you know so this it
didn't I didn't have smudging issues but
like I said it didn't give me quite the
volume I wanted in one coat so with
multiple coats I didn't think it built
on itself quite that well
now the extra super lash keep in mind
this is the one that is you know less
than two dollars and I found that the
color intensity of the black now I got
these in the darkest I could this
one is extreme black and this one is
called black black
so the darkest shade possible and this
one turns out to be much darker on your
eyelashes okay this is like a very very
rich black formula and it really it
lengthens well it is probably a bit more
volumizing in the first coat than the
other one is I would say as far as how
impressed in line with either either of
these this is a very traditional formula
a very normal brush a normal you know
mascara type formula and for less than
two dollars I think this is the better
value than the volume flash mousse I
think they're trying to work the mousse
concept which has for if for some people
worked in a foundation form it's worked
in a blush form some people even like it
as an eye shadow and so they think why
don't we make it a mascara
I think that's perhaps one area where a
mousse really is not warranted if you
like a natural look on your lashes if
you're happy with one coat of mascara
and you want something that really does
feel like they're maybe if you have
sensitive eyes and you really want very
little on your eyes and you want the
feel of very little on your eyes this
might be a good thing for you but as for
me I really have a mascara person I like
quite a bit of it and so I want
something that I can if I choose it can
wear multiple coats and it needs to be
able to wear those coats one on top of
the other without changing the
appearance of the eyelash in a negative
way you know like what the ends and all
that and so this extra super lash really
extra I guess the more I say that it's
kind of ridiculous extra super lash oh
my gosh
but it's good it's really it really is
buildable as the product claims to be
built the natural to dramatic look and I
would say that's very correct there it
it wears a long time I haven't had
issues with this smudging late in the
day granted I'm not like you know a rock
climber for my profession so I don't
necessarily put it through the worst
test I guess but I am out in the
elements throughout the day you know
sometimes in the office sometimes out
doing a story or something and I think a
pretty fair test and like I said it just
kind of depends on what you want and
what you personally like if you're a
volume person and you know having a
weight lift mascara doesn't really
matter to you go for something a little
more heavy duty on that side but if you
do like something like you might like
the volume flash though let me know if
you've tried either these I'd love to
hear if my views are the same as yours
or vice versa
so I hope you have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
