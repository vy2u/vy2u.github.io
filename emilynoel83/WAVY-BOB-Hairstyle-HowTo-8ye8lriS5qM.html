about what I do to get curl in this
short bob hairstyle that I have so
that's what I'm going to be showing you
in this video so starting off with my
straight hair obviously in terms of my
cut I have a bob that is like all one
length around the bottom and then it's
got a little bit of a layer up but it's
a very long layer so I don't have like
super short ends up in here or anything
and it definitely has grown a little bit
since the initial haircut but I do feel
like the length that is that right now
it's kind of nice because I think it
really responds well to the curls and
just the length that it sort of falls at
once the curls are in I really like that
look so I've already got a heat
protectant kind of work through my hair
and the first thing I do before I curl
is I just section off half of it and
just get that out of the way up on top
of my head and then the ones that I'm
using is this Remington T Studio pearl
styling wand I have two of these and
there's a larger size and then this is
the smaller of the two I've had this for
quite some time
this really is a tool that I can use in
my hair and the curl actually stays I
have hair that wants to be just
extremely straight and in a lot of
situations curling irons you know things
will look great right after I've styled
it but it just will not hold the curl
this for whatever reason holds the curl
really well and it is kind of a tight
curl as you can see I mean it tapers to
quite a small tip and so when I'm
curling my hair all over my head be it
the top section bottom section I've got
the ends of my hair wrapping around the
smallest part here so that's kind of
giving me I think a little bit more
volume eyes duay at closer to my root
and then the tighter curl toward the end
yeah this is a total like tried and true
used it for years type of styling tool
love that Paul Mitchell hot off the
press that's the thing that I sort of
spray all over my hair before I get
started and not only does that protect
the hair from heat but I feel like it
also reacts a little bit as its being
curled and that
does help hold the curl too so anyways
got this little guy here and I just wrap
my hair around the wand and as you can
see ends will pop out this is a very
imperfect style hairs going every which
way it I really like it most when there
are just some unruly ends and it really
depends on how much hair you put around
your iron and how long you leave it
there so for what I just did as you can
see I'm just getting this sort of crazy
waves I'm just going away from my face
I generally turn it away from my face
from both sides so I'm just going to
carry on and keep doing this all around
this bottom section of hair the
challenge I guess the most challenging
part working with the short hair and
trying to curl it seems to be the hair
at my neck area you know this stuff
right in here is it's kind of hard to
really wrap and I don't really share
myself out too much about that if I can
get a little bit around the iron and
just give it a little bend you know
that's fine for me I'm not really
looking to get it all like absolutely
perfectly curled like I said it's not as
not a perfect style
so once you've got that bottom chunk of
hair pretty well curled or wavy I just
go ahead and hit that with a little
hairspray not that's not going to keep
moving around makes me feel like it's a
little more like locked in for whatever
reason and then the easiest part is the
top I think because just all of this
hair at least for the length - I mean
see how much hair is coming down here
it's really easy to reach all that it's
nothing you know super challenging I'm
sorry I don't have like the perfect
mirror setup for this but you can go
ahead and part it off wherever you want
I'd usually queue a side part with this
work but you definitely do do it however
you please and I just start at the back
most section of what I pull down and
start wrapping that around the iron and
these Remington wands do come with
gloves I feel a real loss of control
when I've got that glove on my hand but
it will help keep you from burning your
fingers but when you're working with the
top part of your hair I think this is
the area where it's really fun to take
some parts and leave them on the iron
longer so you'll get some tighter curls
some looser waves because this is where
the hair is really showing the most and
I think it's it's more of a fun look
when not every curl is some like perfect
identical thing and I listen this
straight hair girl tell you how to make
curls but sometimes when I'm done like
going over the entire like top part I
just go back and pull out little pieces
just to make certain ones like stand out
differently
okay so now we've got the curls working
all over my head I think I gotten all of
the ends at least a little bit curled
and now what I do is I just go ahead and
style it a little bit as you can see
things are looking a little crazy now
and I like them to get like a little bit
crazier and then came from there I use a
little bit of this organics it's the
bamboo fiber full thickening fiber cream
and I just get a little bit of that
worked into my hair doesn't take a lot
of product even though it might look
like I've got a lot of hair going on
here
my hair's pretty fine it doesn't take a
lot of product to give it something to
respond to but I work this into my roots
and I flip my hair over and just really
get that going in there I feel like it
builds a ton of body and then I
furthermore get just a tiny bit more on
my fingertips a little bit rub it
between my fingers and then I just use
that product to kind of scrunch the curl
up a little bit more and I do a little
styling to create some more body and
lift right up in here so here's what I
do you don't have to do this but this is
how I feel like I ultimately get a lot
of lift going on because when your hair
is short like this it really does
respond to a little teasing so I pull up
this section right here at the crown and
I just drop my comb give that a little
bit of hairspray right on the back side
and then gently tease that section just
a bit okay mega lifts happening right
there then I tease this part so it
doesn't really matter even if I got like
a tighter curls and I was really after
right here on this front section going
through this little bit of a teasing
process on it sort of loosens that up so
you can get that nice looser almost side
bang type look around your face and then
same saying this side of the part just
lift it up a little bit of hairspray and
tease that and then I just take my comb
over everything
and kind of do a combo of like if my
hair we're just straight you know I'd be
smoothing this all out now I'm doing
like a combination of smooth it out
slash pick out some of the curls you
know I'm saying but depending on like
how deep your part is you can really
change the amount of bang you've got
associated with this look
and then folks here's what I'm doing I'm
finding a couple little sections here
right on the top and I am wreaker lling
just to give you know that little bit
more finished curl here it just gives a
little bit more going on I can't really
say for sure what this is doing
and that my friends is how I put some
waves and curl into my short hair I hope
this helps you out if you're looking for
a way to kind of change up your short
hairstyle I'm certainly no pro at this
whole you know a hair styling thing but
this seems to work pretty well for me
it's a tool that I'm very familiar with
and comfortable was using and I think
that's a big part of it but thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
