very specific video I'm thinking about
my subject matter I'm like yeah this is
just a very pinpointed in terms of the
topic and it is these makeup lending
sponges but specifically on several has
come out very recently that have this
sort of wedge shape happening the flat
side and the Real Techniques one you
know we know has been around for years
now but very recently I picked up ones
from Tarte from Ecotools from NYX and
they all are kind of following that
design but there are some very subtle
differences and none of these sponges
that I'm going to talk about today I
think are total does I think they're all
usable there's not like some super huge
glaring problem about one that makes it
like you know oh it's hard as a rock or
it's completely falling apart you know
I'm not running into that kind of
problem it's just some very specific
little aspects of them that might make
you prefer one over the other definitely
makes me prefer one over the other so
the Real Techniques sponge if you're
just buying one I think it's like around
$6.99 just for this one sponge and like
I said this was kind of the pioneer in
terms of this shape a lot of people like
it and I know I liked it for having this
flat side because I felt like I could
really easily pad in foundation I think
that flat edge can multi-task very well
if you like to bake and really lay down
some powder with that side and then
you've got a pointed end over here and
the overall just feel of the sponge it's
very very soft
every sponge that I'll be showing you in
this video has been well freshly cleaned
except for the one that I just used in
the demo but therefore they have also
been fully saturated with water and
wrung out completely so you're seeing
them at their maximum squishiness and
size here all of the other sponges I'm
going to talk about really have a
similar feel to the Real Techniques and
it's a very soft type of foam I mean
it's just as soft as you could possibly
want I even feel like it's a little bit
different than the Beautyblender
Beautyblender I still feel is very soft
but it's almost got a slight bit more
texture to the touch it's like the
sponge itself feels just as
they're more porous maybe might be the
word and these are very very soft so I
like my Real Techniques sponge been
using it for years it's been definitely
a favorite now very recently Tarte has
come out with their lending sponge and I
think they've named it the quickie
sponge they came out with something that
was a little bit different shaped by the
way it looked like this and I don't know
if they decided that was not a good
thing because they have very recently
released one that it's like identical
practically to the Real Techniques
sponge I mean in terms of similarities
it does blow up to be roughly the same
size there's a pointed tip on both ends
of each of these one difference I've
noticed is that the slant here might be
a bit steeper on the tart sponge in just
a little bit more surface area right
there but really I mean it feels like
it's made out of the exact same material
if I was blindfolded I'm not sure I
would know the difference just to
squeeze these one thing I'm not loving
about the Tarte is that this little end
right here has become very thin and I
noticed that from the start and then
after a couple of cleanings I could see
some little bits starting to actually
come off there and you can just see that
the cut of the sponge had something to
do with that it's very thin the material
right there whereas with the Real
Techniques they've kept it a bit thicker
towards the top so this one's going to
cost you sixteen dollars so about ten
dollars more and I mean I feel like they
are doing the exact same thing only like
I said I think the Tarte might be a bit
more flimsy so then the next one coming
on the scene here is from Ecotools and I
could not find online where these are
being sold currently I bought mine in a
Walmart store and I don't think they
were over ten dollars and it is a duo
and here you've once again got the
slanted side to your sponge but you've
got then a shorter slant on the other
side and then with that they're giving
you a downsized like a mini version of
that and it's the same sort of
proportion and then your very very end
actually does not come to an exact point
which is probably for the best for
durability because like I said this ends
you know getting a little flimsy there
here they do give you this
sort of cut right across the top so that
is definitely a difference between these
and let's say the real technique because
if you like to get a very you know
distinct contour let's say or real line
going there and then blend it out you
know you can do that with these this one
has a nice softness to it again reminds
me very much of whatever the real
techniques are the tart is made of it is
so so soft and squishy and again these
have been fully saturated under the sink
and then wrung out completely the
smaller size though is a little bit more
firm and it's like it's a slightly more
dense texture of sponge here and just
because it's smaller doesn't mean it has
to be firmer because I'm thinking about
like how insanely soft my Beauty Blender
micro-mini for example is super small
but super soft sponge and this one is
just rather stiff I've used these for
different purposes I've used this one
you know overall blending out foundation
and then taking this one and try to use
that more for concealer but frankly I
just feel like it's too stiff around the
eye area there's not enough flexibility
there when I'm going to blend out
concealer like I've got a little bit of
a deep set area there and it's not
always easy to get into and I don't
think this made it easier frankly
there's more flexibility and more you
know movement mobility with this sponge
to be able to get around my inner corner
than there is with the smaller one I can
see this sponge maybe applying some
cream contour and blending that out but
it's borderline just a little too stiff
for my liking for that and even a bit
stiff for applying or bouncing in a
cream blush and I think about the beauty
blender blusher that's an extremely soft
sponge it's a smallish sponge but it's
very very nice and soft so I guess my
bottom line was the Ecotools duo is that
this little guy isn't really doing
anything that this one can't do and
different folks out there might come up
with different ideas different
preferences or reason why they love this
one let's say but for me I'm not sure I
really see the value in the smaller size
as far as this size goes I do enjoy the
aspect the rounded bottom here because
I've been liking um just the feeling and
the
I get from actually tapping in and
bouncing in the foundation from the butt
end you know of a Beautyblender just the
classic Beautyblender that's an element
of that sponge that I really like and
that's something that you don't get with
your Real Techniques sponge I feel like
I almost end up doing a bit more of a
swiping motion with that just because I
use a lot of the flat side where if I'm
using the total opposite side I kind of
scrunch it around a little bit so I do
like having that rounded bottom here I'm
not sure I'm completely sold on needing
two flat edges to the sponge though now
the next one I want to tell you about is
my favorite I think I like it even
better than my Real Techniques sponge
which has been a big frontrunner for me
in terms of sponges for quite some time
now and it's from Nicks and it's the
flawless finish son and I got this for I
think between seven and eight dollars on
ulties websites of black sponge and what
you're working with here is the rounded
bottom one slanted side but it's got
like this narrow curve toward the top
see that if you look at it side by side
with a real techniques sponge it's
coming up just a little bit more
precisely not to a total point but
there's definitely some more taper there
and taking into account that one small
detail
I feel like this sponge can do
foundation and concealer very
effectively just all in one all in
itself so this is the one I will be
showing you a demo with in this video
but again the rounded bottom that gives
you a nice ability to tap in the product
over all sides wise if you look at these
all together I know this is not a great
way to show them but there's not one of
these sponges that's totally like
dwarfing the others you know they're all
kind of in the same ballpark size-wise
but the feel of this is SuperDuper soft
feels just like the Real Techniques
sponge to me and the other sponges I've
mentioned outside of the smaller of the
two Ecotools sponges and I wanted to
show you this applying a product that I
thought really benefits from a sponge
applicator is my Maybelline Dream velvet
soft matte hydrating foundation where
this in the shade nude and I just think
that foundation looks the best and the
most natural yet it still has good
coverage when applied with a Beauty
Blender sponge so I patch it all
over my skin and then I've used that
rounded butt end of this but I don't
know why I keep calling a button but
that just you know that's what it is to
me and then I just bounce the product in
and I really like the effect of using a
rounded end to actually get that
foundation applied so that gets blended
in very effectively I feel like all over
my face and then I'm going to show you
how I use this also for concealer and I
feel so satisfied with the way it blends
it in so I've got my honest hacia
concealer hasn't when I reach for today
I dab that around my under eye area get
it right there in my inner corners also
around my nose and then I put my finger
right on the flat side of this sponge
and I'm going to make use of that
rounded and very nicely tapered end to
get right on the inner part of my eye
and this sponge does this better than
any full-sized blender sponge that I
have used if you're trying to keep from
pulling in a micro mini or a tiny sponge
of some sort it's one sponge can very
effectively get in there and actually
you feel like you're getting every
square inch that you would need to reach
as far as concealer goes and same goes
for around my nose too it's like it's
just the right size it's rounded off
it's tapered up so much more than you
know my Real Techniques sponge is and I
just think it does the best job because
it kind of comes out just a little bit
it really reaches the areas where you
need to get to still love my little
likes whisper sponges or my mini Real
Techniques sponges my Beauty Blender
micro minis I still think those are
quality products and they very lightly
and effectively can get around your eye
area and blend things out but I'm just
saying for those of you who are trying
to simplify life and find one sponge
that really can do it all this is it
because I'm also going to show you that
I use the flat side for baking the area
and this isn't a step that I take every
single day but I'll just show you how it
does it today using the Laura Mercier
loose powder just dabbing right into
that and it can very effectively get a
large surface area you know
with the loose powder and then I leave
that on my skin while I do my eyebrows
and just dust it away afterward but I am
just so so pleased with the application
I have gotten with this I've been
experimenting with these different
sponges quite a bit and the NYX
just impresses me over and over again
but just to reiterate it's not that the
Real Techniques can't do the job you
know because that does a good job to the
tart one can do the job although I am a
little bit questionable about this sort
of flimsy very very like to finally cut
tip right there at the end and Ecotools
sponge is primarily the larger of the
two I think that's usable as well but
this is definitely the one that I have
found can tackle my foundation and my
concealer all together very easily and
quickly and I'm just a huge fan so that
my friends is my little wedge sponge
around up there I'm sure more sponges
from other brands that I haven't even
touched yet but also have taken on this
kind of a shape but I certainly have
been most impressed with what mix is
doing here because just the entire shape
the way this is rounded out there that's
something too because it's not so flat
so it just it continues to reach can I
grip it with your finger right there and
then is that such a good job of getting
around the eye area I can't get over it
so anyway so thank you guys for watching
and I will talk to you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
