me for this video this is gonna be a big
look at everything in the two-faced
peach collection I was sent the whole
line I'm very grateful for that that I
had the entire collection to look
through and really draw some comparison
in this video I'm going to show it all
to you I'm gonna be putting it all on
creating the look that I have on here
and as we go I'm going to be discussing
the formulas what I think of them some
things I think are non-essential in this
line I mean it's really easy to get so
swallowed up by how adorable the
packaging on everything is but what you
come to me for and what I'm gonna be
giving you in this video is you know
what are the essentials let's boil it
down let's really look at what's unique
here what are the main contributors to
giving you a great look from this
collection and that's what I'm gonna be
sharing with you today now this whole
wine you know there are peaches on
everything everything smelling like
peaches I can tell you that I inhaled
some of that powder and it tasted like
peaches now I didn't deliberately inhale
it but it was like floating through my
airspace here and yeah it's tasted
peachy and if you don't like peaches and
you don't like that scent then you can
just leave no I'm just kidding you it
just might not be for you if you are not
all about that peachy scent because it
is all throughout this collection and
let me tell you there's some great
things in this line but I also think
there are some things that are not
really necessities and the reason why
this video like kind of jumped my video
to-do list was because I thought a lot
of people would be excited about this
line and if you were anything like me
there were certain things that when I
saw sneak peeks of this collection I was
really excited about like I would have
had I not been sent the whole PR package
you know there were bits and pieces that
I was just ready to jump on and purchase
and those were maybe some of the things
that I wasn't as impressed with or as
enamoured by in this line so I'll
explain it all as I go keep on watching
ok so first things first I have moisture
eyes my skin all over and I'm getting
use this primed and peachy cooling matte
skin perfecting primer and it seems like
this whole collection is geared toward a
like soft matte look on the skin and I
do really like that idea it makes a lot
of sense because when you think of an
actual
teach you know it's got that peach thuds
on it it's not a real shiny fruit it's a
soft like kind of matte looking fruit
and so this is what this primer looks
like by the way it is soft and peachy
and it has that peach scent to it and
even though for whatever reason I'm a
little stuffy this morning I don't know
if it's allergies changing seasons what
it is but I've already moisturized and
I'm just blending this in all over and
it is kind of cooling as advertised and
it also does mattify I always look for
that right around my nose area because
the tip of my nose always picks up a lot
of shine and I feel like this totally
did mattify and I like the primer I'm
gonna be honest with you I mean I don't
think it gives my skin some kind of like
super silky softness it's not doing
exactly what like Smashbox photo-finish
does or Too Faced had a primer called I
think primed and poreless and it was a
really silky smooth feel here my skin
actually feels a little bit like extra
hydrated yet it is matte which is kind
of odd and it is cooling so I like that
whole sensation next up we're going to
use the comfort mat foundation and I am
using this in the shade natural beige it
says oil-free fourteen-hour we're oil
controlling and photo friendly so I am
NOT in a place where I'm needing a whole
lot of oil control although things like
that do tend to benefit me around the
t-zone where I inevitably get a little
bit shiny at some point and I'm gonna
use my little elf brush here I don't
know if you guys saw my elf updated one
brand tutorial but I'm putting like two
pumps of this product in that little
hole yep elfs made a foundation brush
with the hole in it and so I kind of dab
it all around and then I'm gonna just
buff it in from there and this
foundation really the first time I used
it blew me away with the coverage I was
not expecting so much coverage but yet
you know we're working with a matte
foundation here and matte foundations
can look a little bit more fully
perfected than super dewy foundation
to do so I'm really like seeing the
effects of that
I didn't really dwell on this
the packaging design of both the primer
and the foundations is kind of like the
it cosmetics CC cream it's got the pump
but also the squeezy 2 here and now
there is not a peach concealer but I'm
gonna just stick with the two-faced line
for consistency here and I'm going to
pull out my Born This Way concealer in
light medium and I'm gonna dab this a
little bit here on the under eye down
the nose I mean I'm not in need of a ton
of extra coverage I'm just using this
more for like brightening and kind of
contrasts basically I'll just go over it
a little bit with this foundation brush
first
and hit those innermost areas here
so feeling very good about the way the
skin looks right now totally evened out
definitely Matt I feel like it's you
know the foundation definitely was
delivering on its claims and to be
honest with you if I was in a big hurry
I don't even know that concealer was
super essential here so I'm really
impressed by the coverage but now we are
gonna go in with the peach perfect
setting powder and this says mattifying
loose setting powder infused with peach
and sweet fig cream the sweet fig cream
is another element of this but you don't
see figs on any of the packaging it
comes out and I swear I'm tasting the
powder when that opens like I'm inhaling
the powder and like tasting it in my
system here weird but cool kind of so
the powder does have a slight light
peachy tint to it I wouldn't call it
like a bold peach but there's a definite
tone to this powder and it is most
certainly mattifying I feel like my skin
looked pretty perfected beforehand but
this goes the extra mile here like on
the under eye area just elsewhere on the
face I feel like it takes the surface of
my skin and everything just looks so
dang smooth after this
seriously so even so mad it kind of
disguises some little lines here and
there it definitely disguises pores and
I think the way they're pulling this off
without it looking too heavy is just the
fact that this powder is so incredibly
fine you know you saw when I open this
little cap up which by the way I love
that there's a little stopper cap here
but when you open that up you know some
of the products gonna just go airborne
and it's gonna basically feel like it's
pouring almost like liquid into your cap
I mean it's that fine of a powder so
when you put that on your skin assuming
you don't like way way over use it it's
going to not look like too much but it
is a really achieving the mattifying
effect and the brightening effect for me
I love the powder and I see like you
could taste the powder it's so weird a
new formula that seems to be introduced
with this line is called melting powder
and they've got a few like cream
products and this is I think arguably
the cutest packaging in this line look
how they look like actual little peach
compacts here and there's a blush
there's something called peach frost
like a highlight and then there is also
this melting powder bronzer in toasted
peach so that looks like this they're
all just so adorable and this was one of
those things in the line where what I
was seeing sneak peeks this was what I
was most intrigued about I really you
know I saw that they were coming out
with a foundation in this line but I
wasn't thinking like oh I have to have
it or anything but it was this formula
and this packaging that just appealed to
me so much so what it is it feels very
creamy you know you feel like you're
touching a traditional let's say cream
bronzer it is kind of domed up in the
packaging there but it feels creamy now
you start to blend that layer of product
out on your skin and it feels
immediately dry okay I wouldn't even so
much call it cream to powder because it
doesn't even feel powdery it just feels
dry like it very much stays in place
it's not like moving around on the skin
like a powder might it just goes from
this creamy feel to a drier feel what
I'm gonna do is actually take a little
bit of this with my finger and I'm going
to patch a little bit of this bronzer
around the
airline then I'm going to use my small
stipple brush to just kind of blend that
in and you can see it blends in pretty
well it's kind of subtle I mean I'm not
the hugest fan of cream bronzers and I
also feel like for this collection
itself we have gone to great lengths
that seems to mattify our skin and get
this just even really pretty soft matte
look and then you come in with creams
and sometimes it can kind of I won't say
undo the effect because these aren't
like super super dewy or anything but
you do have to work a slight bit harder
to blend these in than you might just a
regular powder product you know
the texture of these is cool like if you
see him in a Sephora you might swatch
him out see what you think of it but to
me it's not like blowing my mind so
that's the bronzer kind of blended in a
little bit around the hairline a little
bit in the hollows of the cheeks you
know it's okay I'm not jumping up and
down over it but then they got this
sweetie pie radiant matte bronzer and
this again infused with peach and sweet
fig cream and this is seriously adorable
packaging and when this first came it
had a little over spray of gold on this
little lattice part here so this looks
like a pie I can appreciate that my mom
makes like the best pies ever it was
cute and the gold on there almost made
me think of like a sprinkling of
powdered sugar I'm usually mad at
overspray but this was so so light it
was like very clear that that was not an
intended aspect of this product and
after a couple of uses it would be gone
I mean I've used this probably four
times already there is no trace of the
overspray anymore so it's not gonna
continue to like annoy you forever if
you don't like that but what we've got
here kind of like three tones of bronzer
from very light to a little bit deeper
tan and peaking through there are some
little pops of peach there so I just
kind of DAB my brush all over this and I
am gonna go ahead and just warm the skin
up a bit this does offer I think a
little extra radiance to the skin it's
called a radiant matte bronzer and I can
kind of I don't know I see where they're
coming from because it's not super like
shiny glowy off-the-charts but it's also
like not quite as matte as let's say
that loose powder that I put on you know
some of these shades in here have like a
little satin finish so I can pick up on
that and this product well I think it's
pretty it's again it's more about the
cuteness factor of the way it looks I'm
not like gaga over how it looks on my
skin it's not doing anything super
different so that's sort of my take on
both of the bronzer II things in this
line now back to that melting powder
formula there's also a blush actually I
think there are multiple shades of blush
but the shade I have is so peachy and
this is very vibrant is it not and I can
assure
it blends out that very same way that
the other does you know once it hits
skin once like a light swatch if it hits
your skin you blend over it and it just
seems dry and it really does have some
staying power I have noticed that and
here I'm just gonna go straight to the
product with my brush I'm just gonna
start blending this out here on the
apple of my cheek and it's a gorgeous
shade of blush like I absolutely love
this color for this whole look that I'll
be creating you know there's gonna be a
peachy eye there's gonna be you know
maybe a new dish lip with this look and
this cheek just looks so dang fresh so I
can't argue with the shade at all I just
think it's kind of funny that they came
out with these creams and you're making
this effort to have all this nice matte
coverage on your skin with the powder
and the foundation and then you have to
go on top with this cream which granted
it blends easily and it does have good
staying power it's just a little bit
more effort than it would be to blend a
powder blush across your skin but my
word is that not a stunning color of
blush can you see I'm kind of on the
fence with this product then the last
element of that melting powder line is
the peach frost highlight same deal here
it's feeling like cream and the compact
and then when applied to the skin
instantly dry and this highway is not
off the charts shimmery can you just see
that streak that I made across the skin
it's a soft glow and this is not a whole
collection that's all about glow you
know it's very much about like soft
matte but maybe a hint of glow and
that's what this is giving me here it
looks pretty enough you know I'm just
blending this in with my fingers I'm
just kind of buffing it in in a light
circular motion trying not to press too
hard to undo like what I did with
concealer and whatnot
and then finally they have a finishing
powder it's a translucent smoothing
finishing powder called peach blur and
it's in a little square compact here
this is what the product looks like
inside the pan you try to swatch it you
really don't see much I mean it seems
like kind of a barely there layer of
powder that you end up getting off of
this I'm gonna apply a little bit of
this just right here on the skin I have
used this multiple times and I'm not
seeing major effects like sometimes I
think it's just in my head what I think
I am seeing a little something from this
powder I don't know it's just it's not
gonna be one of those things that you
immediately use and you see a massive
impact from I just I gotta be honest I
don't see much happening and if I
haven't said it enough this video all
this stuff smell and like peach alright
it's all smell and peachy and then we
got peach mist mattifying setting spray
so says to shake this up and I have used
this a time or two when I swear there
are little tiny specks of powder perhaps
coming out of this I'm not positive but
I think that's what's happening here
maybe to help with the mattified look
I'm not sure but I'm gonna do a few
spritzes I don't think I'm seeing any
powder flecks this time but that
definitely smells peachy I mean if you
are all about that peach scent and you
want it in a setting spray I mean it is
here for you I didn't feel like my skin
looked overly powdery and heavy like I
had a big you know something that I
wanted to undo with the setting spray at
the end of my face look here which is
good because that's not really gonna do
it for me anyway it is a mattifying
setting mist it does not add a bunch of
instant do to your skin the way some do
to me this is kind of another one of
those non-essential parts of the line
it's like yeah if you love the scent and
you're all about it you might want it in
a mist or whatever it's nice it's not
bad although I think a lot of setting
sprays could get the job done for you
and there are just other things like if
you're being really picky and kind of
choosy about the line I think there are
other things that are must-haves and
this is kind of an accessory item that
yeah it's okay but it's not like the
best now for lips I was sent what I
think are just a random
little trio here of lipsticks in this
line it's a very cute packaging design
it's cream and then there's a little
gold like peach logo right down here and
then the color is sort of indicated on
the tops of the lipsticks so I have a
berry shade called drunk-dial
I mean like a really pretty sangria type
color I love that and then I've got a
couple of nudes I've got Dollface and
I've got sundae Funday
sundae Funday is a little bit you know
deeper kind of a spice type tan nude I
think I'm going to work in both of these
shades actually now we're talking matte
lipsticks with this collection they
glide on easily they're not at all like
dry I don't feel any skipping across the
lips as I apply them
that's Sunday Funday mostly on my lips
and I think I'm gonna dab a little bit
of this doll face shade just in the
center here very very light like peach
nude in this color oh they smell so good
mmm really pure peach scent with these
lipsticks absolutely beautiful shade
here I mean I can't argue with the color
payoff with these I think the staying
power is nice it's kind of like as you
would expect for a matte lipstick I
usually have a little higher staying
power expectation when the lipstick is
matte as opposed to when it's a like
cream formula all that being said it's
not maybe the most outstanding part of
the line for me maybe if you've got a
shade that you really really love or you
know this special looking packaging you
want to give one of these as a gift to
someone I can see that but I've got a
lot of lip colors that are this general
shade there are tons of mattes out there
these days it's beautiful but it's not
maybe the most essential part of the
line now I'm gonna do my brows real
quick and then I'll join you with the
eye look okay so face it's done lips are
done brows are finished now the only
thing left is the palette and this is
the Just Peachy mattes palette says
velvet matte eyeshadow palette infused
with peach and sweet fig cream again
figs where you at maybe two faces just
waiting there holding out on us with the
fig and there's gonna be a huge fig
collection later but this is the palette
all mattes we've seen a lot of all matte
palettes I feel like from different
brands these days I will say that I have
been a longtime supporter and lover of
the Too Faced matte formula their
natural matte palette I think is one of
the best neutral matte palettes out
there when I saw that this was going to
be a fully matte palette I thought yes
finally from Too Faced more mats because
the matte formula really does tend to be
the strengths in their different
palettes I mean they do some nice
shimmers they even do some nice like
kind of sparkle and fused shades but
their mats are very creamy very fully
pigmented really easy to work with and I
was just happy to see a palette
chock-full of them including shades that
I'm really happy to work with like these
warm peach colors warm Browns up in
here nice deep wine colors you've got a
really rich like dark chocolate brown
down here so it's really everything you
need if you like peachy warm looks and
you like a little berry mixed in so for
me for this look I'm going to start with
peach tea right up here and this is kind
of a nice just tan neutral shade and I
did prime the lids by the way with a
little Milani eyeshadow primer and I'm
just gonna work this shade all
throughout the crease this is gonna be
you know fully matte look and as I've
been experimenting with this collection
and just you know using all the face
products and this palette - I just
thought yeah you know it makes sense
it looks so velvety smooth like my mom
the other day she was like your skin
looks so soft and nice I was like yeah
it's the it's the peach matte stuff so
that's sweet tea just buffed out
big-time all over the crease and Beyond
gonna blend out the edge of that a
little bit and then I realized a
highlight shade that I really like is
when I take um peach butter and a little
dab of just peachy and just blend that
right here under the brow because these
light cream shades both of these -
they're very pigmented and they can be a
little loud they're actually you know
they came to play and if you put them
right under the brow and you might apply
a little too much of one of those it can
be a little bit a little bit much so I
like to add a little bit of just peachy
to one of them and it just seems like a
nice little soft blurred effect so we
are so blurred we are so matte and
blended right now I want to work in some
of the color of this palette so yes
we're gonna go to pink punch with a flat
brush tap off a little excess there is
some excess to be tapped off by the way
for all y'all who can't stand powdery
fallout I mean you're not gonna see a
lot of that kicked up but you will see
it a little bit tapping off the brush so
I like this shade right here on the
center of my lid kind of recreating one
of my favorite looks that I did with
this so far
and then take a little bit of Just
Peachy and that's gonna be my slightly
lighter shade right in here inner third
of the eyelid okay then the one shade
that I have noticed a little satin
finish actually on in this palette is
peach sangria I don't know if you can
see it in a close-up here that this
shade right here by my thumb there that
has just a satin finish to the naked eye
but then you see it on your lids and I
guess it doesn't really have that look
to it you know it's just kind of looking
at it concentrated in the palate but I
like this shade just Pat it out right
here
I love how you have the option with this
palette of creating some gorgeous berry
looks like you could go berry you could
leave out peach punch and kind of leave
out what's happening here in this middle
row and just do brown and like neutral
and then the berry mixed in and you know
you could bypass the peach idea entirely
if you wanted to I just really love the
this fusion of colors and it really does
make me think fall to like it makes me
think of the trees that turn the most
beautiful rich warm tones this time of
year you know the ones that go reddish
orange I love that so as you can see I'm
kind of not only patting peach sangria
on the outer part of the lid but I'm
turning the brush so I can apply that a
little bit to the crease and then I'm
gonna grab the e25 brush and just blend
that color around some more
ooh it's yummy oh I just love the look
of these colors on my lids oh I swore I
wasn't gonna fall for another palette
anytime soon but my word do I love this
one
it's dynamite now if you're saying okay
that's a little loud for me on the lids
right now I need to just need to just
turn the volume down on that just a hair
I would say take a color like peach tart
this matte Brown and you can work a
little bit of that into your crease some
here and that can almost I don't know
it's something about having a little
more of a brownish shade in your crease
as opposed to just the plumy color and
the bright peachy shade on the lid it
can kind of anchor the look a little
more
when it was no accident that I'm wearing
a light peach and black striped shirt
today by the way
oh yes mama gets real proud of herself
when she actually plans a wardrobe idea
for a video
I am sorry but I am so in love with this
I look this is on fire oh I love it okay
then what do I want to put on the lower
lash I think I'm gonna do a little like
peach cobbler keep it warm
peach cobbler is beautiful beautiful
warm brown all these shades they're just
so pigmented I think what I love so much
is that they never really end up looking
muddy you know they're all their own
true to color saturated nice shades and
if you are like me and you like your let
plummy kind of rich burgundy shades you
are going to love this one right here
you're also gonna love just ripe because
just ripe while it did not have a
starring role in this look that color is
gorgeous and as it sheers out it can
look a number of different ways and then
I'm going to take peach tart right here
on the outside
so just keeping it a little darker there
on the outer edge and then I feel like I
want to keep my lower inner rim a little
bit bright so I'm using my wet and wild
under brow ultimate brow highlight this
just perks up the eyes a lot if you're a
little tired
look at that boom
I'm gonna go ahead and do a little black
liquid liner across the upper lash line
I'm gonna put on my lashes they will be
the Coco lashes in the style Misha a
very like fluttery soft fanned out lash
and then we'll just share some finishing
thoughts on the collection so finished
look everyone I mean this is no doubt
just a really lovely collection I have
been so impressed by so many elements in
this line actually and just the finished
look I feel like my skin just looks soft
without even touching it I feel like it
just looks like it would be soft and
smooth and even I'm just very pleased
with the complexion products in this
line the eye palette is a total star for
me I had my eye on that from the moment
I was seeing little sneak peeks that
they were gonna do an all matte palette
these are my colors I love the formula
so this thing no more discussion needed
that's a fabulous palette if I could
only pick like two more essential
products from this line it would be the
Comfort matte foundation really really
impressed by this I think it's a full
coverage look has good staying power for
me throughout the day a little asterisk
by this should be I'm not sure how well
it's gonna work for the super dry people
out there because given the amount of
coverage that this has and that it's
matte I mean I'm not sure I'd love to
hear from you in the comments section if
you have really dry skin and you've used
this did it work for you did it cake up
on certain areas but my skin is normal
and sometimes dry in certain areas but
this wears very very evenly on me so I'm
very happy with that and I absolutely
love the loose powder this loose powder
is awesome the slight PG tint to it I
think it's a great under eye setting
powder
it looks beautiful all over the skin
like I could not believe just the matte
veil that this gave now if you're not
into matte then set this aside but this
is a very mattifying powder if you like
that look sometimes I like the fully
matte looks sometimes I want to look a
little more dewy and glowy but this is
definitely in the matte category so
these three things the palette the
foundation and the loose powder are my
top favorites from this line now a
couple other things that I really like I
like the primer I honestly think that
this
is what it says it will do it schooling
its Matt it smells peachy I really do
enjoy it and I think it added a little
extra hydration and it just paired
really nicely under that very matte
foundation and then I like this blush
this shade called so peachy it's intense
it's long wearing like I said I was kind
of surprised that they came out with a
cream formula amid all of the matte
emphasis in this collection but this
does wear a really long time this truly
is a nice product and I didn't have to
go to a lot of work to like buff this in
or get it blended in but I loved using
my ELF small stipple brush to put it on
the bronzer and the highlight there okay
they're more cute than anything I mean
they're adorable the formula is
interesting but realistically I can get
that same look a lot easier and quicker
with just a regular bronzer or contour
shade and then any number of highlights
that I already have in my collection
kind of feel the same way about the
sweetie pie thing I mean it's so cute to
look at it gave me this kind of nice
radiance to this look that was sort of
lacking if you just had the foundation
on you know so it's nice but not a
must-have feeling the same way about
that peach blur finishing powder I just
didn't think it did that much for my
skin I thought the thanks giving me the
main contribution to the matte velvety
soft peachy look on the skin were the
powder and the foundation peach mist and
neither one of those things it's like
yes I like it is it absolutely essential
well you know I don't think so I've got
a lot of setting sprays it's a nice
little bonus that this smells like
peaches and I love the actual scent that
is infused throughout all these products
so it's nice to have but I wouldn't put
it tops on your list to pick up
especially if you're trying to be choosy
among the things that you do buy in this
line and do I love my lip color right
now absolutely I do I'm wearing again
Sunday Funday and a little bit of
Dollface in the center of the lower lip
it's pretty packaging it's a nice matte
formula I think it wears a long time but
when you're getting right down to it is
it unique not really so you guys see
what I'm trying to do is just sort of
boil it down to the essentials in this
video I'm trying to get past the
cuteness of everything because it all is
so cute and that scent can be downright
hypnotic but this is just my opinion my
take I think there are a few must-haves
in this line but not everything
a total must-have so thank you guys so
much for watching thanks for requesting
this video and I should also add I have
the two-faced candy Johnson I want candy
releases as well if you want to see a
video on that let me know in the
comments section and I will see you soon
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
