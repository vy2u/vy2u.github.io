watching my channel lately there have
been lots of reviews it is that time of
year where there are a lot of things to
review and talk about but a lot of it
has been makeup related you know these
makeup gift sets and everything coming
out ahead of the holidays and there are
also some little gift sets / you know
stocking stuffers that are more of a
bath and body and skin care type of
nature and so that was what I wanted to
talk about in this video I know there
were a couple of things that I mentioned
in a hole not too long ago so I wanted
to sort of update you on those now that
I've been using them a little bit more
and throw in some other products I've
been trying lately too so one of those
and this would be an $18 product so one
of the lower-cost things I'll be talking
about is this little set from Clinique
and it's called dewy you doing you and
it's got the Moisture Surge line in here
well just a couple products from it one
of them is the extended thirst relief
like the classic Moisture Surge gel
moisturizer and then there's also a
Moisture Surge overnight mask that was
the part of this kit that really drove
me to want to try it I feel like I've
used Moisture Surge in other kits along
the way so I thought the overnight masks
would be great and you also get a chubby
stick in here too so 18 bucks might be a
nice little like side gift or just you
know something small to give someone
especially good I think with someone who
might have sensitive skin and also
normal to dry type skin because I feel
like this Moisture Surge moisturizer
here this is really nice and it does
remind me very much of like a gel cream
there is some like transparency to it
you know you see it on your finger there
but yet once you do blend it in you're
like oh you know it my skin just didn't
drink that up totally immediately and I
have been layering this a little bit
under my SPF you know as I get ready for
the day and it's really a nice feeling
on the skin I think a ton of skin types
could get away with wearing that the
Moisture Surge overnight mask this is
the size that comes in it is a one fluid
ounce size and I have just been kind of
using this as I've been testing it I've
been putting it on like a night cream
basically and it says luxurious
nighttime ritual helps deeply hydrate
and restore April
detective moisture barrier cream mask
helps replenish moisture can awakens
plump supple and luminous you want to
massage this into your skin until you
feel like it's actually been absorbed
it's not going to be one of those masks
that's like sitting on top of your skin
it's not gonna get all over your pillow
you know I just apply it like a night
cream and then when I wake up in the
morning I can tell there's just a little
like leftover moisture there my skin
doesn't feel like it totally drank it
all up and I don't know it's just a nice
feeling this is more like a standard
cream it's not like out of this world
thick but it's got a little more
thickness a little more concentrated
moisture than the Moisture Surge like
gel cream does and then the third part
of this little kit is just one of these
chubby sticks it's not a full size but
the shade you're getting is super
strawberry this has lived in my purse
lately really pretty shade kind of a
soft pink there so I really should have
put that on today I didn't think about
it there's a little bit of Sheerness to
these chubby sticks but I think this
would be the kind of shade anybody could
pick up and throw on real quick and be
happy with so if you are looking at this
as a giftable little skincare item I
think it's very giftable I think it's
very universally workable except maybe
you know the oil list of the oily people
may not want to go to bed with a
Moisture Surge overnight mask on but I
think normal dry very dry skin might
really enjoy that kit another thing that
was priced at $18 as I've tried and I
really wanted to love it but I did not
enjoy really either of these products
sadly it's from first aid beauty I got
from Sephora and it's called fab
delights and so I thought okay this is a
nice little way to try the ultra Repair
Cream which I may have had a sample of
here they're probably over time and then
also the ultra Repair lip therapy which
comes in rosy red it's a cute little box
it has the to-and-from on the back and
what I guess I didn't really realize
this is coming in a special scent called
vanilla Citroen and I do not like the
way that smells I love the texture the
consistency of this moisturizer it feels
so good going on but that's net uh I
mean I feel like it smells better I got
some of my nose there I feel like
smells a little bit better in the tub
than it does like once it's blended out
on my skin there's just a little too
much bite to it for me and it's not in a
really like sweet yummy citrusy way to
me it's like faint bitter citrus and I'm
not really picking up on any of the
vanilla but as far as the consistency of
this goes if you find this in a
different set and you might be
interested in this moisturizer see how
you do get some peaks in there with this
product don't know if you can tell that
or not it's a great feeling body cream
it doesn't take very long to absorb when
you put it on there are some body
butters that I've put on where you
really do need to massage them into the
skin and they practically have to melt
down you know what I'm saying this is
already and that kind of melted down
super creamy state and I love the way my
skin felt after I put it on because it
was it was so interesting I didn't feel
like I had just applied product but I
just felt like I had soft naturally
hydrated perfect feeling skin even what
I mean it was a great texture so I would
be open to trying this maybe in just
their original version or maybe there's
another scent that I would like better
I'm not really that familiar with this
line at all but this scent I just could
not get on board with having it all over
my body and maybe part of this during
pregnancy you're extra sensitive to
scents and there are some sense that I
just totally love and can rally around
but that one's not one of them then I
thought well maybe I will love the lip
therapy this is the Ultra repaired lip
therapy it says repair dry lips
petroleum free and what you get out of
this little tube is an actual like rosy
tinted balm and I put this on my lips
the first time I used it I was like oh I
love the color it gave my lips a nice
natural rosy tint a little bit of shine
and it smells just really really good
like a soft sweet minty smell but the
feel on my lips is so greasy feeling
when I first put it on my lips I thought
we were kind of on to something but then
you know I went downstairs I was going
about my business and I felt like maybe
the warmth of my lips practically melted
or thinned the consistency of the
product even more and it just felt so
darn greasy and I just don't
I have the patience for that you know
feeling like it's gonna slip right off
my lips and stuff and there are too many
other good lip treatment type things out
there that don't make me feel that way
but I loved the tint so both of these
products have something in there that is
really clicking with me but I just can't
get on board with them as a whole next
thing I'm happy a report is a total skin
care success and I'm still kind of
experimenting with some of them but I've
tried enough to know that this is a
really worthwhile thing and it's a mask
sampler from Peter Thomas Roth love this
this is 25 bucks and I think it's a
perfect way to sample out some different
masks and actually kind of realize what
might really work for you before you
take the plunge on a full-size and we're
talking multiple uses of masks out of
each one of these tubes so you really
get a chance to kind of get in tune with
which ones you like but I was excited
because I have a couple of these in the
full-size the cucumber and the rose
stem-cell mask and I love them I've
talked about these before how you put
them on they are really cooling those
two particular ones that you come away
when you rinse them off feeling super
soft and hydrated I cannot hit home
enough the fact that this skin feels so
incredibly soft and smooth after you do
this and I know with both of those masks
they say you can also wear them as like
an overnight leave it on lock in your
moisture type of treatment if you wanted
to but in addition to those you're also
getting the pumpkin enzyme mask and that
I use the other night and it's like a
got some exfoliating bits in it and so
you'll want to check the directions on
the back of each one because they're not
all the same purpose they're not all the
same formula and with that one I think
they said like actually scrub it a
little bit on your skin at the onset
when you apply it with damp fingers
leave it on for three to seven minutes
or somewhere in there just a real quick
mask then you rinse that off and you've
had more of a little exfoliating
treatment but that straight-up smells
like pumpkin pie like the pumpkin pie
filling that you would put in your
pumpkin pie it smells just like that
some people may be thinking ooh that's
gonna be when I give away two
friend but if you're into bumpkin you're
gonna go nuts for that one to that I
have not yet tried the Irish more mud
purifying black mask and the 24 karat
gold pure luxury lift and firm mask so
as you can see there are different
claims on all of these the claim on the
cucumber gel mask is extreme detoxifying
the claim on the rose stem cell mask it
says biorepair gel mask and then the
blue one here on the end is the blue
marine algae intense hydrating mask and
that one reminded me a lot in just
consistency feel on the skin the
coolness the softness I felt after I
washed it off it reminded me a lot of
the rose and the cucumber just a really
great way to sample different masks with
different functions and even like for
example the one that says intense
hydrating mask I think even an oily skin
person could wear that and come away
with a really like nourished yet very
clean feeling I love rinsing that one
with cool water and it feels so dang
refreshing I don't know this might be my
favorite thing in this whole video that
I'm talking about I just think it's such
a great value and it's just such a smart
way to test something out if you were
ever considering buying one of these in
a full-size I think trying the small
size seeing if that's really you know
what you want and then maybe springing
for the full size or a larger kit or
something like that and it would be a
fun thing to to like share with friends
and family like a goal a couple of them
out in a stocking Peter Thomas Roth
makes amazing face masks and I have been
so pleased with a couple of new ones
I've experimented with I've still got a
couple more that I get to try out a neat
thing is after I have rinsed those masks
off I put this on as my night cream the
Moisture Surge overnight mask and I've
just had a really nice skin experience
going lately and a couple of little
updates here the clean rollerball
layering collection I put him all in
here cuz it you know it is a nice
presentation that is what it will look
like if you give it to someone but I
have been playing with these roller
balls and you get some really awesome
and very sense in here and what they say
is you can you know wear them alone or
mix in
the ones you get our skin air warm
cotton that ones blossom and what was
the other one rain I really like these
scents because I don't feel like they're
some you know cheesy overdone take on a
real life scent that you're familiar
with you know like for example the warm
cotton that instantly does make me think
of snuggle dryer sheets but there's a
little something extra there you know
what I mean that's making it a fragrance
you know something that I would feel
like wearing on my body
blossom clearly the most floral of the
bunch rain I think of as the most like
unisex when I smell that maybe it's just
that kind of crispness that that one has
it makes me think of something I could
envision Tyler wearing or myself wearing
air I love because it's it kind of
reminds me a little bit of the warm
cotton but dialed back a bit and it does
just have a little more coolness to it I
can't it's hard to explain like the warm
cotton literally makes me think warmth
when I smell that scent and air is I
think similar to that but lighter and
more cool and bright and then why do I
love this skin scent so much I'm sorry
it's just like a hot mess trying to
explain all of these different scents
and help you understand what I'm
actually smelling here that skin has
more depth a teeny bit of like spice I
guess in it in relation to all of the
others I just I love this one so much I
really love them all I am such a sampler
type person because I don't just always
want to you know stick with one scent
all the time and I like the idea of
layering them although I think purely
looking at each scent individually
they're great there's not one of them
that I would be turned off from using at
all and this is a brand I've never
really looked into before it's a brand I
know I've had fragrance samples from but
I've never really bought anything from
the line there's great staying power
with these fragrances particularly skin
I feel like I just smell that on myself
throughout the day and I'm like yes I
love that smell and then the last thing
here the philosophy land of sweets set
this is $27 I guess the most pricey
thing I've mentioned the rollerball set
was 18 the Peter Thomas
mask set was 25 so this one's 27 and
it's three six ounce body washes so I've
had all of these out in my shower none
of them look like they've been used a
ton because I had bounced around with
all of them but it's hot cocoa flamenco
dance of the dewdrop fairy and candy
cane these three cents could not be
further from one another you know the
candy cane is so potent it does have
sweetness to it it's like a sweet
peppermint but it is strong strong
strong this is the thing you want to be
lathering up with in the shower when
your nose feels a little bit stuffy or
maybe you're bordering on a headache or
something like that it's so refreshing
I've had this in it like a giant-sized
before I love candy canes so I knew I
would have at least one total hit in
this kit the hot coco flamenco though
this is just mmm yes it's chocolaty it's
warm like I was saying before there are
some sense where warmth just translates
to you as you smell it and I sensed that
with this a lot it's sweet I mean I
don't feel like I'm straight-up
squirting chocolate syrup all over
myself when I use it but it's just got
this really nice like warm coziness to
it so I enjoyed that very much and then
your dance at the dew drop fairy is
going to be the light bright fruity I
think of berries as soon as I smell it
blueberries raspberries strawberries
like a great berries and cream mix this
one might be the most like universally
loved actually because I could see you
know not everybody out there wanting
like super super strong peppermint and
maybe not everyone's into a chocolaty
scent either but this is more along the
lines of a fruity body wash that perhaps
somebody's already got like in their
shower it's not incredibly unique but it
does smell really good with these scents
being so vastly different from one
another I could see somebody getting
this kit and not liking all three or
maybe only liking one of them personally
I truly do like all three but if you're
thinking yeah I do want to try something
from philosophy I know I saw other kids
that were more like kind of fruity
across the board I think they had a trio
of sin
that was like something and cream like
for all three of them like a peaches and
cream or whatever there are less risky
sets to cope with perhaps might be the
way to put that but these are a shampoo
shower gel and bubble bath all together
so I have shampooed with these in the
past I haven't done that recently but my
favorite overall way to use these is
just as a straight-up body wash or in
the tub there is a nice I think
luxurious thickness to philosophy's body
washes they don't just feel like those
immediate rinse away type gels there is
a nice creaminess they really do sets up
a whole heck of a lot so that concludes
my little discussion on some body and
skin care and fragrance things that I've
been testing out for the holidays now I
might still stumble across some more
before it's all said and done but with
the exception of that first day Beauty
duo I really have had some good finds
and I even you know realized something
out of this kid that I would like the
ultra Repair Cream just not in that
sense so thank you guys so much for
watching I always welcome your feedback
in the comments section if you've tried
any of these things or you have any
other recommendations please let me know
and I will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
