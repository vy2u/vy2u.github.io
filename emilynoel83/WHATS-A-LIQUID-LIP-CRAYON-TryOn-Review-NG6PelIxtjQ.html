today I'm gonna be talking about a
really fascinating new look product in
this video in fact if you've watched my
videos over the past couple of weeks you
might have seen me mention this product
from Marc Jacobs it's called the liquid
lip crayon and I discovered this at
first in my little Sephora sampler
collection called give me some new lip
so I was trying on all of those new lip
products and I was just blown away by
the texture of this what we have here is
kind of like a jumbo lip crayon I mean
it's obviously thicker than a lip liner
but it's not super massive in terms of
applying this to your lips I actually
feel like I have more precision than I
do with a typical lipstick and this
shade here is even worn down quite a bit
this is night moths or night moves this
is the one that came in that little
sampler set and I have used it so much
sense and what's fascinating about the
product is that it practically like
melts into your lips they call it a
liquid lip crayon and it's not because
this takes on the texture of a liquid
lipstick or is really comparable to what
you know from a typical lips liquid
lipstick it it's that it goes on your
lips with this lightweight kind of
melting into your lips liquefied state
it's really really unique and I have
felt absolutely nothing like this before
it says liquid lip in a stick one swipe
color 16-hour luxe long wear which we're
gonna chat about that a little bit more
if says melts into lips with a
lightweight liquid sensation providing
bold once wet color a dose of innovative
ghost pearl add SEL dimension for a
never before seen finish so I don't know
if you can tell like by the shade I've
got on my lips right now there is like a
little bit of a sheen to it I wouldn't
call any of these like Frost but I chose
this particular shade to have on
throughout the video because I thought
it presented the maximum Sheen out of
all ten colors and this is the color
called send nudes now the interesting
thing about these products is they go on
your lips they do have that kind of melt
down very thin liquid feeling as you're
putting them on like they're light as
air but they're liquid and then you'll
notice as you wear them a bit there is a
bit of a dry down that happens I
wouldn't say they feel drying on my lips
whatsoever but instead of feeling quite
so slick this is a really odd
description but it feels more like your
actual lips very
list but in a different sense than when
you first put it on and it was almost
like wet feeling having this shade on my
lips now for like 15 minutes or so now
it just kind of feels like lightweight
maybe something's on there but it feels
closer to like my natural lip texture
here's the story with these products for
me like I said I got the one shade in
the sampler box and I was so thrilled
with it like just the other day I was
perusing this before a website and I
want to get a couple more shades of this
because this is truly like one of the
best lip formulas I've played with here
recently and no lie on that very day I
got this PR box and it had a lot of
different Marc Jacobs lip products in it
but it was mainly sort of celebrating
the launch of these crayons so I've got
the little booklet on him did not know
that was coming but I'm so thankful
because I feel like I can really dive
into the collection a lot more and tell
you so much more than if I just
purchased a few shades here there
because these are a $26 lip product now
talking a little bit about the staying
power before I show you all the shades I
feel like this varies a little bit with
the intensity of the color you're using
because there is some what I think of a
staining thing that happens here and the
bolder the shade that you have the more
that kind of stain hangs on your lips
like night mobs I wore this for a night
out the other day we went to like this
big fancy shindig I had that color on
and I thought it looked gorgeous but it
didn't really like last that well
through the dinner I definitely felt
like I wanted to reapply afterward but I
think had I been wearing a more intense
shade while maybe that Ghost pearl kind
of finish might have worn off there's
more of an overall color stain on your
lips that comes from those darker ones
so just keep that in mind and then there
are two extremely extremely dark shades
in this lineup and those as with pretty
much any really dark lip color you have
to be very careful with the application
just getting them to look super even on
your lips is a bit of a hassle even with
this formula you know it still feels
like this liquid super lightweight thing
going on your lips but you have to watch
those shades a bit more but everything
else was just super easy like is about
as easy as it gets for any kind of
application and like I said the one that
I've had the longest I
have worn down a bit like here's a
comparison of what it looks like when
you get one new and after you've worn it
for a while and even this you know
because this isn't a massive stick this
feels pretty precise to put it on like I
don't feel like I'm lacking really in
any way to be able to get that on
cleanly so when you want more product
it's gonna twist up from the bottom and
when you cap them you don't just simply
go until you meet some resistance you
actually have a little snap there and I
do think that that's keeping the product
really fresh in a sense I would assume
that if these started to dry out you
would really lose that instant liquidy
type feeling as it goes on your lips and
when you hear me say that I'm not
meaning like it's uncontrollable liquid
or anything like that but it's just like
the product is melting down on contact
and it's very cool and if you really did
just want to try one of these in that
mauve shade appeals to you it is within
a kit of some other things it's a really
great buy that give me some new lip kit
if it's still available and you are
getting this product full-sized in that
collection but enough chitchat now I
want to show you all the colors going on
so first off the one I've been talking
about most the night moms night mo
because however you want to say it it's
shade 310 I think this is a super
wearable shade just across the board you
know it's got that bit of pink you can
definitely see what they're talking
about with the ghost pearl just subtle
sheen here it's absolutely beautiful and
I loved wearing that the other day for a
really formal event then the color I've
been wearing throughout the video is
called sin nudes and like I said a
little deeper here kind of a rich tan
brownish nude or mean this is the color
where the hint of pearl actually shows
up the most but I love that I can see
myself getting a lot of use out of that
shade and then Burn Notice is a really
interesting color here it's a little bit
pumpkiny but there's a lot of brown in
it as well I think the pearlescent
quality and this one goes a little bit
toward gold and it's just an
unexpectedly flattering shade I really
like that and then the next color on the
outside it's gonna look like a real red
and this is called how Rouge and this
one I find to be a very Coralie kind of
Orange II red an absolutely phenomenal
statement summertime springtime type
color in my eyes
so we're gonna get into a string of
pinks and berries here first off we have
Pink's straight and this is gonna be
like your lightest just kind of standard
pink to me it's a very true pink there's
some coolness in this shade not too
light not too dark I really think it's a
fun color actually but if you're really
going for a true hot pink the next one
flamingo is how they write it it's
really bold definitely just jumps off
your lips and as you can see in the
application as soon as it hits your lips
you're seeing the fullness of the color
there's no building up with any of these
shades now one of my personal favorites
is this next one and this is from voix
and this one it strikes me as kind of a
rosy red it's like you've taken your red
you've mixed in a little bit of pink I
think it's incredibly flattering I mean
all occasions any circumstance any time
of year
now plummet get it has I think a really
unique effect because the sheen in this
and you'll really notice it if you make
the effort to build it up on your lips a
bit more there's almost a bit of a blue
tinge to it and I think it makes it
really pretty kind of a deep mauve berry
color I absolutely love that one now
coming up next we've got our darkest two
shades one is Merlot blow this one is
just your dark rich murky kind of
purpley plum it's a really beautiful
color but I just feel like with this
application design you're working off of
a pencil type tip it's maybe not gonna
come off
100% flawless just with the one go round
you know you got to take a little time
with these deepest shades to straighten
them up a little bit if you know what I
mean and maybe a blot might not be a bad
idea and then your final shade is
blacker so you might recognize that
shade name from their eye liner for
example but it's just a true black it's
a creamy black and I still recognize in
that shade that hint of a ghost pearl as
they call it that slight very very
subtle Sheen and I think it makes it
maybe a bit more of a wearable black
than you might expect just for having
that little bit of dimension but I
really actually like that shade I think
I like the straight-up black even better
than that dark wine on me but just to
review here here's our shade lineup
you've got several that I would put in
that neutral family with the mauve to
the deep nude
and into that kind of pumpkiny color
you're really hot coral shade some cool
pinks going from more of a true pink to
a hot pink I love love love the rosy red
and also this berry shade right before
we get into the dark wine and the black
so ten shades total it's really hard to
pick favorites because I love so many of
these I mean I mentioned the cons too I
think the darkest - they're a little
more high-maintenance but I really love
night moves and also the one I'm wearing
now called sin nudes and then I think
Framboise is just unbeatable you know
that rosy red it's a nice classic and
plum and get it for the berry lovers I
mean the evenness of color this is you
know a deeper shade in terms of the
overall color spectrum here but it goes
on so evenly so rich if you're all about
that kind of color like this format is
one of the best executions of it so
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope this review was helpful as far as
the 16 hour where claim like I said I do
question that Sun because what you might
have a stain on certain ones certain
bold shades that last you a really
really long time I don't think you're
having necessarily the true like genuine
first color that you put on unless you
did like absolutely nothing didn't give
any kisses didn't eat any food didn't
have anything to drink who wants to be
living that life I don't know but unless
you're completely refraining from using
your mouth for anything at all it's
gonna show somewhere but I think the
nice thing about this is they're
actually a pleasure to put on they're
fun to reapply I'm not hating on them
for that at all because I think they're
a brilliant lip product and I may not
have talked about this enough but I love
the precision that they have even a
shade that has worn down with quite a
bit of wear has a lot of precision and
more ease and speed and application most
definitely than you have with just a
regular lipstick so thanks again guys I
hope this was useful and if you've tried
these let me know what your experience
has been like and I will see you very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
