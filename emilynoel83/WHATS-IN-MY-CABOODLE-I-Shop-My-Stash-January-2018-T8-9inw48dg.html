another what's in my caboodle or
caboodle confessions or whatever we
decided to call this thing it's my shop
my stash video basically and I'm doing
these every so often because I think
it's a great reminder of certain
products that have been in your
collection been kind of lurking in the
back of your drawers that you haven't
looked at for a while you can pull some
of those to the forefront makes you
think about him again and understand
your collection better I felt like I did
a video that was sort of shot my stash
oriented when I was talking about some
of my longtime favorite things like
certain products I am glued to and how I
want to use different eye primers also
different eyeliners different loose
powders for example and so those things
I may not have specifically put here in
this box because I basically just want
to use everything in my collection where
that's concerned except the one thing
that I've been glued to so I guess my
point here is if you like this kind of
video where I talk about shot my stash
and using what you have you might go
back and look at that one if you missed
it also I'm staring at this little black
zone right here where I can put my I'm
guessing my personalized nameplate that
I've not yet registered for but I need
to do that I've got the paperwork I knew
I was gonna struggle with getting that
done but I am gonna do it because I want
that so just opening this up this is
what it looks like I believe the last
time I did this I gave some good shots
of what the whole interior of the
caboodle looks like but this is
old-school and I loved this I saw this
on old his website I'm like what they're
selling the old-school mint green and
lavender Kaboodle's I need one and then
this became just the perfect purpose for
it so I'm just gonna go through and tell
you what I have in here number one the
foundation that I had in here last time
one of the foundations I just didn't get
around to using so it's staying in its
gonna live in here for like another
month or so it's the Lottie London
selfie ready medium coverage foundation
and I am wearing that today I really
like this foundation it was just a
situation where I tested it I determined
that I liked it and I didn't come back
to it so it's really good stuff so I'm
glad that's there and I work golden by
the way a few things from julep that are
kind of like makeup prep steps and I
know these are newer things but
sometimes that's what I do when I shot
my stash
for some new things that I really want
to make a point to put on so the no
excuses invisible sunscreen gel for face
this is SPF 40 I did put this on today
and it's really awesome it puts
basically no added weight on your skin
like if you've already moisturized and
your moisturizer doesn't have SPF which
I've got some great moisturizers that I
love that don't have it so this is
really awesome to have for that I'm two
different julep primers also the
illuminating and the mattifying today I
tried the mattifying I didn't see like
instant results on my skin from that
like I just moisturize quite a bit and
then I put this on and I was looking up
close like okay when's it gonna get mad
maybe it's just that it's gonna keep me
more matte heating more shine free
throughout the day I'm not sure but both
say treatment primer illuminating
treatment primer mattifying treatment
primer so we'll see another interesting
makeup prep type thing is strobe cream
from Mac and I have several of like the
different tones of it for example this
is the pink one this is called pink
light the strobe cream really just feels
a lot like a moisturizer but with these
different tones that they have oops it
sunless leave the different tones that
they came out with give it just like I
don't know a little bit of a tinted
sheen when it hits the light so I can
see a slight bit of pinkness there but I
thought that might be really brightening
may be good to use paired with other
moisturizers or kind of on top of the
skin for a dewy look let me know what's
your favorite way to use Mac strobe
cream because I definitely have some of
it on hand I did tossed several
concealers into my little box here that
I really want to use I've mentioned a
couple of these in the last video the
Bobbi Brown instant full cover concealer
and one thing I don't like about this is
when you take it right out of the tube
it's like only the tip has product on it
and nothing else and I feel like I'm
always going back to add more maybe
that's their hint that you don't need to
use much anyway I'm still trying that
the NARS radiant creamy concealer today
I did put on some more of this la girl
pro conceal in the peach corrector shade
and I didn't use too much of it I think
the last time when I thought it was a
borderline dark I used maybe a little
more than I needed but I've got it right
where my circles are the darkest and it
just doesn't seem
to have the coverage that erased paste
as Earth at Boeing brightening concealer
does what can I say like that's just
that's my results so far but here's
another interesting concealer that I
found in my stash that I want to use
it's the Amazonian clay waterproof
12-hour concealer in light sand it's a
little stick from Tarte what is this
like when did I get this and it is a
really smooth really nice coverage
concealer stick like I really like it I
think it may have come in like an
Amazonian clay PR bundle around the time
that their stick foundations came out I
think they sent this but this it that
doesn't necessarily mean this is a super
new product their line or anything
it's definitely flown under the radar I
mean I know shape tape gets all kinds of
praise but I haven't heard much about
this one and I really really liked it
and we'll see how it wears today because
I put that on the under I put it in a
lot of different places there's a powder
that I've had in my collection for what
seems like a long time that I want to
use more it's from La Casa lorac Pro
blurring translucent pressed powder I've
gotten so much use out of my lorac
contour palette and I figured for as
much as I like the texture of their
powders I should be giving this a shot
too it's very smooth although you know
how I feel you these translucent powders
do give off some amount of color I'm
gonna use a little bit of it actually
just like setting in here I don't know
around the t-zone maybe
note to self when your makeup has been
freshly applied you might not need to
add too much more powder but it comes
with a really nice little soft sponge
like it's super soft very velvety
feeling and a magnetic closure can't
beat that it's such a goof ball for the
magnetic closures what is it about that
I love the couple of contouring products
that I found that I haven't used in the
longest time I've got the Catrice prime
and fine professional contouring palette
and I did use the contour shade today
well I use the highlight to the
highlight just doesn't show up very much
so the contour is right in here and kind
of around my hairline it's a really nice
tone and but I put on the highlight and
I just it's SuperDuper faint I think
even if you like subtle highlights that
might not be enough for you so I did put
on top of that a little bit of the glow
shade from the Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze &amp;amp; Glow eye
how much I love this duo so I'm
definitely out to use this some more and
so the highlight that you are seeing on
my cheeks is pretty much this shade and
that is just glorious I love that a
couple of little eye palettes that I
wanted to pop in here are from Beauty
treats and I recall really enjoying
these actually being pleasantly
surprised by these they were a five
below fine so if you don't know about
five below that's a store where
everything is five dollars or below and
they really have a ton of makeup a lot
of palettes a lot of things that kind of
make you scratch your head and say is
that really gonna be good do I really
need to try that but these are awesome
little palettes so I have this one
that's like the warmish neutral well
warm and cool neutrals really and then
I've got this one that I've used a
little bit less but it's got some Browns
and purples and blues it's a really nice
mauve as I recall like right up here in
this palette quality affordable stuff
and I want to use those some more I also
grabbed out some shadow singles and
that's what I use to create my look
today and I hear you I hear you guys who
want to see another singles cruise
should I contact Kristin and see if
she's up for it it's just fun to do that
kind of stuff with a friend you know on
but what I'm wearing today I first took
my Bobbi Brown single in con yak and
that's this beautiful like kind of warm
reddish brown and I've got that in my
crease and outer corner what actually
caused me to want to dive into my single
shadows specifically my Bobbi Brown is a
beautiful Bobby Brown palette that my
girl Erica gave to me for Christmas have
yarn Ruby's just beautiful neutrals
pretty shades and I'm enjoying that and
it made me want to see what else I had
Bobby Brown related in my eyeshadows and
also if you want to see like a Christmas
and birthday haul I can do that and I've
been really thinking about doing it but
I really wanted to use the stuff a bit
more so I could kind of have some things
of value to share with you that makes
sense but I love this color this is a
metallic eyeshadow but it works so
nicely in the crease and then deepening
up my crease even further I have black
plum on and just kind of in the outside
like the outermost area blended and
buffed way way out like that shade can
go SuperDuper dark but very nice quality
there and then I
pulled out several of my metallics
paints these may sound familiar from my
video where I was talking about products
that seemed more expensive than they are
like these are fantastic eyeshadows I've
loved this taupe I think that's called
caged I took a sticker off though I've
got brass knuckles which is a little bit
of a dirty bronze shade and then today
on my lids I've got the rose chrome I
mean that that color when i swatched it
looking back on the video where I talked
about these I was like I did not do that
justice but just Pat it and applied on
the lids I think it's gorgeous I loved
it so much I got it kind of around the
inner corner to that shade is very
sheared out as an under the brow
highlight as well and then I kind of
stopped there with the eye look I opted
not to do much really on the lower lash
line but one other shade that I grabbed
out is the endless pearl from the
L'Oreal infallible line this is just a
soft like it might have just a hint of a
gentle sheen but that's the shadow
that's packaged like this with the
little stopper Man I've not used these
in a while yeah it's somewhere walking
the line between a matte and like a
barely there satin finish for lips I
found a few kind of like liquid lip
product things that are definitely non
drying and kind of staining and nice one
of them is the Revlon Colorstay moisture
stain where are these been I love these
this is in the shade Barcelona nice but
really lightweight like liquid lipstick
texture when you get started but they're
kind of like an opaque stain if that
makes any sense they're comfortable and
it really is some moisture to them when
you put them on but that color will
stain and hang around and then over the
weekend I was wearing the kathleenlights
lip colors in her latest collaboration
with color pop and one of them was an
ultra satin lip I can't remember the
shade name but it was a pretty Coralie
shade and there was kind of a new gloss
that I put on top I wouldn't have had to
because the ultra satin lip
I think are very comfortable and it
costs me to look it's in my collection
and dig out some more ultra satin lip
from colour-pop
I think I really prefer these over their
matte lips if they have good staying
power there's a nice cling to the lips
but they don't feel dry and so the shade
I'm wearing right now is lost this
beautiful red not a super bright like
fire-engine red it's got a little bit of
a muted tone to it but I really like
that
grabbed out these three sort of neutral
shades this one is dopey right here this
kind of cool mom tulips right here kind
of a brownish shade and then November is
this soft peachy pink so I really want
to get more use out of that formula I
have a bunch of them on hand that had
been sent to me but I just hadn't dug in
as much as I would have liked so now I'm
doing it but that my friends is my shot
my stash situation for this I guess
month you might say although I'm just
doing it every so often I'm doing it
when I feel compelled to do it
and I have heard from so many of you
since the last video who said I went and
got one of those Kabuto that you
mentioned or I ordered one on the Ulta
website so it's like now we've got our
own little sisterhood slash Brotherhood
of people who you know appreciate this
because it's fun is it not so perfect
for shop my stash stuff I love that so
thank you guys for watching I hope you
enjoyed this video and I will see you
again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
