this video I wanted to tell you guys all
about my buxom customizable eyeshadow
palette I'm not 100% sure how long this
option or this offering has been on the
market but I did recently see Lisa jaye
do a video about this and she's got an
awesome channel here on YouTube I hope
you'll subscribe and check it out she's
got really informative reviews and I
just like hearing her take on stuff
she's a former Mac makeup artist and I
think she's just got a ton to offer to
the YouTube beauty community and she was
sharing her palette and I thought for
$40 for six shades that you can choose
yourself plus the palette I thought that
seemed like a really good deal and
something that I would just really get
into I love the idea of choosing all the
shades and I realized like you could
look in your own collection or you could
buy a bunch of Mac singles and put
together your own palette or buy a bunch
of makeup geek or Coastal Scents you
name it I know it's not like unheard of
to put various shadows together in some
sort of palette that you've chosen
yourself but what really drew me into
this was the fact that I'd never tried
bucks and my shadows before so it was
something new to experiment with I
really liked the way in Lisa's video
that you know the quality of the palette
appeared to be it's nice and compact and
you know you can just at any given time
have six different shades all in one and
this is a situation where I think on
sephora's website or altas website you
can browse all the shadows online you
could put this all together in order
online but I like the ability to go into
my local Ulta store and swatch out a
bunch of different shades you know I had
all this going on on my hand where I was
comparing this one that went do I want
that shade do I want that shade and that
experience was really fun for me too and
if you're strictly confined to ordering
from a brand online in terms of their
eyeshadows that is you know an
experience you kind of miss out on so it
was really fun to go in and choose my
palette and so the shades I have in here
as you can see it's kind of an eclectic
mix of colors I wanted to grab shadows
that would force me to do maybe a little
something different with my look even
though it might make logical sense to
put together a certain grouping of
shades I didn't want
look like my other palettes and you kind
of also have the comfort of knowing like
this isn't permanent so if you wanted to
go you know buy another shadow or two
and swap a couple out at any point in
time you could definitely do that so how
do I feel about my color selection it's
kind of cool because I have no one to
blame but myself is I did not like the
color selection in this palette and I am
really enjoying it I feel like there are
so many ways I can use this grouping of
shades I know in another video I was
wearing like a pop of purple on the
lower lash line I can easily do an all
matte look and I have and that's really
pretty and natural-looking this is my
kind of wildcard shade at the end this
sort of teal duochrome color because it
has elements of this reddish brown that
are beside it you know when it's full-on
in the light it's looking very teal but
when it's not really hitting the light
you can see a little bit of brown coming
through so I've worn that like all over
the lid and up into the crease and
that's a fun kind of simple but
different look I can leave out the
purples and just go with like gold and
warm brown for a really summery sunny
type look the quality of the shadows is
really great they feel super creamy
really nicely pigmented I'm just as
happy with my matte shades as I am with
the more flashy shimmery colors and i
swatched so many when I was in the store
so like my decision to include these
particular shades I don't know that
there was one that i swatched where I
thought on account of it being bad
quality I'm not going to put it in it
was more just a shade selection thing
because truly every shadow that I was
trying felt so smooth so buttery and
there's a gorgeous taupe I was thinking
of throwing in here there were so many
different ways you can go definitely if
you're going to explore the eyeshadow
bar in your oldest store allow a little
time for yourself because you know it
takes a while but definitely a fun
experience for an eyeshadow lover I
thought they had a pretty vast selection
of shades I mean we're not talking every
color of the rainbow in terms of an
insanely bright matte fill-in-the-blank
shade but they did have pops of color
and then a lot of neutral shades a
really nice balance of matte shades and
shimmery shades there was just plenty to
choose from so I'll just show you the
mechanics of the palette first off has a
nice big mirror in there for you to use
it also come
with a little double-ended brush one
side is nice for like small detailed
application of shadows say on the lid
and then there's a little crease brush
that could be nice for like a smudgy eye
liner or edging something right there in
the crease and then your palette
includes an empty tray that slides out
and that is what you pop your six
shadows into they come in and out super
easily it's not like they're in there
hanging by a thread but at the same time
you're not having to struggle to pop
them out which I appreciate because I
don't want to risk like breaking a
powder shadow as I take one in and out
because I was doing a lot of in and out
because for me to decide even how I
wanted to place them in a row like I
kept changing it up I was home and I'm
like hmm I like that shade next to that
shade better at it next it's an eye
shadow geeks dream specific shades that
I have I got Kashmir craving which is a
matte cream color I got 24 karat
stilettos and this is a really you know
super metallic gold has a lot of
brightness to it and I think maybe just
the tiniest hint of a little green in
this one because they've got a different
gold that's a little more muted I got
this matte shade called spoiled sexy so
a nice dusty dusty rose wild nights is a
shimmery purple no faux is this really
interesting shade that looks like a
bright teal indirect lighting and then
when it's not you can see a little bit
of a reddish brown coming out and then I
thought I'd play off of that with a
really warm reddish brown here with
filthy bridge and this shade is matte as
well so I've got one two three mattes
and three really bold shimmers so if you
do decide to try this you know you might
be inspired by some of the shades I got
but I would say you know take a good
look at some of the other palettes you
own and try to use this opportunity to
do something different than what you
already have you know go with maybe a
few shades that you know are going to be
like standard basics that you'll use all
the time but you know bring in some pops
of color because there are a lot of
really good quality shades that are on
the very natural neutral side and then
some more flashy fun shades too so for
today's look I went with a very very
very look on my eyes so I will show you
my tutorial now I already have Milani
eyeshadow primer all
for my lids I know they say this
eyeshadow is like primer infused but I'm
just I'm never not gonna use an eye
primer I think in the sense that yeah
they're super pigmented with or without
a primer I think that holds true but
just as far as staying power I'm not
saying they couldn't last without a
primer but it's just my personal comfort
zone so I'm going to go into this dusty
mauve color first this is a sigma e25
and this is just a nice kind of go-to
not too light not too dark shade to get
going in the crease
this was the shade that when I was
shopping in my Ulta store they didn't
have this in the display and then the
girl unchecked down below in the drawer
underneath and they didn't have any more
and then bless her heart she ran off to
the back and she did find one back there
so I guess this is a pretty popular
shade or difficult to keep in stock but
it is beautiful for a soft crease and I
like kind of you know really shearing it
out as I blend upward then I take this
matte creamy color and I'm just taking
that up over the border of the mauve and
kind of using this shade as my under the
brow highlight then I go into this deep
warm brown which I thought would be an
interesting shade to have in this
palette and just to kind of switch it up
and not go with just like a cool dark
plum or black or something like that I
thought this would be fun to see how it
played along with you know the mob
colors the purples and so I'm just using
this mainly in my outer corner just to
deepen things up a bit there next up I'm
working with this pretty shimmery purple
and I'm going to apply that with my
Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush and I'll
just Pat it all over my lid
and then I'm going to clean off my brush
real quick and I'm going to go to this
golden color this I feel almost has a
tinge of green in it and I'm just taking
that here around my inner corner and
just up on to the inner part of the lid
I'm very loyal to doing like a light
champagne color right in that area and
so it's kind of fun to pop it with
something different and then before I do
the lower lashline I'm going to use some
NYC liquid liner just going right across
the top here
I'll wing it out just a little bit
I'm going to apply some Milani shadow
eyes in almond cream to my lower inner
rim for brightness and then I'm using
this angled brush with my dark brown I'm
going to use that just under my wing and
carry it inward and then to keep that
looking nice and smoky I'm using a
pencil brush to apply that shade all the
way in so I finished off the look with
some mascara top and bottom and some red
cherry number 43 false lashes and I kind
of continued the mob type theme
throughout the rest of my makeup so on
my lips I'm wearing my butter LONDON
lippy in toff so this is their like kind
of shiny lacquer type liquid lipstick I
really love this and then I was
sent these new Becca luminous blushes
and this is the shade called foxglove so
I thought that would make a really
pretty cheek color with this look so
thank you guys so much for watching this
video again I think I had a really good
experience putting together my own buxom
palette and I may still you know
purchase other shades if I'm feeling
like this needs to be switched out in
some way but for right now I think I've
set myself up to have a lot of options
and do a lot of different fun looks so
let me know if you've tried this what
shadows do you like are you thinking
about trying it what kind of a palette
would you create they do have at least a
few pre done palettes too so you can
check those out on the website also I'll
link to everything below but I hope you
guys are having a great day and I will
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
