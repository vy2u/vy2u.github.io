you're having a good day so far this
video is gonna be a dive into a bunch of
new drugstore products I've recently
gotten just like this influx of new
drugstore stuff from Ulta you know every
now and then we just kind of hit that
wave where a bunch of new stuff comes
out so I thought in this video I would
apply that all for you in most cases
it's stuff I've had a little experience
with so far so I will definitely share
whatever tidbits I can it is truly the
most still and quiet morning around here
so
well let's get going I've already got on
this this is my Clinique Moisture Surge
intense I don't wear a lot of this like
I don't slather this on I feel like I
just use enough to basically cover the
skin but I'm not trying to ever build up
this product it's really good in just a
thin thin sense and I just think it
behaves really well under most
foundations so this is what I've been
doing a lot lately in case I've
forgotten to mention it and then you
know how it goes as soon as your girl
finishes up doing a video on full
coverage foundations somebody's gonna
come out with the new one so this is the
Revlon Colorstay full cover foundation
it says matte 200 I guess this shade
name is nude on the back of the claim
say up to 24 hour wear no caking or
fading lightweight blend seamlessly the
texture of this is really really similar
to something else that I've tried from
the drugstore and it's the l'oreal
infallible the full coverage option that
comes in a tube that's like about this
size and I feel like they're both kind
of a moosie texture do you see how
that's squeezed out there and it's like
it's not running all over my finger or
anything it's just kind of like almost a
whipped feeling cream it's like there's
most definitely some thickness to the
product but also kind of a lightweight
nature to it too so this shade again
200 nude when I was using this yesterday
I was kind of thinking you know it seems
to look really good when I place it in
this area but all over my skin it's a
little on the light side live and learn
sometimes I hit it right on the money
when I order from ulties website
sometimes I'm just confused i dampened
my Real Techniques sponge yesterday I
was applying this with a brush
and I thought the coverage while not
full was still pretty good but I just
didn't love like the finish on my skin
it is very matte but it can kind of show
and I remembered my experience with that
L'Oreal that I'm comparing this to with
that I always felt the most effective
way to blend it in was with a blender
sponge because the texture of it was
kind of like this a little bit thick a
little bit moosie and it was like it
needed some help sort of breaking down
into the skin so I'm going to see if I
like this better when applied with a
Beauty Blender
I would say that I do you know I don't
think I helped the coverage any putting
it on this way but like the look across
the skin seems way more natural even
applied with a brush and like trying to
be really careful to to not like shear
out the coverage too much I don't think
this is a full coverage foundation at
all this is one of those classic
examples of a foundation that's labeled
itself full coverage and you look up at
your skin you're like well I'm still
seeing all the things I'm seeing under
eye I'm seeing a lot of spots I'm seeing
redness I'm seeing pimple if the texture
of this sounds appealing to you or
there's the consistency of the
foundation the L'Oreal is very similar
but I think it beats this out coverage
wise by quite a bit I think that's
definitely like a really really close to
full coverage foundation on as full as
the maybelline superstay and so that's
why it didn't make it into that video
where I talked about full coverage stuff
but it just seemed like a logical
comparison here in this video now I do
not have a brand-spankin'-new drugstore
concealer that's one of the few things
that I didn't get so I'll just go for a
different one here this is from makeup
revolution it's the concealed and
defined I wear this in c-five you've
probably heard me talk about this before
and how I feel this is my perfect shade
and I thought now that I have a little
melasma kind of peeking through on my
skin it might be good to show you how
this product tackles that issue what
brushes aren't really my favorite for
applying foundations but I do kind of
like them with certain concealers around
the eyes when you're not bothering to
correct and you're just using a skin
tone concealer I think the shade is so
important when you've got any kind of
discoloration and so this shade just
seems to really do it for me
really excellent coverage I feel like
there then I'm going to set that I'm
going to kind of commit to at least the
full coverage goal in this video I'm
gonna set with a little bit of my
Maybelline fit me loose powder in fair
and we're going to bake
and then we're gonna play with kind of a
barely used product here from a L'Oreal
it's called the brow stylist shape and
fill triangular tip and mechanical
pencil so it's one of those little bit
thicker you know brow pencils it does
have sort of that teardrop looking shape
which some people can find gives a
really fast fill-in and if the texture
of the product is right I think that can
definitely be the case and be a good
thing and then it's got the spoolie on
the other end and then I'm gonna set it
with my brow stylist boost and set which
I love I love that little on teeny tiny
brush but I'm using sort of the most
formed little you know pointed tip and
I'm using that around the front of the
brow
the trouble with stuff that's really got
a formed point to it is that even though
it's a twist up pencil yeah and it's
gonna like maintain the sides of the
product as you go you're gonna be
constantly rounding off the point you
know what I mean but I really like the
texture of this because it's not too
goopy I don't feel like I'm depositing
like a bunch of cream in my brows you
know and I can kind of brush through it
and everything looks really natural but
that elf I tell you the little elf
instant lift brow pencil it's like two
dollars comes in some really good shades
it doesn't have any special shape to the
tip let's put it that way and that works
so so nicely sometimes I feel like when
I know that's out there and even for
other drugstore things you might pay
double or triple the price it's hard to
make other stuff seem worth it at this
point you know but if you like that
thicker tip you know a shape that's not
quite so teeny tiny pointed that's
pretty good it did give me a pretty fast
fill-in and then I take the boost and
set in the dark brunette shade this
teeny tiny brush oh it's so nice hard
candy came out with the first thing like
this that I can remember but I don't
know why they wouldn't have kept it in
their line it's like that tattoo ink
brow tint whatever but this is so good
in the hold it's really nice like you
feel it as soon as it goes on you're
like yep something's holding on there so
next up I'm going to dust away the
baking
I won't mistakenly call that bacon like
I did last time
I'm brightened and I am smooth and now
the next thing that I got tell me what
this is a copycat product of this is
Ulta brand and it says baked sculpting
glow this was new on their website three
in one palette they have three different
shades that this comes in and I ended up
getting this one called Tahitian sunset
and it says cool on the website they
also have one labeled neutral and a
really warm looking palette as well but
I just thought is this gonna be any good
and is this gonna rival Laura Geller
because she has the exact same looking
product I'm not sure if maybe one of
those other compacts might have even
more similar shades because like this
highlight the highlight in the palette I
love so much from Laura Geller is the
baked french vanilla which is like a
barely there highlight it's kind of a
nice like just brightening powder on the
skin but this as you can see is
something built for more shimmer so what
I'm gonna do is dip into the bronzer
it's very soft like you really don't
have that happen and with Laura Keller's
products where you dip in and they fly
around it doesn't seem like a standard
baked consistency here may be
consistencies they're wrong word but
texture the bronzer is really really
light okay there I feel like I got a
little more maybe it's kind of a
buildable thing
trying to bring some life to this kind
of to light foundation here that I've
got on so here's what's up I may come
back to that for the highlight but for
blushes I've got these new L'Oreal
blushes they say enchanted scented blush
what is that fruit exactly I'm not sure
because on the back it just says
enchanting fruit scented blush I don't
feel like they all smell identical
though like one of them is really strong
and it smells definitely peachy and it's
this one
that's called I'm just curious right
here and it does look very peachy so
here's the color scheme of them all and
this one I was trying to put this one on
yesterday and it barely showed up
bashful its peach but with a major like
golden e sheen taking over there that
might even operate as a highlight on
some people and then as you can see
compared to the first that I showed this
is the deepest one 193 charming this one
smells kind of peachy to this one
however very little smell hardly any
smell so it's odd that that's not really
consistent there but this one has a nice
bit of depth to it it's kind of a dark
peach and I actually think this is very
pretty on the skin so I'm going to grab
a little bit of that I'd call it a satin
finish as you look at it in the pan like
it doesn't seem like it would be really
metallic or anything this just got a
little subtle Sheen
it's a happy blush it's a nice blush I'm
not sure that it's worth the price tag
because I was just talking about a
makeup revolution palette in my
favorites video that's full of like
these kinds of tones that I've got right
here and you pay like less than $10 for
that and these I think we're around $9
each maybe oh pardon me these are $12.99
and the color bashful is sold out so
that was what I like the least it just
gave off the least color on the skin it
wasn't quite enough to really be super
highlighter ish and it didn't blush me
up a whole lot either the charming one
is the one I definitely like the color
of but if you're into sense this one
barely had any smell fruit scented blush
whatever that means actually I don't
think I'm gonna go back to the old
palette for the highlight because I got
something else I'm itching to try these
are from L'Oreal they are the infallible
long we're shaping sticks and I have one
that's a blush and one that's a
highlight the blush shade I got is
called sexy flush and the highlight is
called slay in a rose drugstores kind of
been lacking a quality blush stick since
I haven't really seen those Maybelline
master glazes out and about too much but
I must say the texture of these feels
perfect the way that's blending out on
the skin this seems like a really subtle
shade but like it's blending out
perfectly you don't want a blush stick
to be too dry and too like clinging to
any one area you just kind of want it to
blend across the top of the skin that's
my preference I'm gonna do just a little
bit of this right here can you see where
I put it it's a soft pink y'all okay
it's just blend lightly
I see that and let's add a little more
it blends so beautifully you know on top
of powders that you've already put on
that was just the way those Maybelline
master glaze sticks were where did they
go I don't know but now we have another
option that is a pretty shade though I
know I already had a little existing
blush on but I can really tell the
difference when I put this on not a lot
of Sheen to this maybe just a tiny hint
but overall it's almost toward a matte
it seems like let's check this out let's
see if this is the exact same texture
ooh could be pretty potent feels like it
should blend out just as easily that's a
real accomplishment in a product you
know I've tried to cover up my melasma
so I really don't want to put something
on that requires me to you know dig back
in under my foundation work really hard
to blend something as I blended both of
these products I'm using a finger and
I'm doing little circular motions and
I'm not applying hardly any pressure to
the skin whatsoever and then you get
that little glow there
from a distance I like it getting up
close I don't love the look of it it
definitely didn't feel too dry to blend
it out like it was blending out
perfectly fine but when I look up close
at the skin it's not leaving me with
like the most beautiful texture on top
of my skin it's not doing like Becca
shimmering skin perfecter liquid type
beautifulness on top of there or like
the makeup revolution liquid highlight
those are really gorgeous products and
this is just kind of I'm gonna use a new
ish drugstore setting mist to me that's
not been in my collection very long but
I've been reaching for it here and there
it's the Milani make it dewy
I feel like this really works you feel
like you're misting something very
different on your skin most sex rays
they feel like water hitting your skin
and this kind of feels more like an oil
I don't know I feel like I can sense the
results from this right away like just
seeing my skin in person it definitely
does make a difference the first
ingredient in this is water and I do see
glycerin as well but it just comes out
hitting your skin like a different
texture than most setting this it feels
almost like a an oil spray it doesn't
really sound all that appealing because
you're thinking this is that just gonna
break down my makeup I haven't noticed
that happening but I do notice an
instantaneous kind of look of glow but I
don't over apply okay let's move this
sign along we're gonna do some Milani
eyeshadow primer all over the lids gosh
this is like squeezing out the last of
the toothpaste here I am really about
done I love this product you guys know
that everything kind of comes back to
this product it's my benchmark sort of
eyeshadow primer for comparison with
other things and that doesn't mean it's
gonna be everyone's tip top favorite not
everything's gonna work for everybody's
you know skin texture oiliness
what-have-you but this works great for
me another one could have kind of been
getting into a bit more recently when I
shot my stash and did my little bottom
of the drawer back of the drawer thing
the Urban Decay anti-aging like I just
feel like that's something I should be
using anti aging around the eyes seems
important got a handful of freshly clean
makeup brushes and I just dropped them
in my coffee cut this end and it wasn't
all of them but a couple of them just
they slipped right down into my cup is
it a makeup brush is it a coffee
stirrer I don't know I got this from
Maybelline it's the city mini palette
matte about town take off the little
sleeve I've tried a couple of these city
mini palettes in the past I actually
kind of want to dig them out for a
minute I have the one called chill
brunch neutrals and the rooftop bronzes
I recall not being completely blown away
by these but they remind me of just a
reworked version of those I studio quads
do you remember those they kind of
looked like this sort of shape of shadow
and they were just all in a line of for
the textures on a lot of things seemed
similar to that these aren't bad palette
see they're like there's some decent
smoothness and pigmentation I think
color selection wise they weren't like
completely rocking my world but I was
curious as to what they would do with
the totally matte palette and it wasn't
like there were tons of these there was
just this one and we have six colors
total and it almost looks like we've got
a little bit warmer matte color scheme
here and maybe something a little cooler
like a little more pink in these shades
over here that they are so so smooth and
really nice to work with you're gonna
want to tap off excess fair warning like
you know they can kick up a little
powder enos they kind of remind me of
lorac in that sense I'm setting up the
crease with a little bit of this shade
it's a little bit pinky it's kind of
light and then I'm going to deepen up a
bit with the shade right next to it oh
they blend really great on top of each
other
again anytime your brush sticks into it
just just watch out I'm okay with that
if you're gonna give me a smooth
pigmented eyeshadow that's easy to kind
of work with across the eyes it's gotten
a lot of nice mobility you know it's not
clinging to any one place if you can
give me that I'll deal you know
I'll deal with a little extra fallout
trying to make sure I get this little
area blended then I want to highlight
I'm gonna use this lightest one here
just a little bit yeah really good it's
been a while since I've done an all Matt
eye look but any time I do one I'm like
yes this this looks so flawless you do
kind of achieve this really perfected
look on the eyes that you don't
necessarily get other ways I'm going to
use this sort of lightest beige and I've
got a flat brush now we're gonna Pat it
on the lid and around the corner inner
corner
I dig this guy's I'm really liking it
all on its own and the times I've used
it before I've like kind of picked into
certain little shades and kind of added
them in on top of other looks but it can
definitely hold its own I think it's
creating a pretty look just as is then
I'm going to go down here to this color
which actually as you look at it in the
palette up really close do you remember
the quality that those it cosmetics
eyeshadows always seem to have like that
it's a fully matte palette but yet the
shades seem just a teeny bit verging on
satiny I noticed that with this darkest
color especially down here this is a
rich Brown maybe just a little bit of a
little hint of warmth in this Brown
I could see a lot of people liking this
it's just you know work situations easy
palates where there's not a lot of
decisions to make well some of us live
for palates I do hear from quite a few
others who say fewer choices please it's
kind of blending around the outside here
I'm gonna use some of this color I think
on the lower lash line you just don't
forget to tap off backs yes that's
pretty
I am applying just a little bit more of
the darkest shade just trying it out
with like a small crease brush instead
of the flat brush and as stuff sheers
out there definitely is this kind of
warm feel to these Browns like kind of
an underlying reddish tone happening
here which is fine with me but I think
you might not pick up on it so much just
looking at that at a glance I am gonna
use my wet and wild ultimate brow
highlight which I you know live to put
in the lower inner rim instantly awake I
finally woke up in this video
lash paradise one of my favorite kinds
of mascaras they now have a liquid
eyeliner voluminous Lashkar dice liquid
liner it's got this long kind of felt
tip seems very very black
I have shaken it up thoroughly and we're
just going to take this across the lash
line here this is going on really rich
like I feel like this liner would
effectively top off any look that you
would do you know like if you had a
really shimmery lid it's just so rich
and black
I am finding it pretty easy to work with
but I do have to like get back in and
get more like get more juice on the tip
once I get to the end and I'm doing like
a wing which I hadn't done before with
this so that make einde of cramp your
style you know like you get into that
flow of the plumbing that liquid
eyeliner and then it's like OOP I need
more product I'm gonna stop messing with
it now one of the biggest points of
wisdom I can share with you about liquid
liner is knowing when to stop here's
another really interesting thing that
this is my first time using it here it's
the voluminous lash primer you know I
love the mascara so we're gonna pair
these together and see what kind of a
look we come up with and if this is just
gonna be a redo of the regular
voluminous lash I'm not here for it that
really had a tendency of straightening
out my lashes and so I'm hoping this is
not just a redo of that formula in the
lash Paradise tube ooh
okay it's pink guys it's gonna be kind
of like my G Vaughn Chi 1 which is also
pink note it it's a fluffy brush that
really seems like lash paradise is it
going to immediately straighten the
lashes because curl is everything for me
if they don't stay curled they don't
look like they're present we'll see
we'll give that a second and move on to
the other eye it does have that just
light pinky look and I think the shade
is called millennial pink so my kids new
thing is swatches like they have seen me
countless times like get something and I
starts watching it on my hand and
they'll reach out their hands and be
like can I have some swatches bail will
say that Biddy will just kind of edge
her way in and I know what she wants and
once I give them one like just a light
like you know shimmery shade god knows
they've been waiting dirtier than any
swatch is gonna make them but they get
so excited about it and they're like
starting to look at it turning it in the
light and I'm like ok yep they're
feeling it this smells oh it smells
perfumed what
hold on put down the mirror that is
strongly scented that really gives me an
odd feeling they just vaguely noticed it
holding
tube closed to me I didn't really feel
any fumes coming off the eyes you ever
help that kind of you me feeling that
man that smells like a strongly scented
deodorant or like a body spray that's
kind of floral why would they put that
much scent in a product like this I hope
I don't start to get irritation from
that I don't see my curl dropping really
at all here should I put a little on the
lower lashes why not I don't want him to
chunky down here but why does it have
that much smell lash paradise doesn't
have all that no not at all
not remotely oh yeah I plan to open up a
new tube of lash paradise I got this one
that has like a little sparkly calf the
other one was starting to get a little
dry on me probably my third tube of it
that I've gone through so whenever
you're using like a light primer of this
kind I think you really want to let it
get dry because you don't want the light
color of it to mix in with your black
mascara yeah it says allow primer to dry
before applying mascara on top and it
says infused with rose oil
this helps adhere mascara to lashes the
rose oil does it smell rosy yeah Rosie
just kind of floral in general kind of
smells like my mom let's put some lash
paradise on top of this blackest black
the thing is I already love this mascara
on its own do I even need another step I
think when a L'Oreal realize just how
huge lash paradise ended up being
they're just like all right everything
in the line paradise we need a primer we
need a liner we need some blushes and
I'm getting sloppy and if you specs a
little clean up go ahead and do the
lowers here on this side I do not really
like that primer on my lower lashes it's
giving me more more than I want to do on
the upper lashes though you guys I would
have to say I think it's giving me some
more length but at the same time it's
taking away some of that kind of fluffy
feeling of this mascara do you guys know
what I mean when you just apply lash
paradise-like it really enhances every
lash and I almost feel like the primer
like pre stuck some lashes together a
little bit going forward I don't think I
would bother to reach for the primer
I don't think it's doing that much for
me here you go guys little turn there
the length this is not bad it's just
clustering eyelashes together a bit I'm
gonna do kind of a mini try on here for
you because I have these three from
Maybelline they are called color
sensational shine compulsion lipstick
and they say on the website it's
Maybelline's first oil in stick lipstick
has 60 percent reflective oils for an
irresistible shine
I got baddest beige undressed pink and
spicy mob so just three very different
shades I felt like I've tried the
undressed pink and the spicy mob this
will be my first time for the baddest
beige I do like that if it's going to be
this format they've got a tube going all
the way up the stick there's sort of a
dip in the stick that I don't know if
you'll even be able to identify but I
can really feel it as I put it on my
lips I don't know why they did that
this shade seems oddly clingy to some
dry areas on the lips like where it's
smooth and shiny it's smooth but it's
not just perfecting everything it's a
little thinner feeling than the Loreal
shine ones which I absolutely adore
although even some of those shades in
that line have their faults you know
somewhere a little bit more milky and
didn't always give the most even color
but a lot of them were good this does
have just a little more greasy feel that
shade is okay you know I just don't
think I'd leave it alone as is I have a
little dryness on my upper lip and it's
definitely not making that look really
great sometimes that's just the way
light shades go so we're gonna take this
off and put on the pink the pink I
really didn't like I didn't like this
shade this is called undressed pink just
in a full-on sense on my list see how
the color is pretty full with these
they're not really sheer
but like that color just 100% on the
lips and see how if you got any areas
that need extra hydration your lips it
maybe aren't just the perfect texture
you know these couple of light shades
are kind of making that stand out yes
there's some shine but I need more like
treatment to the lips a product like
this realistically is going to be my
go-to when I feel like okay my lips are
feeling dry I need something really
smooth and creamy let me throw this on
its gonna make my lips look better
Neutrogena moisture soon as the color
sticks do that the L'Oreal shine formula
does that spicy mauve probably my
favorite color it's just a little deeper
and maybe the reason why I like it is it
keeps little imperfections from sanding
out quite as much
see that colors beautiful and it's not
accentuating my dryness like the others
work so I could get on board with that
but really I don't feel compelled to
really explore the whole line yeah hey
this is where we're at this is the
finished look the blushes I'm just
seeing in here in my box I really think
they're kind of overpriced for what they
are the scent was inconsistent shade to
shade is in one it was barely there one
it was there really strong and you can
find those colors in so many other
places for a better value I just
questioned that a full cover claim on
this stuff here I don't think it makes
my skin look that good from a finish
standpoint and also a coverage
standpoint the lash primer frankly I
don't think lash paradise needs that
kind of help
like it just it's fine on its own for me
the best parts about this I think I
really like this city mini palette from
Maybelline the matte matte about town is
what it's called
I think that's a great little basic
selection of mattes and the textures are
really really smooth this little dupe on
Laura Geller you only saw me used the
bronzer today and that was pretty soft
and light but these products as a whole
seem to be a really nice texture and I
really want to work in the blush in the
highlight and I do want you to know that
this texture on the infallible long
we're shaping sticks the sexy flush
color the blush that's a very well done
easy to work with
stick blush texture so thank you guys so
much for watching and experiencing these
products with me we'll see you again
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
