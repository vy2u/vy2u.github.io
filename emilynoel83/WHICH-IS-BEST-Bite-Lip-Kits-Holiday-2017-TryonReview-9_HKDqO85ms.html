joining me for my first holiday review
as is always an exciting time when all
the kids start rolling out this is gonna
be all about bite and their three
different lip kits or three of them I
guess that I've seen on their website
like they do have a few little different
combination sets but there's one of
their lipsticks that says joy one of
their liquefied lipsticks that says kiss
and then wish is this set so they're all
kind of consistent and make me think
holiday just because this is my first
review on holiday sets of course a lot
of things that I have talked about
recently could also make good gifts so I
think a video that I'm going to make a
point to do this time around for the
holidays is stuff that's not technically
holiday like a special holiday
collection from a certain brand but
still something that would be just a
fantastic gift that's definitely
something I'm gonna do
but bite as far as this brand goes one
of my favorite brands for lip products
so I always love to stock up around this
time and for me and think about any lip
product lover in your life you don't go
through the loop sticks really quickly
even though you wear a lot of lipsticks
you got tons of different shades and
it's very rare to use up a lipstick or a
lip gloss but when you get them in these
smaller sizes I think it's a little more
fun to do the sampling so as by it seems
to do every year they do a little four
pack of lipsticks and this is $25 this
is the amuse-bouche perfect bite
lipstick set and so I'm going to be
trying all these things on for you in
this video by the way but 25 on that for
$22 I'm just referring to my app here
they have the liquefied lift set getting
this kit this is the first time I've
tried this formula but that's 22 for
those and so these are both mini sets
but then for $35 they have a three-piece
set of all full-size things and it's a
lip liner one of their multi sticks and
one of their cream lip glosses as well
so again I'm gonna be trying all these
things on reviewing them for you but
bite lipsticks I mean the lipstick was
the first thing that drew me into bites
line they had their luminous cream
lipsticks and more recently they've
transformed that line into the
amuse-bouche lipstick line and they are
fabulously creamy lipsticks I think the
feel of them is very comparable to the
Tom Ford
stick that I just got and tried recently
maybe just a little bit less creamy than
that but it's really close the colors
that bite puts out are very vibrant and
I always tend to like the mix that they
put into their kits also their products
are made with food grade ingredients you
can feel really good about having them
on your lips and a key ingredient that
they work in is resveratrol which is one
of the main antioxidants in wine so it's
a very like lip healthy good for you
type of product first kit that I'm going
to focus on here is sort of their
monochromatic kit it's the one that says
wish and it is the champagne discovery
set this one I had a lot of fun with
actually I really like the color
selection in here and I think this might
be one of the most like universally
workable nude lips that I've seen when I
say nude lip it I think it means
different things for different people
but I feel like this shade selection
here really hits it down the middle it's
kind of like a little bit deeper nude
with a little bit of rose mixed in and
it's just a super wearable trio of
products and you are getting them all in
full sizes so the multi state I've
experimented with a couple of these I
really like the tube first off you're
gonna have that magnetic tube that bite
gives you and this color called cashew I
think I might describe it as sort of a
deep dusty rose nude because it's not
just the rose there's definitely a lot
of neutral thrown into this and these
sticks are not formed at the end because
they're designed to be eyes lips or
cheeks and so I used it a little bit on
my cheek I'll show you that I just kind
of raised my elf small stipple brush
over the end of it and dabbed it on my
cheeks and I'll admit I've ear more
toward wanting to use these on lips than
cheeks with these multi-purpose products
I feel like they're generally better for
one thing or the other some will be more
moisturizing and just really ideal on
the lips and yes an added bonus you can
put them on the cheeks if you want to
some it's like their best on the cheeks
because they're more dry and then when
you go to put them on the lips it just
doesn't work this one really can work
for either but I'm just more drawn to
using it on my lips it's very smooth and
creamy not quite as much shine as their
amuse-bouche lipsticks have but I think
it's just a really great shade and it's
a shade that I feel like I can put
without having that precision of the
form tip because they also give you
another thing that works hand in hand
with this which is the lip pencil in
cashew my first time trying one of bites
lip pencils with this kit as well it's
number 36 and it is just a perfect match
for the multi stick so after I put the
multi stick all over my lips I like to
take the lip pencil and just kind of use
it to clean up because it is such a good
match I can just go over my Cupid's bow
area anywhere else and it's a nice
creamy actual lip pencil that you will
sharpen and I just I love that duo and
when that's all you have on you don't
have a ton of shine on your lips you're
kind of taking advantage of the more
matte end of this lip look then they
throw in one of the cream lip glosses
and this is in the shade champagne pearl
and I've tried three of these so far I
tried I think the one called oyster
pearl that was a really unique color but
I didn't find it really working with a
lot of different lip products that I was
trying to pair it with they also have a
rose one that I think is really pretty
but this is the most like show-stopping
of them all and I like being able to use
it either as a complete topper for this
lip look or my favorite way to
incorporate it is to just really focus
it in on the center of the lower lip
you've got all this shine I mean it's
just brilliant and it pairs so well with
these colors which are a little bit
deeper nude and then this gorgeous
champagne glow on top of it and it's not
a glitter filled lip gloss it's not one
of those things that's gonna like wear
down on your lips and all you're gonna
see is sparkle any shimmer or frost and
this is so so fine and it's really about
the shine it's about the reflectivity of
these really micro-fine pigments in here
that allow it to catch the light so
beautifully and I just love this set I
think this would work for so many people
it would be a really great gift option
let's move on to the perfect bite this
is gonna be your $25 set of 4 lip colors
I always feel this way but it's a total
steal to be getting these four lip
colors albeit many lip colors but
they're so pigmented it's such a nice
formula $25 is a great deal and with
this they've kind of changed up their
tin a little bit now you're getting it
in this pretty like metallic ruby color
normally it's just one flat red
and then when you open it up you've got
a mirror on the inside a little sheet
giving you an indication of the shades
and then the way the tubes are they are
just a downsized amuse-bouche lipstick
they've got that little like curved out
notch in the top an important thing to
know about this kit if you really buy a
lot of these bite lip kits like I am
like you kind of make it a point to
collect these and stock up when they
come out in sets honeycomb is in this
kit and it was in last year's as well
and that's the nude shades a really nice
nude but that did appear last time and
also rhubarb is in here and this was in
I think one of their little duo's that
they've sold recently so if those names
sound familiar to you as I'm talking
about them they have been put out in
minis in different ways I do think these
particular shade 's round out this kit
really well and give you four distinctly
different colors overall the formula of
these lipsticks I mean it is I think the
most outstanding single product that
bite makes I mean I like everything was
in that kit that I just mentioned but
this lipstick formula is just so dang
good it's gonna be more creamy than a
Besame lipstick a lot of the best ma
ones well I love that line I mean those
are ultra full color but these have a
little more creaminess there's just a
bit more moisture in these but they're
not quite as creamy as the Tom Ford one
was that I talked about recently just
trying to give you some perspective in
some context here let's try on all the
shades honeycomb gorgeous nude it's like
not too light not too dark does not set
the life from your face I do think it's
a great shade to have in here but again
that appeared in the last year's set
then they're giving you sugar cane as
well and I adore this color this is my
first time trying sugar cane and it is
the perfect soft pink I almost want to
describe it as pinky nude but it's a
little more pink than that but I am
going to get so much use out of this
color I think it's just gorgeous it's
kind of what I think of as winter pink
it's a pink that's not too bubblegum
not too much berry infused in it you
know but it's still really just soft and
light I love that shade and then rhubarb
we're talking a gorgeous soft berry it's
not going to be one of those ultra
purpley berries one that's got a lot of
fuchsia in it or hot pink very much a
soft wearable berry shade absolutely
love
rhubarb is a shade that I have in
another set but I don't mind having
another one and I think it's so
flattering
now cayenne this shade is fun this is
also one of my favorite things to add to
my chili but this is a bright warm red
kind of reminds me of Bess amaze red hot
red it has so much warmth to it so much
intensity it's SuperDuper vibrant I mean
it's just glamorous and I kind of think
regardless of what you assume a person's
lit preferences to be I find this to be
a highly giftable set because you got
three shades you know with the nude and
the soft pink and the rhubarb ultra
wearable but then you've got Cayenne in
here and people may not realize like how
good they look in a shade like this
because it might not always be the kind
of thing they buy for themselves but
it's just in a mini here you know it's
low risk even if this doesn't turn out
to be your favorite shade it's not like
you're losing out big-time but I love
that bite isn't scared to throw in a fun
splash of color with those more
traditionally wearable shades I think
this one's gorgeous so they've done it
again they've put out another four pack
of lipsticks that I really enjoy and I
think would be a great gift idea for the
holidays 25 bucks such a good deal like
don't miss out on it get it before it
sells out now a new formula to me that I
got to try in one of these kids is the
amuse bouche liquefied lips ette and my
mind immediately thought that these were
gonna be mad just because that's kind of
what we've been trained to think so many
brands are putting out the matte liquid
lipsticks you hear liquid lip and you
think it's gonna be drying matte
whatever I should have known better that
bite would not put out a drying
uncomfortable liquid lips say what this
moreso makes me think of it's like a
melted down lipstick well I feel like
their regular lipsticks do give off a
little bit of shine which granted that
fades with where like the color wears
pretty nicely and evenly but you're not
gonna have that hint of shine on your
lips forever
these liquefied lips are gonna have a
good amount of shine as you continue to
wear them like I'm wearing one of them
now you see the amount of shine on there
you might almost think I've got a gloss
on but it's one of these it's kind of
like a gloss regular lip color all
rolled into one because the color
intensity is so there with these these
are very opaque but very shiny staying
power wise comparing the lipsticks to
these these are pretty long wearing I
gotta say they really do kind of hang on
to your lips they definitely have that
feeling when you first put them on
you're like okay this is a little bit
thick not uncomfortable at all you won't
think these are sticky but there's a
little thickness to them and you really
do feel it as soon as you put them on
but we're I'm just a little while and
they have that nice one with your lips
feeling it's like they just calm down a
little bit I don't know how to put it
like this is not feeling near as thick
on my lips as it did when I first put it
on maybe it's melting in just a little
bit I'm not sure but overall the best
staying power I think comes from the
lipsticks compared to these I think the
lipsticks just wear down a bit more
evenly
these are still nice lip products but if
you are going for staying power if
that's what you're shooting for if
that's a priority for you the lipsticks
I think do a little better job with that
first shade I'll put on is the lightest
and it's called whip I mean this is just
a really pretty nude compared to
honeycomb I don't know I feel like this
shade has just a little bit more of a
tan vibe to it but it's a really pretty
shade that I do feel very comfortable in
the next color is called Demi gloss a
and this one is a brown like it's a
brown mixed with a little moth and a
little plum and I feel like it's a
little bit out of my comfort zone yet
very appropriate for the season going
into fall and winter like it's a
gorgeous color it's just not something
I'm used to throw it on you know but
this is a fun shade and they could most
definitely be mixed I didn't even really
touch on that with the lipsticks but you
can obviously do that as well mix the
shades layer the shades for example I
think Deni gloss a with a little bit of
whip like in the center of the lip might
be a really gorgeous look then we've got
two distinctly different levels of red
here in this kit brazed is going to be
that wearable any person's red it's the
shade I've been wearing throughout the
videos I've just been sitting here
talking and it's red but it's like red
with the lights turned down low you know
what I mean it's it's not too bright and
I don't think it's too bright for anyone
frankly it's a very like face flattering
red I think it's gorgeous but then
they're also giving you flambe and this
I kind of think is Cayenne from the last
set the lipstick set it's like the
liquefied equivalent of that shade it's
gorgeous I mean I feel like a million
bucks when I put on that kind
color so this like I said a new formula
we get to experiment with from bite
these are little guys so I think it's
kind of low risk you know if you don't
turn out to love one of them you just
got a mini on your hands so thank you
guys so much for watching I hope this
sorted out these kits for you I think
it's three fantastic really affordable
kits if I were to rank them in terms of
favorite to least favorite I'm really
loving both of these actually it's
because I love their lipstick formula so
much and this might be my number one but
here I really love the color tone like
this was a gorgeous wardrobe of shades
for that pretty nude lip that's not too
light not too dark so I love those and
then don't get me wrong I enjoyed the
liquefied lips as well if I had to only
choose one formula I would go more
toward the lipsticks that these are
super comfortable they do have more
shine if that's what you enjoy and the
colors are just so fun so thank you guys
for your time absolutely let me know in
the comments section what other holiday
type products do you want to see me
reviewing I've bought a lot of things
here recently I've been experimenting
with a lot so I am so excited to bring
