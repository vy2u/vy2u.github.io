recently as I've been testing out a lot
of these different holiday pallets you
hear that thunder out there maybe you
don't it's been kind of a stormy morning
here but like I was saying there's
something I have noticed about a lot of
these holiday gift sets is that in the
midst of all the eyeshadow palettes
there are quite a few little like glowy
highlight sets that have come out and so
I thought this would be a good
opportunity to talk about them all in
one video sort of rank them for you tell
you what I like about them and what I
don't like about them because while I
have some things that I could absolutely
100% recommend to you in this video I've
got some things that I think need some
kind of warning label on them to overall
looks like I've got four things to talk
about that are kind of brand-new here on
my channel one other thing I'll mention
at the end of my lineup that I know I've
talked about a couple times already but
I just want to you know keeping this
conversation because it is a similar
product to a couple of the other things
I'm gonna go from least favorite to most
favorite as I describe these to you so
the first thing I'm going to talk about
my least favorite is the Urban Decay
Naked illuminated trio it's a cute
little box
nice little cardboard box style
packaging here with a big mirror inside
there's a great little double-ended
brush there but I'm here to say that is
where the love story ends for me this is
a great little brush
seriously the good size I think for
highlights that work problem with me
with these highlights is that they just
don't really work for me
they are that domed kind of baked style
can you see how they sort of protrude
from the packaging a little bit and at a
glance like I could see how maybe if you
saw this online you could be kind of
misled or kind of wondering what's the
texture like because this is all about
texture for me this was sent to me from
Urban Decay as a PR sample but if I was
actually thinking about buying this and
i swatched it in the store i would know
immediately i think that it's not
something I'd want to get because these
are like rock-hard powders you know they
feel very hard but what you actually get
from them is the lightest flaky as'
textures pyrite shade is probably the
best it hangs together the best if you
see it in a swatch it looks the most
like
metallic you see the least amount of
glitter sprinkled in but then you got
like this shade in the center called
oasis sort of a zebra stripe looking
color and this is just so hard to like
concentrate it on your cheeks and get an
effect from it because it's so glittery
I mean this is just glittery flaky
fallout everywhere it's so dry it does
not adhere shape called Twilight which
looks sort of peachy it's got a lot of
sparkle in it as well very light and
loose and it's interesting because they
feel so hard to the touch because
they're just these dome baked dry
powders and when you get the powder
actually transferred off either on your
finger onto a brush it feels just so
light and kind of like dust it right
away but I just don't think it's a good
texture it's not good when you want like
pinpointed highlight it's hard to really
see it and when you can detect where it
is it's like oh I just see the flecks of
glitter the one shade that's the least
bad in the trio it's kind of like the
darkest color and maybe not a shade I
would be prone to actually highlighting
with on my skin might look great on a
deeper skin tone but it doesn't do as
much from a highlighting catch the light
perspective on me
so bottom line I don't think this is
worth the $36 price tag I feel like I've
got a lot better things to talk about as
we go along here so you'll see next one
is the Stila starlight Starbright
palettes this is again another trio it
does not include a brush it is $39 so
just a few bucks more expensive than the
urban decay and this is one that I
ordered online really did not know what
I'd be getting into texture wise while
they do look kind of domed up I would
say they're kind of like a cream powder
hybrid type product they remind me a
little bit of like touching a color pop
highlight or blush because there's some
give to it or like a Maybelline Dream
bouncy blush might be an even more
similar format and texture because it's
kind of domed up and you can sort of
sponge into it a bit but it doesn't feel
like an all-out do we wet feeling cream
you know so the three shades here are
transcendence kitten and bronze and the
issue I've had with this so far is just
feeling like I'm really picking up a
good amount of product on my brush to
apply to the skin there is one shade
though that I feel like can give me an
absolute like wet looking eye on the
skin and I was wearing this in a recent
video and I really felt like it kept
caught the light a lot I didn't even
notice it so much as I was facing my
makeup mirror which is maybe a little
bit softer lighting and then I get in
front of here and any kind of glow
really seems to pop if it's there and
this shape popped a lot the Khitan
colors so I liked that one I wasn't so
much a fan of the other two this
transcendent shape is one of those
pretty like lilac tinged highlights and
those can be like beyond brightening
I've got a couple of powders I think
there's one in the NYX stroke of genius
palette that is like this lilac light
powder and it's like it goes beyond what
even white highlights do because it's
next-level brightening it's that got
that coolness in it and this one just
never translated quite as vibrantly as I
want it vibrantly is that a word it
didn't show up as much as I wanted it to
on my cheeks so the kitten was good and
then the bronze shade maybe just for the
fact that it's not as light it didn't
seem to have that same kind of pop like
the kitten one does it never really seem
to have that light catching ability and
it might be different on a different
skin tone so I feel like I came away
from this palette really only liking one
out of the three color pop makes some
really good highlights that are super
similar to this texture so I think you
could get one of those if you just
wanted to experience this borderline
like is it cream is it got a little
powder in there what exactly is it those
transfer really nicely onto the skin any
of the color pop highlights that I've
had have been pretty intense actually
another thing that just sort of falls
right in the middle for me and it is
actually right in the middle of my
discussion in this video is the smashbox
la lights to go blendable lip and cheek
color says so in here you're getting
these four color sticks to are like
creamy blush type colors those are the
two in the center here one is a glowy
highlight and why
is a bronzy shade this is the size we're
talking about there like a chubby stick
but they're not SuperDuper wide but the
thing to know about these I think is
texture these are a creamy texture and
they don't go cream to powder and as you
look at all of the colors swatched out
and you see the light that they catches
I turn my hand you can see that there's
kind of an emollient quality to these
sticks that can be great from the lip
perspective because these do say lip and
cheek but from the cheek perspective for
me I think it always makes them a little
bit harder to blend on your cheeks
because they just pull and tug a bit
more it's not that they're not smooth
and they're not creamy I'm not saying
that any time a cream blush goes a
little bit cream to powder and has that
bit of a dry down it makes the blending
so much more effortless and I don't like
to work too hard on blending out a cream
blush because then I feel like I'm kind
of interfering and messing with the
foundations and powders I've got
underneath all that right I've got a
really good method that makes it about
as easy as it can possibly be to apply
cream blush and that is the small
stipple brush that I've talked about a
lot it's a really great way to shear out
different products like this and feel
like you're taking a lot of pressure off
of your cheeks so even when I use this I
was feeling my cheeks and I thought gosh
they feel tacky even touching them right
now you know they have this sort of
stickiness a little bit to them and I
didn't even apply that much product a
really dry skin person might not mind
the sound of that but if you're very
oily I think that can be a big staying
power concern but here's what I did I
used a couple of these today I did not
use the Hollywood and highlight
highlight stick although this is a
pretty shade I have other highlights
that I want to show you in a second I
also did not use the Venice Beach bronze
which I think in reality I would
probably not so much think of this as an
all over the face type bronzer I think
it would just be difficult to blend in
everywhere but I have worn it like a
blush and it's a little bit prettier
just on the cheeks but what I chose to
use is my blush today is this most pinky
shade called Beverly Hills blush and I
just swept my small stipple brush across
this stick if you wanted to dot the
stick directly on your cheek you could
but again I think it's a
little harder to blend out that way so I
just used my stipple brush and I kind of
buffed it lightly on top of the skin
there's maybe just the slightest bit of
a satin finish to it but I think it's
got good color payoff it's just the feel
of it afterward bugs me just a bit and
then I wanted to show you from the lip
perspective I use the shade called
Silverlake sunset and this one again a
little bit of a satiny finish more of a
peachy nude type color it's pretty on
the cheeks as well it probably wouldn't
show too much on deeper skin but on the
lips it's just like a pretty nude peach
lipstick and so that's what I've had on
my lips all video long and it's just
that really tells the tale if this kind
of a product is going to apply and feel
creamy and practically like a lip balm
on your lips and it's gonna have maybe a
little thick stickiness as you try to
use it on the cheeks definitely not the
easiest thing to use from a cream blush
perspective not out-and-out bad products
not something I'm shouting from the
rooftops like everybody needs to try
this it's so great it's not really that
great okay can we talk about something
really good already this love this set
this is a twenty dollar set this is the
least expensive thing I'm going to
mention in this video it's the Becca
glow on the go shimmering skin perfecter
moonstone set and I was excited to get
this because I didn't think I had
moonstone turns out ahead the moonstone
highlight as the powder one as part of
that little um what was it called the
afterglow palate had to actually pull it
out to remember it and it moonstone was
in that little palette from last year
just FYI but I did not have the
shimmering skin perfecter liquid
spotlight here and I love that you guys
know I've talked a lot about enjoying
the shimmering skin perfecter liquids
because I think they're the most like
subtle undetectable beautiful looking
highlights and it was fun to try a new
shade in that and I think moonstone
would be really universally usable for
people because it's not too dark
I think fair skin could wear this and
get an impact out of it and deeper skin
tones could get a really pretty shine on
their faces as well and you are getting
small sizes of these you know they're
not huge but
these little things have lasted me a
long time these little skin perfector
spotlights because you don't have to use
a lot of product and I frankly prefer
this format over there big full-size
pumps because I can control the amount
of product I'm doling out a little bit
easier so I just swipe a little bit of
this on my hand I've cleaned off my elf
small stipple brush pick up some of that
and then just start dabbing it right on
top of the cheeks now this product is
going on so nice and thin and even if I
really put a lot on it it doesn't tend
to maintain any sort of sticky feel on
my skin this can be the final step you
wouldn't need to set it with anything
because we're going big in this video
and I really want to show you as much as
possible here is the powder version of
this highlight I think it's so cool that
you get both textures to play with here
and I used my up-and-up highlight brush
which i think is just a perfect size for
hitting the top of the cheeks and picked
up some of this really soft pearly hint
hint hint of a buttery glow in this
shade I just you know went across the
top of the cheeks and it was like the
angels saying you know it was a really
pretty effect there these products are
tremendous I think you could give them
to anyone of any skin tone they're easy
to use if you needed to blend this out
with your fingers you could it's not
hard to blend product I just love how
this small stipple brush just doles out
like the right amount across my skin it
never feels like it's laying anything on
too thick and the last little thing I
want to give mention to that I also feel
very strongly about but I have talked
about it recently and used it in a video
earlier this week on Wednesday where I
showed the new hair and then I also did
my foundation and concealer routine I
went on and I applied on this genesee
quoi palette from it cosmetics
definitely one of the best face related
products of this holiday season that's
come out you get the blush it's the bye
bye pours blush the bye bye pores press
translucent powder perfect lighting oops
right here perfect perfect lighting
Luminizer in genesee quoi and sunshine
in a compact bronzer these are things
that are available individually and
you've got them all in this palette
generous sized
highlight in here is really fantastic by
the way it's got a lot of glow but no
glitter it's a nice kind of creamy
feeling highlight even as you rub it
between your fingers it's not one of
those like oh it just dust it away into
the air you know it really hangs on very
Universal pink blush there I enjoy the
bronzer this is so good this bye-bye
pores press you guys told me it was good
it is it's a great little mattifying
powder or and under the eye powder just
kind of all-purpose powder great big
mirror in there awesome for travel so I
would highly recommend that but for the
demo on this please check back to that
other video so that is my take on some
of these glowy kits that have come out
this holiday season some rather big
losers but a couple of big winners to
love the Becca set love the it cosmetics
thank you guys so much for watching and
many of you requested this video because
you've seen just like I have all these
highlight sets that have come out and I
think there's more even beyond what I've
talked about here I hope you guys have a
great rest of the day and I will see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
