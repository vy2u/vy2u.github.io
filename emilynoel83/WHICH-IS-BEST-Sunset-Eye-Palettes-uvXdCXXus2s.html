joining me today the topic in this video
is going to be what I'm going to call
sunset eye palettes this is a very
specific type of palette that I think is
really trendy you're seeing this color
scheme come out right now from so many
different brands and in my eyes I mean a
sunset is just kind of the thought that
comes to mind for me you might describe
it other ways but basically I think the
palettes are characterized by having
some peachy tones but also some plummy
kind of burgundy even purple tones also
in there so you've got these kind of
contrasting shades that look really
beautiful together on the eyes it's
really becomes the key look that certain
brands have adopted in their palettes so
I really wanted to hone in on for newer
palettes in this video that I think have
this type of thing going on one is the
natasha de Nonna lila palette the other
is the hooter desert dusk palette also
the Too Faced just peachy mattes palette
and the lorac unzipped desert sunset
palette to back the story up just a
little bit I have been obsessed with
this type of color scheme for quite some
time going back to the bareMinerals
happy play squad okay in a very subtle
way this quad like kind of initially
exposed me to this color combo of peach
and plum that I liked so much these
tones just work so beautifully together
on the eyes I love and what we're seeing
more currently is that kind of color
scheme just boost it up a notch
intensity wise so more recently you know
the Too Faced peanut butter and jelly
palette why did I like this so much well
you've got these terracotta kind of
bronze II warm Browns mixed with plummy
shades and purples and it's really
beautiful another great option from a
more affordable brand elf the mad format
- palette again with peaches warm kind
of yellowish tan colors also a purple
thrown in fast-forward a little bit and
we're seeing that kind of color scheme
just blowing up in so many different
palettes the first one that I want to
mention just briefly at the start here
because I have talked about it before in
my Too Faced peach collection review so
you guys if you've watched that video
you know I really love this palette the
Too Faced just peachy mattes this
palette I think encompasses the color
scheme I'm talking about and
a slightly more subtle way color-wise
although these are very intense and rich
matte shades just really great to work
with and blend out on the eyes but it is
working in the kind of look I'm talking
about because we've got really warm
brownish peach shades you've also got
what I think is the true definition of a
plum color right in here and then you've
got this burgundy shade with a little
more pink in it we're not seeing the
full-on purple in this palette but it is
putting together the kind of look that
I'm talking about with all the warmth
but also something maybe a little more
reddish and burgundy mixed in so I love
that palette if you adore mattes and you
like the thought of just a really warm I
look I think this is a great one to look
into now these next few palettes again
this is a color scheme I'm in love with
I'm not critiquing really the concept
behind these palettes and the way the
colors are put together the shade
selection stuff like that I think it's
really great although I have a few
critiques on a couple of these and it's
just my opinion and you might not share
that same take but I'm just gonna share
my thoughts with you and you can just
toss that into your decision-making
process if that's where you're at but
this natasha de Nonna
Lila palette is a hundred and twenty
nine dollars it's by far the most
expensive palette that I'll be talking
about palette is nice quality it's got a
nice big mirror here you do have a flat
that's attached and that's gonna have
all your shade names on it and it is
perforated and it can come off if you
don't care about shade names no doubt
we've got a lot of beautiful shimmers in
here you've got like a really pretty red
violet you know the color of the red
violet Crayola Crayons that kind of
thing but with a gorgeous amount of
shine lowish Purple's rusty reds coppers
kind of a fuchsia color couple of
shimmers that are more on the neutral
side or my skin tone this would be kind
of like my sole highlighting shade down
here there's kind of a dark like really
shimmery cool brown in this palette too
it does not provide really quite enough
contrast for me to really like cut into
these shimmery shades like let's say
I've put one of these colors in my
crease to just get started and maybe I'm
gonna pop one of these ultra shimmery
tones on my lid and then I want to
really work into that with a darker
shade to get some contrast and depth
right in my outer corner and so I might
go to this shade well it really doesn't
get
enough for me in application on the eyes
to create enough contrast with these
shimmer since these are really strong
shades they're really like loud and they
need something I think extremely rich
and extremely rooted in a matte finish
they're kind of cut in there and blend
in with your eyeliners and create a
great amount of contrast with these
tones and of course we can all say yes
you could grab any like matte eyeshadow
just single from your collection and you
might be good to go just pair that in
with this kind of palette that's fine
but when I am gonna pay a hundred and
twenty nine dollars for one eyeshadow
palette I'd really like it to encompass
all of my needs one other small
complaint that I have with this palette
is that while the shimmer swatch like
incredibly well with your finger and
they apply pretty good with your finger
if you're just gonna like Pat it on your
lid let's say I'm not always satisfied
with the way the shimmers applied with a
brush on the eyes I don't know if
anybody else feels this way about the
natascha - known as shimmery shades but
I feel like I have to work with them
more than say a visi art shimmery shadow
just to build up the tone on the eyes
like you've got to kind of do a little
tugging a little extra padding on it
gorgeous colors they can be worked with
I like the color scheme it's a beautiful
palette this is a review from my
perspective in my opinion and those are
the couple of little shortcomings that I
think it has now let's talk who to
desert desk here this is a gorgeous
outer packaging I love the way that
looks and then you open it up you also
have a really nicely sized mirror and
then here we're dealing with 18 shades
you see the color scheme that I'm
talking about once again lots of peachy
colors instantly popping out at you some
reddish colors and then definitely some
purpley colors as well what sets this
one apart is the texture in it you've
got mattes in here you've got shimmery
shadows and I really like working with
all of those you've also got varying
levels of sparkle some seem to come off
as maybe a little bit of like a topper
type shade colors like Twilight and
retrograde you know they might appear
even somewhat transparent or sheer as
you see them in a swatch but you put
them on top of another color they take
on a different low they really offer I
think an avenue to be sort of creative
with your look you've got Cosmo here
which is a straight-up glitter okay
so that's gonna require maybe a glitter
glue type primer or some kind of a cream
shadow that really lets that start to
cling it's a variety and finishes that
some people might be craving and other
people might look at and say well I
don't really need the glitter I like the
color scheme but I don't need all the
razzmatazz
you know attached to it there are some
shades in here that require extra care
that require a little bit extra building
up or like I said a certain kind of base
and so it could be a little more fussy
for that reason I do like the mattes in
here as with every palette I'm talking
about I adore the color scheme but what
this is lacking much like the natascha -
Nona palette is a really really dark
shade because again we've got really
flashy colors here we've got some ultra
metallic things even some sparkly things
happening in here
we need one at least one really really
dark shade this color right up here you
know it's swatch is kind of dark but by
the time I blend this out say in my
crease or outer corner you know it's
about that deep and it's not quite
enough I don't think to hang with some
of these shades that are so bold so
metallic I'm talking about Blood Moon or
Turkish Delight those shades need
something a little bit deeper to anchor
the look so that would be what I see
this palette is lacking and again it
might not be everyone's cup of tea
because not everybody cares to have that
amount of different finishes but for me
personally it's definitely a palette I
can have fun with and I'm going forward
I could see myself doing some really
cool looks with that it's just not
everything I need and not to mention
that is $65 so here's the palette that
really impressed me
it is everything I need in a smaller
package like a smaller quantity of
shades the lowest price tag of anything
I've mentioned here and it's giving me
every bit of what I need for this sunset
type look and it is the lorac a desert
sunset unzipped palette first off quick
comment on the unzipped these new
palettes that they've put out I'm not
really sure why they're calling them
unzipped because the only way they seem
to follow the former unzipped palettes
is just the size of the palette and the
amount of shades inside because those
were very monochromatic like the first
one that they put out it was like rose
gold into Burgundy it was like following
a spectrum and the same thing with the
unzipped gold these palettes which there
are three different ones
this one is my favorite but as you can
see it's like a splash of different
colors as opposed to just following more
of a gradient but this one just soak
this up for a second because this is
everything this is everything you need
in a smaller package here 10 shades and
it's doing it all
it's got your purple a real true purple
it's got peach here it's got this really
warm terracotta brown you've got a
couple of different Reds one is gonna
veer a little bit more toward pink one
is more rusty a dark matte Brown that
unlike the other palettes where the
darkest shade seemed to perform lighter
on the eyes than it looked in the
palette or in a swatch this one seems to
intensify more in application and I
think that might be just the texture of
lorac shadows which you guys know I like
they're very soft they're very pigmented
a little goes a long way you've got
highlight options up here the Cirrus
shade is a gorgeous cheek highlight as
well got a shimmery Brown down here I
mean if you wanted to do a look and
ignore the purples and burgandy's and
anything remotely reddish and just do
like a neutral look with brown and gold
you've got that in here as well
seriously if you are like me and you
like this color scheme and you want the
most bang for your buck and at the same
time not have to wade through way more
shadows than you need this is great now
this is not offering you all those kind
of out there finishes that the hooda one
was you know that one had those Sheen's
that you can kind of use to top off a
shadow that color that was basically a
hundred percent glitter that's not in
here what we have here finish wise is
matte here here and here and everything
else goes from kind of a satiny finish
to a shimmery finish and this is what
I'm wearing on my eyes today I've got
the purple on my lids I've got some of
the dark brown in my outer corner it was
plenty dark enough for me I've got this
in my crease along with dunes dunes is
great for blending out the edges it's
just a little bit peachy I also did a
little bit of this shade like just in my
outer corner you're probably seeing some
red come out of the look there and I
used that on my lower lash line too so
it creates just a gorgeous look but I
just really wanted to share this with
you guys because I was so excited to see
the $42 palette deliver basically
everything I want out of a look like
this like give me all the options but in
a more edited down shade selection so I
love this I still love my two-face Just
Peachy Matz because this is kind of a
little bit on its own playing field
because it is purely mat but I adore the
quality of these eyeshadows and it very
much can give you that peach into like
reddish plummy burgundy if you're into
that kind of look it's great the hooter
and Natasha de Nona I mean that I'm not
taking anything away from the beauty of
these palettes but I still have little
bones to pick with them and I feel like
you know for the price tag $65 and 129
dollars you want them to be everything
you need right you're putting that kind
of money into them and I just think
there are a few little points where
they're lacking so I hope this video was
helpful to you guys I bet we'll continue
to see some pallets coming out that
followed this color scheme let me know
what you think in the comments section
and I will talk to you guys again very
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
