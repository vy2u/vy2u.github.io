are talking about three of the biggest
two-faced holiday collections for there
Christmas in New York holiday 2016
collection two-faced is probably one of
the first brands I was ever gifted a
holiday item from like way way back when
my sister got me like a gift set from
Sephora I remember it was like a little
two-faced music box and Wow have they
expanded what they're putting out since
that time your most expensive set this
year is the chocolate shop and all of
these things come in a cute like outer
box that coordinates with everything but
even once you lift that out this is kind
of the presentation of the palette
you've got a little lid up top looks
like a gift box they really stayed with
the total same format as they did last
year and to some people maybe that's a
good thing maybe you missed out and now
this year you'd like to have that same
kind of item or maybe you're totally
bored and wish they did something
different
but this is what the chocolate shop
looks like when you open it up there's
this little place for your palate to sit
but it can be totally lifted out and
ultimately this is like your makeup
palette and then there's the little
scene in the back so you could have this
open and use it as kind of a display
item or just take those little sample
guys out and close it all up but you're
getting a two faced shadow insurance a
better than sex mascara and the melted
lip color and here is one from the
melted chocolate collection it's called
chocolate milkshake I am wearing that
one I love this shape I actually already
had this in the full-size and I was so
glad they were putting something other
than melted peony in a gift set here so
that's great it's as pretty like kind of
caramel a nude love it every set that
I'm going to mention is also going to
come with a little booklet that's going
to fold out and show you some different
like look inspiration so that was the
chocolate shop 58 dollars Sephora only
your next little thing is the Grand
Hotel cafe I may have the little top
switched around there there you go this
one is $49 it's available at both Ulta
and Sephora and last year what did they
call it the Chateau or something and it
was the very similar little house like
design which is no doubt cute but they
are kind of repeating that this year it
opens up like this
the pallets out so you could see what it
actually looks like you're getting a
better than sex mascara in there that's
your little added bonus and now with the
pallets inside that's how that looks
they sit in there just like three little
books and this one is kind of geared
toward you know keeping it all yourself
or gifting it because they all have
little to/from on the back of each
pallet there's the eggnog latte palette
you're also getting the peppermint mocha
palette there you can see each one has a
little different color scheme and then
the gingerbread cookie palette as well
and each one claims to kind of take on
that same scent just like the chocolate
shop was cocoa powder infused and had
that sweet kind of chocolate Soleil
bronzer type scent these you know while
I can tell they are making an effort to
do something different in each one I
wouldn't necessarily pick that out as
being a gingerbread cookie you know what
I'm saying the eggnog I kind of sense
the peppermint mocha not so much it's a
very very weak peppermint mocha but I
mean they're Pleasant they're nice and
it adds a little interesting twist and
then finally your Ulta exclusive is $39
so we went 58 with the Sephora exclusive
49 with that Grand Hotel little house
looking thing and then 39 now for the
Mary macaroon set oops
just a size comparison from the big
Sephora exclusive this is the ultimen a
lot smaller but a very similar design in
that you're going to take the top off
and it opens up just like this you've
got a pretty little scene there you got
somebody doing some ice skating there's
your one extra that comes with this it's
the better than sex mascara you got a
little macaroon stand a little Christmas
tree very cute instead of being all out
pink like the other one was this is a
little bit more of like a soft lilac
color and on the inside you're getting
twelve eyes shadows they're larger than
the shadows in the chocolate shop
palette but about the same size as what
you're getting in your little trio of
palettes truly I feel like two-faced
nails the cuteness every year this color
scheme this kind of pastel but still
Christmassy color scheme really appeals
to me I think it's adorable I think it
looks nice in my room let's say you were
gifting any one of these things to
someone who especially maybe didn't have
a ton of makeup or hasn't been
collecting Too Faced holiday collections
year after year I think they'd open
doesn't be like oh you know that's so
cute now for somebody who does keep up
with these things year after year there
may be a little disappointment I don't
know with this set and seeing how
everything was formatted basically
exactly the same and the little display
boxes to the one of them being shaped
like a little house I mean it's all cute
but it really didn't change up too much
from last year I'm going to be going
through and showing you swatches I'm
going to go from my least favorite set
to my most favorite and keep in mind
that's a personal opinion you may have a
different take on this a different need
than what I have or just a different
overall preference and that's fine I
really try with my reviews to cater to
you know well some people might like
this because of this reason or some
people might like that but ultimately it
is my review and I need to take
ownership of it and I'm giving you my
personal opinions also so just keep that
in mind my number three here is the
chocolate shop palette which is the
Sephora exclusive your most expensive
one fifty eight dollars and the thing
I'm going to be kind of gesturing with
is basically the palette itself although
keep in mind there were a few extras
with this a shadow insurance the mascara
and the lip product but here's your
overall palette you're getting the three
face products which I was pretty pleased
with quality wise one is a highlight one
is chocolate Soleil bronzer and the
other is this chocolate-covered
strawberry blush that's kind of a cool
satiny finish and wearing all of those
products on my face today thought they
all applied nicely had decent
pigmentation I really thought that was
adequate in terms of the extras I am
kind of wondering why they chose to
place them on this side next to your
darkest shadows and not over on the
other side near the lighter shadows but
I'm sure there's a reason a couple
reasons why I'm putting this is my third
place palette and it's not because I
totally dislike the palette or I think
oh gosh it's a real dud I don't feel
that way but I do think that the quality
of the shadows is a little more hit and
miss in this palette granted it's harder
to put out a larger palette where
everything has got to be fantastic you
know what I'm saying but as a whole
really with the entire Too Faced holiday
stuff I love that they're matte shadows
are exactly what I hope they would be
Too Faced makes really good match
shadows and I think sometimes when you
think to face you think of their more
glitzy like glittery shadows maybe
glittery fallout or whatever but they
make a great matte formula I know if you
have their natural matte palette you are
familiar with this it's very soft the
shades are very smooth they blend
fantastically well on top of one another
and even in other palettes whether it's
the chocolate bar or peanut butter and
jelly or whatever any time where there
are mats sprinkled with in their regular
line of palettes they've been turning
out really well lately and I have not
been disappointed with the mattes in any
of these holiday palettes either if
anything's questionable to me in some of
these palettes it's some of the shimmery
shades now if you recall the big palette
from last year there was a lot of
sparkle happening in that one and I feel
like they've dialed it back a little bit
here and made it more like some shimmery
pops some are stronger than others
though I have a little bit of a problem
with the inconsistency that I see in the
palette but also like just looking at
these couple rows right here I think
gosh that reminds me so much of like
what's happening in the chocolate bar
palette with these tones of brown
varying finishes of Browns and gold's I
mean some people are going to not have
any Too Faced stuff on their shelves at
home and they're thinking yes this is
where I want to jump in because it's
giving me the most but I know some of
you out there who have been keeping up
with the chocolate bar the semi-sweet
the chocolate bonbons you are a
collector of Too Faced palettes I don't
know that you're going to be doing
backflips over this just saying but I
will show you my swatches I chose to do
like the top half of the palette than
the bottom half and you can see what I
mean the mattes are really strong most
of what's in that upper half is kind of
light to medium shades with the
exception of that matte Brown and those
mats just work really well certain
shimmers here and there cookie dough I
thought was kind of weak ginger doodle I
mean I freaking love the names but some
of those were just a little bit flaky
and harder to work with on the eyes or
just required a little more building up
and then getting into the bottom part of
the palette you've got more rich tones
more colorful tones overall matte shades
once again did not disappoint but honey
dip I thought there's a shade I've seen
in other palettes and I thought it was a
little bit weak in here pound cake
especially flaky and
I was looking for those metallic shades
that are rich buttery and just hang
together wonderfully jingleberry
two-face likes to throw in a token
purple it seems like into these holiday
sets and that one's pretty sheer you
definitely have to build that up that
would work best on top of a base sugar
bells though the metallic like silvery
color really pops a really nice rich
shade there with huckleberry and overall
you know it's a palette that can totally
be worked with you've got mid-tone
shades transition shades plenty of
mattes to balance out some of these
shimmers not trying to knock this
palette overall but for me looking at
the other things that I have that's why
I'm kind of putting it in a third rung
situation now second place for me was
the Grand Hotel cafe this is your $49
product from both Ulta and Sephora so
we're dropping the price back by about
10 bucks here and I think you're still
getting a lot of product you're getting
some more generously sized shadows I
really like all three of the face
products that are included within these
sets from a cuteness perspective I think
these individual palettes are just
adorable I really love the look and just
the design on the outside and I think
when you're splitting it up into three
you do have more flexibility what if you
wanted to give a couple of these out to
a friend you could totally do that and
also just portability for yourself
in general you're going away for the
weekend okay I only want to take one
that's not a lot of space and your stuff
and then you've got a face product to
work with as well as six pretty
good-sized eyeshadows I'll go through
each one but the overall picture here I
think is again really good matte shadows
and a couple of hit-and-miss shimmery
shades but they're the kinds of shimmers
where I feel like they're kind of a wash
of a really pretty sparkle but they
stand out so beautifully if you do a
coordinating base underneath or maybe an
even tackier type primer like a glitter
glue type primer and then those shades I
think can really shine so there's
potential in pretty much everything in
here even though in dry swatches that
I'm showing you here they might not look
as strong as they could possibly be so
first one we've got here eggnog latte
again the scent is there I can sense a
little bit of eggnog
but this
one is your neutral and a little bit
greenish color scheme and I do like this
I love my mattes in this palette I love
my Central Perk that pretty emerald
green a couple of things to be aware of
your eggnog latte is a little bit flaky
so that's that light shimmery golden
color it's not my favorite to work with
just putting that out there
cold brew is an example of one of those
shades that can look gorgeous when it's
catching the light but it needs a little
bit more of a helper base to help that
cling peach cobbler a very generously
sized matte peach blush that's nicely
pigmented there's so much to work with
in there so as a whole I do like this
but there's a couple of shades that need
some special attention now peppermint
mocha yep this is my jam these kinds of
shades love that they've got a pretty
like kind of rusty brownish color that's
actually named peppermint mocha your
mattes and peppermint cream and candy
cane those two light shapes really
perform well they're bringing it with
the mattes take a drink of your eggnog
every time I compliment the mattes in
these collections sprinkles is a pretty
kind of metallic burgundy and then
you've got coffee chip for a nice dark
contrast color your blush in here
equally as good as the peach I thought
it's called Santa Baby and it's more of
a pink tone blush getting into your last
palette this is the gingerbread cookie
so cute on the outside and this one is
neutral kind of like the first but
taking you more in a golden direction
gingersnap is killing it that is a
really bold metallic winter dream is one
of those that could benefit from a
little bit richer base to stick to but
black coffee that's a fantastic black
ginger cream maple syrup cannot complain
about those and then the face product
you get here is a bronzer it's called
Gingerbread and it kind of reminds me of
like the deeper tone and two-faced Sun
bunny bronzer I haven't swatch those
actually side-by-side to see if it's an
exact dupe but it's got a little bit of
a satiny finish there so a little more
glow to it on the skin than chocolate
Soleil but I do really like this little
set of three palettes they're adorable
and any time you split things up into
threes they're just more versatility my
number one pick actually of these two
based holiday palettes would be I think
the best bargain of all of these two and
it's the Mary macaroon
set from ulta again this came in a
downsized little box compared to the
chocolate shop palette and in there you
got the extra mascara but 39 bucks and
you're getting I think a really nice
little palette of colors here and this
was the most consistent thing
quality-wise out of anything I used and
they say this is vanilla scented there's
a little sweetness there I think I am
picking up on some vanilla with that
it's a little different from the
chocolate bar scent you might know from
different two-faced products as I
alluded to earlier I think it can be
easier for brands to pull off a
consistent palette when there aren't
quite as many shades in there that they
have to nail and I thought everything in
here was really good obviously for the
person who maybe isn't so concerned with
all the cutesy stuff and isn't so
concerned with having extra face
products in the mix as well the only
extra you're getting with this is the
little you know travel size mascara
otherwise it's all about the shadow but
the mattes in here really nice basics
like coconut I love that there's a matte
creamy shade there are several really
fantastic mid-tone mattes here a nice
dark brown and cookies-and-cream down
here that has some shimmer but the
shimmer really hangs in with that black
shade I love it now this violet color
you might think did I see that in the
chocolate shop palette the chocolate
shops color like this is a bit more
pinky and more sheer this one has more
intensity honey lavender I love I think
that's gorgeous praline a little bit of
a soft gold so I find this palette to be
very wearable for my neutral lovers out
there and I think it's just the most
consistent with the quality the mattes
are great but the shimmers are more
consistent than I was seeing in any of
the other palettes they're smoother and
he shine and then really hangs together
nicely added bonus this color called
champagne rose over here gorgeous
highlight and it can go bold if you want
it to and it's I've been you know
thinking about my reviews and how I'm
going to do them I look at this and I
think well it's not the most exciting
palette you know I use that word
sometimes but it doesn't have like a ton
of you know pops of color bouncing out
at me here and there but I think one of
the reasons why I kind of like this is I
think back to the Vegas nay palette and
it's got some
similarities to that I adored that
collection and this is kind of like a
similar take on it I think also one
thing I want to mention here I love the
peanut butter and jelly palette this one
goes very warm you're looking at the
Browns in here and they all go toward
this really orange e Brown put this up
next to it if you felt like these shades
went a little too warm for you this one
cools it down a notch you've still got
like tiramisu I think is a nice warm
brown but overall things aren't quite as
orange E as that peanut butter palette
was and my eye look today did come from
this palette and I've been very pleased
with this and other looks that I've done
so I'll just walk you through it real
quick i prime my lids I did a wash of
coconut bat matte cream shade just
everywhere and then I used tiramisu
which is the light warm brown just back
and forth in my crease I intensified it
a little bit on the inner and outer
corner with mint chocolate which is kind
of like a I don't know a little bit of a
lilac taupe shade and then I decided to
pop honey lavender right in the center
of my lid very intensely I was pleased
with the way the shade built up and then
I used chocolate raspberry which is a
gorgeous burgundy color i padded that on
my outer corner and my inner corner and
work that up into the crease just a
little bit so the pop of shine is really
on the center of my lid and then I
applied some liner across the upper lash
line I did a brown in my lower inner rim
and I continued under the lower lash
line with more chocolate raspberry I
guess what I'm trying to prove with this
look is that you can still pull off
something I think very festive and fun
and a little bit smoky with this palette
even though it's largely very safe
neutrals but from the gifting
perspective I think that can be a good
thing this has all the cute presentation
that the other you know lift out pallet
had a few fewer bells and whistles in
terms of extras but if you want a nice
quality consistent eyeshadow palette
you're going to pay about 20 bucks less
than you would at Sephora for the larger
one and I think this is great so that's
my roundup on the biggest Too Faced
holiday things this year if there are
other smaller Too Faced holiday
collections that you're interested in
hearing me talk about let me know I
think I mentioned this in another video
but I do still want to do before it's
all said and done for the holidays I
want to do a round
my top favorite holiday gift ideas will
any of these appear in that video I'm
not sure yet I've still got more things
to try but thank you for staying with me
and watching these reviews I'm so glad
you enjoy them and I'll see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
