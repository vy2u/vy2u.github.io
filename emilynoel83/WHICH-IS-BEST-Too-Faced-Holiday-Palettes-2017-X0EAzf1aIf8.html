we've got the big two-faced holiday
review coming at you right now I have
their three big pallets that they seem
to put out every year like this sort of
breakdown of pallets I'm gonna be going
through all of them for you in this
video giving you my opinions which there
are many I don't know how I'm gonna fit
all this into one video but it's
interesting I think we do tend to see
patterns every year you know this is the
kind of thing two-face puts out for
Sephora this is the thing they put out
for Ulta there's also a little pallet
collection that comes out in both and I
think Too Faced during the holidays
tends to be the brand that is going most
toward the holidays with their theme
although it's not out and out ever like
red and green you know they still are
very Christmasy with the stuff that
they're putting out this year I don't
know they might be taking steps to make
their collection a little bit more
relevant over the course of the entire
year but it is a little bit more of a
New Year's type theme there are planners
involved in a couple of these
collections guys and I'm going to tell
you right off the bat you're gonna have
to decide for yourself whether you like
the idea of a planner being mixed in
with your makeup collection or if you
think you're gonna want to give that
kind of thing as a gift to somebody
that's your own call I'm gonna give you
some of my opinions in this video but
you're gonna have to decide for yourself
whether that appeals to you at all but
the outer boxes here are really fun each
one has a different overall color but
this is the most Christmasy the
collection gets is really to look at the
outside and you see like little Santa
Clauses and little like decal looking
stamps on the outside that kind of make
you think of all the stickers that will
be on the inside for you to put in your
planners just to give you a little price
round up here the most expensive is the
boss lady beauty agenda and that is $58
at Sephora your middle price range set
is $49 and that's the Too Faced best
year ever and that's available at
Sephora and Ulta and then your Ulta
exclusive set is $42 that's the least
expensive of what I'm talking about but
before I forget I do want to mention one
extra thing that I got and it's the Too
Faced melted matte limited-edition
gingerbread scented gingerbread man
color here and I
do really like this we've got actual
little gingerbread men bear on the cat
actually the story of the gingerbread
man if you've got the golden book it
does not end well for the gingerbread
man but I won't go into that I don't
want to bring you down in this video but
scent wise I don't know it's sweet it's
definitely trying to simulate some kind
of baked good I don't think I'd call it
gingerbread but whatever they're making
an effort with that but the color is so
good I'm loving this like rusty reddish
shade I feel like it looks even a bit
more orange a bit more pumpkin spice in
the tube than it does on the lips
I feel like I see a little more red once
this goes on my lips and sort of says I
fell into this formula for the first
time with the candy Johnson collection I
hadn't tried any of the melted mattes
and I was so impressed I've got another
shade on my lips that comes in one of
these other kits that all explained
further but it's a really nice formula
they kind of set to a point you can't
pull a little color off your lips but
they're not drying the crap out of your
lips and they have pretty good even
where all the ones I've tried but I like
that shade a lot I love that they put
out you know a holiday color that wasn't
just straight-up red but something a
little different I like that and I think
it will mesh well with the looks that
you can get out of some of these
palettes they've put out also but as I
did last year I think I want to go from
my least favorite to favorite in terms
of the big palettes so I'm gonna start
off talking about the set that is
available at both Sephora and Ulta again
this is called the best year ever set
and it is $49 this is what your outside
box looks like and then this is the
breakdown of what's on the inside it's
gonna be three separate palettes your
little bonus will be a mini better than
sex mascara they come in a little makeup
bag love the idea of the makeup bag as
opposed to seeing them in a box that you
may or may not want or need to display
like in your makeup area
you know last couple of years these
palettes have come in sort of a display
box which was cute but not really you
know super needed this bag says I have
way more makeup at home I love that I
think it's actually a really cute size
it's kind of structured you know I
love the color scheme but this is where
it kind of starts to end for me you've
got the many better than sex mascara
they do these minis of this mascara in
so many things and I've got to say I
don't think it's the best representation
of this mascara in the mini size I don't
feel like the brush is fully loaded down
enough and when you do the little light
kind of swirl the brush within the tube
kind of thing it's so short you really
can't pick up any extra product that way
I don't know I just don't think you're
gonna see the best of what this mascara
can do in the mini size and even with
that being said I do like the L'Oreal
lash paradise better but yeah you're
gonna see this thrown into each one of
these sets and I'm not like jumping up
and down about it but it's there what's
inside your makeup bag is just a little
plastic tray in the tray we have three
separate pallets and see what I mean
about them not looking overly like
Christmassy with this collection these
do have the two in from x' as these
little pallet collections tend to do on
the back so if you wanted to split these
up and give them to different people you
could do that I feel like the look on
the outside of these palettes is very
like young um it seems like the kind of
thing that I don't know might appeal to
just a really young girl I'm not saying
I totally dislike them because I am
definitely like a little kid at heart
they have a little bit cheaper look to
them than some of the more Christmasy
design palettes they've put out in the
past but inside each one of these they
are cardboard style packaging by the way
no mirror you're gonna get six
eyeshadows and a pretty big cheap
product so in one of these there's the
blush in another there's a bronzer and
in the other there's a highlight one is
a sort of rosy collection of shadows the
other one's going to be brownish
neutrals and the last is more of a cool
smoky neutral look not so impressed by
the quality of the shadows really
inconsistent I think I remember seeing
this last year but I felt like the
mattes were pretty good all throughout
these palettes but then some of the
shimmers would be like kind of sheer
here there and just not making a big
statement for me I'll pop up the
swatches of this rosy collection by the
way or the I believe in pink palette you
got a couple of mattes there one more of
a cream one has a little bit of pink
pink ranked as a rose gold pink
Christmas didn't
supply quite enough color for me spoiled
rotten is a nice matte shade and wish
for it definitely really pops among this
lineup pink poinsettia I really wish
they would have put in a more neutral
less totally hot pink blush in this set
because I was wearing this the other day
and I just really struggled to make it
look normal on my cheeks I'm really not
loving that palette so much the natural
beauty one is your collection of
brownish tones and this don't get me
wrong it's a pretty lineup of shades I
think you look at the swatches and you
think yeah they're pretty consistent
you're getting a satiny finish bronzer
in here by the way with warm my heart
it's a very common shadow lineup and
maybe that's what you're wanting to give
to somebody and I'd say you're getting
six pretty decent shades in this one
with nothing too surprising or
outstanding then we hop over to super
fun night and here everything is pretty
cool in tone I do like this cozy
cashmere shade that really light pink
tipsy is sort of interesting because
it's a topi bronze with a little bit of
a pink shimmer so I liked that they
threw in something that was a little bit
different oh what fun and no peeking
you'll see that some of the shade names
do reflect Christmas in these sets but
those are nice quality mattes for sure
in here and dashing through the glow was
sort of a I don't know okay decent but
not great highlight it's definitely got
some glitter in it so just be aware of
that so bottom line if it's a situation
where my favorite part of this is the
makeup bag I'd say it's kind of a no-go
I mean out of all those pallets I found
one really unique shade now uniqueness
might not be a huge priority for people
when you're thinking about gifting this
stuff but I'm just you know pointing out
what comes to mind here I didn't think
the quality was absolutely spectacular
and consistent and just the look of
things didn't really Wow me with that
set now with these next couple of sets
we're talking about the Ulta exclusive
and the Sephora exclusive so the most
expensive in the least in terms of to
face sets this year I'm a little bit
torn on this I think overall I like this
one best the Sephora one simply because
I prefer the palette however I think
this one's more giftable we're getting
into planners now they're putting
planners and with both of these I find
one to be more practical and usable and
the other to be kind of
a little bit over Kelvin this is what
the Ulta one looks like it says wake up
makeup repeat best year ever it's got
the cute little tassel like this is an
actual legit little I guess binder for
your planner here's the makeup palette
we'll get to that in a second here's
your better than sex bonus mascara and
then what you could keep in here or take
out is this little planner so this is a
small planner it's gonna be just you
know paperback here and I'm not a big
planner guru I may not be addressing all
of the super key points we're looking at
a monthly planner so you've got your
month laid out here and then you turn
the page and there's the next month
there's not like little day-by-day slots
but for a planner this size that's kind
of this casual like small maybe just
toss it in your purse need to jot
something down you know that works for
me fine there's some areas here in the
back where you could write stuff down a
small part of me does resent the fact
that I'm doing this video about makeup
and I'm gonna be spending some time
talking about planners but there are
some seasonal makeup looks lined out in
the back that you can also do with your
palette and stuff is cute you know they
point out that it's national peach
cobbler day on April 13th they'll tell
you when daylight savings begins there's
some useful stuff in there and there is
a page of really cute stickers things
that say wake up for makeup but first
unicorns this is gonna be the best day
like it's really cutesy stuff and even
as a grown woman you know the child and
me can enjoy that there's a little like
folder pocket down here a mirror in
there and a place to put a pin as well
talking about the palette again
mirrorless but we've got 15 shades in
here 15 I think very practical very
workable shade six matte and the rest
are shimmer and except for this one
called why not up here this has just a
teeny bit of pearl it's a very
interesting shade but good quality
overall with these like I like the shiny
shades I love work shop down here like
that's a great copper a nice gold I like
this sort of metallic mauve here and
this is a very interesting like matte
dusty purple I love that shade that's
kind of different break the ice is kind
of a different shade here because it's a
teal with a gold shimmer and don't be
- like I don't know disgruntled by the
fact that it's only eyeshadow and they
didn't put in like bronzer blush or
highlight I'm here to say this could be
bronzer right here this can be blush
I've worn it as blush and this color
called white Christmas could be a very
intense highlight as well so it's all in
how you look at it it's a good palette I
would not feel funny about like gifting
this to someone and thinking well maybe
they won't use any of the colors
nothing's too wacky in this one
nothing's - out there I think it's a
very giftable palette and I find this to
be you know the most practical way
they're putting out their planner thing
it's realistically the kind of thing I
might actually use you know toss that in
my bag use it when I need to jot
something down real quick an appointment
or whatever it's not too bulky it's not
like taking over my life you know I
wasn't looking for Too Faced to really
fill that void for me and more so
looking to them for makeup but I think
this is a like nice little giftable
thing now can I also say I don't prefer
any of these palettes over the lorac
mega Pro 4 if we're talking big palettes
and just strictly the makeup here that
is my favorite I would pick that over
any of this I'm still definitely able to
appreciate other things and see things
that I still like in other collections
you know but just to give you a little
context here your final set this big one
from Sephora that I've been referencing
is the boss lady beauty agenda so your
outer box has this pink metallic and
then these little Christmas E's sticker
stamp looking things on the outside
here's a size comparison with the Ulta
one you can see it's much bigger this
one says wake up makeup repeat on the
outside this one says don't let today be
a waste of makeup they're nice feeling
planners by the way they're kind of
cushiony like they really went there I
feel like with this planner idea and I
like the tassel - nice attention to
detail same kind of look on the inside
of this one everything's just bigger and
you're getting an actual like hardback
book for your planner it's got this
little strap on the back that you can
flip over the top and keep everything
together they are giving you two pages
of stickers just FYI and guys this is
where I start looking at this thinking
am I really gonna use this and if I do
this is kind of a commitment the
kind of gonna take up a lot of room in
my purse but they've got totally
inspired by they've got hashtag goals
okay I'm not against goals they've got
just the quick layout of all your months
here reasons to party place the
write-down birthdays I do like that but
the overall theme of every month there
is a look on every month okay so a way
that you can use the pallet that comes
with this and then there's a cover page
for the month there's a to-do list
before every month and there's a note to
self page but then there's just the
calendar and there's not like a
day-by-day
you know chunk of space where if I use
this in school like I would write all my
assignments or everything I needed to go
do on that day say today you've just got
this I mean I could fill up the note to
self page in one afternoon with
something but like that's all you've got
and then after that month which just
like the other it points out all the
funny little days like national opposite
day and also the important days like
Martin Luther King jr. Day but then we
go right back into the next month with
another look a cover page the two do's
etc in the back we do have some blank
pages just to write things on a pretty
good chunk of pages and you see what I
mean when I say this is kind of a big
deal kind of a lot of space but yet that
planner actual planner wise is only
giving you the month calendars and
wouldn't we want like more space to
write things down at least this is my
logic on this I would want more space to
write stuff if I'm gonna carry around a
planner this big let's talk about the
make I really like this makeup palette
best despite the fact that I think the
planner is a bit overkill let's compare
the size of the palettes as you can see
you're getting a lot in this no mirror
they still can't give us a mirror here
and when you do try to bend it back it
pulls a little bit but I'm still gonna
do it because just convenience you've
got 24 shadows in this palette and then
highlight blush and bronzer I kind of
like that they just made it you know
boom here's the stuff there's not a real
fussy palette going on there's not a lot
of like moving parts here we've just got
this as far as the makeup goes and it's
definitely one of the best holiday
palettes that to face just put out in a
while here
the reasons why there's not a bunch of
like flaky fallout type shades I feel
like for whatever reason in years past
they seem to reserve some of those
really flaked out shades for their
holiday stuff and maybe it's the mindset
that here's something really glitzy you
can put on but those shades I think for
the most part are a little bit harder to
work with here they gave us the really
rich mattes there are some deep very
just sink your teeth into a nice dark
mattes in here but some beautiful jewel
tones as well that are in workable
textures that's what's really important
like trimmed and party over here and
plum pudding and Christmas Carol these
colors are really easy to work with
their metallics but you've got a lot of
nice mattes I think to balance them out
like don't give a thud I love that shade
up here this nice dark brown spiked
cider is gonna be a great crease shade
for people the way I swatch these out I
did two rows at a time so let's just dig
into the top couple of rows you've got
light highlight shades with marshmallow
tanned snow day Christmas dream a nice
light pink I adore Speights cider and
love actually those are gonna be great
like mid-tone crease colors for anyone
one you know more mauve one's that nice
warm brown and then faux fur only it's a
nice little bit deeper Brown that also
works nicely in the crease moving down
to the next couple rows there are some
great rich mattes here and I want to
talk about also shades like give me some
more you know this is a matte with like
embedded micro-fine Sparkle it's not
really any Sparkle that you have to be
worried about it's not a super flaky
thing but as far as these mats like
pinecone and jolly those shades that
rich burgundy and the dark teal they're
really nice to face does mattes very
well and they have certainly worked them
in into these pallets in some ways you
haven't seen them in their other
palettes halo is absolutely stunning
deck the malls is a nice kind of dusty
topi lavender color sleighbells is a
really pretty peach sha-la-la-la-la is a
gorgeous like dark silver I really like
that and then in our bottom two rows
like you really can't deny it guys
looking at these swatches these really
pretty jewel tones here and within those
brighter colors you've got Santa's
helper rich kind of sparkly shade black
tie it's like a satin finish really nice
soft black no
often intensity but soft in texture I
mean just to the touch it's really nice
and soft
lest really goes there as a highlight
will you marry me it has much more
intensity than you might expect and then
the chocolate Soleil bronzer which is a
known product and to face line I like
that that's in there but you see that I
mean guys they've done a pretty good
layout of eyeshadow here I don't find
the colors to be as unique as what's
come out in the lorac mega Pro 4 I'm
just really impressed with that palette
if you like your neutrals and at the
same time you also aren't scared of some
jewel tones you might really like this
as well the thing that just makes me a
little bit torn as I said is the fact
that you've got this great palette in
here but then you're also kind of paying
for all this as well there are a couple
extras with this kit too though they are
giving you the better than sex mini and
they're giving you a melted matte which
I've been wearing throughout this video
and the shade called sell out so I
believe that's part of the regular line
I love that this is a bonus in here
because if you haven't tried this
formula it's really nice and this is a
very all-purpose color but this is just
one of those situations where you kind
of got to decide where do your
priorities lie would you be the type
that would like buy this keep the
palette and give the planner to someone
who would really be interested I don't
know maybe so if you're gifting to
someone who you know like needs more
workable like work day makeup or is new
to makeup and doesn't want colors that
are quite as out there and bold and
colorful as what's in the larger palette
that's why I think the best year ever
would be really giftable and easy plus
it has the little planner but it's a
little more of a practical realistic
planner in my eyes as always I want to
give you the look that I did today I
want to show that in a tutorial so you
can see these shades going on I tried to
choose some maps and some bright shades
so you can just see what's happening
here intensity wise and I will start
with the face colors so I have my
foundation and powder and stuff on I
took the chocolate Soleil up around the
hairline I used it in the hollows of the
cheeks I'm very familiar with this
product we go back years so I'm happy
with this I like that this is in here
will you marry me is a peachy blush with
a golden shimmer and it's more intense
than you would think like the color tone
might make you think I'll just dive into
that and put a bunch on my cheeks but be
careful with that because it is very
pigmented but I think it's a beautiful
glow and then hashtag blessed this is
the highlight and this is really going
there for me like it's very metallic a
little bit of a champagne tone to it and
a very very micro fine little flecks of
shimmer I don't know that it's really
fair to call it glitter but that
highlight is 100% like going for it now
let's move on to the eyes I have got
them primed with Milani eyeshadow primer
and then I went with spiked cider in the
crease so I used my Sigma e25 got that
all buffed out there in my crease use
the color called marshmallow under my
brow a really nice example of a soft
matte but very pigmented shade then I
used a little bit of don't give a thud
in my outer corner just to deepen things
up a bit more then I took unwrapped meat
which is like a soft metallic purple
with a little bit of a bluish twist a
little blue tone Sheen in this shade and
I patted this all over my lid
they used halo with a very small brush
for a little brightening around the
inner corner and then I really like the
look of plum pudding with a small brush
on the outer corner just to provide a
little more contrast between the unwrap
me shade and the Browns that I've gotten
the crease I really like that addition
there and then on my lower lash line I
used some plum pudding as well and I
used party over here which is this great
like rich gold kind of a mix of gold and
bronze and I use that all throughout the
lower lash line finish the look with
some winged liner I popped on the better
than sex mascara so you can see that
going on as I've said I don't think the
mini size is really the best ambassador
you know for this mascara it I don't
think enough comes out on the brush
really I've got it on I wanted you to
see that going on see what it does on
the lashes and then I just a pop on some
false lashes for some extra glam here
these are cream I believe it's the brand
and it's number 43 gotten real cheap on
eye kate house and then that lip color
and sell out my goodness this is a great
shade this would work so well with so
many looks even more you know bold looks
on the eyes I love that it's kind of a
deep nude deep kind of rosy with a
little bit of Brown great shade to
include so guys that's my full wrap-up
on the Too Faced holiday stuff right now
and there might be some other
like little stocking stuffer type things
that they have but as far as their big
sets go this is basically what we're
looking at and again I was a little
underwhelmed well quite a bit
underwhelmed I would say by their three
pallets and that came in the makeup bag
the first one I talked about didn't
think that was so great the Ulta
exclusive I think it's the most
practical very wearable very giftable
but the Sephora set you know that
palette really does speak to me in terms
of these colors I like the jewel tones I
like the dark Matt's that are in here I
think it's one of the better holiday
palettes that Too Faced is put out but
lumped in with that you got a big ol
hardcover planner and quite a large
finder to put it in as well might make
people all the more excited to buy this
or might be kind of like and I don't
need that you'll have to be the judge
but thank you guys so much for watching
I hope it was useful and I'll see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
