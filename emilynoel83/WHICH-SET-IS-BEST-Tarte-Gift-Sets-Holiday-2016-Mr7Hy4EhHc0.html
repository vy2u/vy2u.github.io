talking about gift sets from Tarte I'm
not going to be talking about larger
palettes which you may see lingering
lurking back here in the background I'm
gonna save those for their own video
there's just a lot to talk about there
and I kind of had to split this up
somehow so the focus of this video is
going to be four different sort of less
expensive smaller kits one of them is a
brush set another one is an eyeliner set
also a blush set and set of their lip
paints that actually includes kind of
like two packages of lip pants and one
so we're gonna cover all that right now
you may notice that the overall theme
for tarts 2016 holiday line is sort of
an artsy geometric print on the outer
packaging it's called works of tart
that's what they're calling the whole
thing and I like that I think it's fun
to look at it's cute in this blush set
for example which is good I'm gonna talk
about first you just have a pull out
tray here nothing too fancy but you can
see each of the blushes have that sort
of artsy colorful pattern on the outside
now this blush set really is not one of
my top recommendations from this video I
felt like it was a little bit lacking
you're getting four shades a peach
that's called vibrant pink a cool bright
pink called pop dusty rose called genius
and then the sort of a bronzey shade
that still has a little rose in it when
you share it out on the cheeks and
that's called royal along with those
blushes you're getting a brush which is
really pretty in design you know it's
got this nice gold handle but it's very
light and wispy it really strikes me as
a better blush for highlighter
especially considering the fact that I
think three out of these four blushes
just don't pick up well with this brush
this is a really nice item to have for
your super intense highlights where you
only need a little bit or maybe even
certain blushes that you feel that way
about like oh I just need to tap in
slightly because it's just so feathery
super super light I think several of
these blushes require a much more dense
brush to really pick them up and get the
most out of them because the swatches
really just weren't that impressive of
these shades these are all matte blushes
and I do appreciate that it's kind of
nice to not see a bunch of sparkly
filler hiding out in these colors but
the Coralie peach shade
the light pink I thought were very weak
the strongest shade to me is no doubt
that color called genius which I do like
it's a nice dusty rose a little bit of
mop in that shade you can see me
applying that one on my cheeks today and
I just think it's really pretty
royal you might think well can that be a
contour shade I have tried to contour
with it a little bit and I feel like I
do see just a little bit of rose coming
out of that color and it's just not
quite effective enough as a contour it's
just kind of weak all around for me to
really only like one of the blushes in
this kit I just don't think it's worth
the $35 next up we've got something that
I really really liked and it's the
winged workers I think they're calling
it deluxe Tartus eyeliner set and this
is $35 and with this again you're just
going to slide out a little tray here
and you've got four of they're sort of
like hybrid gel liquid liners this is
such a cool formula this is the first
time I've ever experimented with this is
getting this kit because this formula
has been out for I think quite a while
from tarts line and then they give you a
double-ended brush one end it's a nice
fine pointed tip the other end is a
small angled tip you could use that with
these liners or I have used that angled
tip just with powder shadows to sort of
blend in with my eyeliner but the four
colors in this set are uber Jean so it's
kind of like a brownish wine color black
bronze and navy bronze seems to have the
most like shimmer in it but it still
does set and that shimmer doesn't just
go everywhere so I was impressed to see
that Navy has a teeny bit of Sheen in it
as well but you're black and aubergine
are totally matte now in terms of the
amount I believe you're getting about
half the amount of a full size in each
one of these so considering you're
getting for the price tag is $35 and
you're getting the double ended brush I
think it's a pretty good deal and just
the format of these if you've never
tried these these are so unique you
twist off the top you actually have what
looks like a small palette and there's a
little bit of a rim that comes up around
the outside and I think that's so
perfect for getting just the right
amount of product loaded on your brush
quickly because sometimes that's the
issue with just dipping into a pot of
gel liner is that you get so much on
your brush
you end up swiping it off on the side
sometimes it takes a while here you just
kind of squeeze up just the tiniest bit
that you need out of the top and then
load up your brush with just as much as
you need scrape off easily on the side
any excess and then you can glide it
right across the lash line goes on so
easily and this is the point in the
application it almost makes me think of
a liquid
you know there's fully opaque they're
really super pigmented but the ease of
the glide across the lash line just
really makes me think of liquid liners
so I love this stuff also in this
products favor they do set they don't
take that long to set and once they do
it's a totally long-wearing finish so I
think this is a great little way to try
out these liners if you're looking for a
totally new format of liner and you know
you get a little frustrated with your
gel liners in the pot I think this style
of liner is really genius and the brush
is fantastic - totally usable this is
not a throwaway type tool you're gonna
want to use that because it's got the
perfect fine tip for doing a little wing
I did that with the aubergine shade and
I just was so impressed another kit that
I really liked and kind of surprised me
that I did enjoy it so much is this
TARDIS and Nicole Concilio collaboration
and this is a six piece brush set you're
getting three face brushes and three eye
brushes in here really love the design
and the brush again it's simple it's
kind of like that one brush that was in
with the four piece blush set there's a
nice weight to these brushes and I just
think it was a pretty smart selection of
brushes to have in a smallish kit like
this I'll try to use the actual names
that they've given these but the first
one is this beauty in the buff air Buki
foundation brush really dense I have
used this for both powder and liquid
foundations it's a great little buffing
brush
I think this brush could be a big
game-changer for people who want to get
maximum coverage out of a powder
foundation because it's just so so dense
you can really buff it into the skin
easily but it's worked great with
liquids as well so I think it's kind of
cool to have that I didn't really have a
brush exactly like this another brush
that I think was great to have it here
for a smallish brush set where you're
gonna need some things to multitask is
this one and this is
called the face framer powder brush I
believe you might think well is that the
same thing that was in this kit no this
is a fuller brush much more dense this
can easily apply face powders blushes
bronzers it's a perfect size because
it's not oversized but if you do want to
use it for something like bronzer you're
not going to get that streaky
application you know you could also take
things down the neck and feel like okay
that's a substantial enough brush but
it's got that nice little taper toward
the tip almost like this egg-shaped
design that makes it more precise if you
want to pick up product right on the tip
or just use it for blush you know it's
easy to Pat on you're also getting a fan
brush and I have like one fan brush that
I don't especially even like that much
in my collection and I do enjoy this why
the fan brush that I have is so so super
like slim like that I don't feel like I
pick up much product this if you look at
it head-on
see how well it's a very light and wispy
brush there is some thickness to the
bristles there so if you want to dust on
some highlight like right on top of the
cheekbones I may start using a brush
like this for my highlight because it is
so easy it picks up product very
effectively so I enjoy that and then
your three eye brushes you do have a
full blending brush that I think does
the job very nicely this could
definitely be like something I could
throw in my mix of brushes and use it
interchangeably with my Sigma e-40 which
is often what I use bare but I have used
this in testing this set I've used this
to apply shadow to the crease and it
does it really well everything in this
kit is very soft I have not noticed any
shedding I also really like this pencil
brush because it can do all the
functions of a pencil brush that I feel
I need which may be doing some smudgy
liner on the lower lash line but it's
got a little more give to the bristles
than a lot of pencil brushes do and that
allows you to do kind of like the work
of my essence of beauty's fine crease
brush you know really getting some
shadow right there in the crease
applying it moving it around shaping an
outer V it can be useful in that respect
too so I appreciate that
and then the brush that this one took me
a little bit longer to warm up to
because it looks like just one of those
random sort of angled cut brush
and I thought wouldn't it have been nice
to have something that could really pack
shadow on the lid this is just enough
barely there taper to pack some shadow
on the lid or you can go head on from
the tip and actually you know boom boom
boom boom boom get some shadow on there
but this also does make for a very easy
crease brush it's full enough to where
you can pick up like a light to medium
crease shade pop it wedge it right there
in your crease and then just go back and
forth and that's very easy so while I
don't really feel like there's any dud
brush in the collection this was
probably the one where I was like okay
how is it best to use this and I have
figured out that it can Pat on some
shadow okay but it really does work nice
in the crease as well so I think for a
six piece brush set it was pretty well
put together and I think it would make a
nice gift for somebody who's just
building up their brush set because you
know it's not overwhelming but every
brush really does have its place and I
think it's also got an impressive look
to it too I love the gold all over like
I said these don't feel like cheap
brushes there's a little bit of weight
to them I kind of like to see that so to
me I think this is one of the high
points of tarts Holiday Collection last
thing I want to chat about in this video
in this round of you know smaller sets
that tartness put out they got this
limitless lippies collection this would
be the most expensive thing I've
mentioned so far it's 42 dollars and the
way they've packaged it is you're
getting two like four packs of their
TARDIS lip paints and this is a matte
formula lip paint there are four in each
box and you could certainly buy this for
yourself keep them all
or you could gift one set to somebody
and you could kind of mix them up a
little bit if you feel like oh I want to
give this set to somebody but I know
they'll never wear that red shade you
know you could do a little swapping out
if you wanted to I'm gonna just breeze
through all of the shades first and then
talk a little bit more about the formula
but in the first set you've got a nude
shade called candy a deeper Rose called
purse you've got a brown called latte
and a really deep burgundy called soul
your next kit you've got kind of this
deep nude called honey you've got mani
which is the shade I've been wearing
throughout the video which turns out to
be kind of like a deep Moss spicy is a
nice deep rose and then
juicy
is your red with a little bit of added
depth in that shade as well overall
theme for all of these colors I feel
like is dusty tones you're not getting a
lot of like pure full-on you know hot
pink or light pink over here there are a
lot of these kind of trendy neutral deep
nude type shades and something to keep
in mind with these although these aren't
the worst offenders in the whole scope
of liquid lipsticks but something to
definitely be aware of is that these
shades do often turn out a little bit or
sometimes a lot bit deeper on your
actual lips for example I'm wearing mani
I think this looks a lot lighter in the
tube then it ended up looking when it
fully dried down on my lips you know and
these are kind of a light mousse like
texture they are pretty easy to apply
they feel kind of lightweight on your
lips but they don't offer any real
moisture back to your lips when I press
my lips together I'm not feeling really
a lot of hydration or like okay now I
can feel a little more creaminess you
know they are kind of this light sort of
dry mousse-like texture and while they
do dry down considerably on your lips
from where they start in this kind of
creamy state they don't 100% set I can
kind of rub across them with my finger
and still pick up some color that being
said they are pretty good in terms of
staying power and I do think Tarte made
a wise decision with this formula in
including a lot of these kind of medium
shades like there is one very very dark
one and I thought it highlighted the
dryness in my lips tremendously now I've
been battling a cold so I've maybe got
more dryness than you might have on a
day-to-day basis if your lips are dry
are the least bit flaky the dark shades
really show it the medium shades kind of
mask it a little bit more for me
personally I'm appreciating more of the
creamy lipsticks that are out there the
things that make my lips feel
comfortable and hydrated and nourished
these don't really fall into that
category but I know there are some
people who absolutely love just the
staying power and the practicality of a
you know a liquid lipstick type product
and the
I don't think or maybe as drying is some
that I've used but I gotta be honest
they're not given a lot of moisture back
to my lips either I do like the thought
behind the set where you've got to
easily giftable things here but just use
your own judgment and think to yourself
do I like something that is that matte
finish that does have pretty impressive
staying power on my lips really doesn't
run a lot of risk of drifting outside
the lip line or am I'm more the person
who's going to go towards something that
feels like a bomb or feels really soft
and creamy and that sort of thing
sometimes I feel like these liquid
lipsticks can just flake off almost in a
layer off of my lips and these I gotta
give him credit they're a little better
than that but you know what you're
getting here you're getting a matte
finished product that is gonna feel kind
of derived so again more tart reviews to
come on those bigger collections but for
now I definitely want to give you my
recommendation for these eyeliners which
I think are my tip top thing that I've
talked about today but I also think this
is a really fantastic brush set that
they've put out as well so thank you so
much for watching
continue to give me your requests for
holiday videos you'd like to see and I
will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
