work-appropriate makeup yay I was really
inspired in one of my recent videos it
was the makeup playtime where I was
asking you what is it that you do for a
living and we just kind of got into this
discussion it felt like a discussion
sort of especially going back and
reading the comments like what is it
that you do and are you required to have
certain makeup because of it like it is
your office place your workplace require
some certain thing and there were very
like very dancers there some of you who
can get away with doing absolutely
whatever you want and you do there were
many of you who had jobs where you just
can't get away with wearing much of
anything or the job is so rigorous it's
just makeup is not a factor at all and
you just kind of leave it for the
weekend and then I read so many comments
and I get these even just outside of
that video where you're telling me you
work in a hospital you work in an office
place you're a teacher you're in a bank
you're a scientist there were a lot of
you in this category who told me yes I
wear makeup every day but it's got to be
kind of like under a certain point it's
got to be very natural very muted
non-distracting and so that's what this
look is all about it's about you know
just making you feel confident and good
and feeling like you've got a nice put
together look that can be a go-to for
you something that doesn't take a long
time look you're not going to feel like
you got to keep checking on and touching
up throughout the day because as many of
you told me that's just not an option at
all and I know this may not cater to
everyone's specific like work needs but
I just wanted to let you know that I
really appreciated the comments that you
guys left on that video and it really
got me thinking how can I help those of
you who sort of feel like you're in a
bit of a box where makeup is concerned
for your workplace and you can't really
go too far with it but you still want to
have something on and look really nice
and polished why have you also said
you're interested in an interview type
makeup look I've heard that for a while
now in my comment sections or maybe
you're the boss who's doing the
interviewing this is the look I hope you
enjoy it
starting out I'm going to use my it
cosmetics your skin but better CC cream
in the shade medium
why did I choose this for this video
well I feel like it does have really
good staying power it packs in some
extra moisture I think you can always
use a light moisturizer underneath this
but I think the overall idea is that
this is moisturizer and coverage in one
and it's got that great SPF in there and
it just covers really well I don't feel
like this gives me an over-the-top glowy
luminous finish but it doesn't make my
skin look unnaturally matte either so I
can pretty much do one pump just a teeny
bit more and then I will just kind of
DAB this all around my skin
and then I'm just using my Real
Techniques buffing brush to blend this
out blender sponges work great you could
also just use your fingers if you want
to I just kind of like the evenness that
I get with this product and a brush like
Live
so again moisture concerns coverage
concerns staying power concerns it's all
kind of wrapped up in one product there
and then I thought what's a concealer
that I can just sort of throw on that's
going to cover basically everything
without going in for multiple steps and
multiple products I feel like one of the
most one-and-done concealers that I have
right now is this Almay aged essentials
concealer it's got SPF 20 in it I do
wear this in the shade light/medium so
this is just a really creamy stick
concealer and I'm going to use this to
not only tackle my under eye area but
I'm going to go around my nose where it
might feel a little bit of redness here
and there and so just swipe it on
wherever you need it it can work all
right on blemishes too and then I just
grab my Sigma p84 brush to blend this
out a Beauty Blender micro-mini can work
well too I find that I can sometimes
maintain just a little more coverage
with this particular concealer when I
blend it in with a brush and it never
really looks like cakey or thick anyway
I'm trying to take this tutorial a
little bit quicker than some of my you
know chat about everything type looks
lately because I'm trying to be time
conscious here I know some of y'all
don't have a lot of time as you sit and
watch I don't worry I'm not abandoning
the makeup playtime's this is just you
know a little more down to business
hence the work look okay so look at that
I feel like really even skin is
happening right now and then I am going
to set my under eye and for those of you
who aren't super oily this may be like
the only powder step that you really
want to think about but I got some of
these Besame I think that's how you say
it Besame this is the brightening violet
powder they all say translucent but
there's like little bit different tones
available and I got this little 3-pack
my first time experimenting with this
brand they're available on Sephora and
so it is like a light lilac powder and
the other day I was just playing around
and I used a little bit of this on my
under eyes and I thought wow that really
is really nice and brightening so I'm
just picking up a little bit of what I
tapped into the cap with my ELF small
tapered brush and I'm going to dab this
on the under eye overall it's a pretty
light amount of product not like baking
the area right now I'm just sort of
taking away any any tackiness that
concealer stick left behind which it's
not a lot but I just find this lilac
powder to be like extra brightening or
really really enjoy that so that's
really all the powder I'm going to be
using on my skin today as far as just
like a setting powder but if you do
produce a little more oil and that's a
concern staying power wise for you the
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless is
kind of a nice powder to use as you're
first doing your makeup because I think
it does help as a day goes on it helps
keep your skin from getting overly oily
you need a shade reference I have this
in natural beige and that does work for
me but just throwing that out there to
those of you who have a long work day a
very little chance to even maybe glance
at yourself in a mirror let alone take
the time to touch up if you're oily even
though you think your skin may not need
a lot of powder right now it might be a
good time to go ahead and put that on
next up we're going to use a little
multi
Skeen palette to do some bronzer blush
highlight it's going to be very light
and you can feel free to skip the
bronzer steps some people like to bronze
more than others and I totally get that
but this is the laura geller baked color
and contour compact and I know I've
talked a lot about the it cosmetics
compact as well recently part of me just
wanted to reach for something different
because I've used that a lot lately I'm
talking about that Genesee quad compact
that has the four powders in one but
another reason why I chose this
specifically is that the highlight in
here is very very subtle it's the baked
french vanilla highlight that seems to
add a little coverage it's very good if
you have any kind of like texture
problems up in here and you're not
wanting to exaggerate that with a shiny
powder and it's just not a distracting
look whatsoever it's a very pretty soft
natural look on the skin and that is
what we're going for here so I'm taking
my ELF complexion brush and I'm going to
dab into my bronze and brighten side of
this palette and I'm just going to start
using that a little bit around my
hairline here I'm using it very lightly
I always you know maybe when I use
bronzer sometimes in videos you don't
even really feel like you see a lot of
product going on and that's fine because
I don't see a lot in person either I'm
just kind of keeping it light just
giving the skin a little extra boost and
then you can use this lightly just under
the cheekbone it's like shortcut
contouring is kind of what I'm doing I'm
not really thinking that much about it
doesn't need to be a big process and
then I like to always take it down the
net if you really want to keep it very
quick and natural you can just add a
little extra bronze and brighten on the
apple of your cheek and it makes a
surprisingly pretty blush as well so
just a more neutral like a little bit
bronzy blush but I am going to use the
blush that's in this compact it has a
little glow to it not too much though
doesn't take a lot of product either
this is pretty pigmented so I'm just
going to swirl this on the outer part of
the apple of my cheeks those of you who
are waking up early start in your work
day I mean there's nothing like a little
bit of blush on the cheeks to just
wake the whole face up
and then we're just going back to the
small tapered brush and here's my french
vanilla highlight as I've said many
times that I've talked about this this
is not an over-the-top blow a shiny
highlight it's more of a brightening
type of powder that I think just takes a
whole like zone of your skin and lifts
it up
and you can use it other places besides
just the tops of your cheekbones you can
go down the nose with it hit the center
of the forehead you know
Cupid's bow even it'll definitely do the
brightening it's just going to do it
with less shine and then hear that those
are my last remaining drops of hard
candy shear and be hydrating primer mist
I thought we'd say goodbye to this
product together I love this stuff and I
am going to repurchase it but I'm just
going to do a few myths of this because
I think it does make a difference
locking in the makeup giving it an even
more natural look on the skin so boom
mm-hmm
love the way it feels yeah there's not
much left in there and then as far as
brows go I'm thinking what's one tool
that I can easily grab for and get the
look quickly and lately it's been this
makeup forever Pro sculpting brow and
the shade number 40 for me that's just
been a really easy product to use and I
like it because it's a hair like lighter
than my brows I think but it's just very
cool so it doesn't make them look too
reddish or warm Brown and I believe I've
mentioned this before but the shape of
the brow product itself see how it's a
little bit thicker and I think that
helps me just lay it on a little bit
faster compared to some of the really
fine tip pencils out there
there's also spoolie on the end that you
can use and there's a little like under
the brow highlight powder that you can
throw on as well which is very quick and
easy right there
and then not everybody may require this
step I do like to hit the brow with a
little bit of a clear gel this is just
one from wet-and-wild next I'm going to
prime the eyelids real quick Milani
eyeshadow primer this might to some seem
like a fussy step like okay why are you
taking the time to put some invisible
priming product on the lids but eye
primer I tell you if you're going to use
any type of powder shadow on top of
those lids you want something to help it
stick and help it last and just help the
intensity of whatever shadow you're
putting on top and there are certainly
several routes we can take as far as
everyday eye makeup you know um you
could take a shadow stick that's very
simple and easy to swipe it on kind of
blend it out and boom there's like
quickest look ever what I thought I
would go ahead and show in this video is
a matte palette that I really like it's
the Too Faced natural matte I don't know
how many of you guys have this but I've
raved about it quite a bit
I think this formula is 100% awesome and
it kind of makes me think of a condensed
version of that new Urban Decay Naked
ultimate basics 100% matte palette only
I think I like this formula a little bit
better but I totally get that there are
days that you're not going to mess with
multiple shadow colors and that's fine
but then some of you may also be
watching this from the thought of maybe
I just want a nice professional look to
wear to an interview or I am going to
you know take that little extra time
just to put something together on the
eyes so here's a very easy look with
this palette and there's a lot of easy
looks potentially you know available
here but I'm going to go into this shape
called cashmere bunny right up top and
this is just kind of a matte very cool
Brown like a greyish Brown and I'm just
applying that to the crease with a sigma
e25 brush
next step is going to simultaneously
highlight under the brow and kind of
blend the edge of what we just did so
I'm going to use this color called
heaven light creamy color and the little
tat taps you here are just me tapping
off excess off of my brush because it's
easy to pick up maybe a little more than
you need then we want to brighten we
want to make the eye look even more
wide-awake than it already is so I'm
going to go back into heaven this time
though with a flat brush you could also
use any random sponge tip that's sitting
around for the step but I'm just dabbing
it on my inner corner going all around
that inner corner and on the lid and the
final thing I'm going to do is use this
shade here which is my dark very cool
Brown called 6 press oh it's an
extremely basic color and I'm just
dabbing that on the outer part of my lid
and what I think that does is provides a
little bit of a finished look to what's
happening on the eye and if you do kind
of take this brush and flip it over and
pull it into your crease just a little
bit I think it can give you a little
added lift
but the cool thing about this palette I
feel like I just now reached for in that
top row just the most neutral natural
very very easy colors but then you can
take it a more rosey route or you can go
more warm on the bottom because you've
got like a warm brown and like this
almost yellowy Browns kind of
interesting another palette that can be
great for everyday work looks would be
the Kat Von D shade + light eye palette
and this one I think just doesn't go
quite as dark as that palette does
overall so it stays in a little more
natural place one other thing I'm going
to do is a little trick for eyeliner on
the lower lash line that doesn't look
like eyeliner I'm going to go into a
little bit of cashmere bunny here with a
smudge brush and just apply that ever so
softly right here you're going to define
the eye give the eye a little bit of an
outer border without it looking like
thick lines like I don't think anybody
be able to point to it and be like oh
she's really rimmed the eyes today soft
easy and then an ultimate thing for
makeup step that makes an impact but
doesn't look makeup e at all is taking a
nude liner such as the Rimmel
scandaleyes in nude and apply that right
here to the waterline instantly more
awake instantly wider looking eyes not
as stark as a white liner although you
could use white if you want to do and
for eyeliner I was really debating on
whether to pull in liquid whether to do
pencils some people find one easier and
more natural to use than the other so I
thought I'd go kind of in between with a
liquid pen one that I really like from
the drugstore that I think wears a long
time and it's just so simple and it's
got a brush tip instead of a felt tip so
this is a Physicians Formula
eye booster pen and I'm just going to
take a thin line of this
I'm not winging it out at all I'm just
kind of stopping where my the end of my
eye stops
I'm going to curl my lashes
and a really good go-to mascara for me
is my covergirl super sizer so I'm going
to apply this to my upper lashes and my
lower lashes because I've realized it
really performs pretty well on my lower
lashes too without being getting smudgy
or anything
we're going to finish this look off with
lips and I think lips are just the
single thing that you can do to really
make yourself look polished but it's a
very easy step and a light step can take
just as much work as a slightly deeper
step so here's something I would like to
challenge you guys to do I've heard from
so many of you who say you know I just
wear lip balm or barely there like
barely visible type of lip Geller to
work and I think if you just deepen that
shade up just a little bit and I think I
got the perfect color to do that for you
your whole face is going to look more
finished defined somehow brightened by
this and plus it's just very appropriate
to the season as well and I don't think
it's going to make you look
unprofessional in fact I think it's
going to make you look more professional
Elf has a line of lipsticks called satin
lipstick I've had a few for a while but
haven't really dug in to experiment too
much until recently they feel really
nice on the lips and this one it's
called touch of blush just let me put
this shade on real quick
it's not over-the-top shiny glossy it's
not completely matte either it has a
really nice feel smells great and I
think this can be like your ideal color
this can be something that takes your
whole look and whether you went super
minimal on the eyes or whatever else you
did this will do something for your face
and now you know take the hair down
throw in a pair of earrings and I think
we're done with a very finished very
work appropriate look but not only is
the look I think appropriate for a
conservative workplace but it also is
something that's going to last well for
you and I don't think you're going to be
constantly feeling the need to touch
something up it'd be it on the eyes or
elsewhere on the face so I want to thank
you guys so much for watching and thank
you for inspiring me to do this look
through all the things that you've
shared with me about what you do for a
living and what your workplace kind of
requires of you in terms of appearance I
truly found that fascinating and I love
learning more about you and just what
your day-to-day beauty routine is like
so hopefully and you can take if not the
whole look just bits and pieces of this
and make it work for you so thank you
for watching and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
