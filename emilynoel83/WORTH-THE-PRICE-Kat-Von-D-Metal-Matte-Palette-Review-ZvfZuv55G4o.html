we're going to be talking about the new
eyeshadow palette release from Kat Von D
it is the metal matte I love how it does
that I think that's so cool
big eyeshadow palette here I mean it's
physically just large I think I showed
in my haul video I have another small
palette here you know it really extends
quite a ways past some other palettes
you might be familiar with there's a lot
inside a lot of generously sized shadows
and I think it's a really good value
even at $60
I think the quality in here is intense
and wonderful and so varied so in here
there are nine of the metal crush
metallic finish eyeshadows and then
thirteen totally matte shadows
I feel like overall I've had the most
experience with Kat Von D's matte
shadows and having used the shade +
light eye palette which I know so many
people love it's a really great matte
neutral palette and then she kind of
branched off and did some quads that I
really liked as well and so here you're
getting I think a good handful of
neutrals but you're also getting some
pops of colors and sometimes I feel like
we put a lot of stock as makeup lovers
makeup junkies in swatches you know how
does something swatch does that fully
tell the tale of how it actually works
on the eyes and these swatch beautifully
I mean I think they really look so true
to color when i swatched them out
not even on top of any sort of base or
primer but just a dry swatch one swipe
on the skin I think they look really
good but after doing a handful of looks
with this palette I can tell you they
apply equally as nice on the eyes if one
of the things that I like so much about
shades that have just really rich
pigmentation and this goes for I'm
thinking primarily the deep matte shades
but also some of the shimmery shades as
well they have a range it's kind of like
when you think about buying a really
deep rich lipstick with the one that
comes to mind is Revlon's black cherry
that lipstick can take on a certain very
distinct deep dark look when it's
applied full-on all over the lips but if
you shear it out a little bit I mean
it's got a spectrum of ways that can
look it can look like the dark
as vampy is near black ever or it can go
more towards a light soft berry so when
you've got really nicely pigmented
colors even an eye shadow I see similar
effects to that I've worked with this
green called Moss ribbon that pretty
purple velvet down here this nice
burgundy they all have a range they can
be packed on and look pretty much
exactly like they look in the palette or
they have the capability of being
sheared out and looking a totally
different way on the eyes and offering
something really different to your look
so I think that's something worth
keeping in mind
I mean $60 yes good chunk of change for
an eyeshadow palette but if it's going
to really perform for you and be
top-notch quality and do everything you
would expect and I think give you a
little creativity that's what I like to
see I mean I mentioned this with my big
lorac mega pro 3 review and not
everybody's like this and I totally
understand you know I saw people in the
comments like oh this would be a great
palette just for a conservative
workplace or you know I only like to
wear neutrals fine absolutely great but
when I look at some of the palettes that
I personally like most and this is my
review so I'm going to own it and give
you a little bit of personal insight
here when I look at the palettes in my
collection that I really enjoy the most
there are things that do offer a good
chunk of neutrals but also some things
that cause me to do something a little
bit different than I would normally do
with my eyeshadow and sometimes I need
that push and I think palettes are good
for giving you that push because
everything's kind of all in one you can
look at everything it's all sitting
right there on your lap and you can say
you know maybe I'll go over to this
shade and try a little bit of that out
so I like palettes that push me just a
bit out of my comfort zone I'm not
saying I want to wear like the world's
brightest eyeshadow around town every
day and that's not what this is that's
another key point that I want to make
about the colors in here because kind of
look more towards this side of the
palette when I look at those shades I
see colors that I'm very like familiar
with wearing on my eyes colors I wear a
lot on my eyes I look over here I see a
blue that really stands out some
metallic blue and teal type colors and
what gets me about these and I meant
this in the hall they didn't go like
absolutely screaming electric-blue with
those shades they went with a really
true royal blue they went with kind of a
deep emerald green as opposed to a
really bright kelly green and these
shades up here too while they're
pigmented they're very vivid there's
that little bit of depth to them that I
think makes them a little more
approachable a little bit easier for an
everyday person to throw into a look so
what I see when I look at this palette
is something where I could do a largely
kind of neutral or neutral toned look
and then if you just wanted to add one
pop of color to your outer corner to
your transition type color to your lower
lash line like everything is here to
make your look just a little more
interesting so I'm really embracing this
palette I love it I'm clearly enamored
by what's in here but I do want to ask
myself anytime I look at an eyeshadow
palette like this is there anything
missing
I know a lot of palettes these days have
a lot of warmth going on a lot of like
orange e-type shades there's nothing
super Orange about this palette I mean
fringe is a little bit peachy here but
you're not getting like one of those
rich rusty orange shades not saying it
should have been in here but you know
that might be a color that some people
are really looking for these days also
when I think about the more transition
type colors shades that might help you
blend out a look for me and the looks
that I've done suede has been good for
that
so has fringe but when I just want a
soft like kind of light brown crease
color and you'll see this in the look I
did today I just kind of go a little bit
back and forth between oak which is the
true kind of deep brown here and suede
which is the soft tan I do a little
blending with those and I can kind of
customize it to just the perfect like
soft Brown crease color so keep that in
mind so what I see when I look at this
palette is generously sized eye shadows
really good quality packed into all of
them today I use tinsel which when I
initially swatched it I thought maybe
tinsel is going to be like the dry flaky
one of the bunch but it really can be
packed on the eyes and have an impact so
I was happy to see that in application I
have snap pictures of a couple of the
looks that I've done one is like
all to the max I use the gold I used the
burgundy I used the kind of bronzy brown
called synergy and I just love the way
that look came together I mean it was
just it felt so good everything applied
so full-on and vibrant and then the
other day I wanted to experiment with
Moss this pretty green here and I really
felt like I used it softly I went into
the look knowing I don't feel like doing
you know full-on glamorous heavy I look
today I just want to take this in a
lighter direction and I tell you what
that lighter eye look and this does not
always happen with eye shadows even
though I'm careful to prime my lids
every day that look on my eyes looked
identical when I took my makeup off at
ten o'clock that night these shades are
really capable of clinging to the eyes
even if you wear them in a lighter
capacity it's really beautiful and then
for today's look I want to walk you
through a little demo on that again I
did prime my lids first I used that
little combo of oak and suede in my
crease just to get the perfect soft
Brown crease color for a deeper look oak
could have done the job on its own but
I'm just trying to try to set the stage
for something here and get just a little
natural contrast going and then I used
fringe a little bit that peachy shade on
the outside of that color and went
further up towards the brow with bone as
my highlight so I've got this nice kind
of matte natural thing happening and now
I'm going to pop on some color and sort
of layering with this look from the
inside out so I decided to pack tinsel
which is your silvery color I find that
this color applies best with kind of a
Pat and a little bit of a tug type
motion you know I'm saying like not a
painted on swipe back and forth but just
like pack it on and then just pull your
brush slightly and it transfers on so
well then I pulled in what because I
wanted this sort of teal pop right on
the lid and that shade is just dynamite
such a pretty deep rich teal color and
then on the outer part of my eye I used
ribbon which is the pretty matte purple
and I cleaned off my brush and I use
that just on the outermost part of the
lid outer part of the crease I used a
little bit of volt just kind of around
the edge because I thought I don't know
it just brought out more
the purpley look that I was going after
here press pause on the eyeshadow
palette I did some black liquid liner
across my upper lash line and I used
this fantastic purple liner it's the
l'oreal kissimmee liner in pur purple
applied it to the waterline I also kind
of smudged it that down there in between
the lashes and then I went back to
ribbon on the lower lash line with a
pencil brush and I used a little bit of
volt which is the shimmery purple as
well on the inner part of the lower lash
line finish the look with some mascara
and some demi whispies false lashes and
could not be more pleased without this
turned out it's so fun I love having
that little kind of unexpected pop on
the lid because overall like head on I
feel like it looks like a very plummy I
look but then you can see that little
bit of wat coming through and when that
layers with tinsel it like brightens
that shade up even more so so many fun
options I really enjoy the feeling when
I get an eyeshadow palette and I think
yeah I've done a variety of looks with
this but yet I still only feel like I've
scratched the surface you know that's a
fun feeling and when you've got shades
like ignite in here which I haven't
really talked about a whole lot but
ignite glitz twinkle tinsel as well
these lighter metallic shades when you
start layering the mattes or the deeper
metallics over those you have again even
more looks but you can go after even
more shades so in my opinion I think
this is a really good palette for those
of you who you know you like your
neutrals but you're ready to start kind
of stepping out there and integrating a
little bit of color into your look I
think it's all wearable it's just in how
you apply it and I'm going to do some
more tutorials with this you know I've
got a lot of reviews kind of lined up
that I want to get done but I truly feel
that this is a totally wearable palette
you tell you right now it's no doubt one
of my favorite favorite things of this
holiday season thus far and a happy
customer I'm glad I got this I would
highly recommend it and yeah it's just
it makes me happy it gets me in a good
mood you know I'm like when you crack
open an eyeshadow palette and it's
either gonna make you feel like okay
here we go again same old business or
it's going to make you feel kind of like
yes what can we do with this today
that's how I feel with this so thank you

very soon with more reviews bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
