me for this review and double tutorial
using the Too Faced natural love palette
so this is the big new thing from Too
Faced and chances are you've seen this
all over social media and I really
wanted to give you my review on this
today I'm seeing it right now for $59 on
Too Faced website but this is a 30 color
eyeshadow palette quite a bit going on
here and just to give you the background
because I was kind of curious as to you
know what the inspiration behind this
palette really was because they did
decide to include 13 shades that have
appeared before in other palettes and
then the rest are new shades on the
website they talked about coming out
with the natural eye palette back in
2009 and how popular that was and it
says to celebrate that iconic look get
ready to fall hard for the first ever
natural love eyeshadow collection it
says we had to include some of your
favorites from the best-selling
naturalised natural matte natural at
night palettes of natural at night was
like one of my all-time faves but get
ready to take your neutral game to the
next level with new exclusive shades
packaging lies on this guy it's really
adorable and it's not too over packaged
I think for the fact that you're getting
30 eyeshadows in here I don't really see
a lot of excess both in the thickness of
the palette or the width or anything
like that and you are getting a great
big mirror as well as I look left to
right at the shadow selection you can
see it going from light to dark
obviously so I look at the bottom they
put some really warm shades right down
here mixing matte shimmer a few kind of
sparkle infused shades the shimmer on
some is downright metallic whereas with
others it's sort of barely there satiny
type things there are certain shades in
here and as we go through looking at
swatches you'll see there are some
unusual neutrals in here and it's sort
of hard to impress me these days with
new drill shades or to make me feel like
wow I'm getting something different here
but there are some colors in here that I
feel like are totally stunning and
really offering something different from
the norm but in a little backstory on
this palette they mentioned natural eyes
and this is definitely a palette that
they're taking a lot from in terms of
the shades from this palette that are
going into this other big one you're get
heaven nudie push-up honeypot and
chocolate martini so that's five out of
nine shades in this palette and then
when I look at the shades that you're
not getting I kind of glance over at
this and I'm thinking well there are a
lot of similar shades to what you didn't
get out of this palette so it's kind of
like you're getting naturalized in here
enclosed in this larger palette which I
do think is kind of a good deal and I
had discussed this palette a little bit
in my beauty chat video that I did and
the thought of including some iconic
shades from other palettes and I do
appreciate the fact that if they're
going to do that if that's the route
they're going to take I like that they
pointed out exactly what those shades
are give them the same names don't try
to just like pop in shades rename them
but they were really like just kind of
recycled colors from other palettes you
know I really love the naturalized
palette and a lot of the shapes that
came from there and so I guess I don't
really mind them being included in here
basically I like the fact that they're
recognizing that some of their shadows
are kind of well-known they do kind of
have this identity I think about the
shape push up and honeypot you know
those are colors that yes I hear that
name I know what that shade is you know
without even looking at it so I kind of
liked that they recognized that with
this palette and they gave us things
that maybe very loved colors in your
collection so let's get down to the
nitty-gritty here and talk about
swatches and the exact colors that are
in here and the way I chose to break
this up and swatch it for you is these
two rows in the center and then the end
so here we're talking the lightest tones
overall in the middle I think mid tones
and then your deepest colors at the end
so that just makes it a little bit
easier to discuss and compare the shades
so starting off what you see swatch tout
is going from spot light to heaven and
then honey butter to Fairy Tail on the
next row some of these shades just give
them my skin tone that they're swatching
on top of they may not seem to be really
bouncing off my skin a whole lot but
what I'm noticing with shades that I've
like seen before and other palettes like
heaven and honey butter that was from
the natural matte a nice texture to the
matte they're creamy they're soft
they're what I expected to see and work
with on my eyes so I really appreciate
the fact that they seem to stay true to
they're matte texture which I really
like from two-faced now fairytale that's
the shade right up here this color is
the only one in the palette that is that
kind of flaky all over the place
glittery just kind of crazy shape I
think it's been a complaint in the past
with different holiday palettes that
they put too much of that kind of shade
in a palette but here you're just
getting one shade of this type and I did
work it into a tutorial to show you how
I like to use the color and sort of show
off how that shade is best used and it
really needs to be put on top of a base
that's where it really shines and it can
pop a whole lot if you do it that way so
while in a swatch you're going to look
at that shade and give it a total I roll
it really does work in a look if you
know how to use it this shade called
kittens right here it looks almost like
a soft lilac with a golden e undertone
to it and that is a really pretty like
thought behind a shade I like the
concept but it is a little sheer poodle
this color down here is just brilliant
that is a really really brightening
highlight shade because it has just a
little bit of that pink eNOS to it not a
lot just a bit to make it like
next-level brightening and it's also one
that's more like a soft pearlescent look
you know it's not downright metallic so
there are definitely some great things
happening in those first couple of rows
but I really get more impressive that's
how it goes along so moving on to our
next couple of rows which are kind of
mid tones here I think is where you're
getting a lot of variety and down
towards the bottom of the palette the
shades honeymoon and hot and bothered
those are gorgeous and those give you a
very pronounced warm look and just
taking a glance at this palette when I
first got it I didn't especially think
of it as a super warm palette but those
two shades can totally take you there
and then working up from that these
shapes here dear diary and copy date I
think are especially smooth bunny nose
is sort of a sheer pink and I will
tackle that shade in one of the
tutorials I love Moonbeam here this
color is like silver with a hint of gold
thrown and there's one of those unique
colors push up in honeypot iconic shades
from past palettes I mean push up is
just a gorgeous color in my book the
best way to describe push-up would be a
dirty rose gold
a little bit of brown working in there
nudee is going to be that crease color
everybody wants tickle me might be the
weakest shade in the palette it's got a
little bit of sparkle you know it's kind
of a soft shade I'm just not really
feeling that one too much and then we're
moving into our last two roads where I
think it can be really hard to put dark
neutral colors in a palette and really
set them apart in some way
give us something different that we
haven't seen before but Too Faced I
think really managed to do it with this
palette I'm glad to be saying that
because when I first got it I thought
okay another neutral palette you know we
all have that kind of assumption but
there's really some cool stuff going on
here with the last two rows first off
the shape down here at the bottom makeup
and chill and stiletto those are very
strong matte dark brown and matte black
colors so it's great that those are in
here they're going to give you the
ability to anchor a lot of these
shimmery shades in the palette but I am
in love with Love Bug like if I could
create a shadow that would probably be
it it's this mommy purpley just kind of
little splash of taupe sometimes when it
hits the light I see a little bit of
bronze in that shade it's so pretty
smoking is really surprising I love that
shade because it's kind of like charcoal
but I swear there's a splash of green in
that shade and I can see it when it hits
the light under cover is in here I'm
glad they're giving you a nice deep plum
that appears to have a little sparkle
but behaves very matte on the eyes and
you will notice that with some of these
shapes that you see a little sparkle
with but it doesn't like really Sparkle
big-time on the eyes and I don't mind
that so I have used this palette a lot I
really didn't want to just like do one
look with its watch it out and then give
you my review I wanted to put some of
these shades into action and be able to
tell you like from a first-hand I've
used it perspective you know how this
works and I really am a fan of this
palette I got to say something I'm
really happy with is that I think they
have all of the basic matte bases
covered in terms of a neutral eye
palette I mean it doesn't leave me
feeling like I need anything else
because you've got your matte like kind
of cream color up here you've got a
couple of really easy tones to work with
as soft
at crease colors with new tea and also
honey butter down here and then you've
got your two deep dark guys down here
that I think are necessities dark matte
brown dark really rich saturated black
and then even on top of that you've got
a few other masks to play with with
shapes like lace Teddy this peach
spotlight kind of a yellowy beige down
here so to me I feel like the mat needs
are covered here but if you're a full-on
just matte shadow lover and you don't go
for a lot of shimmer whatsoever what's
left in this palette really is a lot of
shimmer and if that's not your thing you
might be better off just like going for
the natural matte palette because Too
Faced natural matte palette is really
just fantastic as far as just matte
shadows go but if you want that mix I
really was pleasantly surprised with so
many of the shimmers in this palette
colors that are doing just little
unexpected things for me and I like the
ability to get a plummy look out of this
palette lovebug and under cover those
are working into this look today and I
really enjoyed it and then you know a
warm Brown look that's in here for you
bronze and gold and that type of thing
totally there with a shade like honey
pot cooler like smokey eye type looks
are in here as well so the variety I
think once you start using this will be
very evident to you now I want to jump
into the two different looks that I did
I wanted to do a couple because it's a
pretty big palette and I thought it
might be nice to share just like a
little inspiration maybe with what you
can do with it and I'm really not like
the most super creative hi shadow user
all the time like I really do look at
things and I think how would I
realistically on a day-to-day basis like
to use this palette so I wanted to show
you one look that I thought was really
glam and it definitely took that Fairy
Tail shade that can be a little flaky it
really took it to the max and then I've
got the look that I've been wearing
throughout the video that I think while
it is deeper on the lid it's kind of a
bit softer and it's that very feminine
pinky plum thing so let's jump into
those two looks so after applying primer
all over the lids I use nudie with a
crease brush just all throughout the
crease really blending it out getting it
kind of in a nice wide path there
throughout my crease and then I took a
slightly deeper brown makeup and chill
and I used that just in the outer corner
after that I used the peach called lace
Teddy just up above those shades to sort
of help blend things out a little bit
and then I used heaven the matte cream
color just up under the brow so we've
laid all of this matte groundwork here
and then I'm using a primer that has a
little bit of pearlescent finish to it
it's the Maybelline master prime and I
applied that on my lid and then I
blended it out a little bit with a
synthetic brush from Real Techniques and
I wanted to definitely have a base when
I used fairytale this ultra ultra
shimmery kind of flaky shade I padded
that all over the lid and I really
wanted to just give that color a
pronounced pop on the lid and the lid
only so that's what I did there and then
for some real contrast I brought in
stiletto the matte black with a flat
shadow brush just patted that on the
outer part of my lid trying not to cover
up too much of the sparkly shade and
then up into the crease a little bit and
then I used a smaller crease brush from
makeup revolution just to concentrate
the shade even more get it exactly where
I want it there in the outer V area and
then to really finish up the upper part
of the eye I used honeymoon with my
little white wispy e36 brush from Sigma
and I thought that gave a nice little
warmth on the outer edge as my I was
then before moving on to shadow on the
lower lash line I'm doing a liner I'm
using my Jordana color Envy liquid liner
in black and be a great waterproof liner
went all the way across the upper lash
line and winged it out just a little bit
and then in my lower inner rim I use my
L'Oreal kissimmee liner in charcoal this
is great for being kind of smudge able
and smooth not the best in terms of
staying power but it get you through a
night out for sure smudged it a little
bit on my actual lower lash line and
then used an angled liner brush with
stilettos and matte black to blend in
with my wing a little bit and then I
love this color called smokin it's got
just the slightest hint of olive green
in it and I blended that all throughout
my lower lash line gets a really nice
smoky effect but a little brightness
because it is shimmery and then after I
curled my lashes I use my essence
princess mascara on the upper lashes and
covergirl clump crusher water-resistant
on lower lashes the false lashes that I
put on I don't totally remember the
style and brand but they're very similar
to red cherry number 43 and after I got
that on my upper lash line you got the
finished look with a really nice pop on
the lid and some nice contrast in the
outer corner in crease and then I've got
kind of a deep peachy pink blush on and
it's matte and it's from the balm it's
called bomb Springs and on my lips I'm
wearing my wet and wild gel lip liner in
the shade bear to comment and then my
Revlon Ultra HD lip color and HD sand
so for this look I applied primer all
over my lids and I padded lovebug all
over the lids and then I also used my
Sigma e25 brush to work that shade up
into my crease as well and then I
overlapped a lot of that shade on the
lid with under cover which is a really
rich plummy shade it kind of behaves
like I'm matte it just has the tiniest
bit of sparkle in it as you look at it
in the palette I also used a pencil
brush just to slightly bring that shade
on the lower lash line and then that's
really all I did shadow wise on the
lower lash line and then I took my white
wispy brush and I went into bunny nose
just to give a really pretty light kind
of pinkish border on the look is kind of
a sheer shade and I do like it that way
because I don't really want this color
to full on and then I took poodle as my
highlighting shade both under the brow
and I also used a more pinpointed brush
to bring it right around my inner corner
and then I went across my upper lash
line with black liquid liner and I went
in my lower inner rim with a nude liner
just to brighten things up mascara top
and bottom and some false lashes I feel
like the end result is sort of a
plumbing look with a little bit of a
pink twist though it's kind of hard to
put your finger on the pink you know
it's lightly there but it's not a
full-on like saltless pink eyeshadow
look so bottom line here with this
palette who is it not for I don't think
it's for the person who primarily uses
matte shades and just is not interested
in a lot of shimmer because let's face
it there's a lot of shimmer happening in
here well I think all the right
necessity matte shades are included
there's still a lot of like sparkle and
glow going on also it's not for the
person who's wanting a lot of color
because it is as the name implied and
natural palette of the tones are kind of
rooted in a neutral place you might have
a more pinky shade here or there you
might have something kind of rusty
orange a little bit of plum but overall
it's a neutral eyeshadow palette but for
me it really checks a lot of boxes
because I feel like the variety is there
for a neutral palette right the variety
is there the quality is there they're
really just two shapes that were a
little bit questionable to me kittens
you know it's not a bad color
it's going to be more on the light and
sheer side and also tickle me but
everything else I mean there's a lot of
great quality happening in here some
unique shades that after all this time
in the make up game we're able to be
neutral but still surprise me and it's
the kind of thing where I could simply
grab this palette and do some easy one
shadow looks like the lovebug color that
i layered on with this look that could
have been a one shadow look after just a
couple of steps and there are multiple
shades that I look around and see you
know it could be one shadow looks in
this palette but then there are so many
ways you can dress up the look right
make it really smoky or make it a little
more glowy with some of the other tones
and then like I said before just
packaging wise I like that it's pretty
you know it's adorable
but they didn't really overdo it with
side I'm not sure with 30 shades it
could have been much smaller than this
right so I'm very happy with that layout
so that is my take on the new natural
love palette from Too Faced I'd love to
hear your thoughts in the comment
section especially if you've tried it
what did you think thank you guys so
much for taking time to watch and I'll
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
