great day I'm trying to make some second
day waves work here even though they're
they're barely hanging on but I want to
talk today about the busy art petite pro
palettes so there are three of these now
and I really this past holiday season
fell in love with the first one it had
been out for a while just during the
time when I was doing a lot of traveling
and just really wanting to simplify and
downsize whatever makeup I was taking
with me that petite Pro palette was just
everything for me and I really fell in
love with it and I found the color
selection to be actually really really
versatile so this is the one I'm talking
about here these palettes if you're not
familiar with them they're tiny they're
about the size of a credit card but a
little bit thicker they're gonna cost
$30 each this original one the first one
that came out I know that's available at
Sephora the second one is also available
at Sephora and then the third I just
recently got from Beauty lish visi our
shadows are really high-quality you've
probably heard me talk about them on my
shadow my shadow on my channel before
they do some really great like all matte
or all shimmer palettes they also have
the theory palettes which I love they're
a great kind of monochromatic grouping
of shades just in certain color families
so like the mink squad is going to be
your coppery warm shades and then you've
got amethyst with the purples and
they're really doing a great job in
giving you half Matt 1/2 shimmer in just
one solid color scheme but with the
petite pros what you'll notice is that
things are a little bit more mixed you
are always getting half Matt and 1/2
shimmer here so like in this original
one here's your row of mattes here's
your shimmers but the shades are a
little bit more mixed you know you're
getting maybe a purple and then a dark
charcoal type shade a gold thrown in
there a champagne so I think it's
actually a really good way to sample the
brand the pans are small and if you
ended up with a few of these and you
really wanted to customize it mix and
match you can pop the pans out and
switch things around but this is the way
they fold down they've got a mirror in
there and then it's just a magnetic
closure and it's just so tiny so easy to
take with you and that's why I
appreciate in a little 8 color palette
that they're able to in a lot of cases
work
a lot of variety but what I want to do
today is compared the one two and three
and let you know my preferences and not
only that just show you the swatches and
help you decide for yourself if you
never tried one of these before also I'm
going to do a demo with the newest
petite Pro at the end of this video but
with the original here's what we're
looking at we've got kind of a purpley
shade a copper a gold a champagne color
and those are all with kind of a
shimmery metallic finish and then your
mats are like sort of an off black a
near black shade here a really dark kind
of rusty wine color to sort of mushroom
a shade right here that's great for the
crease and then just your light cream
color so it's perfect for creating looks
that might be more on the warm side or
you can cool it down you can do a purely
matte look if you felt like loops but
again I was just stunned by the
versatility of this when I really took
it with me as the only eye shadow I was
taking on a trip and I pinned myself
down to only using these shades you can
really come up with a lot of varieties
so I think that one's a lot of fun it's
filled with good basics and this is the
one that's been around the longest then
we've got the petite pro tube which is
quite different and I want to set this
aside for a second and actually talk
about the newest one in comparison with
the first because these two have a lot
of similarities that I think need to be
pointed out this is the newest fatigue
Pro and at a glance like just seeing it
really tiny on the website I thought
wait there's that same palette or they
just re releasing it changed a couple
shades no I can tell you every shade in
here is different but there are
similarities there is closeness and I
would say the bottom line difference
between this one and this one is your
preference for greens if you really
don't think you'll ever wear like a
spring green or a forest green you might
go toward this palette there here in
place of that kind of a shade they're
giving you a gold you've got more of a
strong copper and in this palette there
is no gold your Capri shade is a little
bit more of a dusty bronze you're still
getting a purple which is a little bit
more vibrant I would say in this newest
palette it's more of an orchid and then
you've got the spring green this really
dark forest green this brown right here
seems to have maybe
a little plum mixed in absolutely love
this crease color here it's a little bit
on the rosy side kind of a rosy taupe
you've got a nice soft matte pink that's
great for highlighting under the brow
and then this beautiful shimmer up here
as well it's kind of like slightly pinky
champagne colors so again looking at
these two palettes side by side if you
love the idea of grains you might go for
this one if you say I'm really not gonna
wear those I'd prefer going more gold
I'd like more of a standout copper in
there and maybe you'd prefer that purple
to be just a bit richer and deeper if
that's your preference you might go for
the first one but they're both good
palettes all of these petite pros I do
like but I feel like my favorite that
I'm really becoming attached to is this
one and it is reminding me a lot of like
the Too Faced romantic eye that also had
tones of purple and also green and I
just really fallen in love with the
looks that I've done with this and as I
will point out in the demo you know you
can forego these brightest shades and
have a very very natural wearable
everyday palette but I think it's so fun
to have that beautiful ton of purple and
also the green and this dark forest
green alongside that when you layer
those up on the lid it's just absolutely
stunning so I am a huge huge fan of the
latest petite Pro release but now let's
back it up and go back to the petite Pro
2 which I think launched pretty soon
after the tryst palette and for a time I
was getting quite a few questions like
which should I get because I had used
the triste palette and like a get ready
with me video and then this came out to
me the petite Pro - it's like all the
shades of tryst just rich and up you
know like instead of just getting a
peach you're getting a bright coral
instead of getting this kind of burgundy
shade you're getting a real true rich
purple like kind of purple plum and all
of the shimmers where you're getting
some that are a little more peachy a
little more golden in the triste palette
everything is more along the lines of a
rose you know you look at this entire
shimmery row and everything's kind of
got some element of rosiness when is
this really cool ultra shimmery pink
it's a great statement shade one has a
little bit more purple infused in it
is the most reddish and then you've got
this kind of warm shimmery pink here and
then on your next row we've got kind of
a yellowy peach I'd call that your
bright coral a true Brown like a milk
chocolate brown and then the plumy
purple and my one complaint about this
pallid that maybe takes it just down a
notch versatility wise compared to the
others is that when I am looking for
that one perfect kind of medium shade to
set up my crease I feel like I have to
mix this with the coral or this shade
with the brown just to lighten it up a
little bit and it's not like it's that
hard and it's not a big problem but I'm
just pointing that out to you that these
shades are all pretty intense so when
you do start applying them to the crease
they really show they have a lot of
pigmentation and it might be a bit of a
struggle if you like to work your way up
slowly and also everything in this role
I guess it has some element of pinky
rosiness to it and so I think it's a
little less versatile than these other
two petite pros where the shades seem to
kind of be bouncing all over you got a
gold you got a copper you got a purple
you got a green when I pick up this
palette my looks tend to fall along the
same kind of look most of the time just
given the way I'm comfortable putting
these shades together like it always
ends up being a very similar look not
always identical but I just don't find
it to be quite as versatile as these
other two because the shades just don't
bounce around as much however I do like
it more than the triste palette because
I think the color intensity is so
beautiful with some of those mats and
you know don't get me wrong the shimmers
are great as well you can in a pinch I
have used this shade here in my crease
it's the one that looks like it's got
the most purple going on in there and
that can work alright
but these shades are pretty darn
metallic in that row so keep that in
mind but what I want to show you now is
a little how to using the most recent
petite Pro I wanted to just talk you
through the look because I do feel like
sometimes with these tutorials a quick
voiceover is nice but then there are
other times where like stuff pops into
my head and I feel like as I'm reviewing
something it might be helpful for you to
know is so I'm just going to cut to that
and then we'll wrap it all up first
shade I'm going to use is
this very like soft kind of light rosy
Brown and I'm gonna get that going in my
crease I just think it's a perfect
crease color it's a great place to start
no matter what ultimate direction you
end up wanting to go with the palette
builds up very quickly easily and it's
just a good depth level
I'm gonna take this light shade right
here pick up a bit of that it's kind of
like a soft I don't know just off light
with a little pink apply that is my
highlight and then I'm going to do some
purple on the lid and this is a really
pretty like orchid take on purple it's
got a little bit of a metallic nature to
it I think it's really beautiful
I'm getting that all over the lid and
leaving just a tiny gap kind of right at
the innermost and outermost corners
around the inner corner I'm going to be
using this brush called the e 47 from
Sigma it's a really nice brush for
little detailed areas or if I ever like
go back at the end of a look like I've
already got eyelashes and stuff on and I
just want to intensify my shadow in one
area this is really nice for that
because it doesn't cover too much
surface area so if you don't want to get
a bunch of powdery shadow on your
eyelashes or whatever or you just want
to apply to a really small zone it's
great for that so I'm going to use this
shimmery kind of pearly shade here and I
love the way this works around the inner
corner and just kind of pull it up onto
a little bit of that purple
then we've got this shade over here
which is a little bit complex sometimes
it feels more brownish to me maybe it's
just if I'm layering it over like the
purple like this I see a little more
plum come out of it but we're going to
take that really rich deep color there
and just dab it on the outer corner and
it will really feel like a plum when
you're going on top of the purple so
just sort of go little by little padding
that on focusing on the outer corner you
can flip your brush around and intensify
more up into the crease and then we can
go through and blend that out but it
only takes a little bit of these shades
to get the impact and another high point
about these is definitely the staying
power like you can see we've got some
definite colors in here we've got some
greens and purple and you will notice
those shades throughout the day a lot of
times colors can even with a good
eyeshadow primer you might notice some
colors D tense' fiying just a little bit
and these I do feel like at least on my
eyes they stay very true to the color I
expect them to be so now that I've done
that little bit of deepening up there
I'm just going to take that original
brush that I used in my crease and kind
of run over that outer corner
and if you feel like you've lost any
purple in this process just dab a little
on with your finger you know if you're
wanting to really Center it in there in
the middle of the lid just dab it on
also I was thinking I might try some of
this shade it's kind of a dusty copper
it's not over-the-top warm but it's kind
of pretty when you use it kind of like a
transition just out over the edge of a
look
especially I'll look what the purpley
stuff there really looks pretty with
that
now on the lower lash line I think I am
gonna utilize the greens in here and get
myself a greenish pop there normally I
feel like I steer toward this green for
the lid just because I really like that
shade and it's just a nice way to
showcase it but I'm gonna try it on the
lower lash line today I'm gonna pick
some up with my e21 smudge brush from
Sigma and even just in a small little
zone it still has impact it's not like a
wild lime-green it's just as soft you
know the trees are just starting to get
their leaves kind of green when we went
to Destin and we started to get further
and further south on our Drive like this
color really took over because we didn't
have a lot of leaves on the trees where
I live and then you know the whole South
was starting to look like this then
I'm gonna take this really rich forest
green and I'm gonna work that in on my
outer corner and just kind of allow that
to come in and overlap slightly with the
spring green
it's really pretty if you do this
technique on the lids as well and just
go you know the shimmery green over most
of the lid and then your dark forest
green in the outer corner you know it's
a very logical way to go about it but it
does look good
but don't feel pressured like okay every
time I use this palette I have to use
the purple and the green and find a way
to make it work no you could you could
really forego those two sort of
statement colors and look you've got a
really nice pretty natural easy palette
just without the purple in green but
they're fun pops and if you value that
that's kind of why you might want to
look toward the petite Pro as opposed to
just a theory palette because with the
theory palettes you can now get absinthe
which goes a green route or if you
really like the coppers and warm shades
you can get minx if you like Purple's
you can get amethyst but if you like the
mix that's kind of where the petite Pro
comes in and I just think it's a good
way to try the brand and experiment with
this level of quality of eyeshadow okay
so I'm going to stop there I'm going to
kind of complete the look with some
light liner in the lower inner rim and
I'll line my upper lash line and stuff
but as far as shadow goes that's where
we're gonna leave it and I'm really
happy with it
so there you can see the finished look
with some light liner in the lower inner
rim I've done black liner across the
upper lash line and these lashes across
the top these are some of those kiss
blowout lashes I think they're in the
style Shenyang but sometimes you might
think about straying away from a lash at
all when you really want a spotlight
your eye shadow look because lashes can
kind of cover them up but a style like
this that's not super dense is actually
I think going to bring attention to the
eyes but still let the shadow definitely
peek through so in conclusion everyone I
think these petite Pro palates look I'm
holding all three and it's like nothing
here I think these are a great value
it's a great way to sample the quality
of visi our shadows it's nice to always
know that you're gonna get that half
Matt 1/2 shimmer split and I think
they're all beautiful palettes I really
do like them all if I had to pick a
favorite which is always what the
question it comes down to when I'm doing
these videos somebody will ask like well
what one do you actually like this I
really like this one because I am a fan
of greens I do like the little splash of
purple in there and everything else all
the little supporting cast members here
are so nice even just on their own so
it's a really beautiful color palette
still really love the original and if
you have this and you're like the greens
just don't appeal to me just stick with
this because there are a lot of like
things happening between the first one
and the third line the wild part in the
middle you know if you're kind of a fan
of plums and the peaches to me at a
glance I would have thought maybe this
would be my absolute favorite one but
ultimately I feel like it's probably the
least versatile out of all three but the
shades are really gorgeous just in
themselves and again if you have all
three or if you just have a couple you
can switch shades out you can pop them
out and give yourself a different color
combination there it's totally up to you
but they are super durable super travel
friendly and I really appreciate that so
let me know what you guys think if
you've tried any of those which one's
your favorite thank you so much for
taking time to watch and I will see you
again very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
