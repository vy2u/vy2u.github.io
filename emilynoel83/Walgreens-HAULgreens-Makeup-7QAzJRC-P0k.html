from Walgreens I think I'm gonna start
pulling it Whole Grains
I like the sound of that anyway I've got
some new makeup and skincare and I just
got some of this stuff yesterday so some
of that I have used some of it I haven't
actually something I did use just last
night was this new mask it's yes to
cucumbers soothing calming facial masks
and you don't get a whole lot of product
here it's kind of a smallish tub but it
does have kind of a fresh cucumber type
scent and you just leave it on your face
for five minutes
so I did that last night and let me tell
you soon as I washed it off I thought
man this is looking nice and smooth and
bright and I just loved it it was just a
nice little pick-me-up if you're ever
doing like a spa day or you know taking
a bath and sometimes I take a bath and
you know you got the face mask all this
is a nice one umm it is kind of pricey
though I think this was around twelve
dollars and I wouldn't normally pay that
but I have had good luck with the yes to
cucumbers like face wipes those have
been good and a Tyler and I have both
liked the face wash so I thought I was
wanting to try a new mask and I do like
this a lot pick up some Altoids
I get very paranoid in the mornings
drink coffee before the newscast and I
know like the viewers can't smell my
breath duh but my co-anchor can and like
I don't like coffee breath and so I try
to never have coffee breath so that's
why I find the strongest mint possible
which I believe is Altoids and keep
those like in my purse or in my desk
these are the no-slip grip and I think
these have been around for a while but I
just haven't tried this particular kind
but it has like this rubbery like little
rubbery teeth or grooves or whatever in
the inside of these clips and I really
find that whenever I'm home and I'm not
doing a video or sometimes when I am
doing a video I just want to throw my
hair up into a bun or get it out of my
face like that's probably what I'm gonna
do at the end of this video is throw it
up into one of these clips but these
were marked down and they were like
right beside some just standard clips
that were like 2 bucks more and then
these were marked down to like 2
dollars in something and they have the
no-slip grip so I'm totally gonna try
those and see if it makes you know the
quick bun a little bit easier the almay
products we're buy one get one 50% off
so I picked up another one of my
favorite and get up and groan mascaras
love the brush on that as you can see I
haven't even taken it out of the
packaging but I love this mascara and so
many of you who have tried it say you
love it too so I got blackest black and
I do not want to be without that one so
um I got some of these little oil free
eye makeup remover pads which can be
really quick and convenient if you are
sitting down to do your makeup and
you've totally you know remove your
makeup wash your face or whatever but
you look at yourself and you're like is
it what's that there and you just want
to remove it these really thin wipes for
eye makeup are really good also and
they're just little rounds to I mean
there's nothing to them really but
something else that I figured out these
are good for is to clean off your false
eyelashes you'd like take one of the
little rounds make a taco out of it put
your false lashes in and then kind of
squeeze and just let that removers start
to break down the mascara that's on the
lashes and then just kind of pull it out
rub it off a little bit and it's like it
really does a good job of cleaning off
the lashes yeah now has a kiss of
strawberry I haven't even tried this yet
I haven't taken the little seal off even
why don't we do that now have the kiss
of cherry and I know I love that and
this can't be that different color wise
I'm sure but I just I really like the
Nivea lip balms even just the one that I
think is it's in like a light blue tube
and it's like kiss of smoothness oh it
smells so good alright that's what it
looks like it smells like a delicious
strawberry popsicle just so we can
compare and see how different they are
yeah this one's more of like a raspberry
looking red and this one's like more red
red tomatoey
lip gloss I'm wearing now is new it is
one of the Revlon Super Lustrous lip
glosses and the shade is called pink
pursuit I believe and it's just kind of
a nice shimmery Pam wearing kind of a
neutral II like dark green little
cardigan today I'm very
falta day but I like this pink with it
because it's like okay I want to wear
pink but I don't want it to steal the
show because I'm wearing some olive here
on the eyes I'm loving these new
products from Maybelline two new color
tattoos that I picked up
they had this display and there were
several limited edition colors and I got
two of those one is barely beige and
this is what I have kind of around the
tear duct area the other light shade
that they used to have that I think is
part of the regular line is like a total
white and this is not quite as stark
white and it just makes a really nice
pearly colored base so that's that one
underneath my whole look is this olive
color called
mossy green this is so pretty it's a
really deep dark green and I just kind
of thought I don't have any cream shadow
in my collection probably that's quite
like that really just a beautiful olive
and I'm so gonna be getting into greens
for fall I just have a feeling I love
the look I love the look this created
but I topped it off with some shadows so
that's what's given it like the real
major shimmer here I got one of the
limited edition of quads the eye studio
quads in smokey cinnamon so this is what
I'm wearing today I've got the light
shade on the inner corner this shade is
like the game-changer this kind of
yellowish green really brightens up the
look right in here so like the inner
part there I put that one and then I put
the deep green on the outer half and
blended some of this
I guess the actual cinnamon shade here I
kind of blended that above a little bit
I love the look put the smokey green
below ah love these are really great
shadows and this one just I mean these
colors this light green and the dark
green work wonderfully to get one that I
picked up that I didn't try is called
all of martini and if you're familiar
with Too Faced this shade is just like
the shade they called label whore it's
like a brownish blue color like
depending on how the lights hitting it
looks totally different so you've got
like a
white color kind of an icy blue that
weird bluish brown and then a deep sort
of rusty brownish burgundy color here
are some swatches this is the olive
martini kit which it really doesn't look
that all of it's more like kind of
burgundy brown see how that looks bluish
brownish it's interesting so that's this
quad and then my other quad the one I'm
wearing all these shades right now and
my eyes is this and this one is again
smoky cinnamon I think I'm definitely
going to do a smoky cinnamon tutorial
because I love the look of that created
there again along with the color tattoos
so in the display they had like bad to
the bronze which is part of the regular
line they had a gold shade and then they
had a brownish color but I got these two
it was the beige and the mossy green so
um that that's my hull guys every now
and then I just got to go crazy in
Walgreens and this is what happens so
thank you so much for watching have a
great day and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
