again
guys remember when I did this I am I've
been in here or more ago and I titled it
Walgreens haul grains and thought I was
really clever well I've come up with
more products from Walgreens and just
figured I'd give it the same title but I
do have some Ulta thanks a few Ulta
things to tell you about as well now for
the classic haul disclaimer this was not
all purchased in one shopping trip this
was purchased during multiple shopping
trips I love what everybody says that in
a whole video because you know it's
gonna happen and I'm like waiting for it
and I get excited when it happens but
anyways I sing a brand new thing that I
hadn't even seen advertised yet but I
just found it at Walgreens and is the
covergirl plus Olay I rehab two-in-one
brightening concealer and chances are
you've seen the foundations that look
like this only they're taller and it
does have that swirled thing going on
and I do like that it has a little pump
thing I haven't used it yet but there's
a look at the product and it just has
you know a really thin texture it seems
like I really get the feeling that this
isn't necessarily gonna be a full
coverage type product but more just a
brightening product so I can't wait to
try that like I said it is brand new to
me so I will definitely be testing it
out in the coming days and let you know
how that goes so this I okay I've seen
this in ads people have told me this was
great that Vaseline spray and go
moisturized I just thought what you know
what's the deal why do we now need a
spray-on moisturiser isn't can't you
just pump it out of the bottle you know
but after getting this and taking the
plunge I got the cocoa butter thing sent
here I realized that it's really a
difference in formula that's in this can
it's not just the fact that you know you
twist this and then you like spray it on
and bam and then you rub it in but it's
a really thin consistency for a for a
moisturizer for a lotion a lot of mine
are thicker they do take a little bit
longer not only to blend in but to
actually feel like they've sunk
into your skin somewhat and this one you
know like I just rubbed it into my arm
here and now my arm while it feels
moisturized it definitely does not feel
like there's anything kind of sitting on
the surface of my skin so I must say I
really do like this and I just love the
ability to like spray it on really fast
and and rub it in you're good so and I
do like the cocoa butter scent if you if
that's a scent that you know you like
you will probably like this one I've
told you guys how much I enjoy the
Milani shadow eyes they are long wearing
shadow sticks from the drugstore and
there's a limited edition set up out now
and I'm I'm not sure how much longer
it's gonna be around because I did see
it a few times here recently but it's
all neutrals
some are shimmery some are more just
creamy shades I got a couple of the
creamier ones because the ones I already
had were a little bit you know colorful
and shimmery and bright and so I got a
couple of basics one is almond cream and
if you're wanting that totally neutral
kind of skin tone base with no shimmer
in it that's that's what that shades
gonna give you and these absolutely like
you have a little playtime you have some
time to rub it out and blend it out with
your finger if you want but then it is
gonna set and it's not gonna budge so
that's something to keep in mind so
there's the light one and then I got
cafe au lait and this one is going to be
your creamy brown and so that one looks
like that again no shimmer in either of
these and I just thought you know a lot
of the green shadow products I have the
vast majority are you know pretty
metallic or sparkly in some way so I
thought it would be nice to have just a
couple of basics now this thingy here is
not a jumbo shadow stick but is a liner
it's the L'Oreal voluminous smoldering
eyeliner and I got this because of a new
blog I discovered it's called mascara
I'll put it down here so you can see the
spelling of it but the girl who does the
blog her name is Kara and she's got
great just great tips here and there she
just awesome before and after work she's
a makeup art and I just
her blog I think I just read and read
and read you know something that she was
recommending was this liner and it is a
really smooth creamy liner here you go
see how long like that point is it goes
on real easily I'm as far as staying
power I've won this a few times and I do
think I noticed a little bit of fading
like just putting it on my upper lash
line you know no no false eyelashes on
top of it or anything and I I feel like
the black intensity can fade a little
bit my waterline as well
not amazing staying power there either
but this is a really nice like liner to
smudge out and smoke out and you know do
different smudgy liner tricks with us
don't maybe rely on it as your most
hard-core staying power black line or a
few lip products the maybelline color
whispers I really like these
I love how I've said this before but one
shade can give you I feel like multiple
looks you put them on sheer but you can
totally build them up to have a little
more color intensity and they feel so
light I just love it I love how the
consistency is not too slick you it
really feels like it is clinging to your
lips but not in an uncomfortable or
annoying way so I love these and I've
got really mostly a lot of lighter
colors um some of the brighter ones like
pin-up peach is a nice coral rose of
attraction has a little more color to it
but I really hadn't looked at the deeper
end of the ring I got let's see this
dark one is called very ready and it
looks like this it's a really pretty
color there it's definitely just a rich
berry I sense quite a bit of red in that
as now I swiped over that a couple times
but if I just did it once you could see
how see the the variance there in color
so you could get that kind of a look or
that kind of a look other one here is
called mad for magenta beautiful I've
worn this one several times this has a
little bit more of a purple tone in it
than
I am typically accustomed to wearing but
I like it and so I'll do a sheer swatch
and then a more concentrated swatch of
that look how that could not look more
like just a classic pink right right
there and the sheer swatch but in the
opaque swatch I've got a pink with a
little bit of cool you know purple tone
in it I love it it's really pretty more
lip thing and I mentioned loving the
texture of the color of whispers you
know not too slick
this texture I've blogged about these
these caress lip colors from L'Oreal and
I feel like they are just a little
slippery for my liking but this color
just really caught my eye this bright
pinky coral I am wearing it today I put
it on kind of sheer actually I didn't
wanted to clash too much with whatever
was going on on my shirt but it is a
little bit buildable check out my blog
to see my full you know post on these
things but that's what that shade looks
like I think it's very pretty very
summery again I wish like I could have
that exact color in the color whisper
but um it's still still nice and I'm
getting definitely going to use it okay
Ulta revlon baby stick
I believe the shade on this one was
sunset but it does not any longer have
that name on there what the heck are
they supposed to do something I even saw
these it's like an editor's favorite in
a magazine I thought what there are
these these are good it's supposed to be
good look you think maybe okay this is a
lip and cheek thing it's gonna give me
that beautiful color
okay I'm gonna swatch it on my hand and
see what it looks like okay what it's
like I cannot make this show up on my
face you have lip smackers you know they
they have a color to them but they
usually don't show up with much color on
your on your face on your lips it's the
same deal here you know they've given
you this gorgeous what seems to be like
a like a tangerine reddish color and
then you try to you know put it on and I
don't get it I mean I don't know it's
there faintly I thought this was gonna
be really cool I had heard people
buzzing about these made it like him
found him yet everybody was kind of
looking for them and I just thought that
was a big fat letdown except it's just a
little baby stick so I guess it can't be
big oh it's a newfound favorite favorite
thing love this so much this is
Physicians Formula the matte shadow quad
in quartz quartet I use this in my
latest get ready with me video
absolutely love the looks this can
create fantastic basics I love that this
shows almost light blue this is kind of
like a a little bit of like a deep dusty
rose they're beautiful they blend
together nicely I have the canyon Club
Canyon classic squad and I like that one
too
but I think I might even like this one a
little bit better the coolness in these
shades and I think with a primer they
have awesome staying power to remember
that mascara blog I talked about and she
had a whole thing pointing out exactly
every single reason why she loves this
next palette and like specifically like
down to each individual shade what each
shade was awesome what was great about
it and it's the Stila in the light
eyeshadow palette I'm not quite sure why
I didn't give this more of a look you
know just in general I got this on Ulta
online by the way and it comes with a I
believe it's called a smudge stick is
that what a smudge stick waterproof
eyeliner in damsel but all these neutral
shades Matt Matt Matt Matt and Matt so
one two three four Matt basics and then
some pretty like this shade these two
I've used together and loved this is a
very interesting shade here too with a
little bit of blue tie haven't really
dug into cela eyeshadows in quite a
while and so I think I kind of lost
sight of how good the quality in ahead
and just decided to swatch them for you
so you can just get a look at it but
really nice shades love the mattes the
shimmers are nice too I don't feel like
they're overly
you're not getting a bunch of glitter or
Sparkle you know even the shimmery
shades are more like you know pearly
metallic finish as opposed to something
with a lot of glitter and I hope you
enjoyed the whole I hadn't done one in a
while so I thought it was about time and
with some of these things I know I sort
of reviewed them for you others I could
definitely give you more information on
as I try them more so always check my
blog that's community broadcast net I do
a lot of extra reviews there you can see
certain products used in like face of
the day posts and stuff like that so I
try to keep that updated really
regularly so thanks for watching and
I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
