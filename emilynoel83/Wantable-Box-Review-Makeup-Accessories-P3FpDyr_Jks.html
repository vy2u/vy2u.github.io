about my experience with one table and I
mentioned this in my things I got for
Christmas video this was a gift from
Tyler I did not even know this
particular subscription box service
existed until he like sent the little
email to my inbox that said you've been
given a gift for one table but now I've
gotten two different boxes in so I
thought it might be a good time to let
you know what I've been thinking about
this stuff in a nutshell I think what
makes one table different from a lot of
subscription boxes is that you are kind
of customizing what you get in your box
and it's kind of like the excitement of
getting sort of a grab bag I'm not
exactly sure what's going to be in there
surprise but you're able to give it a
little bit of direction with your own
preferences so there are different
categories and I think the clothing
related ones cost a little bit more so
there's style fitness intimates
and then makeup and accessories the
makeup box was the first one that I
chose and then the other one I'll be
talking about in this video is the
accessories some early detailed surveys
where you identify things as love like
or dislike so for example I don't
dislike eyeliner or nail polish but I
wasn't really looking to get anymore of
those items so I marked them as dislike
in this box because they tell you you'll
never receive any products you dislike
it will only come from the love's I
guess preferably Belov's
or the like section so for the first
month I got the makeup box which was $40
the accessory box as well $40 this can
be given as a gift like I said that was
what it was for me or you could choose
to buy this yourself and I do have a
link below that link if you do use it
you don't have to use it but it does
kick back a little bonus to me but
that's not like exclusive to me I'm in
no kaput so with wonderful on this video
that link is something anybody gets if
they sign up to this you could sign up
and then share your link with your
friends and then I think it gives you
maybe a little credit toward a future
box but this is what the box looks like
I'm going to tell you about the makeup
one first it's kind of small and when
you open it up it's got this little nice
to see you gorgeous and then you've got
this little pamphlet that explains all
of the things like a little packing
sheet of what was put in your box it
says January makeup collection
hand-picked for me on the inside
we hope you'll love your collection but
if not returns are always free simply
visit your order history to begin the
return process and then it kind of
reminds you of what your preferences
were so it says everything that I marked
love on which were a lot of different
things I mark love on the base makeup
eye shadow highlight blush lip color
tools and there were even some more
specific things that you could share
your preferences on for all that and
then under like I put skin care brows
lash product bronzer dislike eyeliner
nail polish and I of course love all
that makeup but I just wanted to adjust
what I said here in accordance with the
things I hoped I would actually get in
the box
there's a little note here from Miranda
I guess she's the stylist she says hello
Emily thank you for letting me know your
preferences I've selected some great
items for you this month I hope you
enjoy so I have five different products
in this makeup box three of those items
actually came from the same brand which
considering this is all about sampling
you know and getting different things I
was really surprised by that and a
little disappointed not that I really
disliked the products so much but I was
surprised because I marked so many
things as either being alike or a love
it seemed like I opened it up for a lot
of different ways they could go with
this but I got three things from the
brand Elizabeth Mott never heard of that
brand before but I'm getting exposed to
it now I have no problem with that but I
just it would have been kind of cool to
have gotten less things from all one
brand so one of those things is called
tints and sass tints and sass you heard
that right this is the fabulous lip and
cheek stain it says and this was one of
my favorite things in the box actually
if you're familiar with the stain I
think it's called stain e AK from the
balm it's kind of like a gel staying in
here so whereas Benetint is a
straight-up liquid that's a little more
gel like you pull it out with the wand
applicator and you can apply it on the
lips I'm wearing it today as a stain on
my lips I love a beautiful rosy stained
lips so this is really pretty in that
way in a recent video I think on the
vlog Channel I was wearing it as a blush
I thought it was gorgeous as a blush I
might like it even better as a blush
compared to benefits Benetton Benetton
is very much a sheer red the
it has a little bit more of a cooler
pinky tone in it but I think it's
gorgeous I'll continue to use that I
enjoy it I also got an Elizabeth Mont I
shadow and antique brass and this is a
really interesting shade I was wearing
this
also in that vlog and it's cool because
it's a great one shadow look type of
shape when I first looked at it I
thought okay it's just a medium bronze
but a lot of green comes out of this
color it looks kind of one-way packed on
the lid a different way sheared out into
the crease and I think it's really
pretty it's a really nicely textured
shadow it's creamy without being cream
if you know what I mean it didn't kick
up a lot of Fallout in application so I
liked how you go from looking kind of
dark like it would in this concentrated
swatch to sheared out and looking a
little different so that was a good
product to third Elizabeth Mott thing
was this all-over shadow brush I'm not
saying this can't pack shadow on the lid
but I like something a little bit
flatter than that to get the job done
just because I feel like this gives me a
bit more diffused color I have parent at
a time or two with that particular
shadow that came with this set and you
know it does okay it's not my favorite
thing it's kind of nice wedged up into
the crease actually feels like a nice
quality brush but I feel kind of
take-it-or-leave-it about that one you
know a brand I've never tried anything
for him before his face Stockholm and
this is the powder foundation I guess
the shade is late March and the shade is
dead-on for me I was really kind of
surprised you've got a sponge down here
and then your power is in this pan and
this normally retails for $38 this is
great for normal oily and even dry skin
and they say it can be used wet or dry I
love the texture it really reminds me of
that great textured benefit powder is it
hello flawless I think so and this just
feels so buttery and nice and I've worn
it on my skin it's a really mattifying
powder I think it's got good staying
power I mean this and this these are
probably my top two things in this
little collection the lipstick that I
got that's the final thing in this box
this is the lip teeny pink champagne
lipstick it's from teeny Beauty pink
champagne is peachy pink brimming with
gold shimmer do I generally like
lipsticks brimming with any kind of
shimmer not so much
this isn't a bad shade like it's a very
workable shade I think for a lot of
people I'm just not a big fan of the
frosty lipsticks and that's basically
what this is peachy pink golden shimmer
does have some shine on the lips feels
pretty comfortable on the lips but this
is regularly gonna retail for $18 just
one of those mint products for me
so I would say I ended up with two
things in this makeup kit that I loved
one that you know I really liked that
was a solid product the eye shadow and
two things that were kind of like take
it or leave it with the brush and the
lipstick nothing I absolutely disliked
so I guess they succeeded and not giving
me anything I dislike really my one
critique of this would be I hope that
the next time I try this because I do
plan to get another makeup box I hope
there will be more variation in the
brands that they give me now as far as
my accessories box goes I am wearing
almost everything that came in that box
it came packaged with that little guy
you've also got your description of
everything and with the exception of one
thing that came in a little pouch all of
the jewelry was really nicely and safely
put in this box so I pulled out like a
couple of pieces of foam and there were
some earrings like put in there and the
necklace was really nicely draped in
there so it wouldn't get all tangled up
so very good packaging that these
pendant it's not over packaged but it's
definitely enough to keep things from
breaking and getting messed up so in
this set I ended up with four things
again it totals out at $40 and it says
the total value of this collection was
$77 and the things that I marked as
loving or gold-tone classic like they
had all these different styles you could
choose from
bracelets necklaces and scarves and I
don't think I marked anything is just
like I had like on silvertone multi-tone
glam rock and roll both open patch
earrings rings watches sunglasses and
hair accessories so I was pretty wide
open with this one and I loved
everything really happy with all the
stuff first off these little earrings
these are so cute they're the Laura
studs in gold they do have like the
tiniest little border of pearls and then
I guess some rhinestone and then it's
just open right in the center and I
think those are so cute I love studs
that's really the easiest kind of ear
ring for me to wear most of the time and
I think these can look dressy I think
they can look really nice and casual
also just a fun little twist on what I
might normally wear so that was an
absolute hit also this double necklace
this is the Aurora double necklace gold
it says and at first looking at it in
the box just the way it was laying there
I thought it was just one necklace that
you know latched all together in the
back but this is two separate necklaces
the rose gold is this open triangle and
that one does have an adjuster on the
back and then you've got this little
gold triangle and I love that I love the
subtlety of this this is very much my
style you can wear just one or both of
them together I could see myself
layering this gold one with a lot of
other gold jewelry that I have this by
the way is valued at $18 valued at $24
is my Isabel bracelet in gold it says
this bracelet features a glam center
stone on a leather band and I'm just
wearing this on the outside of my shirt
so you can see it today how fun is this
it's got this little snap closure there
is a larger adjustment on that as well
and then I just think that is so
beautiful I love the design I mean it's
fun but it's still all in the neutral
family so you feel like you could wear
this with so many different you know
tops outfits it has kind of a vintage
vibe to it but I love that it's on this
little leather band so very cool I
wouldn't have expected to get that but I
love it and then the final thing that I
got the one thing I'm not wearing is
from House of Harlow and it's the
sunburst drop earring just love the
little red accent there on the stud part
and then dropping down you've got that
really fun dangle they don't feel heavy
at all which is my pet peeve with a lot
of dangly earrings so I love the gold I
think it would be fun for a dressy
occasion or just really casual for
something different but all in all I
would say I was even more excited about
the accessories collection that I got
than the makeup collection even though
the makeup collection had a couple of
you know really cool things in there
the accessories set
surprised me a lot I would definitely do
accessories again I would try makeup
again as well if any of you guys have
done like the fitness stuff or the
clothes or the intimates let me know how
that worked out for you in the comments
section and maybe we can help one
another out here a little bit but all in
all I would say my experience with one
table so far has been a good one I feel
like the survey actually does work you
know the thought that you're going to
give some preferences they're going to
stick to some of these things and
hopefully those turn out to be things
that you like it really turned out that
way for me like this video if you
enjoyed it let me know if you'd like to
see more of what I end up getting from
one table that thing is that's kind of
tricky about it as I can't be like oh I
loved everything in my box you can get
my exact box too because it's gonna be
different person to person and I think
different times of year as well they'll
probably have access to different things
that they put in the boxes I still
wanted to give you my little individual
reviews of the things in case you wanted
to track down some of these items or you
know you're just interested in general
thank you guys so much for your time and
I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
