so excited for this tutorial like this
look I mean this look is my baby I love
this look so much it's using the lorac
unzipped palette gorgeous palette full
of neutrals pretty mom's Burgundy's rose
gold I mean it's just an amazing neutral
palette those matte and shimmer and
metallic shade hold it warm and cozy
because that's just the way it makes me
feel you know it's neutral it's just a
very inviting soft look but yet you know
paired with the lashes and a little bit
of winged liner I think it just is the
cherry on top so I hope you like this
look and here's how to do it so I'm
starting out with my Milani eyeshadow
primer I'm just gonna get a little bit
of that on my finger and blend that all
over my lid up to my brow then in the
unzipped palette I'm going to the
lightest shade this is called under
cover it's got a little bit of a satiny
finish kind of a white creamy color
going right around that inner corner
with my Sonia Kashuk small shadow brush
and then I'm going to Pat that all over
the inner part of my lid I'm going to go
about half way in with this then I'm
going to unbridled this is a really
really rich Burgundy and this is a matte
shade I'm just gonna start patting that
on my outermost corner oops didn't dab
it on the brush there there we go and
Pat it on the outer part of your lid and
then bring it in and kind of start to
overlap that white then I'm going to
flip my brush over and I'm using that
same burgundy shade and I'm wedging it
right in my crease so I get you know the
most intense deep color right there in
my crease and I'm going about 3/4 of the
way in with that brush still with the
Burgundy I'm taking now a fluffier brush
so I can get a little different kind of
application of the color and I'm still
going back and forth in the crease with
this maybe just working up slightly
higher than the crease
now then right next to unbridled is a
matte shade called unconditional and
with that going right over the border of
Burgundy then I'm taking my little wispy
brush here my e36 and I'm going to
unattainable right here this actually
comes off as a really pretty like rose
gold shade so get a little bit of that
on your brush and I'm going from my very
inner corner I'm going even further in
with this then I did with the other
deeper shades so starting right in here
and then take it I'm kind of right on
top of where you put that moth oh so
pretty like we've had a lot of matte
shades where hand here and now here's
the blue then as a highlight we're going
back to this shade which is under cover
can never remember that name separate
fluffy brush and I'm going right up
under the brow now brow now start
working on the lower lash line in a
second but first I'm going to do some
liquid liner this is the elf liquid
eyeliner in black to start this right
here in the innermost corner and take it
all the way across the lash line and
then I'm doing just a small wing with
this look so you can see it's nothing
too big but we are going to come out
from the eye slightly here in my
waterline I'm using my M from Michelle
Phan water liner and this is in jet
black is that the shade black night and
I'm going to go right in my lower inner
rim here on the actual skin on your
lower lash line getting a little bit of
this as well and then just bring it up
to meet your black liquid liner here
just applying this on the outside not
taking this pencil liner all the way in
then I'm going in to unbridled that
Burgundy that we were using earlier and
I'm using an angled brush and I'm going
right under that wing so on the bottom
of the wing it's going to have a
slightly more I guess smoky look
it's not going to look quite as harsh
and black on the bottom part and then
over lapping the black with that shade
as we continue shadow inward I've got
more of a light metallic thing going on
guess what it's that gorgeous shade
called unattainable that pretty rose
gold oh so so beautiful so I'm taking a
smudge brush so I can get a little bit
you know wider application not quite as
precise of a line and overlapping what
we did on the outside and then just
pulling that shade all the way in and
when we do our lower lashes with mascara
this is going to create such a pretty
backdrop and I'm going to curl my lashes
and I'm applying my almay one coat
triple effect mascara right here my
lower lashes I need a really long
wearing look today so I'm going with the
clump crusher from covergirl and it's
the water-resistant kind so it lasts
really well without going anywhere
really did nicely at a Halloween party
last weekend so it can be trusted for
lashes i'm using the Ardell whispies
whereas the demi whispies that i use
quite often are longer at the ends these
are actually a little bit longer in the
center so I just wanted to go for a
little different look there for a full
false eyelash tutorial you know where to
go false lashes 101 placing them right
on top of my eyeliner and then securing
them at the outside and the inside so
that's the finished look I hope you guys
enjoyed it on my lips I'm using the NYX
lip liner in mahogany and I just put
that kind of on my outer parts of the
lip and then I went all over my entire
lips with the Sonia Kashuk shine luxe
sheer in the shade sheer pink lust and
so this is like kind of a pinky nude I
thought it looked really pretty on top
of the mahogany for a not too nude lip
look you know but something that would
mesh really nicely with the shades on
the eye and then for my blush um where's
my blush I was just the Jordana matte
blush and peach blossom and if you want
to see the entire like face routine
that's actually the same look from my
full coverage radiant face routine all
drugstore products
so much for watching thanks to everybody
who requested a tutorial with the lorac
unzipped palette it is an awesome
palette just so gorgeous and I really am
going to love using it throughout the
rest of the fall so I'll talk to you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
