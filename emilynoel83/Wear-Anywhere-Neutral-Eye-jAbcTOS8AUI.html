be doing a look using my new Coastal
Scents shimmer palette and it's actually
a pretty neutral look I just wanted to
you know do something just kind of
trying it out and showing you what it
can do and then I will do some more
colorful looks here soon but you can see
what the look is it's just kind of a
really easy to wear everyday look so
just because you see that that's a
really colorful palette maybe online and
whatever and in person - it really is
but it does have a nice selection of
neutral shades that I wanted to show you
about and also if you were wondering
about my lip color today I'm using my
it's L'Oreal lipstick in organza and
it's just kind of a nice warm pinky
neutral shade but it's like kind of got
got quite a bit of brown in it too but I
also am wearing on top of that my lip
licious lip color tasty lip color from
Bath and Body Works and hotcakes and
that's what's giving it that nice shine
over the top so let's go ahead and get
started with the eye tutorial scoot up a
little closer here um what we're gonna
start out by doing is putting kind of a
cream shadow based on I'm gonna use my
ELF a shadow cream in butter pecan and
I'm using this kind of peachy shade on
the side so I'm just gonna apply that
all over my lid just with my finger you
could also use a brush of course I just
find the sort of the warmth of my finger
kind of helps just melt it into my skin
a little more and applying that all over
the lid primarily but also just up into
the crease a little bit okay now that we
got that I'm going to grab my low cornel
3/8 brush here and I'm gonna get out my
palette and this is the palette by the
way I posted a picture on my blog but
it's gorgeous
and I'm gonna use I'm gonna start by
using let's see which one did I use
first
up here it is like a light shimmery
peach and I'm going to apply that first
to right on the inner corner and you can
see how I mean a little bit goes a long
way it's so nice and shimmery and then
I'm going to go down here to this shade
right here at the bottom it's sort of a
there you can see kind of a coral a a
deeper quarrel with quite a bit of
orange tone to it and I'm going to apply
that on the outer half yeah and I'm just
going to kind of work that up into my
crease as well just a bit okay so next
we're going to go for a little bit
deeper shade I'm using this sort of
right here this kind of brownish color
sort of a taupe Brown and I'm going to
just apply that sort of with this kind
of somewhat flat brush that I'm using
I'm applying it on the outer half of the
lid but also up into the crease
you know so you can see we're getting a
little more depth to the look right now
and then I'm going to take grab my
contour brush here I'm gonna take the
color right next to that which is just a
little bit more seems to be oh just a
little less shimmery perhaps and I'm
just gonna use that in the crease too
over-the-top layering is really fun with
these colors I've found okay and the
last step I'm going to take my little
more fluffy crease brush from Sephora
and I'm gonna use this shade right down
here it's kind of a a smoky plum shade
heavy on the smoky and I'm just gonna
apply this all over because it gives off
such a warm a much warmer tone than it
appears to have in the in the packaging
there so I'm just taking that all over
and you can see it's just really easy to
blend easy to use and I really like it
and I want to go just a little bit
deeper and I want some kind of
concentrated color so I'm taking that lo
Cornell brush again and I'm taking the
brownish shade one more time just to
apply a little more color right
colors are so prettyy all right and then
I'm going to just take this fluffy brush
again because it just moves the color so
well and I'm going to take that this
shade right here just a it's kind of a
peachy shade right above the one that I
put on the outer half of my lid earlier
I'm just gonna use that to go all over
up here and then I'm going to take the
very first shade I used which was pretty
light and I'm just going to concentrate
that right here so there's that part and
then the liner is pretty fun I'm going
to show you a couple different liner
products here actually I'm going to use
the FEM Couture liquid eyeliner and
Brown this came from Sally's and it's
actually really really smooth and the
color is so rich it's not like one of
those liners that you line and as you go
the line thins and gets kind of watery
it's really easy to use it has a little
brush on it and that's the perfect shade
of brown in my opinion so I'm going to
just start right on the inside and I'm
just dragging my brush right across and
you can see how fast I mean you can line
it really easily with this and I'm just
gonna extend out just a little bit
outside my regular lashes there but so
easy I mean that that was just so fast
it's just it really glides and it really
hangs together it's a nice rich shade
and then I'm gonna use my Smashbox
waterproof shadow liner and the color is
Hollywood and for this I'm going to also
use my Smashbox number 21 and little
brush eyeliner brush with the very nice
bend in it there and I'm gonna use this
just to go from the inside out and
you'll notice this is like a really soft
golden e Brown it's like a it's a really
gorgeous shade to put down under your
if you want just really soft color and
it's got a beautiful kind of shimmer to
it
I love the golden undertone it just
makes it such a unique shade and I'm
just kind of dragging that along and you
take little strokes and it sort of
smudges it out even more and I'm just
going to blend that in with what we've
done here out in the corner just sort of
connecting the two but if it doesn't
want perfectly connected this isn't it
really
this isn't near as dark as the shade we
used in liquid so don't worry if it's
not connecting you know or really like
seeming to blend with that Shay because
we're gonna go over it here in a second
with some shadow but I just love the
line that makes I mean if you look up
really close it's just it's not a really
intense line it's just it's really soft
I can feel like it's coming off dark on
my camera because my camera adds a lot
of contrast but it's still like oh just
a really pretty shade I should show you
inside there see just the gleam you get
off of that I love it but yeah it looks
light it live at some points in dark at
others I just really really am enjoying
that and then I'm gonna take my hip duo
in foxy and I'm gonna use this dark
brown shades just any you know any matte
Brown will do and I'm gonna just go over
what I just did there sort of helping to
set it but also this is a little darker
than that liner actually is alright
after that I'm going to curl my lashes
here real quick and then I'm gonna apply
some mascara I just went ahead and use
lash blast today I'm not a huge fan of
lash blast but figure I have it I'm
gonna go ahead and just use it the brush
is just so so big you do have to be
careful I've heard a lot of people say
that
it's not like the worst mascara ever or
anything I just I don't know I feel like
it was really hyped up and I wasn't
entirely like I think I had really high
expectations before I tried it was kind
of expecting maybe a little more so I'm
going in for two coats on it yeah I
think I do three I don't know I feel
like for some reason on the other side
look turned out to look a little thicker
but okay alrighty guys so there is your
look it is really warm really easy to
wear and just an example of one of the
neutral looks you can get out of the
Coastal Scents 88 shimmer palette so
thanks so much for watching guys have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
