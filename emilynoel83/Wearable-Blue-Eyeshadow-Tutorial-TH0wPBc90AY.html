this video this is going to be a
wearable blue I look so I'm you know
that may be a contradiction in terms for
some of you because you may think a blue
I don't want to go there but it really
can work out and look really nice so I
wanted to show you how I pulled it off
first real quickly before I finish up
this little intro here I wanted to thank
you guys so much for logging on to the
new facebook fan page for beauty
broadcast it's I'm just so thrilled with
how many people that have facebook have
gone on there and become a fan what you
can do is just log onto Facebook it in
that little search box type in beauty
broadcast it'll take you right to a link
to my page and you can also just visit
the link that's on the front page of my
channel in my little links box you can
get there through that but it's just
really fun i'm enjoying using that as a
way to notify you guys when I have a new
video or a new blog written up because
some people may spend more time on
Facebook than they do scanning YouTube
and so you'll see that update on your
home page and you can be like oh there's
a new video so anyway I find it really
fun so I don't know kind of a dork i
guess but anyway back to the topic of
this video on the blue I i'm using this
five color palette from be luscious you
notice the palette gives you a great
little mirror here and also five super
super pigmented colors so i'm going to
be going through and using its a four
out of the five shades in here and
creating a look that is blue but it's
also kind of soft and the great thing
about this kit is you could take this
I'm you will see when I've applied one
of the shades you can take this really
to the next level if you so desire so I
will take you through that look which is
pretty easy and doable so stick around
guys first thing we're going to do is
grab whatever eye primer you like to use
I'm enjoying the delicious shadow magnet
in light when I've got a color that I
really want
to stand out this just does a great job
of neutralizing just the color of your
natural eye lid and gives a just a
really nice base and just great for that
shadow to stick to so then I'm going to
grab might be luscious this is a five
color palette here in sky blues its
number 600 so you've got a range of blue
shades from basically white to dark navy
so I like it when a really dark color is
thrown in because it helps add some
dimension to the look but the first
thing I'm going to do is use this little
brush that they give you that you get a
double ended brush this end looks almost
like a mini concealer brush but it's a
nice flat brush you could actually do
some lining with and then this pretty
thin and kind of small shadow brush but
I like that for getting on the inside
part of my eye here so I'm going to take
on the second lightest shade which is a
light sky blue and I'm just going to
pack that onto this little brush and
you're going to see how handy that that
brush can be when we are using this blue
I mean it really can pack it on so this
is actually a really nice quality brush
it's extremely soft so that's just kind
of surprising you know when the prod of
the applicator that comes with your kit
is actually a good quality little brush
so nice to know there and then I'm going
to go ahead and use that same brush just
kind of wipe it off flip it over and go
to the center shade kind of the star of
the whole kit and it's a true blue with
um it really doesn't have any shimmer to
it it might have looks a little bit of a
pearly sheen but nothing super shimmery
on this color and you can see that this
is a vivid bright blue that you could do
all kinds of crazy work with but for us
um what I'm going to do here is use this
smallish breast you just kind of blend
the line between the light and the dark
there okay and then I'm going to come in
with a flat kind of shader brush my
Sonia Kashuk medium shadow brush pack
that blue on there actually don't have
to do much packing you lightly touch
this color and it's going to be all that
you need and more but I'm going to just
kind of go to my crease get it in there
and I'm just doing this kind of wiggling
effect just really pressing that shadow
right into the crease and then lightly
flicking it outward to work that shadow
out and you can make this blue when
we're using that Center blue shade you
can make that as intense as you want it
to or as you as you desire on what I've
done is basically just gone from outer
part of my lid got it in my crease and
then I'm gonna layer over that with a
bit a little bit of a darker shade and
you know some people say well what's the
point of layering well it can really
help the number one it can help that
darker shade go on smoother but it can
also give it a little different
dimension when you're putting one color
on top of another especially some of
these more complex shades because what
we've got here um I don't know how well
you can see but this is a very rich Navy
and it's not just your typical Navy with
like silver sparkle in it it's actually
got pink sparkle in there and that may
or may not come up on camera but if you
look at this in person it's really cool
so it's just a very different shade than
anything I've ever seen I'm going to be
taking a brush from Coastal Scents it is
this brush right here it is a small
brush that you can use to get in your
crease with I don't it actually doesn't
have the name printed on it so i will
make sure i find that for you and put
that in the sidebar info but this is a
great little brush I'm going to do more
on some brushes I like in a future video
coming up here soon but basically I'm
taking that dark blue I just described
to you and I'm working it into the outer
corner
I'm going about halfway in this is such
a soft brush and it's really great for
getting flawless flawless blending out
of even the darkest and most difficult
colors to blend like your dark navies
and blacks and whatever but as you can
see I'm working it into a very subtle
outer V I kind of did the same thing
over here it was just a matter of you
know deepening that area right in there
we're not going up super high with this
this is a color that packs some punch in
I'm just going to take this the brighter
blue shade again light light tap and
since it is a little lighter shade than
the Navy I'm just going to use that as a
buffing out color for my border there
okay and then as an all-over shade just
just too lightly kind of put up there as
a highlight this white shade i'm not a
huge fan of highlighting in stark white
but if you keep a light hand see I don't
want to make it too terribly like
unnatural now for liner I'm definitely
going to use a liquid liner on the top
lash line this one I have is the bu SS
liquid liner and this is just a nice
rich black and I want to warn you if you
happen to get your hands on this which
is which it is a great liner has great
staying power it has a little brush tip
you want to make sure that that brush
gets pretty well cleaned off like don't
pick up too much product on it when you
go to before you put it on your eye
because it can give you a little more
than you want especially if you start at
the inner corner and go out you may have
more than you want there so get it
cleaned off really well it can still
make it all the way across your eye
without you dipping back in there for
more so just know that this brush kind
of holds a lot of product
sorry holds more product than um they
like a tip like on revlon colorstay so
as you can see I'm not even worried
about going back to the tube I'm just uh
slightly widening my line towards the
end and there we go now on my bottom
lash line I hopefully didn't take the
palette too far away from you because
I'm going to go back to that gorgeous
gorgeous Navy shade there on the end and
that's going to be our liner it is so
rich and pigmented it's i love it when
shadows can work that way for you and
truly give you a liner effect and i'm
using the best liner brush that i've
ever used it is my Coastal Scents tackle
on liner brush it's an angle brush so
soft but yet so um firm and just I mean
it by soft i mean the texture of the
bristles and by firm i guess i need to
elaborate on that a little bit more I
just mean that it really hangs together
nicely it's not like a loose floppy
brush it's very dense may be the better
word to use there so I'm just taking
this color and I'm using a really light
touch and just kind of using a little
bit of a smudging movement to get it
right there in between my lashes and
just a fantastic color to use their as
your lower liner now for our lashes I'm
going to be curling my lashes and
holding that there for about 15 seconds
and then I'm going to put on this dual
ended mascara from Maybelline it's the
extensions XXL so that means I'm going
to be putting a white primer layer on my
lashes and then putting the black
overcoat and then I'm only going to put
the black overcoat on my lower lashes
I'm not going to do the bother with the
primer there so I'm going to go ahead
and do those steps and then I'll join
you with the finish all right guys
there's your finish
look a really wearable blue eyeshadow
look I kind of took it on as a personal
challenge because I'm kind of tired of
hearing people say like 80s blue
eyeshadow like it's a total don't like
you can't get away with it because you
definitely can and you know it's just
about really blending your look out
using colors that work well together you
know not just one straight color but
using a variety of tones that can mesh
well with one another and also you know
sort of keeping the rest of the face
fairly natural I use mineral makeup i
used my everyday minerals foundation in
the original glow formula which kind of
gives you more of that dewy effect I
used the salon fun blush which is a
pretty kind of peak pinky plum blush and
also the everyday bronzer all over and
then on my lips I use the Rimmel
exaggerate full color lip liner in East
End snob just a light pink and then I
topped it off with one of these new
Coastal Scents max and this shade is pet
pink it's just a creamy pink shade over
the top so I was kind of happy with that
the way that all came together the
combination of those two products so
look for more on the Coastal Scents max
in a future video and also some of these
coastal scents brushes that i enjoy but
um really star the show I mean these
these shades are just phenomenal so if
you get a chance to check out some of
these be luscious 5 color kits they're
really really great they also come with
a nice little actually usable brush in
there so thank you guys so much for
tuning in for this video and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
