this really wearable green I look it's
using some different kind of products as
using the Coastal Scents loose mica
powders that are really fun to use they
come in a variety of shades and they're
just um give off a really really unique
finish that's not glittery but somewhat
metallic and I really think that's
awesome so if you want to see how I got
this look keep on lying everyone I just
went ahead and applied my Coastal Scents
epoxy primer it's it winds up being like
a colorless primer it looks creamy in
there but it's sort of like a gel
practically put that all over my lid and
I'm going to use the couple of the
micah's from Coastal Scents this is the
Emerald Isle mica and I actually I got
it in a little packet and i went ahead
and found some of these cute little
containers they have little black lids
from um my hobby lobby's store near the
paint products and i'll probably do a
video or a blog or something on how i
did it took the label off the pouch and
just kind of cut it so it would fit
there and so now i have a much easier
way to use these so I'm pretty proud of
that so anyway I'm going to use Milo
Cornell three-eighths brush and just get
it in the product there get a little bit
on that brush and then sort of press
into the lid here just to kind of make
sure that that shadow really is on the
brush and I'm going to just apply this
all over my lid my goodness this color
these mica powders are so vibrant and
they're so fine that's the thing you're
not going to see chunks of glitter or
anything like that in these mica powders
it's a fine fine shimmer that can turn
out to give you this awesome kind of
metallic finish with some of them and I
just think that's so cool so they go on
really well just be careful when you use
them you can see I'm using really gentle
strokes more of a padding approach
rather than you know a big windshield
wiper like that so I'm just kind of make
sure it's all over the lid that's sort
of the look we're going for once you get
it on there and then I'm just blending
it up to the
a little bit you can see how it's you
know this one shade can have different
dimensions this part that's directly
hitting the light has that real
reflective quality but as you shear it
out more up in here it just kind of has
more of an all of you looks so I really
like that of the way these work so
that's the Emerald Isle mica and then
I'm going to use the camel mica and just
use that sort of as a highlight you can
see it's really really subtle I wanted
to keep it pretty sheer because I have
all this shimmer and reflective
qualities on the lid I wanted to keep
this kind of sheer but this is the camel
mica gorgeous color there I love that so
I'm going to take my Sephora rounded
crease brush get a little bit on there
just on the tip and then definitely tap
tap tap it into the lid here so there's
not too much excess and then you're
going to be able to see how we just have
this gorgeous halo of gold any color
there just right on the border love that
this would be a great at powder to these
are like multi-purpose so you could
blend this in with your favorite lotion
I think this would be gorgeous in with
your lotion and you would have this
pretty kind of dewy look but it wouldn't
be glittery so that's kind of nice
people can't quite points exactly what
they're seeing then I'm going to take my
be loved pallet in its the the five
color palette in greens I think this is
rainforest greens but i'll double check
and i'm going to use this darkest shade
right here in the corner and so it's
just a deep shimmery olive which I
really like and I'm going to find my
brush that I need I'm going to use the
my fine crease brush get a little bit of
that shade on there and we're just going
to use that to deepen up the outer
corner here okay so you can I mean you
can make this as dramatic as you want to
you know you could make a big sweeping
outer V I'm going to keep it kind of
somewhere in the middle here just
building it out a little bit but not
enormously so if you want to if you want
to play down any of this shimmer or
metallic feel to the mica you put on
there there's a really pretty um just
very very extremely light like spring
green and it's matt so just keep in mind
any matte shade that you have like kind
of go if you go over it i'm not going to
do a lot of this but i just wanted to
show you a way you can correct it if you
wanted to just kind of Pat it on there
and suddenly you've got more of a pastel
looking shade as opposed to something
super shimmery so I'm just putting a
little of that there in the corner and
also I want to go back to the Emerald
Isle mica because we're going to kind of
take that all the way underneath our eye
and so I'm going to use my little on one
quarter low Cornell brush which I was
just showing there and get some on it
I'm applying it to this brush to the
very tip of the brush because that's the
only place I want to touch my skin there
so I'm going to just kind of blot it on
very carefully because you know
especially when you're talking lower
lower lid and loose shadow you're
talking fall out there we just kind of
apply that all the way around and as you
can see you know things need to be
blended just a bit more so I'm going to
take my rounded crease brush again and
just kind of go around the outside of
this border here kind of in the crease
area as well picking up excess product
just blending it all out and really
getting that that kind of sultry look
we're going for here my next we want to
think about liner I'm going to use a
fairly thin application of a brown
liquid liner this is from fem couture
that's available at sally beauty supply
and this is brown that i'm using has a
nice little brush to apply it with
and just go inner corner to outer corner
and like I said fairly thin application
of the liner letting it out just
slightly here we go then I'm going to
use my Revlon Colorstay pencil liner in
black brown and I'm going to line about
halfway in on the lower lash line kind
of blending it in with the outer corner
here bringing it in like I said about
about halfway three quarters of the way
we want some of that pretty green to
kind of show up in the inner corner okay
and then just to set that I'm going to
take that matte dark shade from the be
luscious that one right there on the end
and go ahead and use your liner brush
whatever you like and just going to get
some of that on there and just use that
to kind of set that Brown for me and
keep it with our green tones all right
next step is our mascara and i'm going
to use first i'm going to curl my lashes
and then i'm going to grab my L'Oreal
double extend mascara it's the kind that
has you know wide on one side and the
black regular formula on the other so
I'm going to apply a coat of the white
go to the black and then I'll come back
and show you the finished guys this is
the finished look a pretty um wearable
green I look using those fun mica
powders from Coastal Scents I love these
I think they're so easy to work with and
they're also great to work with in an
all-purpose mode in terms of maybe
mixing it in with a moisturizer some of
these neutral shades like the camel one
it could be really really pretty you
know in that sense
I applied the double extend mascara just
to give me some sort of natural lashes
along with this because the idea is that
you know you can wear green in a number
of settings we just don't really typical
II think about it that way so on my lips
I'm trying out a new product it's the
covergirl wet slicks amazement in this
color is everything's Rosie it's just
it's really kind of a a neutrally pink
shade and it really is minty yeah I
really really like the scent and the
flavor is kind of giving off so that's
really cool it's the kind that has like
the crest infused lip gloss anyway guys
thank you so much for watching this
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
