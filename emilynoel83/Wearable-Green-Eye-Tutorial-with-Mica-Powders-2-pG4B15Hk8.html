this really wearable green eye look it's
using some different kind of products as
using the Coastal Scents loose mica
powders that are really fun to use they
come in a variety of shades and they're
just give off a really really unique
finish that's not glittery but somewhat
metallic and I really think that's
awesome so if you want to see how I got
this look keep on watching everyone I
just went ahead and applied my Coastal
Scents epoxy primer it's it winds up
being like a colorless primer it looks
creamy in there but it's sort of like a
gel practically put that all over my lid
and then I'm going to use the couple of
the Mica's from Coastal Scents this is
the Emerald Isle mica and I actually I
got it in a little packet and I went
ahead and found some of these cute
little containers they have little black
lids from UM my hobby lobby's store near
the paint products and I'll probably do
a video or a blog or something on how I
did it took the label off the pouch and
just kind of cut it so it would fit
there and so now I have a much easier
way to use these so I'm pretty proud of
that
so anyway I'm gonna use my low cornel
three-eighths brush and just get it in
the product there get a little bit on
that brush and then sort of press into
the lid here just to kind of make sure
that that shadow really is on the brush
and I'm going to just apply this all
over my lid my goodness this color these
mica powders are so vibrant and they're
so fine that's the thing you're not
going to see chunks of glitter or
anything like that in these mica powders
it's a fine fine shimmer that can turn
out to give you this awesome kind of
metallic finish with some of them and I
just think that's so cool so they go on
really well just be careful when you use
them you can see I'm using really gentle
strokes more of a patting approach
rather than you know a big windshield
wiper like that so I'm just gonna make
sure it's all over the lid that's sort
of the look we're going for once you get
it on there and the
I'm just blending it up to the crease a
little bit you can see how it's you know
this one shade can have different
dimensions this part that's directly
hitting the light has that real
reflective quality but as you shear it
out more up in here it just kind of has
more of an all of you looks so I really
like that the way these work so that's
the Emerald Isle mica and then I'm gonna
use the camel mica and just use that
sort of as a highlight you can see it's
really really subtle I wanted to keep it
pretty sheer because I have all this
shimmer and reflective qualities on the
lid I wanted to keep this kind of sheer
but this is the camel mica gorgeous
color there I love that so I'm going to
take my Sephora rounded crease brush get
a little bit on there just on the tip
and then definitely tap tap tap it into
the lid here so there's not too much
excess and then you're gonna be able to
see how we just have this gorgeous halo
of gold any color there just right on
the border love that this would be a
great powder - these are like
multi-purpose so you could blend this in
with your favorite lotion I think this
would be gorgeous in with your lotion
and you would have this pretty kind of
dewy look but it wouldn't be glittery so
that's kind of nice people can't quite
points exactly what they're seeing then
I'm gonna take my be lush Asst palette
it's the the five color palette in
greens I think this is rainforest greens
but I'll double check and I'm gonna use
this darkest shade right here in the
corner and so it's just a deep shimmery
olive which I really like and I'm gonna
find my brush that I need I'm gonna use
the my fine crease brush get a little
bit of that shade on there and we're
just gonna use that to deepen up the
outer corner here
okay so you can I mean you can make this
as dramatic as you want to you know you
could make a big sweeping outer-v I'm
gonna keep it kind of somewhere in the
middle here just building it out a
little bit but not enormous Lee so if
you want to if you want to play down any
of this shimmer or metallic feel to the
mica you put on there there's a really
pretty um just very very extremely light
like spring green and it's matte so just
keep in mind any matte shade that you
have like kind of go if you go over it
I'm not gonna do a lot of this but I
just wanted to show you a way you can
correct it if you wanted to just kind of
Pat it on there and suddenly you've got
more of a pastel looking shade as
opposed to something super shimmery so
I'm just putting a little of that there
in the corner and also I want to go back
to the Emerald Isle mica because we're
going to kind of take that all the way
underneath our eye and so I'm going to
use my little one quarter lo Cornell
brush which I was just showing there and
get some on it I'm applying it to this
brush to the very tip of the brush
because that's the only place I want to
touch my skin there so I'm going to just
kind of blot it on very carefully
because you know especially when you're
talking lower lower lid and loose shadow
you're talking fallout there we just
kind of apply that all the way around
and as you can see you know things need
to be blended just a bit more so I'm
gonna take my rounded crease brush again
and just kind of go around the outside
of this border here kind of in the
crease area as well picking up excess
product just blending it all out and
really getting that that kind of sultry
look we're going for here right next we
want to think about why
I'm going to use a fairly thin
application of a brown liquid liner this
is from fem Couture that's available at
Sally Beauty Supply and this is brown
that I'm using has a nice little brush
to apply it with and just go inner
corner to outer corner and like I said
fairly thin application of the liner we
can get out just slightly there we go
then I'm gonna use my Revlon Colorstay
pencil liner in black brown and I'm
going to line about halfway in on the
lower lash line kind of blending it in
with the outer corner here bringing it
in
like I said about about halfway
three-quarters of the way we want some
of that pretty green to kind of show up
in the inner corner okay and then just
to set that I'm gonna take that matte
dark shade from the B luscious that line
right there on the end and go ahead and
use your liner brush whatever you like
and I'm just gonna get some of that on
there and just use that to kind of set
that Brown for me and keep it with our
green tones all right next step is our
mascara and I'm gonna use first I'm
gonna curl my lashes and then I'm gonna
grab my L'Oreal double extend mascara
it's the kind that has you know white on
one side and the black regular formula
on the other so I'm gonna apply a coat
of the white go to the black and then
I'll come back and show you this guys
this is the finished look a pretty
wearable green eye look using those fun
mica powders from Coastal Scents
I love these I think they're so easy to
work with and they're also great to work
with in an all-purpose mode in terms of
maybe mixing it in with a moisturizer
some of these neutral shades like the
camel one could be really really pretty
you know in that sense I applied the
double extend mascara just to give me
some sort of natural lashes along with
this because the idea is that you know
you can wear green in a number of
settings we just don't really think
about it that way so on my lips I'm
trying out a new product it's the
covergirl whet slicks amazement in this
color is everything's rosy it's just
it's really kind of a a neutrally pink
shade and it really is minty yeah I
really really like the scent and the
flavor is kind of giving off so that's
really cool it's the kind of heads like
the crest infused lip gloss anyway guys
thank you so much for watching this
video and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
