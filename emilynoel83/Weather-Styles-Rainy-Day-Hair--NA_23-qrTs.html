in for this video I'm really pumped to
be telling you about my new hair series
I've been trying to think of you no way
I could work in more hairdos and I was
talking with some people on my 24-7 chat
room on my blog and a lot of us were
saying how you know what you do with
your hair is often dictated by what the
weather is whether it's rainy or windy
or just a regular nice day you know
that's going to sometimes determine what
you do with your hair so thanks to all
of you who gave me the great idea to put
together a series along the lines of
that concept and today is the rainy day
here do it's really i think really cute
and could totally be a dressed up look
or just an everyday look i'm really
liking it it's super easy and quick to
do so i hope you enjoy this tutorial and
keep honoring everybody the first step
is to pull back this front part so we've
kind of got like our bangs and
everything out of our face and we know
we don't have to worry about it you know
getting unsecured and flying back into
our face if it's rainy and windy and
nasty out like that so I'm just taking a
little bit going about a section about
you know from here to here across my
forehead and just gather that up you may
want to tease your hair here or you may
just be comfortable with kind of
securing it like this and then giving it
a little push forward like that that
sometimes works for me especially if I'm
in a hurry you don't always need to do
all that teasing so then I'm going to
take a bobby pin and secure that and
take another one and crisscross it like
you're going to make an X and surprising
how secure this method can be if you're
not used to doing it crisscrossing bobby
pins it's the way to go so anyway you
get that there and you can take one of
these pins like I like to use a lot and
sort of adjust how you have that pulled
back you can pull up you know certain
parts of that or make it a little more
or less poofy whatever you want and then
we go ahead and just spray this at this
point and you can also further kind of
adjust and style after you spray so
following that you want to kind of
smooth it down if you have any short
layers like I do you want to sort of
smooth those down there and then pulled
your hair
to a ponytail right here on the side and
you may need to brush for this or if
you've already kind of brushed all the
tangles out of your hair you can
probably just pull it sideways and I'm
actually kind of covering up this ear
here so once you feel like you've got it
smooth you're going to create a ponytail
basically just behind that ear and
obviously whichever side you prefer is
cool just go kind of low like just down
a little bit and below that ear would be
great okay so now you've got your two
little side ponytail wish you could
totally go with and leave and go or you
could curl it at this point you can curl
it before you started and have kind of
like a curly side ponytail or what you
can do is twist this around to do a cute
little button this is going to be
different in terms of actually you know
twisting around and making the button
for all of us because we all have
different lengths of hair or some of us
have curly hair or you might just have
your own special way of making a button
so I'm just going to demonstrate one way
to do it here and basically I'm going to
twist my hair around and you'll notice
that once I get to the end I've got this
extra hair here so like I've twisted it
around once I got this little tail if
you can see that I'm just going to try
to tuck that under the bun okay I'm
pushing it right back into the hair that
I've twisted around then I'm going to
take this clip I'm going to go back
behind my head here and actually clip it
from the back and just kind of get up on
the bun just a little bit a little more
than you might think you need to and
we're basically just it's a matter of
kind of stuffing the hair right back
there in the bun but there you go that's
basically what it is I've got a little
bit of my hair showing I'm it that
covered up but I think I just pulled a
little bit of there we go I pulled a
little bit of the harem you know a
little too tight
around it but go ahead and give that a
quick spritz of hairspray all around
your bun and all around the top and
wherever but that is basically the look
you're working with here it can go
dressy or it can be you know you can
poop it out a little bit more and make
it more casual or kind of crazy looking
or pull the bun down even lower that's
totally an option too but it's just a
cute way to to work one of those
sideways hairstyles if you don't want to
deal with the ponytail and just have it
all kind of pulled back so I hope you
guys like this look and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
