video this is a style that is great for
that sunny day because it will
accommodate your sunglasses of course it
looks cute when your sunglasses are on
your face but it is a perfect style to
accommodate them when they are on top of
your heads so I just wanted to show you
how to do this this is great for curly
hair straight hair shorter hair longer
hair really it's very very quick and
easy to do and it will definitely you
know a sunny summer day you could get
away with some curly hair for this look
and it would really look nice than it
would probably last you since it's a
nice clear day so anyway if you want to
see how I put together this really quick
and easy look keep on watching guys in
terms of what's going on with your hair
you can definitely wear your hair
straight or curly with this look or what
I did I just kind of had my hair wavy
today this is just kind of left over
from earlier in the day I kind of took a
curling iron and just kind of curled my
hair back away from my face and it gave
me these sort of I don't know how will
they show up on camera but just some
loose waves I kind of like that look for
this and assuming it's a clear sunny day
which is what this hairstyle is geared
toward for this series I'm going with
curls you know maybe you can trust that
they won't totally fall apart if you've
got a nice clear day outside so anyway
just you could do the side part with
those if you're more comfortable but
just to switch it up a little but I'm
just kind of parting my hair in the
middle and I'm going to go back let's
say I'm going to go three to four inches
back on that part and then pull back a
little section of hair just right in
there you know like I'm leaving a lot of
this hair down but I'm just going to
pull up a little section right here in
the crown and don't pull too much in
terms of you know back this way on your
head keep it kind of a thin strip but go
as wide across this way as you want if
that makes any sense tens I'm just
pulling up a little pony tails worth of
that can see about what I've pulled up
there okay so once you've got pulled up
take any sort of rat tail comb and maybe
give it a spritz of hairspray back
behind there
if you can I'm just using this from
tresemme and just give it a couple
squirts and then go ahead and tease your
hair just a little bit that means I'm
just combing down on the hair and we're
just going to boost it up a little bit
right there in the crown so there you go
once you've done that I recommend using
a little pin like this i've talked about
these a lot you can get them from
walmart or sally beauty supply we're
just going to form that into like a
little half up sort of do here and then
you might want to pull some more from
the sides as you pull it back so
basically we're in a stage where we're
just kind of forming forming our hair to
here so i'm pulling a little more back
and just getting that height right there
in the crown like that now when you're
ready to secure that you could use a
clip like a little clip like this or you
could use bobby pins i'm just going to
use the bobby pins here and i'm just
doing the regular little crisscross sort
of formation here to get them to get
them in and then once you've got across
your hair is basically secured there and
i would recommend giving another little
spritz of spray to that just like so and
now you could totally just where the
look like this and have kind of a half
up sort of like less defined since you
got this hair down around your face that
a sort of half up kind of Messier do but
for a little finishing touch on the
whole look you could put a little
headband right here in this area or
considering that this is a sunny day
look this is the perfect look and this
is kind of how I figured it out kind of
the perfect look to pop your sunglasses
on right there and your hair just looks
like it's just fallen into the perfect
shape you know with your sunglasses and
it's just a great way to wear your hair
along with your sunglasses assuming it's
a sunny day you take your sunglasses off
you're still good for the day so thank
you guys so much for tuning it for this
video I hope you enjoy these weather
styles
just drop my sunglasses and have a great
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
