you might know me as emily noel 83 from
my youtube channel beauty broadcast this
video is exclusively for shape.com and
i'm going to walk you through a great
wedding day touch-up kit I'm gonna break
my kit down into three basic categories
the first is gonna be your hair and
makeup touch-up products second you've
got products for a fashion emergency or
any other unforeseen circumstance and
finally something no bride can forget
and that's to have a snack on hand now I
recommend packing this kit days in
advance of your wedding so you're not
getting stressed out thinking about what
you might have forgotten also keep in
mind that this kit can be used for your
bridesmaids or anyone else involved in
your ceremony that's having that
last-minute emergency and this could
also be a really great gift for the
bride-to-be if you're watching this well
ahead of someone's wedding so here's a
quick rundown of what's in the hair and
makeup bag I think you definitely want
to have a hair spray I love the Tresemme
trade - and they make it in a really
small size for travel also you I have
bobby pins to take down any hair that's
blown out of your updo now when it comes
to makeup keep in mind that sometimes
it's not a matter of putting more on but
actually taking some off oil blotting
sheets like these from elf are only a
dollar you get 50 sheets in there and it
could really sum up excess oil also
q-tips that's gonna be your best friend
when it comes to any under-eye smudges
and we all know Kleenex is not a bad
idea for a wedding day then when you
start touching up your actual makeup I
think a great product is the elf
translucent mattifying powder first off
it has a great big mirror it's very
sheer and it works for all skin types
since it's translucent and you can keep
applying throughout the day without it
looking really cakey if you're wearing
false eyelashes for your wedding a lash
adhesive is a must to have on hand so
you can get those babies really glued
down and Revlon precision lash adhesive
is great because it actually has a wand
applicator so you can get in there and
actually glue your lashes down without
taking the whole strip off and starting
over you also want to have your lipstick
or lip gloss of the day so you have that
for touch-ups and finally a fragrance is
nice to have and I love how Victoria's
Secret makes these itty-bitty ones so
they can
easily fit in your kit the second part
of the kit is sort of like your fashion
emergency slash first-aid kit all very
important things I think Claire's
earring backs are great to have on hand
you can get a little pouch of them in
silver and gold tone so you have those
if you need them also a little sewing
kit
you got your white thread in here also
some other colors a safety pin this is
terrific to have on hand when you've got
all those people they're dressed up
somebody's bound to need a sewing kit
and with a nice white dress of course
comes spills
so at tide to go pin or shout wipes or
something like that will help you defend
against those stains mints always a good
idea along with that some floss gotta be
flawless and all those pictures for
experience on my wedding day I was
reaching for the band-aids because my
shoes weren't super comfortable and now
they have the band-aid friction block
stick that you can actually glide over
your skin so that those striping parts
of your shoes feel much more comfortable
the stress may lead to headaches so
don't forget to pack your Tylenol
excedrin or some sort of pain reliever
as a bride you're going to be rushing
around all day getting ready taking
pictures going here and there so you
definitely want to make sure you have a
snack on hand at least some sort of bar
like the TLC bar from Kashi and a bottle
of water so you don't get dehydrated and
you stay really energized for the rest
of your day i'm emily noel 83 I hope my
ideas for a wedding day touch-up kit
help you have a fantastic wedding day
