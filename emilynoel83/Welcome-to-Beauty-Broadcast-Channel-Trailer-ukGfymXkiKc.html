beauty broadcast actually spent years as
a TV news anchor and I mean I love the
job love the people but beauty and doing
this YouTube channel is really my
passion so now I'm happy to call this
pink room of my office I actually call
it my happy place and I've always felt
like when you're truly happy and you're
doing what you love and you're then able
to share that with someone I feel like
something really special happens there I
think you're putting your best self out
there people are receiving that
hopefully being inspired and I think
it's just a really good place to be I
actually started making Beauty videos
back in 2007 and still to this day I'm
doing reviews step-by-step tutorials
holes you name it I'm doing it I mean I
practically feel like my local Walgreens
is my second home you could probably
talk to the staff there and they'd be
like yeah this girl is always in here
buying makeup I mean I love drugstore
makeup I try to mix in some high-end
makeup too on my channel my reviews are
always on and sometimes I like abroad
too sometimes I don't like a product but
I always keep it real and that is really
one of the nicest things people say
about my videos that or that I feel like
a friend I mean if somebody tells me
that it's like they made mission
accomplished like it makes me so
thrilled it's just crazy to me because
we're all bonding over makeup but if you
you know learn a new trick and that
makes you look good and then that makes
you feel good and then you're in a good
mood so you make somebody else feel
better about their day I mean it just
goes on and on and on I think that's
just the coolest thing
you don't have to be perfect gots you're
not perfect but I mean if you can be
content and happy with being yourself
that's what I want to encourage and
maybe wear a little lipstick while
you're at it thank you so much for
checking out my channel if you're not
subscribed yet feel free to do so take a
look around at my videos if you're
interested in my husband Tyler or my cat
cupcake you will see a lot more of them
on my vlog channel that's called Beauty
vlog cast I'm also on Facebook Twitter
Instagram Pinterest all of those sides
see you guys in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
