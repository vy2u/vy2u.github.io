beauty broadcast by day I am a morning
news anchor and pretty much the rest of
the time I am just a makeup addict I
talk about a lot of different things
finding makeup that can make you look
good and save you money at the same time
how to videos that can show you how to
look natural and glamorous and
everywhere in between
really I also have a series called ends
world where you meet my friends my
family what I'd like to do in my spare
time and of course my cat cupcakes I'm
not a professional makeup artist I'm a
regular person that has tried a lot of
makeup
I feel like knowledge is confidence if
you know what you're doing if you know
how to use the makeup and what to buy
you're going to know how to make
yourself look good it's gonna make you
feel good and they give be less crabby
to the person sitting next to you love
