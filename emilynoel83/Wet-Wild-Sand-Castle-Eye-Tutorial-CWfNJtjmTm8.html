this I tutorial video and this is going
to be using the wet and wild ultimate
expressions sandcastle palette and
you're looking at this and you're
probably thinking oh my gosh it's a
neutral look you know Emily likes the
neutral looks well I like them but a lot
of you like them as well because so many
people have requested looks to come from
this palette because I've mentioned
different times how I think these are
really nice palettes I've used the
Paradise Cove one already which is sort
of a more plum tone palette and a lot of
people said well I want to see a look
with the Sandcastle palette and even
though I've done brown or neutral lips
in the past I'm using a different
product here and I think it's important
to show even if it's may be in the same
color family as a previous look it still
kind of shows how how does that product
work how do the colors work together and
give you some ideas for it so that's
what I wanted to do today it's a very
very warm brown look and we kept it
pretty natural with the liner although
there is liner here if you're trying to
get some ideas for how to use a cream
liner and keep it subtle and watch this
tutorial because you will see closer to
the end how I did that with my liner so
if you want to see how the whole look
comes together keep on line one is to
apply a primer I'm going to use my Mary
Kay signature I primer just cuz I
haven't really used it in a while and it
is a really good primer for kind of
grabbing that shadow and keeping it on
your lid there so I'm just going to
apply that all over my lid this one
stays just slightly tacky so it's going
to be good for really good making the
colors stand out alrighty now to our
palette and this is the wet and wild
ultimate expressions palette in sand
castle and I'm going to be working first
all over my lid with a couple of these
ok see if i can get this applicator
alright i'm going to be using a couple
of the lighter shades here on this side
one of them is kind of a light champagne
gold and this one is just a little bit
darker it actually has a little more
pink in it so i'm going to take the
little bit more pinky shade and i'm
going to use my sigma SS 239 so a nice
kind of flat eyeshadow brush and just
apply that shade all over my aisle
so that shade on the bottom there is
giving us just a little bit of light
shimmer to the lid so I'm just kind of
really packing that on and then for a
little more concentrated shimmer right
here in the corner i'm going to take the
shade right above that which has a
little more of a gold tone to it and i'm
packing that right here on the inner
half of my lid okay next we're going to
go to the darkest shade in this palette
which is right here at the bottom this
really deep shimmery brown and for that
color I'm going to be using my SS 252 so
kind of a flat shader brush get a little
bit of that color on there and we're
just going to kind of pact that in the
crease just a little bit you can see how
we're getting kind of some really soft
color building up there in our crease
and I'm just pulling it out taking kind
of little strokes not mad making sure
there's not too much product on here
that I'm working with but really getting
the product right in here and then kind
of pulling it out working in here as
well ok and just build that up as deep
as you want to that that shade can go
pretty dark i'm going to go just a
little bit more just for a little more
concentrated color right here that's
totally up to you this brush makes it
really easy to work with though to
create that kind of outer v look ok so
once you've done that take a fluffier
crease brush I'm going to use my SS 224
and I'm just going to use that to buff
over the edge of this brown just like so
ok and then for a little added warmth
I'm going to use this brush and I'm
going to go to the shade right above
that darkest brown see this one it's
almost more of an orange e brown I'm
going to get a little bit of that on my
brush and just kind of buff over that
entire dark brown and all this is going
to do is just warm it up see how
everything looks a little bit more warm
now that I've done that great and now
we're going to pay attention to this
area right here it's kind of the border
of that shadow and not quite to our
eyebrow and for that I'm going to take
this really pretty gold shade see how
we're kind of just working our way up
this middle section this shade right
here if you pack this on you could get a
really nice gold look like if you just
if I just got it on my finger here you
can see how concentrated that gold can
be so that might be a fun idea for a
future look but I'm just going to get a
little bit on my brush tap off the
excess and use that as sort of a border
color right here really catches the
light and looks pretty and then I'm
going to go to the back to that same
shade that we initially put on our lid
this one right here and that's actually
going to be our highlight and I'm just
sticking with that same kind of fluffy
crease brush and that is just going in
this small space i have left right
between the shadow and my eyebrow so
just kind of buff around that we've
we've applied a lot of different colors
to get a really multi-dimensional look
so just really make sure you've blended
these colors out using fluffy brushes
like this is a good way to do it and the
next thing we're going to do is just pay
a little more attention to our crease I
want to really get it nice and deep kind
of right here in the outer corner and
you can do that with that darkest brown
shade so I'm going to use my SS 219 kind
of a stiff pencil type brush get a
little bit of that dark brown on there
and just apply a little bit more right
here to the outer corner ok it's just
going to work a little better with our
liner there sometimes it just takes a
really small brush to get it just how
you want it so the next thing we're
going to do is move on to our liner then
we will come back to our shadows briefly
again but I'm going to be using my
Smashbox cream liners these I had
have them for a little while and it came
in a kind of a limited-edition
collection but basically it's a brown
cream liner at a black and any cream
liner that you have will do or if you
like using pencils more go for that as
well this can just give you a really
soft look so I'm taking my SS 266 it's a
stiff angled liner brush I'm going to
get a little bit of that brown shade on
there and I'm just going to basically
think about applying it right here to
the outer half of my upper lash line I'm
not really going to the inner part at
all I'm just keeping it right here this
is not a super dark brown this is kind
of an a warm brown along the lines of
this whole palette so just getting it a
little bit deeper there close to the
lash line and keeping it we're kind of
going for that seamless look here and
then I'm going to take some more of that
and use it on the lower lash line where
it will kind of tend to show up more
because we're not going over as much
shadow you can see I'm kind of just
using that angle brush to my advantage
getting it right there in the corner and
then right up here and just just really
pushing it right here in between the
lashes trying not to go in for any more
product than I have to just kind of
using a back-and-forth blending motion
to really get the shadow or really get
the liner on there go for a little more
okay alrighty next step go back to that
pencil brush and there is a really
pretty taupe shade in this palette that
we haven't used yet it's right up here
at the top so kind of when I say taupe I
mean it's kind of like a brown mixed
with a little bit of gray almost and I'm
getting a little bit of that color on
here and I'm just using that to overlap
that liner giving it a really kind of I
wouldn't call it necessarily majorly
smokey look but it's just kind of
softening it up okay once you've done
that I'm going to take my teeny tiny
brush this one's from Coastal Scents
it's like a mini they call it their mini
contour brush or detail I think
like mini detail chisel contour or
something like that but it's a very very
small brush I mentioned it in my top 12
Coastal Scents products so if you want
to find a specific name I put it there
I'm going to go to the white shade in
this palette which is right up here
these were the these two here where the
shades we initially used on our lid so
I'm going over here to the white and I'm
going to get a little bit of that on
this tiny brush a q-tip could work for
this as well just any small brush that
you have a lot of control with and I'm
going right in here and the tear duct
this is such a great shade just to
really get that area nice and
highlighted you can see how easy these
shades are to work with the one just
kind of blend seamlessly right over the
next I'm going under a little portion of
my inner not in ER i mean i guess the
inner half of my lower lash line and
we're just going to brighten that up
it's going to just give a really really
bright eyed look to this ok next thing
I'm going to do guys is curl my lashes
and then I'm going to apply my covergirl
LashBlast lengths mascara I am liking it
so far you can see a big difference in
the length of my lashes from this side
compared to that side so I'm going to
apply probably two coats on the top and
a coat on the bottom and then I'll join
you with the finished look
all right guys here is my finished look
on the wet and wild sand castle I
tutorial very very warm brown look there
are so many ways you can go with this
palette because there's just such a wide
range of colors I really kind of wanted
to focus in on this kind of range of
colors in the center they're bold
they're shimmery and they work really
really well together however you could
do a lot of different things here in
terms of this gold shade which I
mentioned was very dense and metallic
you can also just stick with more this
brown shade which is less warm than say
this or this and just kind of use that
alongside one of these lighter colors
just for a classic brown look but like I
said using this more coppery tone and
the gold we ended up with a really
really warm Brown look I think it really
complements brown eyes but I think it
could be pretty on other colored eyes as
well just it's fun to play with it's fun
to have that many options in one you
know neutral sort of pallets so I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial guys on my
lips I'm using my wet and wild lip liner
in number 666 that's Brandywine and so
it's sort of a reddish kind of with some
neutrally brown tones in it as well and
then over the top of that i use my
plumping serum volumizing lip gloss from
hard candy and all-american girl this is
sort of a ma vie nude shade so it's just
got a hint of sort of deeper tones than
just your classic nude gloss so it's
fairly sheer so what you're seeing here
is mainly the color of the liner and I
think it worked really well with this I
look and just keeping the lashes settle
and the liner subtle really lets just
those warm natural tones in the shadow
really shine through so i hope you
enjoyed this look everyone and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
