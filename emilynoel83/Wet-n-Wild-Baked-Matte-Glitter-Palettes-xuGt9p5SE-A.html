a bunch of different wet-and-wild
products in this video they've come out
with a lot of new things I know lots of
people have been talking about them and
I've had mine for maybe a week and a
half couple weeks now and I've tried all
this stuff not only swatched it but
tried it on my face so now I feel like
I'm ready to review it for you what I'm
talking about are three new baked
pallets also a 100% matte palette and
four new glitter pallets so I'm gonna be
just giving you a rundown of what I
think about all these things all in one
video because they all kind of came out
around the same time I recently got my
hands on this stuff because I am a wet
and wild Beauty ambassador so I do get
sent some products from wet and wild to
try out and review I have found these
things also in my local Walgreens store
but I know that they're not necessarily
everywhere so I'm just something you
have to kind of keep checking on and see
if it comes out some of this stuff I
really like and some that I'm not so
impressed with so I'm just gonna give
you my honest opinions on everything the
first thing I'm going to talk about is
the I love Matt Palace so this is really
great I think wet and wild has been
listening to what people have been
saying and I think they've gotten a lot
of good feedback probably on pallets
like this that have you know half
shimmer half matte and they're really
versatile and great to you the thing I
do want to mention here is that if you
have the palette labeled pride and the
palette labeled vanity there are there
is some overlap with these two palettes
that I've found for vanity it's that
darkest Brown and that light cream shade
so they're really kind of coming up here
right side by side but if you love those
shades and maybe you can't find the I
love matte palette you have some of
those in vanity and then in the pride
palette you're overlapping with that
green and that Y benefit of having a
nice little collection of matte shades
is because if you rely heavily on
drugstore products I feel like the
majority of drugstore shadows come out
what
shimmer in them and so with this you're
getting you know some real standard
basics including great matte black to
kind of supplement what you have that's
already really shimmery and you've got
some pretty bold colors is what I felt
like these all applied very much the
same way I mean they're all a matte
finish and I didn't notice like oh well
this one shade really stinks you know
they all go on in the same fashion so I
really really am a fan of those I want
to talk about the glitter palettes so
what you're getting in each of these is
six they say six high-impact cream
glitters and dazzling colors that
deliver strikingly sparkly looks that
won't go unnoticed so this one with the
black and red is called a shimmer
station then we have main street glitz
which is kind of reds bronzes and golds
the reason why I'm having to look down
is because they don't actually say the
shade names on the thing so I had to
write them down next we have tinsel mall
which is your pinks and blues and kind
of a black silver white thing and then
we've got blues and greens in twinkle
town I love that name twinkle down have
NYX glitter cream palettes you may have
noticed a similar thing going on with
these not all of these are straight-up
glitter creams for example this gold
right here that's just a creamy metallic
gold cream there and this one right up
here it looks like it was straight up
you know silver glitter but once you
just get past the top layer it's just
creamy silver so if you are getting
these thinking I want to try a bunch it
it just broke okay I might have fixed it
ESPA so I'm getting it here is if you're
if you were getting these thinking I
want to try a bunch of glitter or
products on you're gonna run out of
glitter fairly quickly even if you just
swatch it a couple times because you
come through and you get past that
glitter and you've just got cream and
when you look at these I mean they look
gorgeous palette right here though those
colors just look amazing and they swatch
beautifully too this one
a really unusual thing with the blue
because the blue glitter was on top of
purple cream once you got past that
first layer look it's purple on the
underside blue palette here that is just
an emerald cream there is no glitter on
that one and then some others have the
glitter and again with the silver where
it's silver but if you just peel back
some of that silver as you can see there
is just a silver cream then underneath I
did a glitter cream look and I had some
powder product that I kind of blended up
into the crease but overall what was on
my lids was the glitter cream I did one
color and then I kind of dabbed the
silver glitter cream over the top i sat
down and I read a book for an hour I got
up and looked in the mirror and it
creased like none other
on my lips I didn't top it with a shadow
or anything I used a primer but I didn't
top it with shadow because I had doesn't
it I mean I had to see if my assumptions
were correct that it was going to crease
like mad and it did but there are three
things that I do with cream shadows
number one I always use a primer first
number two I apply it in as thin of an
application as possible with the glitter
or what the whatever cream product it
might be and number three for staying
power purposes I almost always top it
with a coordinating shadow or whatever
shadow I want to use to give it the look
that I desire and that's how I get
staying power out of random cream
eyeshadows and here's the thing when you
got glitter you want that glitter to be
on top you know you want that to be
showing and standing out and being you
know you don't want to cover up glitter
with powder and then you know it just
kind of defeats the purpose that you
work through the glitter and you get to
some potentially usable creams but what
I'm getting at here is it glitter is
what you want you're only going to get
it for a little while and it just does
not seem to work very well without
creasing all of these come with a black
eye liner FYI
to the bake palates and these all come
with actually two of these these two
come with a black eyeliner and this one
comes with a silver liner and I am
wearing this one right now actually and
the cool thing that I love about baked
shadows is that you can use them wet or
dry and I'm just going to give you a
quick overview of what each of these are
first okay this one is baking a cake and
I'll take the top off I don't really
love how you've got it like it's just
like a little tray here but baking cake
you're getting you know magenta and
light pink the two shades in the middle
of all of these are kind of marbled and
you can't really judge them by the way
they appear here because you've got to
kind of see them swatch to see what
color you get at you also get a brown
and a blue also got a baked not fried
which is the blue collection that I'm
wearing right now so you've got your
light shades your two marbled colors a
black and a believ got bake-off contest
which are your neutrals here I'm going
to start by talking about this one in
terms of exactly how these were these
can be worn wet or dry and with this one
in particular it did not swatch very
well for me dry and it when I put it on
my lids dry I'm just like applying with
a brush even though I had a primer on my
lids
it still came off in a really flaky like
this shade right here is just so darn
shimmery and it just does not like
concentrate very well for you however
this was the one I noticed the biggest
difference with when I wore it wet
the metallic came out of these so much
it was gorgeous when i swatched these
wet and when i wore these wet and the
impact was great and you might be
wondering well I don't even know how to
wear them wet and I don't want wet
eyelids well they don't stay wet on your
eyelids for example I wore the blue with
a couple shades wet here it dries and
then actually wears a really long time
but what I do is I just keep some water
in a spray bottle I spray it right on
the palm of my hand and I have some
sponge tip applicator --zz now those
don't come with sponge tips so you might
want to either take some sponge tips out
of containers you already have or just
buy some they're real
cheap i dampen the sponge tip in the
palm of my hand and then i go directly
onto the product and then i apply it so
i like to do the wet stuff like on my
lid so there's the real pom then I blend
it up into the crease just dry using
this shade I use the shade underneath as
well so basically for your pops of color
you know maybe use it wet and then to
blend it out use it dry so I love that
versatility if you've ever had any other
baked products Laura Geller Milani
whatever they last a long time they
really did this one I wasn't too fond of
dry I really like them all best wet they
look their best they give you the most
impact wet and then use like I said the
darker shades for blending I like that
you get some kind of fun Marbley shades
in there because you don't really know
what you're gonna get it just turns out
some of them look kind of topi this
shade is pretty this was the palette I
used combined with a cream palette and
it gave me a beautiful look that magenta
although I didn't love the way it's
washed I really liked it when I wore it
on my eye gosh I feel like we just had
so much to talk about in this video but
I wanted you to be able to know what I
thought about all this new stuff love
the matte palette really not a big fan
of the glitter creams but if you can
find these baked palettes I really think
those are a lot of fun definitely
consider maybe getting out of your
comfort zone with using dry Pro shadows
and try them wet because they really
will give you their most impactful
finish on your eyelid and all you need
are some you know water and sponge tip
applicator zits that easy so thank you
so much for watching let me know what
you think of these if you have them
already or if you get them feel free to
comment below and have a great day bye
