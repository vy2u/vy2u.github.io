this video this is going to be another
two-in-one tutoria mad a look and a
dramatic look for both looks I'm going
to be using the wet and wild color icon
palette in Pride you can see there's
some shimmery shades and somesh only a
few subtle changes you can do to take
this palette from day to night and you
just add on to make the night look you
don't have to totally start oh let's go
ahead and get started with the natural
daytime look i prime my lid with the
smashbox photo finish lid primer so um
that operates a lot like the Too Faced
shadow insurance only it more so
neutralizes the look of your eyelid so
it really takes away any sort of
pigmentation that's already there on the
skin on your eyelid so then we're going
to take our wet and wild color icon
palette in Pride with the greens and
blues and we're going to start out by
just taking the sponge tip applicator
that comes in there and we're going to
use the shimmery green shade right there
so just kind of Pat your applicator into
that color and we're just going to apply
that all over our lid sometimes the
sponge tip is just the quickest way to
really get the color intensity on your
lids so don't feel like every everything
you do has to be with a brush I actually
did an interesting smokey eye the other
day just by using a q-tip and that
includes in the crease and everything
and I was really happy with how it
turned out so I might do a tutorial on
that sometime too but anyway you just
kind of pack that on your lid and then
just sort of start to really look down
into your mirror and pull that up to
your crease just a bit so that way when
we put our next shade on which is a
bluish color it's going to really blend
in nicely there okay so speaking of that
bluish shade i'm going to take my
essence of beauty fine crease brush and
we're going to go to this pretty
shimmery blue that's right here and keep
in mind this is sort of our daytime look
or a more natural look so we're going to
keep sort of a light hand with these
colors even though these are some of the
richest shades that
I've ever used from wet and wild
basically I'm just getting that blue
there in the crease and I'm not working
it out to an outer V as you can see I'm
just overlapping the green and we're
getting a nice kind of greenish blue
then on our lower lashline we're going
to use several colors go back to the
shimmery green that we put all over our
lid and with an angled liner brush just
kind of get that going right here right
under the first little portion thereof
your under-eye okay and then take the
shimmery blue like we use just a moment
ago in our crease and use that under the
rest then on our upper lash line just
keeping our line are really soft we're
going to take the matte blue shade in
this palette and take your same liner
brush dip it into that color and we're
just going to go basically all the way
to the inner corner inner to outer
corner or as I'm doing it right now
outer to inner and this is going to come
off soft what you could also do if you
really just like to stay with a defined
eyeliner look even during the daytime
you could wet your brush here to make it
just a little more intense then do any
final blending you want by taking your
fine crease brush and since you've been
working with powders you know right here
kind of as our liner and you're going to
find it very easy to sort of blend them
together and make things kind of make
sense there on the outer corner so I'm
just kind of running it over the outer
corner running it up and just getting a
nice blended look there and then you may
want to take a fluffier brush to for
your ultimate border of that shade and
then for your highlight there is a
shimmery white in this palette so that
would be oops that would be right there
so just get a little bit a little bit
goes a long way on that we don't want to
you know totally wash out the area right
under our brow but we're doing
just a little bit there to brighten it
up and then take a q-tip or a small
detail brush and take that same shade
and go right around the tear duct area
that added Sparkle can really brighten
things up during the daytime and then
what I'm going to do is put on some of
the Maybelline XXL Pro 24-hour bold
mascara it's a two-step mascara one side
is it's basically just two different
kinds of brushes that's the first to
kind of thicken them up and then I think
the second step is more of a lengthening
brush but what's neat is that they're
both black instead of one being a light
primer so I'll probably review this in
the future but anyway I will put that on
and join you with the finished daytime
look
so here's the finished look for the more
natural daytime look just an easy way to
wear some what we all see is typically
brighter colors so I basically just put
on that mascara which adds a little
intensity but it's not too much I put
just a little bit of the step one of the
XXL pro on the lower lashes so it's not
too much and then on my lips I used my
georgeanna easy liner in baby berry
which is a nice kind of medium pink
shade and then i used the Stila lip
glaze and ultimate pink it came in that
kit that was like I think an Ulta kit
with a bunch of different stila products
in it so we've got like a nice light
shimmery lip and makeup wise I mean I've
got a little bit of bronzer I've got the
Rimmel blush in peach on so I mean it's
just a really natural look but now let's
see how to make it more dramatic
since the dramatic look apart is going
to be focusing on some of the matte
colors instead of just the shimmers
shimmery colors can definitely give you
a dramatic look but when use matte
you're definitely getting more color
intensity out of it I feel like
especially with this palette so we're
going to use some of those shades and
we're going to do some different liner
techniques so to see how to do it keep
on this thing we're going to do to make
this look a little more dramatic is to
go in with a black liquid liner on our
upper lash line i'm going to be using
revlon colorstay in black shimmer you
can use any black liquid liner you want
we just want to lay down a little more
of a defined line there so I'm just
going to get some of that out and go
from upper to lower or inner to outer
that's what I meant and just kind of
stay in close to your lash line it's a
little different doing line or after you
already have mascara on but I mean it's
not that big of a deal and then if you
want to do a little bit of a wing I did
just a little bit of a winged outliner
look here so if you're going to do that
just continue your line kind of straight
out and up a little bit and just fill it
in then on the lower lash line we're
going to do some liner as well take a
black pencil liner I'm using the l may
eyeliner pencil in black it's kind of
creamy and we're just going to draw that
liner right here we're only doing it
like I'd say the outer fourth of our
lower lash line and just going to
connect it up to the end of the winged
out liner so we've just got a little
darker base there to deal with and we'll
come back to that area in a moment but
first we're going to line our water line
with this black shade so just go ahead
and do that next we're going to grab our
liner brush and make sure you have like
a tissue handy or like a makeup remover
wipe because we're going to be going
between a few different colors and we
don't want them to get too muddied up
we're going to go back to our wet and
wild palette and go to the
blue shade here you'll notice we're
using a lot more matte shades for the
dramatic look and it was more the
shimmery shades for the natural one so
here is the matte blue so go to that
first get some of that on an angled
liner brush and just use that to top off
the black that we just put down there in
the outer corner and then go continue to
take that about let's say half to
three-quarters of the way in then we're
going to go to the mat green shade right
here so get some of that on your angled
liner brush and we're going to use that
on the inner part right here so get that
going on right there and then we're
going to continue it down kind of just
underneath um what we just did with the
blue so this is where having a really
precise liner brush will help you to
keep it kind of contained and this is
going to make the look look just a
little more smokey because instead of
having it end on that defined blue shade
it's like we're continuing it out with
the green and I like that so now that
we've got that you can see we've got a
lot more dramatic kind of fun looking
liner on the bottom and we're going to
go in and do a little bit of work up
here on our upper lash line so for that
go back to your palate we're going to
take this dark matte blue shade i'm
using my fine essence of beauty fine
crease brush get a little bit of the
product on there and a little bit will
go a long way and we're going to just
take this in our crease we're going to
go from inner corner to outer corner
here so you can see it's just really
working very easily for us and we've got
we're kind of overlapping some of the
greenish and greenish blue shimmery
colors so it's really getting a nice
unique effect here I'm just taking that
all the way to the outer tip of the
winged liner and go back for more if you
want and just you know as you feel
comfortable just work that up just
a little bit higher and as you have
space not everyone has the same amount
of room between their eye and their brow
so just if this is too high up for you
then just go a little bit lower and as
you work with the outer corner think of
just going over that part so it's all
very blended next I'm going to take the
larger of the two brushes that come with
the fine crease brush so here's the one
we just used this one is a little bit
bigger and I'm going to go to the mat
teal shade we use that in the liner just
a moment ago press a little bit of that
shadow onto your brush and then just go
over the top of that blue and you can
see we're getting a neat little kind of
blended more smokey look anytime you
fade out when you keep those darkest
colors in close to your eye and then you
you know use the lighter color as you go
out you're just going to get a nice kind
of subtle faded out look keep in mind
that these colors are kind of soft in
the palette so you don't need to go
scrubbing your brush on to them you
literally just Pat the brush onto the
product and you're going to have enough
and otherwise you will have fallout
that's the one kind of downside so you
just have to be careful but it is I much
prefer having you know shades that are
easy to blend and work with like this so
you have to give your your eyes
another look if you want to go over any
deeper in the crease you can go ahead
and do that with the matte blue shade
otherwise what I'm going to do right now
is do another coat of our XXL pro a
24-hour bold mascara and I'm going to do
a little bit more on the lower lashes as
well you can tell they're a little more
intense over here on this side and then
I'll join you with the finished look for
the dramatic look
here's the finished look for our
dramatic tutorials so as you can see a
little bit of extra liner and just using
the matte shades really goes a long way
in intensifying these colors and I mean
this could work for a daytime look too
if you kind of stopped and in certain
areas maybe you don't line the waterline
or you just use one of the matte shades
in your crease and that could be a
daytime look as well just with a little
more depth if that's what you're used to
and that's what you're comfortable with
the only thing I changed for the rest of
my face for the nighttime look was I
added a little more shimmer to my lips
and this is a really easy technique you
can do just to basically add a little
more fullness the look of more fullness
to your lips and if you have a really
light shimmery shade which we have in
this palette right here is a shimmery
white I'm going to take a q-tip and get
a little bit of that um shadow on there
and then I'm just going to roll that
q-tip like this right on to my lower lip
you can see that extra shimmer that's
there and then just kind of take your
other finger and kind of blend it in and
it becomes just part of your gloss
really and you've got a little more
shimmer there it adds a little more
fullness to your lower lip makes it look
a little more pouty in full so I hope
you guys enjoyed this look thank you so
much for tuning in it's always fun to
show two sides to one palette because so
many times the palace we see in the
drugstore can do a variety of looks so
thanks so much for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
