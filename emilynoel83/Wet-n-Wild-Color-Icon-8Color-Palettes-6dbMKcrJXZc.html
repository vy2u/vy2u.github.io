me for this video if you can't tell by
my voice I am still battling through my
cold like I'm sure many of you are this
time of year so if you are dealing with
a cold like me I hope you feel better
soon but I did want to get this video
out there because I've done a lot of
talking just here and there about these
wet and wild eight color palettes I've
blogged with some pictures of I
mentioned this in my more for your money
makeup video and I also have a tutorial
using the more neutral of the three
palettes so you've heard a little bit
about it here there but I feel like I
owe everyone just a full-on review about
you know what I think about the quality
of these palettes happened wet and wild
has come out with quite a few new
eyeshadows they have some new trios and
it's called color icon but they've got
some new trios which you might have seen
with some real bright colors but the
thing that I think a lot of people were
really anticipating were these eight
color palettes there's three of them and
one is called comfort zone it's it's
kind of like neutrals and olives what is
called a petal pusher and this is going
to be your your purple tone and kind of
mobs and Maroons and then blue had me at
hello is is kind of your Silver's blacks
and blues so you're getting eight colors
in each palette and each shade actually
has a little imprinted label on it for
where to use it so like this says brow
bone eyelid crease and definer so you
can kind of see them if you look
vertically you know if you're if you're
a little lost who think eight colors
what do I do well you could kind of see
it as basically two quads in one palette
you're getting the same amount of each
shade I don't like how sometimes you'll
get certain brands and they will give
you a big swath of a light shade and
then just a little bit of the darkest
shade and you know kind of making that
assumption for how you're gonna use this
palette I like that you're getting full
amounts of each color even though this
is a large palette they're giving you
the same amount you would get if it was
in a
so I think that's really nice and then
if you turn it over on the back you it
gives you sort of a formula I guess on
how to get a sweet look a flirty look
dramatic look or a wild look so that's a
little look there at the back just to
show you exactly how to apply it and
then it goes through and says which
colors to put together so that's really
helpful if you're new to combining a
bunch of different shades that's sort of
my overall feeling about these palettes
is that I think they're very pigmented
some of the dark shades you really have
to be careful with them if you're just
you know popping your eyeshadow brush
down there and going straight to your
eye I would really recommend giving it a
little tap or sometimes what I even do
like I have this little mirror that I
sometimes kind of look down into what
I'm doing my eye makeup and I will
sometimes just tap my brush after I've
got the product on it tap it on the
mirror it just dusts off some excess and
then I can you know really get it where
I want it on my it's not something I'm
gonna complain about because I feel like
many drugstore eyeshadows do force you
to work a little harder sometimes to
pick up the product although as a whole
I think drugstore shadows are really
upping their game and I think what and
Wilde is kind of leading the pack with
palettes like this and also they are
$4.99 I know I guess that may vary by
location so I got but around five
dollars for a you know regular sized
shadows for what this line puts out I
think is is really fantastic so I just
want to talk a little bit about each one
individually and you'll see as I talk
you know some pictures up close to the
palate and some swatches to but comfort
zone for those who love neutrals you're
going to really enjoy this palette
actually from this palette today see
that pretty shade that says eyelid
that's one of my favorites it's actually
kind of a like a a golden e peach and
I've got that all over my lid and then I
took the shade labeled crease right
below it and I put that in my crease and
a little bit of the brow bone shade
right up in here and I kind of drew that
eyelid color I kind of pulled it up a
little way so it kind of all really
blends to
gather so I think this is so fun to be
able to kind of go between the sides as
well because when I was doing my look in
the olive tutorial and I'm sorry I sound
so nasal guys it's probably annoying but
when I did my look with the olive colors
you know I went over here but then I
took the highlight from that side so
really use your own creativity the this
watch wise these also watch very easily
something you should keep in mind that
is that all of these have some degree of
a shimmer or at least a pearly quality
for example this shade that's labeled
crease you know you look at it and it
doesn't seem you know super shimmery but
it does give off kind of that pearly
metallic look and then there are a
couple of shades like this one that says
definer and this one that says crease
that actually do have a noticeable
sparkle and live so you're not getting
any matte colors this definer shade if
you're familiar with Too Faced cosmetics
it's very it reminds me a lot of label
whore because it gives off that bluish
brownish two-tone look which is really
interesting so I think olives are a
great way to kind of deviate from the
typical Brown spectrum and give yourself
a still neutral eye but something that's
really pretty and I think that that
light green is just studying there so
love this palette neutral lovers will
enjoy this just keep in mind you're not
getting any mattes there which kind of
surprised me because that was the
direction they were heading with
palettes like like these remember these
color icon palettes where it was half
matte have shimmer but I must say those
shimmery shades give off a lot a lot of
pigmentation and you'll notice that when
I did my swatches on my hand I didn't
use any primer there so I wanted you to
see just what these gave off and I
literally took my finger from the
palette and then put it on my hands like
that so you're really seeing the true
ability or the capability of these
products asset called petal pusher this
is something that fans of the plums of
the purples are going to enjoy I must
say in my group of swatches of these the
lighter shades
the upper left-hand side here I didn't
feel like they gave off a whole lot of
color and those are probably the most
matte shades of the group I don't know
that their entire I mean to compare to
everything else they do appear to be met
and they're just a little bit softer
it's not bad to have a couple soft
shades and a palette that's otherwise
kind of intense
I like these deep kind of periwinkle
purples here this shade is great
something I did I took this shade which
is kind of a dupe for Mac Beauty lurked
right here which is a shade that I
currently am loving and I think I might
have it handy here yes I do
I'll hold that up for you so you can be
impressed by how similar they really are
just a second here
there's beauty marked and there is the
shade I'm saying as a dupe right here
so you can see they both have that same
kind of burgundy purple reflective
quality so if you've really been wanting
to try Beauty marked this shade is very
much like it but once again they give
off a lot of color with just barely any
you know you you you just kind of have
to retrain yourself if you are a
longtime drugstore shadow user train
yourself to only really tap your brush
into these these products just lightly
but a look that I went for back back to
my original story I was trying to tell I
like took this pink pinkish brow bone
shade put that all over the lid starting
to blend this color on the outer part of
my lid and then kind of took it up into
the crease a bit and also use that
purpley shade on the left and it was so
pretty I just I've had a lot of fun with
this palette I don't feel like the
swatches did it quite as much address
just this shade called eyelid another
one of those two tone shades that
they've thrown in they can look peachy
pink or purple depending on how the
light hits it
so I mean you look at it in there you
might think oh that's just that's just
peach or whatever but it does have as I
tilt it back you can see how it changes
so I love that they've thrown in some
shades you just don't see every day
and it's nice to have that nice kind of
charcoal color there as well the kit
that I thought would be I think it just
first
Glantz I thought this will be the one
that I probably don't use as much and I
did buy these all from Walgreens and I
just really wanted to be able to try
them all you know but I kind of thought
from this one you know this might be the
one I don't use as much however you've
got to really think about what you're
getting here I know your eye kind of
goes to the turquoise and the Blues and
you think man there's the blue palette
you know but in all honesty you're
getting so many other things I'll use
this is my little pointer here you're
getting a great metallic silver that's a
that's a great all-purpose shade above
it a pearly white and then a matte black
that yes that is mint and then a another
black here that has some sparkle to it
you've got a knockout navy blue here
with a a that the sparkle in that is not
silver it is like a navy blue sparkle so
thanks deep rich blue shadow with a hint
of blue sparkle it's gorgeous and then
you know here's kind of your more
colorful blue and your teal so these
swatched so beautifully I was really
nuts about the way these turned out and
I mean so I think as you look at this
palette you might think I'm not a blue
person but really you've got a lot of
good Basics in here as well that pretty
much sums up my review for these
palettes I love them but something I do
think you need to be aware of is that
between all of these palettes you're
getting maybe three matte colors and
they're kind of on the verge as well but
um you know you're getting a couple in
the petal pusher one and then a matte
black in this one your neutral palette
is all shimmery so I just think you
should be aware of that if you are a fan
of matte shadows however they have done
a terrific job of making all of the
shimmery shadows in these palettes
really pop and really look great so I
think this would be a great little you
know gift item if maybe you're starting
thinking about Valentine's Day or maybe
even for your for your daughter or a
best friend or somebody to pop in a
little Valentine's Day basket or
something these are really fun and so
affordable for the amount of amount of
shadows you get I think you're gonna
realize once you start using it just how
many options you have thanks for
watching I hope you enjoyed this review
of these products and
let me know what you if you like them if
you've tried them yet and what you like
to do with them so thanks again for
watching guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
