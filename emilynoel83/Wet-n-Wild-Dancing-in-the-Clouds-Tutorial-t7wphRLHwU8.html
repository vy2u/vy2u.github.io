video because it's kind of a request
because in my last video I told you all
about those new wet and wild dream
weavers trios that should be coming out
in stores very soon if they're not where
you live already and I asked in that
video which one you wanted to see a
tutorial on and that doesn't mean only
gonna do one tutorial but I just kind of
wanted to get a feel for which one you
guys were most excited about and I was
happy because the one that got the most
buzz in the comments section is the one
that one of my favorites in the group as
well and it is called dancing in the
clouds two metallic shades one's kind of
a gold and one's more of a rose gold and
then a purple and in wet and wild
palettes they always specify like brow
bone crease and eyelid I think you can
see those kind of stamped into these
shades but you don't have to use them
that way and I really didn't with this
look I chose to put the purple kind of
in closest to my eye to get more
intensity and to sort of bring out my
eye color more but you can use this a
lot of different ways as well the first
time I actually use this I didn't even
use the purple at all and I went with
more of a you know bronzy gold look so
it's really versatile it's a fun palette
to play with and if you want to see how
I put this look together keep watching
so I first primed my lid with my NYX
eyeshadow primer HD eye primer which I
really like and then I'm going to use
kind of like a second base for this look
because it coordinates so well with the
purple in this palette and it is the wet
and wild idolized pencil in techno and
I've bought a few of these before and I
think they work really well as just
getting some good base color down there
I'm taking it just up to the crease as
well I always like to blot over any
cream I do with my finger to make sure
there's not too much product on there
also going to take it just underneath as
well then I'm gonna go to my dancing
with the clouds palette and I'm going to
take the purple shade in here and the
reason why I chose to use the palette
this way was so the purple would really
be closest to my eye and I felt like it
would have the greatest impact as far as
you know really enhancing my eye color
and continue to Pat that up into the
crease as well using a pencil brush I'm
gonna just carry that purple around
there's a shade in this palette labeled
eyelid and I might have described this
as kind of a bronzy color in my first
video talking about these palettes but
it really strikes me is more of a rose
gold it's got just the most beautiful
warmth to it and one thing you do need
to be careful about with most of the wet
and wild shimmery shades if you've never
used these palettes before they carry
like if you stick your brush or an
applicator in them they carry a lot of
products so definitely tap off and make
sure you're not getting too much taking
this shade this beautiful warm rose gold
and overlapping the purple that we
brought up to the crease and i'm just
using use whatever crease brush you feel
fits your eye best this is the Sigma SS
222 and you'll find because this is
shimmery it's going to capture the light
you know where the light can directly
hit it but as it gets closer to your
crease it becomes a darker shade I love
how versatile this palette and there's a
shade labeled brow bone and this is
going to be our highlight this is a nice
metallic gold if you applied this
in a really you know dense way with just
like packing it on it could be super
metallic but in the way I want to use it
for this look is to make it extremely
sheer I'm just overlapping a little bit
of the rose gold shade also take a q-tip
or a small detail brush see how we got
this kind of glossy effect going on
around the tear duct as well really want
the shadow to be the focal point of this
look so I kept the liner as simple as
possible I'm using my Maybelline line
stiletto eyeliner because I feel like it
has such a fine tip I can get the
slimmest line possible I'm not winging
it out I'm just going from inner to
outer corner for the lower lash line I'm
gonna be using a NYX slide-on pencil
these are so long wearing guys and this
one is called purple blaze and once
again I am keeping this very close to
the lash line making that all the way in
next I'm going to curl my lashes and I'm
going to apply my L'Oreal double extend
carbon black mascara is really great for
length so it's going to be a primer coat
and then you can do as many coats as you
want of the black on top of that and I
will join you at the finish line
it's amazing how a trio can give you so
many options when they do throw in that
one you know kind of oddball shape
instead of giving us a you know a brown
or a deep bronze you know we got purple
and here to play with in terms of blush
and lips for a look like this I kind of
played off of not so much the purple but
of course but like kind of the rose gold
and gold shades so I chose a blush that
I thought would be somewhat neutral but
still kind of give off that same effect
so this is Milani blush it's the baked
blush and Rose de Oro and so as you can
see it's kind of a dusty rose with some
gold weave throughout so it's it's
really a pretty subtle blush look I
think but it gives your cheeks a little
bit of a glow and then on my lips I use
one of my favorite Revlon Super Lustrous
glosses this is in foiled and so I think
this kind of you know works right
alongside the golden II kind of
metallics in this look so it's subtle
it's not commanding attention you know
versus this kind of interesting eye we
have going on so I hope you enjoyed the
look thank you so much for taking the
time to watch and like I said keep an
eye out on my channel because there were
lots of other palettes that you guys
were interested in seeing tutorials on
as well so I will keep working on those
and thanks again have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
