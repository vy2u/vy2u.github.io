well for you today this video is going
to be really exciting because it's on a
highly anticipated limited edition
collection of wet and wild eyes shadows
so this is the Dream Weaver collection
there are six and I have all of them to
tell you about today and kind of tell
you what my favorite ones are show some
swatches and sort of talk about some
other comparable palettes in the wet and
wild line that may help you determine
whether or not you even need some of
these
so I'll go through that in a minute
first off I did want to mention a little
announcement here that I was selected as
a wet and wild Beauty ambassador which
was so cool because I mean I have been
reviewing wet and wild stuff on my
channel since like the beginning of my
channel basically and so I guess they at
some point in time stumbled upon what
I'm doing here on beauty broadcast and I
think this is something they do on a
monthly basis as well with different
bloggers I guess what that means for me
is not really anything different from my
channel I'm still going to provide you
with the same types of reviews you know
that I gave before but I think this will
allow the allow word to spread a little
bit more about beauty broadcast which i
think is a good thing because I totally
stand behind my reviews 100% and if more
people can find out about them and
either save a few dollars on their next
product or figure out a great new
product that solves a lot of their
problems you know I'm all for that so I
think they may be able to you know
promote my videos on their social media
websites I got things falling off my lap
period and also give me the chance to
try out some limited edition stuff so I
can you know throw out some videos and
let you guys know what's in store this
is the Dreamweaver collection trios from
wet and wild run about $2.99 and these
are expected to be in stores by mid-july
should be turning up pretty soon
wherever wet and wild is sold near you
there are six different palettes and
just to show you a little example here
just the way wet and wild trios are
composed and they have a brow bone shade
a crease shade and
she doesn't mean you have to use in that
way I often don't always use them that
way but they're split like that you have
two applicators one is a sponge tip
applicator one is one that I never use
which has a it's a blunt cut little
brush here I wish they would replace
that with another sponge tip but um
anywho that's what you get first what
I'm going to talk about is this palette
called earth looks small from down here
it's kind of a long name but this is
what you're getting here three shades
and they are kind of in green the green
and blue family this top shade is really
pretty it's probably my favorite shade
in the whole kit because it's kind of
like a greenish gold so it's kind of
unique haven't seen that shade and a lot
of the wet-and-wild palettes and then
you get a really nice crease shade here
which is a pigmented royal blue and then
for the eyelid shade you're getting a
green this is not one of my favorite
palettes and the kit simply because I'm
not nuts about wearing a lot of these
shades together I might pick out one of
these colors like maybe just the green
and then take a black you know from our
another random palette and use that to
kind of work with it a little bit I want
to point out also that if you kind of
like this color scheme at least these
bottom two shades and you have the pride
palette you can see there on that green
this blue right over here so just keep
that in mind if you have this this is
pretty similar with the exception of
that top color and this is called bright
idea look at these bright shades isn't
this so happy just to look at it and as
I swatch these and as I've worked with
these I mean I have kind of worn these
in different capacities not necessarily
all three shades at the same time and
you don't have to with any of these but
in swatching these I noticed that the
brow bone shade this yellow is sort of
like the weakest out of the bunch it you
know just didn't quite swatch with as
much intensity and took a little more
work to build up however I love this
crease shade which is a green that
actually has as it catches the light
maybe you can sense the golden undertone
that that has and the pink is really
nice as well so if you are looking for
you know a basic colorful palette you
know
that would be nice I can't really tie
this to any other wet-and-wild pallets
that I have it's just all personal
preference if you need these shades you
know go for it because these two are
great this one's not bad but just not as
soft and creamy as these bottom two
this one's called enter a new realm one
has a killer silver I love this silver a
matte black and a red and as soon as I
saw this I thought oh hey that reminds
me is a limited edition Christmas
palette and what was this one called
I don't know the name of this but I just
always think of it as the red and black
palette because it's got that red and
the black and then some neutrals down
the side and that silver as well the
black and this palette has sparkle this
one is matte so that's probably the only
difference that I can note but if you
didn't get that you wanted to try
similar shades this is it again I love
the metallic nature of the silver you
can't go wrong with having a matte black
from wet and wild I mean it's it's
fantastic I would probably go on do some
silver on the lid there's some black on
the outside and then you know how I kind
of like to blend out a deep shade in the
crease with a warm shade the red can do
that and that can be a really fun look
so I like this one and like I said it's
crazy how similar it is to that other
limited edition one but if you didn't
get your hands on it here's your chance
again this one's called fly me to the
moon and what you're getting here is a
really super frosty white a black with
spark and a blue that comes off with I
just kind of Reese washed it to remind
myself it's got like kind of a pearly
finish but it's definitely not like
super shimmery so I mean as you see it
kind of hit the light you know these are
so fun they're fun to wear together I
see this as a wearable look a wearable
way to incorporate color because you
know when I do want to put color on I
might put a bright shade on my lids such
as this blue but then I will use that
black shade to kind of tone it down and
create some contrast and use this as a
liner or use it in the crease or an
outer V or something like that and then
I've got a great highlight as well you
want something that's kinda like it
you're getting a sparkly blue and a
frosty white in the blue had me at hello
palette you're the one thing you're not
getting is there's not a blue in this
palette that really compares to that one
but if you're out forgetting mainly the
black and the frosty white you can get
it in that eight pan palette and now to
a couple of my favorites this one is
called dancing in the clouds and I
really wasn't sure what to expect at
first when I looked at this because I
just kind of thought what's going on
here like I just I this isn't a typical
pairing of shadows you know how
sometimes you'll just see different
palettes in the drugstore and you're
like oh that's a likely combination you
know but this one I kind of looked at
for a second I was like hmm interesting
and so the top shade and the bottom
shade are killer
metallic colors it's like a a really
nice non brassy looking gold and a
pretty copper color so those are
wonderful
this purple has actually um this one is
definitely not gonna come off looking
just like it does in the packaging
because this actually has an iridescent
blue tone to it when it hits the light
have always been a fan of kind of
pairing purple and gold so this would be
a nice way to do that and this is just
gonna be a little bit softer purple and
these are really like out now like wowza
metallics so um I hope you get your
chance to get this one because this is
really nice finally this was the first
palette when I looked at it I thought
I'm gonna love that one and there's a
reason why because the shade called or
the palette called we're blasting off is
totally similar to where is it one that
I already really like and that's called
the silent treatment and this is silent
treatment is not limited edition but
these pre shades actually even though
this one looks like has a little more
purple to it that's also similar to the
petal pusher one that's kind of a dupe
for Mac Beauty marked but it reminds me
they go on it goes on a lot like that
one too
nice deep dark and rich with a little
shimmer the bottom shades are really
nice taupe colors that are almost
exactly alike and then the only
difference is your brow bone shade here
is a lot more pink and that's more peach
you could just select these two shades
like I did today you know I didn't mess
around with the pink but I did kind of
the metallic taupe into this deeper
color and you'll get a pretty look that
way so great to have in your collection
of all these palettes this one you know
gives you a little more of that neutral
feel and a lot of people will see that
as more wearable day to day I really
like that one really like dancing in the
clouds those are kind of my top picks I
also enjoyed this palette which is
called fly me to the moon with the blue
I think this is a good one as well so
these are kind of like love these like
these and then these you know there's
nothing that I can really point out as
being wrong with these these are just
not typically once I might reach four
you might love them you might need those
colors in your collection so just keep
that in mind I hope you now know what to
keep an eye out for in your drugstore
next time because these again are priced
just like the other ones are $2.99
I love these airings I'm sorry guys I
got these from Claire's I got to show
you these they have a little sparkly
ball there and I'm all about these
feather earrings guess what
they're so light nor would you guess but
it's got a cute little like polka-dotted
feather and then this teal feather and
everybody was asking me like I got asked
if I had the feather hair extensions in
actually so there's a thought you know
you don't have to get the extensions you
can just put a big your ears but anyways
thank you so much for watching this
video have a great day and I'll see you
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
