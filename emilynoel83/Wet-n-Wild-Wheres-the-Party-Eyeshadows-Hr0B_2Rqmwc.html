in just wanted to give you a quick
heads-up on several new wet-and-wild
products they are out with some new 8
color palettes three of them to be exact
and it's a collection called where's the
party it's in a special little display
of certain drugstores for example I
found mine at CVS they were like $4.99
five dollars each pretty much what these
kinds of pallets run that are already
part of the wet and wild line downs to
me like a lot of people are either
seeing them in Walgreens or CVS stores
video I'm just going to give you a
little rundown about what I think of
each and show you some swatches so you
can decide if this is something you want
to try to find in your area three
pallets are called drinking a glass of
shine and if you're a big wet and wild
fan this might look familiar to you I'll
get to that in a minute it's called
Sparkle till morning and this is kind of
a neutral type palette and then shimmer
the night away it's like you're half
smoky half kind of purple and blue
colorful palette by the way thank you so
much to all the people who are like I
saw you on the wet and wild display
there is like a display of 99-cent wet
and wild products where I along with
some other bloggers are featured on the
display and I thought that was crazy
like one of the first people who told me
about it like they sent me a picture and
I knew something like that was coming
out but I didn't know when I didn't know
what it would look like and so when you
guys started sending me pictures I was
like wow this is super Glink you for the
congratulations Tyler my husband even
found it at the Walgreens where we live
and he like took his picture next to it
on to my little review of everything
first off this one called drinking a
glass of shine as I said it's the exact
same thing as the I heart matte palette
I heart matte came out for like a
limited time at Walgreens so while I was
like oh it's too bad you know it's the
same exact palette but at the same time
if you missed out on the I heart matte
now you have another chance to pick it
up and I already have my I heart matte
one open so that's the one I'm going to
be kind of referencing here but was
literally the same colors all matte
shadows you get some fun colors like the
green and the blue and the purple but
then you've got great basic matte shades
through the whole new
family from like a light light beige to
a peachy color dark brown and dark black
and I was just using this palette the
other day and it's just so easy to work
with
really not much fall out with these
shades either which is impressive really
do pack a punch and it's just a great
set of basic line myself sometimes
coming to it even when I use like a
different palette that has shimmer but I
just wanted that dark brown or I just
wanted the black it's great to pull from
just four individual colors Sparkle tell
morning is such a pretty palette this is
a palette of neutrals bronzy colors a
great coral a great kind of turquoise
color it makes me think kind of summer
as I look at it but yet many of these
shades are just phenomenal basics for
any time of year it doesn't matter when
and actually I was using this one in
conjunction with my matte palette just
the other day I did a matte look
basically going like neutral on the lid
dark brown in the outer corner in the
crease and then I used these awesome
like kind of warm colors to blend out my
crease a little bit and give just a
really pretty like warm cozy almost
fall-like effect with this pretty copper
on you might also notice as you look at
these palettes they are stamped in with
brow bone eyelid crease or definer and
so that gives you an idea of how to use
them you don't have to use them that way
I found myself getting you know using
them a totally different way more often
than none of this brow bone shade it
kind of reminds me of a color in the
walking on eggshells palette as does the
one called crease I feel like those are
both pretty darn similar to walking on
eggshells mind it because I feel like it
fits really well those shades fit really
well with this palette and I love this
definer shade I feel like the shimmer
truly does come through and then put it
on kind of opaque on the eye and you
will really see the pretty sparkle of
that color has outstanding colors love
it and like I said it works great when
you pull in like but if I cover up the
colorful part of this palette and put
like those two sides together it's
really a nice little pairing the final
one is called shimmer the night away and
this one is your half smoky shades and
then half really colorful shades
instantly
when I saw this it made me think of the
don't steal my Thunder tree oh here
there you're getting an ultra shimmery
silver you're getting a white and you're
getting essentially this kind of
gunmetal looking shade right here that's
what comes in this trio if this is
basically all you're interested in in
this palette and you think man I
wouldn't wear those colors just go out
and get the don't steal my thunder trio
because that's pretty much what this is
but you do get one more color which is a
sparkly black as far as these shades go
I find this top color to be really
pretty it's kind of like a dusty pink
it's not pure pink it's not bubblegum
it's almost got like a little bit of
lilac a little bit of pink maybe just
the slightest bit of golden this eyelid
shade is super gorgeous
it's like purple with blue undertone
it's a complex kind of shiny metallic
really really pretty when it hits the
light these two shades down here I mean
they really look kind of like matte
colors but with sparkle just thrown into
them and I don't love them I don't feel
like they have the same rich texture
that many of these other all of these
other you know shades and the palettes
have I feel like they're just a little
more flaky a little less rich and just
dense and creamy feeling blue maybe a
little better than the purple but I just
don't find them as good to work with us
the rest the smoky side um can do no
wrong in my opinion I love these shades
I've loved this trio so I definitely
like that nice basic smoky look to have
and then again you can take you know
some of these shades and then bring in
the matte palette and you've got a whole
other twist that you can start putting
on these shadows as a whole love to see
that wet and wild is putting out some
more eight color palettes
sure if these are going to be adopted
into the regular line at some point or
if these are completely limited-edition
I will let you know when I find out more
but meanwhile I would say keep an eye
out for them in your drug stores because
button wild puts out wonderful
eyeshadows and I forgot I would love to
do a tutorial with one of these or a
combination of them so please let me
know if there's something that
interested I'd be more than happy to
make some tutorials there
see you guys later I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
