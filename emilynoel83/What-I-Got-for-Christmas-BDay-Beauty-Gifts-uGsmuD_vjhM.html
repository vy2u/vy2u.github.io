are having a wonderful holiday season
end of the year it's been seems like a
really long time since I sat down to do
a video because I've been gone for the
past week I traveled back home with
Tyler and cupcake for Christmas at his
house then my house then we have my
birthday on the 27th and then did adjust
this past weekend so the end of that
week Tyler's sister got married and so
it was just been a whirlwind of travel
we just had been away from home for a
solid week and food me that seems like a
long time able to post a couple new
videos I have it get ready with me video
I had shot days before that and then got
that posted last week as well as kind of
a last-minute holiday look using green
glitter eyeliner so if you haven't seen
those definitely checking them for now I
thought I would show some of the things
that I got for Christmas and my birthday
you guys know I tend to like to ask her
some high-end beauty related gifts
around this time of year and so I
thought I'd show you what I came up with
these things I specifically asked for
and then some I was totally surprised
but just off something I was really
hoping to get was this little palette
from bareMinerals it's there ready I
shadow and it's totally mirrored there
but this palette is called the finer
things and it is just a gorgeous
selection of their pressed eyeshadows I
just love this grouping of shades
especially love is kind of pink and then
sort of a purpley taupe color that black
is phenomenal a matte gray and the white
is good for this I'd only had a duo of
these pressed shadows and really liked
that but here I'm able to try more and a
variety of finishing and also use this
for makeup on the bride Sarah he just
looked gorgeous I used a little bit of
the black a little bit of the sort of
topi gray color here some of this gray
as well and the white and it just turned
out so beautiful so I'm really really
enjoying that and that came with a
little
I'm time eyelid Prime another thing that
I asked for got from my parents this
little kit from Dior it's the new look
mascara and it comes with a little
eyeshadow set as well so just a brand
new mascara
I was curious to try it just to kind of
see how you know a really high-end
mascara would stack up with some of the
other things I've tried and the claim
with this I guess is to really define
each lash and it also has some
properties in there that are supposed to
help with lash growth the brush is
really tiny if you know typical Diorshow
it's a huge brush and this is a little
rubber bristle brush and I feel like it
really like loads your lashes down with
mascara I've got it on today and I feel
like my lashes are just kind of clumpy
and thick and not really separated like
they claimed so I don't know if this is
gonna be one of those mascaras that gets
better with time I'm definitely going to
keep using it because my initial
reactions on mascaras tend to sometimes
not be the same you know just a few
weeks down the road so I'll keep you
posted on that it came with a little
eyeshadow tour color eyeshadow palette
and I thought it was gonna be a lot
bigger than it was it's like tiny these
are itty bitty colors here but it's kind
of a mix of like matte and satin finish
neutrals and I'm wearing that on my eyes
today I've also got some lorac lustre
drops for that glittery finish on there
but I used kind of just diagonally right
down here I used those shades and I mean
they're great quality they really are
are nice colors but I just like that's
so well I also got a little um skincare
set here from Clinique I don't have the
box anymore but I believe it was called
better brighter skin and this came from
Sephora and I had asked for this because
I was wanting to try the Clinique um
even better clinical dark spot corrector
cuz I do have a couple spots that I
would like to see if this does anything
went on and this is kind of like a serum
type texture so I got that it also comes
with the even better skin
tone correcting moisturizer with SPF 20
so from what I understand I can put this
on any spots that I have used this
moisturizer all over and then something
I haven't used yet is the 7-day scrub
cream rinse off formula so I guess
that's supposed to just help with the
radiance of your skin so that is in
there as well it looks like a pretty
small ish size here this is yeah one
fluid M parents also got me the
philosophy I believe it's the home for
the holidays kit with the like for
shower gels and for lip shines but we
were traveling so much and trying to fit
everything into the car and I didn't
want him to sit out in the car while we
were at the wedding I didn't want him to
freeze or anything all this other stuff
I could you know fit in my little makeup
tote bag but they're good all that I was
like I don't want to risk losing that so
they're gonna get that to me a little
bit later we've been keeping up with my
videos you know I purchased a lot of the
like holiday makeup kits ahead of time
so I could review them for you guys and
my sister knew that and she usually gets
me you know makeup kits but she was like
this time I've got to think out of the
box maybe some brands that I don't
already have to come up with something
some makeup related gift and she always
likes to surprise me so I give no input
on this but she got me some really cool
things and I've been trying some of them
one was extremely handy for the wedding
this is the red carpet color body glow
just read you the description here the
first ever luminous body lotion that
will stay put and not transfer onto your
clothes this innovative all-over body
lotion provides gorgeous glowing
coverage for imperfections such as
pigmentation veins cellulite stretch
marks age spots and wrinkles helps your
skin look super sexy younger and healthy
instantly I use this for the wedding
because I was a bridesmaid and I was in
like a strapless dress and I just this
was beautifully I'm gonna want a jumbo
of this I have a feeling sir got some
expert advice on things to get for me
and so this was one of those things and
I really really like it also got me
something from sleek which is a brand
that I really need to dig into and get
some products from but she got me a
sleek blush and the
here is flamingo I am wearing that today
and as you can see it can be very much
sheared out from this color but gorgeous
so much pigment in this blush I must
have more like I mean that's that's
always the feeling I get when you find
like something great a great formula in
one color you just want to try all the
other colors but this shade is beautiful
and I couldn't be more impressed with
that blush I've heard great things about
these blushes and yeah it's true they're
awesome so a lipstick here from Lime
Crime maybe you've heard of this brand I
don't know much about it at all I have
seen people you know show a lipstick or
something and they look so fun it's got
like a unicorn on the outside and this
it's vegan lipstick made in the USA and
this shade is called retro futurist and
it is a gorgeous red and I've got that
on today love the color love the
brightness so saturated even even smells
kind of good I'm not sure what it smells
like but I like it and I'm also wearing
that in conjunction with something else
you got me a couple of the obsessive
compulsive cosmetics lip tars and I'm
wearing this darker one just to kind of
provide a little more um instead of just
one flat lip color give the lips a
little dimension with a little darkness
on the outsides but this shade this deep
shade is called vintage and these are
the most pigmented things in the world I
just wear this is trollop this light
kind of pinky corely shade and I can't
believe it like I've never tried these
before they come with their own little
lip brushes and I think I still have
some of that red I put some on my finger
and I'm like whoa it like stained my
finger so I'm interested to see how long
this stays on I've even after putting
this stuff on I've been drinking my
coffee and stuff still on there
definitely full-on holiday red lip so I
love it love getting to try these new
things sister also surprised me with a
couple of books one is vogue the covers
and this
really cool if you're a fashion and
beauty lover it truly is all the covers
of Vogue magazine some are big a really
big book so it's hard to show but tons
of makeup inspiration in here I haven't
had much of a chance to really dig into
this and look at each and every page yet
but I think this is going to be so fun
to have out and just to flip through
from time to time she got me another
book that I just started reading last
night and this was hard to put down it's
classic beauty the history of makeup and
this is so freaking good I love beauty
books I've got quite a few I think it's
so fun to you know have them because you
continually refer to them to get new
ideas or for information on this little
thing or that but this is so so
interesting because it is the true
timeline of when makeup began it takes
you back to ancient Egypt ancient Greece
go on and you see the development of
brands that we know now like Maybelline
and covergirl and you know you see there
are timelines throughout it see the the
old ads as well I mean it's fascinating
stuff if you're a makeup nerd at like I
am you would love this for sure well
take you like I said decade by decade
and really dig in and look at the
classic iconic look of that time period
so like I open it up to the 1960s here
it tells you you know what was going on
at that time and what people were doing
with their makeup and you know what
kinds of colors were used and what
celebrities were you know like the icons
during that time that we're mimicked for
their makeup there's Sophia Loren there
are the things I find the most
fascinating is how advertising has
change you get to see the classic like
popular products of the time is just
like a huge makeup scrapbook from the
beginning of time to now I'm having so
much fun with this thank you so much pup
for all the great gifts I had asked for
a few books specifically as well from my
parents I wanted a couple of the Jemma
Kid books because when I did a video on
Beauty books many people said you should
check out the Gemma kid once
and so she's got makeup masterclass so
this one is kind of like beauty based as
a
lot of close-up picture how to's and
then she's also got like a lot of top
ten things you know makeup over whole
this might be something fun to blog
about her you know maybe do a video
based on her suggestion she's got some
good ones on when to throw things
now I haven't really read a lot of that
one yet but I've got it here also have
makeup secrets and this is her newer
book this came out in 2012 on skincare
there as well for at least a third of
the book there and then she goes through
some classic iconic looks all the basic
looks as well so there's tons of
information to be gotten from a book I
was really really excited about because
I love Scott Barnes about face and now
he's got face to face yes that is Kim
Kardashian on the cover and he is all
about transformations and he features so
many celebrities in here sample Kathy
Griffin you know he takes a celebrity
gives them you know completely normal
classic makeup and then takes them to a
whole new level but he's done with
Vanessa Williams in here incredible
that's Vanessa Williams both pics read a
little bit of this so far I'm loving I
can't believe I almost forgot my big
gift from Tyler he got me tickets to
IMATS
in New York in April I am so excited to
be there I can't wait I hope many of you
will be there too so I can meet you and
I can just experience the whole eye mask
thing I've never been to one before he
knew I've been wanting to go for so long
many years here my work schedule has
been in the way and now I will be able
to experience that and just you know
have a lot of fun with it I can't wait
to make that trip and he will be there
with me too it was just gonna be really
fun my reaction when he gave me that
gift he like hid little clues in
different boxes and on my birthday
morning I opened it up and I was just
like freaking out kind of in shock like
I couldn't believe he went behind my
back made all the plans necessary to do
this and I am just thrilled so can't
wait for that anyway I've been getting a
lot of questions about the Emily awards
they will be coming at some
point in January I don't know exactly
when yet I'm still making some decisions
on different products and just going
through my whole process of figuring it
out it seems like it grows every single
year and there are new categories and
new products to think about so just a
heads up keep your eye out for the Emily
Awards definitely join me on Twitter and
the beauty broadcasts Facebook page
because I'll keep you updated on the
progress and let you know exactly when
you can expect those very soon so thanks
