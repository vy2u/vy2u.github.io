this video is going to be my what I got
for Christmas and my birthday I'm kind
of a haul video I guess just some really
generous people in my life who gave me
some awesome kind of beauty related
gifts I do feel very fortunate that what
I do for a living here on YouTube is my
true genuine interest in life and I love
how the two things overlap and the
things that I just recreationally want
to play with and that feel like my hobby
yeah you know it's makeup related stuff
my birthday is December 27th that's two
days after Christmas and some of these
things are Christmas presents summer
birthday presents and I'll just jump in
and share with you and as for my parents
they do always ask me for like some
specific things that I might be
interested in because they really like
to have some direction with the gifts
and I'm not gonna lie I can be difficult
to give to because I already own a ton
of makeup things and a lot of the
holiday stuff I already purchased but
there are still some things that I was
really into and I thought you might be
interested to see what those were first
off this came from Nordstrom it's the
Smashbox photo op mega palette do you
guys remember when there was a mega
palette it was actually called that very
thing and it came out on QVC like I
don't know was it four years ago it was
a red palette and it folded out with two
sides and it had like every eyeshadows
Smashbox made it had brow stuff it had
blushes it was like the whole nine yards
and I've never seen anything quite like
that again from Smashbox this does not
really hold the candle to that in terms
of size it's this big but it does have a
lot of eyeshadows in it and I just can't
get enough of Smashbox eyeshadows it's
got a bunch of trios you can see eight
different trios they're very excited
about this one here with the gold and
the burgundy there's a great olive trio
as well so I think this is going to be a
lot of fun to play with because you have
you know the direction for a quick look
with the trios but then you can totally
mix and match throughout the whole set
there are three blushes in here as well
one thing that really baffles me is that
the palette just folds together there
was no dividing sheet here and that kind
of bothers me it's not like any of these
products really generate a whole lot of
fallout but it's essential
where I'll definitely make a point to
make sure there aren't a lot of loose
particles when I go and push the pallet
back together but you got a very neutral
peachy blush a light pink and kind of
like a deep coral that this was a
Nordstrom exclusive I believe and I love
Smashbox eyeshadows so I was really
excited to get that also for Mom and Dad
and I believe this came from Nordstrom
as well this is from Kiehl's
and it's the ultra facial collection set
I'm really hoping in the New Year to
branch out into some new skincare type
items just want to inform myself and
educate myself more on different kinds
of skincare I've tried a few keel
samples here and there and anything I've
tried I've really really loved so this
has the ultra facial toner I've kind of
love how simple and just classic those
packaging is it's got the ultra facial
cleanser there's a little midnight
recovery concentrate really excited to
try that this is the hydro plumping
retexturizing serum concentrate and then
you've got a good sized tub here of the
ultra facial cream so I cannot wait to
start using that I haven't tried any of
it yet my skin I can totally tell right
now the weather's getting colder my skin
is starting to get more dried out and
look at the inner part of this bag isn't
that cute now you might remember last
year I got this really cool like an
eyeshadow palette stack thing I think it
was called the masterpiece collection
remixed or something for the brain
called Shanny
it was really cool how the palettes all
like pulled out like drawers and it was
mostly eye palettes there was one cheek
palette in there and I was really
impressed with the quality of the
eyeshadows and I've been using them on
and off I really want to use more of
them but a cute little companion to that
that I got this time is the mini
masterpiece makeup kit and so this is
smaller and it contains right here you
can see it's all face related stuff
there are six separate palettes I'll
just pull them out for you and show you
there's a concealer palette with a bunch
of different shades and some kind of
corrector shades as well here's a powder
blush palette with some kind of more
natural type shades there's a cream
foundation slash I could see that being
like cream contour palette there's a
powder blush palette with a bunch of
deeper tones a powder blush palette with
some super super
created colors these kind of remind me
of a few shades of the la femme blushes
that I have and then down here you've
got powders that could act as face
powders maybe a couple of them more
contour type powders but I'm just really
excited to dig into this I haven't used
any of these yet on my face I've just
watched a few shades here and there but
it magnetizes shut it's a really nice
little box set and I'm interested to see
if I like the face stuff as much as I
like the eyeshadows one other thing for
Shanna here is this natural look eyes
shadow palette kind of interested to try
one of their smaller sets and it's just
got a lot of really pretty neutrals in
here there's some metallic colors and
the shades I'm wearing today I've got
like these two here in my crease which
this one's kind of peachy it's really
interesting got a little bit of rose
tone to it
this is more plumbing I've got this peak
matte peach on the inner part of the lid
and the matte Brown on the outer corner
and kind of smudged below the eye as
well really really love the color
selection in here I'm just easy to grab
for quick everyday looks I mean I knew I
liked the quality of these shadows but
this is just a really great little
palette another thing that I got and
that these are so adorable and they're
even smaller than I anticipated but
they're really really cute it's from
Charlotte Tilbury and it's the kissing
kis si ng fallen from the lipstick tree
mini lipstick charms so you get this
little box and outcome these three
little lipsticks and they've got the
ribbon attached so I think you could
probably tie that up and like hang them
literally hang them on a tree if you
wanted to but there are three great
really creamy shades I was wearing one
of these the other day and I just loved
the way it went on and I have only tried
the matte revolution lipsticks from
Charlotte Tilbury slide and this formula
is just really really creamy it's very
comfortable to wear and so this shade is
called pardon my french here bitch
perfect and it's a really nice it looks
like kind of a peachy nude
you've got Penelope pink here which is
just a really delicate pretty nude color
that was the only one I've worn so far
then this red is called so Marilyn and
so that's just a really classic kind of
red
throw looking bright red I really love
these pretty rose gold tubes and there's
so much detail on the packaging too
there's little stars all across the top
and then the Charlotte Tilbury logo
there so it's so cute now my sister pup
got me some really fun like accessory
type items she also painted me a
gorgeous picture of Belle she painted a
photo that I had taken of her back when
she was 10 months old
and she's standing in this little like
floral outfit and her little pose is
just so cute and I think she painted it
with the thought that it would look
really good here in the makeup room so I
can't wait to hang that up it's gorgeous
and pop also got me this really cool
thing I cannot wait to try because if it
works I see myself using it all the time
it's lip chic by Ella
it says transparent sealer for lipstick
it's got some instructions here that
I'll need to read and then it looks like
clear nail polish it says the
transparent sealer for lipstick apply
lipstick and Blanc with tissue brush
with lip chic allow to dry keeping lips
apart so we'll see how it goes there are
definitely some lip products that I own
that I love the color of but I would
really love if they could have better
staying power so thank you pop I can't
wait to try that now my buddy David and
I've told you he's an Estee Lauder
makeup artist in New York he has access
to some amazing luxury products and he
completely spoiled me for Christmas and
it just gave me some amazing things
including these YSL baby doll kits and
blush products here now I've heard about
these and I really think these are kind
of a similar concept to my NYX whipped
lip and cheek products you know a
comparison is going to be coming on
those right um but these the shades are
gorgeous I am actually wearing the red
on my lips today and that's the extent
to which I've tried them so far it's
just this one shade on my lips I haven't
tried them on my cheeks yet but it does
feel super lightweight but they're very
pigmented it's a little like wand
applicator like that this is shade 6
that's the red I also have shade one
which is that gorgeous pink and then
this coral is shade 13 now something
David knows that I love are the pure
color Envy sculpting lip
sticks not just for the quality of the
lipstick but also for the awesome
magnetic closure packaging you just
cannot beat that they're just luxurious
the colors are extremely pigmented and
they manage to wear a really long time
while never feeling remotely drying on
my lips so he gave me several shades
that I'd never tried and I really do
like to see what he recommends or what
he chooses for me so this shade is
called powerful isn't that gorgeous
it's so perfect impassioned is this
really pretty like bright reddish orange
shade I think that's gonna be awesome as
we head into spring I love that kind of
color this shade is called red ego it's
a deep kind of brick red and then this
color right here is insolent plum look
at that deep rich purple e berry shade
so awesome for wintertime I think Estee
Lauder has some of the best nail polish
packaging in the business this is the
shape called smashed
it's a gorgeous purple with kind of an
iridescent sparkle in there I think it's
so so pretty I need to do my nails in a
major way and even get my sister like
this really deep dark kind of almost
blackish blue so we're gonna have some
dramatic nails happening in this family
now something I have never tried from
Estee Lauder are the brushes and this is
the powder foundation brush so I do own
both the powder that's the loose kind
and also the pressed Double Wear compact
powder so this feels really nice and
soft it's kind of like a full brush but
it doesn't fan out too terribly far so I
think I'm gonna like that for just
control of the product I really don't
like my brushes to be too too big as I'm
sure David has heard me say so this is
full without being oversized so that's
gonna be fun I could see it being a good
like bronzer type brush too okay here's
a brand that I am not familiar with what
so ever and I've got a couple light kind
of seeing Kerr type items here well
one's a primer it's from Eve LOM and
it's the radiance perfected flawless
radiant primer it has an SPF 30 in it
and in this I haven't even unwrapped it
but it says it's like a cleansing cream
the directions say a black Lancer to the
face using circular movements dip the
muslin cloth in hot water and wring out
press onto the face hold for 5 seconds
repeat 3 times rinse the cloth in warm
water and remove all traces of makeup I
think this is going to be a lot of fun
to experiment with and let's see what
this primer looks like as I can easily
pull that out right now very cool very
luxurious looking packaging there's
primer really feels like a lightweight
moisturizer I wonder if you would
recommend using it in that way - no my
skin feels pretty hydrated after just
applying that so David thank you so much
you know me well I cannot wait to dig
into more of those products and try them
on for you guys for my birthday my
parents gave me this spec from Peter
Thomas Roth it's called cucumber detox
hydrating and soothing kit it's got one
of the gel masks which I love my Peter
Thomas Roth Rose gel mask so this is the
cucumber one it also has the cucumber
detox foaming cleanser the bouncy
hydrating gel and these are the deep
puffing IQs so I think it'll be kind of
like a spa type experience when I put
these on but I was so surprised to see
this size on the mask in this kit
because this is the size I have in the
rose mess and something I also love
about his gel masks is that they don't
have to be immediately rinsed off like
if you just want to apply a thin layer
you can actually leave it on over your
moisturizer wear it overnight and not
like in a goopy way but you know just a
thin amount of it and you get like extra
moisturizing hydrating benefits so I'm
really pumped about this I love how it
looks like green slime in there and this
is what that bouncy hydrating gel looks
like this is the foaming cleanser and in
the deep puffing eye cubes this says
freeze peel back and pop out so that's
gonna be fun I should like just shoot a
video as I'm using this stuff and let
you guys know how it's going again my
family really outdid themselves but my
parents also got me these hooda lashes
and these are in the style Samantha
number 7 and I had been looking at these
lashes quite a bit on Sephora's website
and I do follow who does YouTube channel
I think she's really awesome and
I'm wearing the Samantha style right now
and these are just beautiful lashes
really well made the band the band looks
thick but it actually is surprisingly
easy to work with and the lashes really
go all the way in on me to the complete
outer edge of my eye I probably could
have trimmed these up a little bit but
it was kind of like they look so pretty
I didn't want to touch him so I just
really made him work today and they do
feel really nice despite going all the
way into my inner corner these feel
really comfortable on the eyes and I
just think they look so pretty when you
look at them sideways they almost remind
me a little bit of like the Ardell
double stacks and that they are just
that fluttery there's like layers of
lashes in here instead of it being just
one single you know swoop of lashes for
lack of a better words so I'm loving
these these are like $20 lashes so I
don't have a lot of lashes like that in
my collection so it'll be interesting to
see how well they hold up how many uses
I feel like I can get out of them
because they may be you know worth that
price if I feel like I can use them all
the time over and over again Tyler for
Christmas gave me a really amazing gift
and he got me my first really really
nice luxury handbag actually and I've
been thinking this over quite a bit what
I might want if I were to ever get
something like this and I was just
feeling like a lot of the bags that I
have are you know the larger ones that I
carry they end up all being really slow
chi and just kind of like lobs and I
feel like I'm needing to carry more
things these days with Bell I like
having a bag that's a little larger so I
can take you know an extra diapers and
wipes a toy some food or something like
that in there and I also want something
crossbody that would be a little bit
larger than most of the crossbody things
that I have but you know it's just that
fine line and the bag that he ended up
getting me is just so so perfect in that
respect it holds a lot but it doesn't
overwhelm me I'm only like 5 feet tall
so like if I'm gonna wear about a bag
crossbody I don't want it to look like
I've got this massive thing on my hip
you know it's just a really beautiful
bag I see myself using it for years and
years to come smells so good it's so new
I really really love it another cool
thing that I want to mention that Bob
got me for my birthday is a subscription
to one table and I wasn't really
familiar with this service at all but
it's like you can get these monthly
boxes of it could be makeup it could be
accessories I think even clothes and
things like that sent to you by stylists
they've looked at these little online
surveys you've done and I guess put
together a collection of things that you
should like and judging by what you said
or the things that would look best on
you or work best for you so I am really
pumped to see what somebody might choose
for me based on my preferences that I've
laid out so I think you can get
different boxes each time depending on
what you want and I'm gonna be getting
them every month so it'll be fun to show
you guys what I end up getting through
this but the first one that I wanted to
get was makeup of course that I'll
totally branch out in future months and
see what some of the other options are
but it seems like so much fun and thank
you so much above you completely outdid
yourself this holiday but thank you guys
so much for watching this video gift
giving is so much fun it's really fun to
be on the giving end and it's always
super fun for me when the gifts I
receive are things that I can tell you
about they're relevant to my channel and
that I just really genuinely enjoy so
thank you for watching I'll see you next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
