this little session we're having here is
some kind of lip balm that I really like
um I'm sorry if my voice is getting kind
of low sort of scratchy I've been at
work today for a long time I was
reporting in the cold we're having an
ice storm right now hence why the hair
is kind of you know out of it right now
I've got out of it but I felt like doing
some videos so we're doing them and this
one like I said it's about lip balm just
a few ideas of stuff that I like maybe
you can share some things with me that
you like because I love lip stuff and if
you've seen my overview of my lip
collection or I mean this my collection
general you'll see how much of it is
made up of lip related stuff I've got
like this little container here like
full of what bombs but I'll hold out a
few that I really do like so I'm going
to just go now one is this is such a
cheap buy but it's a great thing it is
from cocoa care is the brand yes yeah
yeah
cocoa care cocoa butter football it's
pretty much just pure cocoa butter it's
got that cocoa butter smell if you've
ever smelled what cocoa butter is that's
what this is um I got this for 99 cents
they always sell this for 99 cents in a
little tub at Walgreens this is
something that actually my husband
swears by I picked this up because I
just heard over and over again people
say how good cocoa butter is for your
lips and so I try it now that's like oh
my gosh you know put it on before bed
it's like wow I do not have chapped lip
issues I just don't have them with this
and so my husband he also you know
battles with the you know being out cool
the wind you know get that crack what
stuff going on and so he put this on and
he doesn't like carry a lip balm on
we're I think throughout the day but
I'll put it off before it goes to bed
and he's like wow you know I'm doing
good so this is something that anybody
can use are you guy watching this and
you need some lip balm use this it's in
a very masculine yellow pursue and it
works really well got a very smooth
texture not sticky not shiny it's not
going to you know do anything phenomenal
to your lips except make them feel good
it's not going to be much about making
them appear shiny or whatever it just
going to make them soft and wonderful
so that is cocoa care cocoa butter as
sold in Walgreens for 99 cents the other
thing is soft lips you know this is like
something there's I think there's a
pretty big following out there for soft
lips products they're in these petite
little tubes you know as far as the
width goes you know you look at that
compared to that this is much skinnier
very easy to apply very soft as the name
implies this one is in French vanilla
it's and what protect an SPF 20 as well
just a really few feels good on your
lips Kaifeng maybe gives you just a
little bit of a sheen on there not much
just tiny bit um just a really smell
good feels good I really don't know how
much more I can describe this it's just
you know you find it at your your
drugstores again sometimes in sets of
three or you know they got like
strawberry mint and and different things
like that um but you know if you're
looking for something good something out
that also works quite well under a
lipstick like I put it on as you start
your makeup and then later on you put
your lipstick on over it and your lips
are very you know have you know taken in
all that moisture it's a good thing all
right so those are my like practical
choices for lip balm now my fun choices
then
this is the Betty Crocker whipped fluffy
white frosting lip balm and let me tell
you smells exactly like Betty Crocker
frosting from the can I'm so serious
about this what it is totally it totally
smells like that I will use this this is
another thing that I'll use like before
I put my lipstick or lip liner on or
whatever it gives you just a little bit
of a very subtle shine but as you can
see it's like a it's basically a quite
clear if transparent but it's just like
for the smell of that likewise I got
this at Claire's cuz they you know they
sell that whole um grouping of some
really random flavored stuff like
oatmeal cookie or dr. pepper or you know
diet coke flavor football for crying out
loud well they sell the fluffy white
frosting Betty Crocker flavor and it is
just great like like if you got one of
those cans of frosting in your cupboard
your refrigerator right now go open it
up and smell it I promise you if you
want that smell recreated on a daily
basis on your lips try this this is
really really great you're going to like
it it looks just like the pattern on the
can and it is phenomenal you're going to
love it
promise and another fun flavor of lip
balm fun product is the Sephora lip
butter this one that I'm holding right
here is in Bananas Foster flavor I also
have it in tiramisu and like layered
birthday cake or something like that and
these just these do give you just a
little bit of Sheen there's they're just
very very moisturizing they really it
really adheres to your lips it's not
going to slide around outside your mouth
it's got a little more thickness than
any other three that I just showed you
the scent is
credible I mean bananas I love bananas
this is you know a great recreation of
that on your lips and it comes in the
little little pot container um I really
like it it's just it's very moisturizing
you think lip butter you think of
something kind of rich this is sort of a
rich feeling on your lips I can't really
think of too many ways to describe this
stuff but like I said a few ideas for
what bombs we've got the cocoa butter
and the soft lips something more
practical very cheap again something was
not too expensive but amazing the
whipped lip balm and also you know Pro
step up the Sephora lip butter so just
an idea is there I'd like to hear what
you guys like as well because you know
chances are maybe I have that in my
collection maybe I forgot about it maybe
you know you give me some ideas I give
you some more ideas that kind of thing
so I thank you for watching and I hope
you guys have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
