doing some packing I'm going back home
for a little like family gathering
family dinner slash shower for the baby
and I'm really excited about it and
normally I want to shoot a video like
this like here's what I'm taking in my
travel bag I've meant to do this on so
many occasions but everybody knows how
it gets when you're packing and just
about getting ready to leave for
somewhere like you're stressing out
you're checking things off your list
you're trying to make sure you've got
everything and for some reason I'm just
feeling very mellow right now so I
thought I'm gonna go ahead and share
what's in this bag and I would call this
my road trip Beauty bag because if I
were flying it would be pared down
considerably and this is not a lesson in
how to pack lightly this is really not a
strategy and how to like get a really
compact bag together this is just the
true real-life fact of what I take as
far as beauty related stuff if I'm you
know driving somewhere go on somewhere
for a weekend for some people this is
gonna be like a comedy because you're
gonna be like what do you need to thanks
so much and others maybe you're right on
the same wavelength as me I like to have
my clothes and you know maybe some
toiletry items in one type of bag and
then just know that all of my beauty
related stuff is in one other kind of
tote bag in this tote bag was something
I got for free from Victoria's Secret
once it's just really nicely sized it's
durable its neutral and I just liked the
overall contents I've got bags within
bags that's how I roll here so I've got
this little bag this came from Clooney
and one small tip that I can pass along
is that I find I'm less stressed when it
comes to packing and traveling if I do
just keep you know some certain travel
things that I know I always want to take
with me already in a little bag that I'm
not using all the time it can just stay
in this black bag and then when it's
time to go somewhere I grab it and just
add you know a few things to it kind of
replenish it so in here I've got my
Tresemme my mini tray to hairspray love
that
don't leave home without it I don't
leave that's in my purse that goes with
me everywhere I've got this mini
Victoria's Secret bombshell body mist
that just lives in this bag this is a
Nick Chavez product it's called flocker
it's a nice little like volumizing thing
to use and after I style my hair I can
get a little bit of this in my hands tip
my head over and it just tends to like
amp up any style I'm doing so kind of an
all-purpose volumizer thing must have
q-tips in the little travel box as well
so they don't get all messed up love
traveling with the face wash cloths this
is what I use to like wash my face with
every night and sometimes it's Olay
brands sometimes it's the equate ones
which work great from Walmart but these
just sets up with water they are so
perfect for travel because you don't
have to go ask for someone else's
washcloths and get your day's worth of
makeup all over it you know they're
disposable and they remove everything
eyes fake my mom is actually on top of
things so I know she'll already have
them but I keep some of these in this
bag since I know I've gone and forgotten
them other places like I've got a little
teasing comb my brush is in my suitcase
and then just some random hair doodads I
keep a thing of some bobby pins retail
holders headbands and the camera just
fell over that can't be good on it
this camera bless its heart it's fallen
over so many times and it just keeps on
tickin for me not gone but I'm taking
this great little travel hot roller set
this is so small so compact I reviewed
this on the Express channel I'm loving
it it's from Conair like 15 bucks works
like a charm
and I just stuck some clips that I like
to use with that in a ziplock is my
makeup bag okay this is all of my makeup
that I take with me I reviewed this
Laurie Grenier bag
years ago and it continues to be the
thing that I take with this bag
internally I'm not gonna lie it could
use a good wipe down some of these
little compartments are getting a little
bit dirty I'll show you inside cuz how
it's laid out but if you just total
must-have things for me to take I'm
taking my Estee Lauder Double Wear the
maximum cover that I demoed
the melasma video I definitely want to
have that on me and have my good full
coverage looks for pictures and whatnot
another specific great for travel
product is the sleek face form
contouring palette it's got my contour
bronzer type thing highlight and blush
all together so I love that I also got a
pocket in here of mini products that
always stay in here like a mini primer
mini lip balm any moisturizer and I
always keep this elf makeup remover pen
in here as well it's so great for those
periodic like touch-ups that you need to
do and maybe it's not convenient to run
to a sink or to take a bottle of makeup
remover so this little pin is really
handsome inside this bag that I travel
with often it does open up kind of like
a book basically and I can actually snap
in yet another page so to speak of
little pockets in here I normally put
like some foundations and concealers in
one pocket so I've got you know my Estee
Lauder for my full coverage look I'm
taking some Bobbi Brown's stuff that I'm
kind of continuing to retest I talked
about that in a recent haul video I've
got my little sleek palette but also
some new bronzers from elf that I'm
testing out I don't know that these are
even totally available yet so those will
be a future review and all these pockets
just velcro open but I've got a couple
sets of red cherry lashes here I've got
this user and moisturizer that I've just
been enjoying and it hasn't been causing
problems not my skin so I thought I'd
just toss that in there my two-faced
brow Envy kit that I love sexy mama
mattifying powder from the balm is just
kind of a handy you know good to throw
on if need be for a touch-up I've got
the new Too Faced this is the cocoa
powder this is definitely going to be a
future review kind of like a powder
foundation some bare minerals bits over
on this side I've got three small
zippered pockets and up top like I said
mini stuff that's always in here that
little elf remover pin I've got a mini
pore fessional
this is a little tube of aqua for
I've got a couple of different mascaras
that Rimmel scandaleyes and this is just
a brow gel from NYX and down in the
bottom another great like travel
must-have would be this Milani shadow
eye stick because this can be an awesome
long wearing like nude base all over
your lids or I like to use this to
brighten my lower waterline so that's in
there I've got kind of a two-in-one
liner from NYX and the all-important
lash glue what are you guys most likely
to forget because for me I'm most likely
to forget lash glue and tweezers my
tweezers are somewhere up in here then
this page flips out and this is where
I've got my brushes and a few other
things sitting on top there are little
elastic bands that just hold my brushes
down so I've got like my sigma f84 p84
so great like foundation and concealer
type brushes some other face brushes
they're from Sigma's some Sonia Kashuk
eyeshadow brushes small and medium
shadow brushes that I love this is kind
of just floating around there from Real
Techniques but I love to have that comb
and brow brush there's a big kabuki
brush that can use for body and I just
keep a brush guard on that so that stays
nice in this extra elf brush that
complexion brush is so nice and
multi-purpose my eyelash curler that's
another thing I'm very prone to forget
so there you go that is the makeup bag
anyone else out there feel the need to
travel with a separate lip bag like you
could not possibly stash all the lip
products you want to take in here with
the rest of the makeup so you got to
give it its own bag I mean it's I just
can't be confined I can't be confined to
think okay I'm only gonna take these two
lip products heck no here's what's it
got some products that are kind of like
you know my homework and here as well
like things that I need to be trying and
testing and reviewing you know that
never stops even on the weekends or for
travel so like these Baby Lips crystal I
really need to be using them this is
pretty much par for the course for the
amount of lip products I might take on a
short trip I'm talking just a couple
days you'd be honest with me do you take
more or less than this but I think I
don't know I think this is fairly
conservative for me but I've got a lip
balm from soft lips these couple things
I'm actually taking to mom
so she can try them it's a NYX lip
primer and then a Milani like anti
feathering liner mom sometimes has
issues with lip products running outside
her lip line so I thought maybe she
could try those and maybe review him on
the Express channel or something after
she's used him for a while
couple lip liners for me I've got a hot
pink one from Milani and a neutral one
from Too Faced this from Too Faced
melted it's melted fig I'm really liking
this shade and it totally matches with
my toes and my nails and so those that's
gonna be my little accent color I think
for my look for the shower got a Too
Faced butter gloss and tiramisu just
total classic berry gloss from the balm
read my lips a couple of color whispers
a couple of the baby lips and just a few
random lipsticks here this is a pinky
shade from Estee Lauder and mood from
Too Faced and kind of a rosy shade from
the Erin line which is under Estee
Lauder you girls gotta have variety
right as far as palettes sometimes I
cram them into my makeup bag sometimes I
give them their own separate bag I'm
just taking a couple here lorac unzipped
great basic palette haven't used it in a
while so I thought I'd take that and
also to face cat eyes which I want to be
reviewing soon and I'm a well I'm home
gonna try to shoot a little get ready
with me video like from the old little
vanity err you know where I got ready
for my high school dances and like all
that stuff I thought that'd be really
fun at my old makeup mirror and so that
may be what I use to get ready for the
shower that little palette and so all
that with the exception of looks like
one rogue q-tip in this bag is
everything that I'm taking beauty wise I
don't feel like I am an especially light
backer at all I can pack lighter if I
need to but if I don't need to i'll just
you know throw in as many little
separate makeup bags as I can full of
stuff so I gotta have options right if
you guys are having a great day and
thanks again for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
