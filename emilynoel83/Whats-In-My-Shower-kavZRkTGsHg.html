know i eated about how we went on this
quest for the Snuggies because Tyler
tried one on over Christmas you were
convinced yeah I was I was pretty
skeptical about the Snuggies and then I
tried one out it was like instant nap
it's like you put it on you wanna go to
sleep so yeah we just decided we'd be
goofy and wear them for this cuz this
really really really cold it's actually
cold everywhere but it's definitely cold
down here and in case you are new to my
videos and you haven't seen Tyler
because he hasn't been in one in a while
I don't know why exactly we just haven't
had the topics I guess that you know we
might use
Tyler in a video for but he's my husband
so anything you say about yourself
you'll find out along the way because
we're doing what's in our shower yes
you'll find out everything you need to
know about me while I shower I was
thinking you know maybe we should do
this from the shower but then I realized
that the sound would probably be funny
and the lighting wouldn't be good enough
and the you tube lighting police would
come after me like they so often do look
out for those and so I just decided hey
let's just bring it in the living room
and do it here right okay do you want to
go first
sure okay item should I use I just you
know whatever from the tops you're going
the words that I use them how about this
okay
I just usually buy whatever shampoo is
the cheapest and smells the best so this
happens to be vo five herbal escapes
mousse strengthening shampoo antioxidant
rich pomegranate and grapeseed extract I
know how important the in antioxidants
are you Tyler I didn't know anything for
my hair but it really smells good you
just basically go to the store find it
if it's a dollar he smells good and it
works for you here seems to be
responding well okay what else
umi-friend let's just call you all right
this is the body wash I use this is what
I have I get this every time whole spice
high endurance
what is it sport something game day
that's my favorite it smells pretty good
it does smell good smells kind of like
your deodorant which I've had to use
because I ran out of my own but I just
went to Walgreens today and got
deodorant and of course a couple
eyeshadows my shaving this is the
Gillette with four blades because two
word blade two or three is just not
enough wait are you sure there's no
there's dude there's five five
I think there's five blades on that
there's five blades on that and then
there's one on the top - like for
trimming in small area no also vibrates
yeah yeah it's got um yeah it's totally
got five blades yeah I'm pretty sure
it's from Gillette Gillette Fusion yeah
that's the fusion that's right this is
the shaving cream I use you reviewed
this previous in me be lucious the beer
oil shaving cream for him it's that kind
of cooling yes it's really cool like you
could run you can actually if you need
to also is basically a moisturizer
that's neat everything know this is what
I've washed my face with if your initial
time if I'm in the shower
cleaning clear oil free foaming facial
cleanser you've probably used this since
high school
this type of thing I think since college
since like freshman year of college so
what's going on eight years now yeah I'm
guessing so medicated to kill problem
causing bacteria without over-drying
i you said sometimes if i take a shower
it's not the end of the day because I
usually shower at the end of the day
Tyler showers you know maybe after a
workout or something like that in the
morning before I tend to do it at night
before I go to bed because I do a
morning show so I'm having to get up
really early so that just saves me from
doing one more thing when I wake up so
um you have more things it appears
tonight I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 things
yeah so what I was going to say was that
when I get in the shower I've got my
makeup on so I use the Olay daily facial
cleansing cloths very very easy to use
and the shower you know that you just
get them lathered up and this is for
checking your Twitter script okay
but anyways you get it what you like
using these sometimes if you go to bed
and they're really good because they
have a scrubby side and I mean you can
get all your makeup off and then just
pitch him when you're done I started
using these in college because I didn't
want to really have to deal with washing
wash clothes all the time so they came
in very handy
um another thing I want to talk about
I'll talk about my shampoo which really
hasn't changed for well over a year now
and these are not the cutest bottles
they're probably not as cute as your
shampoo bottle this is these this is a
volumizing shampoo and conditioner from
generic value products available at
Sally's and basically generic value
products are products with the exact
same ingredients as the non generic
version the actual version so this is
matrix amplify shampoo and conditioner
Tyler look at the list on the back it
will compare the ingredients in the gvp
version to the actual matrix amplify and
they're all the same ingredients
identical right down to like you compare
the numbers the sense and like your
fragrance both have identical amounts of
hexyl cinnamon it's really it's really
good I've been using like I said been
using the shampoo for a problem maybe as
long as I've been on YouTube or at least
as long as I've been on YouTube talking
about shampoo but I go through the
shampoo a lot more faster than I go
through the conditioner I just don't
like to use as much conditioner and I
usually use it on like the lower portion
of my hair but it smells good it's
volumizing it doesn't build up on my
hair I have dark hair so if you were to
see you know like the build-up of
shampoo on it Tyler is inspecting it
he'll probably find something now yes
okay good I put myself out there for you
guys but it's it just works really well
I it's really hard to tell if a shampoo
is volumizing when you're going and
styling your hair and putting other
things in it however you don't feel like
it's weighing my hair down and I don't
feel like it's creating buildup so um
it's definitely definitely a good
product for volume and your and by the
way these are like $5.99 apiece one of
these from matrix and wool five would be
like $15 so you're really really saving
on that and that's Sally Beauty Supply
um I have this lower on Sally's stuff I
have something cut called tan wise body
polish foaming body scrub and this is
sort of if I was to describe the smell
it's not a real distinct smell it's just
kind of a clean it's not like one of
those awesome fruity smells but it's
just kind of a clean scent clean and I
got that I got that free one I got some
tan wise tanning stuff from Sally
and it's basically the idea is before
you ever can
you're supposed to exfoliate you're
supposed to get off the dead skin and
really start with it with a clean slate
so that way when you put your tanner on
it's not going on top of dead skin
that's going to quickly you know brush
it it's not going off some good skin
it's gonna quickly come off your skin
you want to go
yes move your skin out really give it a
clean palate basically for the Tanner so
if I know I'm gonna tan I put that on
now to some really good smell except
herb well this this actually smells
really good but it's a hair thing
it's the Aussie 3 minute miracle I did a
previous review on this specifically and
it's basically a I don't know why I just
handed it to Tyler I'm out this day off
it's like once every three showers it
smells super good if you want to see a
more in-depth review I did do one way
back when and it's just something I use
once or with this dry weather twice a
week and you let it stay on your hair
you use it right in the shower put it on
your hair for 3 minutes and it's going
to really like deep condition it guys
that have short hair don't really need
to worry about these sorts of problems
as much but if you have long hair like
mine that's really kind of growing out
long you want to keep something on there
that's going to like I'm having trouble
keeping my Snuggie it's a zebra Snuggie
- I really like it but anyway that's a
very good deep conditioning thing to
keep your hair and you might wonder well
what's the benefit that why why I really
do you do that well it keeps your hair
from feeling quite so dry and brittle
and I feel like since I've been doing
that on a weekly basis it's kept my hair
my very very fine hair from feeling
really staticky and out of control
easier to work with very good thing my
razor I love this is cool this is very
neat I don't know who out there uses the
Schick intuition but it has a neat
little like doc type thing
like suctions to your shower so you can
put it on there has a little cap and
this is the razor that is surrounded
basically by a shaving soap that's the
white around this and when you use it
the the razor kind of pushes down in
there a little bit so like when you use
it you don't have to use any shaving
cream and this the one I got was for
sensitive skin and I've got to tell you
I used to get pretty bad irritation on
my legs from shaving and I could never
tell if it was the razor or the shaving
cream something along the line was
irritating me this has not done that at
all I've been using this for about six
months now probably maybe I always do
that whatever Tyler's did a video and
you guys call me on it too it's like I
look at it and I expect him to answer my
question but um this is really good it
leaves your buddy
he's my Snuggie assistant it keeps your
skin really soft it gives it does give
you a close shave there are four blades
on this he's got two we're not competing
or anything this just really works well
I would and and plus you just do it so
fast you don't have to you know you put
on shaving cream or anything and it
truly works well so if you're a fan of
that like I am let me know last two
things are two different body washes
that I use so I'll talk about this one
first this is from tone I've mentioned
this in a past video and it is the
moisturizing cocoa butter mango splash
body wash with vitamin E Oh smells so
good it's so it's the ultimate super
fruity tropical kind of body wash that
just lathers up really good it smells
like something you want to eat
it's just absolutely fantastic and I've
been using this for a long time this has
lasted me ever since the last time I've
incorporated that into a video so really
really good and then I
the dial clean and soft healthy smoother
skin body wash in the soy and almond
milk scent and this I actually just got
not too long ago but I discovered it
when I went back to mom and dad's house
for Thanksgiving and they had this in
their shower and I used it and I thought
oh my gosh that is a phenomenal smelling
thing because it's like it's just
lightly sweet it's not it's you get a
little hint of like a vanilla scent but
it's just like creamy sweet it's it's
not over-the-top I mean I have used body
washes from philosophy and Bath and Body
Works and all that stuff but this has
got to rank among one of the best
smelling I have ever used and it's from
dial you know it's from it's gonna come
right off the shores of you right off of
your drugstore shelf but no I love what
I use in the shower
and I was just really realizing that the
other day when I kind of cleaned it out
and I thought I really have some good
stuff in the shower and I'm all of it is
very inexpensive everything between all
of us that we use is super affordable
stuff as well is there anything else we
need to add anything else we need to
update people on Tyler's on Twitter he
also has a blog both of which he needs
to update much more often yeah I am oh
my New Year's resolution is it really no
no it is now it is indeed alright well
thank you guys so much for tuning in for
this video hope you enjoyed seeing
what's in our shower without actually
getting in our shower and I hope you
like the Snuggies bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
