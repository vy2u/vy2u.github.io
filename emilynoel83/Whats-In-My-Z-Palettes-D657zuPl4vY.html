palettes I have been busy look at all of
these ballots I have now filled up with
products that were once in larger
palettes some of them were in like those
little drugstore quads and things like
that I have cleared out a lot of space
in my makeup collection with all these
you know little bitty containers that
are now empty you're not familiar with
what a Z palette is I've done one other
video on these I believe but basically
this comes to you as an empty palette
and it's got a surface inside where the
little pans will magnetized to it now
not every pan does so sometimes you have
to add a magnet several of my new Z
palettes that I got actually came with
little stickers that were magnets on one
side stickers on the other you can put
them on the bottom so if anything
doesn't stick inside like for example
these Mac ones you can put that little
magnet sticker right there on the back
and then it goes in so as far as deep
potting and the process of taking you
know your little drugstore quads and
emptying them out and putting them in
these I got all those tips on youtube is
so I will post below some of the most
helpful videos that showed me how to do
this maybe I'll do a blog to accompany
this or just something with a few little
you know things that might make it
easier on you that I've personally
figured out but as far as the overall
process I did not come up with that
myself so I will I will share what
helped me the most in the info box
what I have inside all of these and of
course it's not permanent that's the
beautiful thing so if you want to
rearrange you know you can take the
magnets out pop them back in different
ways do whatever you want as far as like
travel goes with these I've been able to
travel with my Z palettes multiple times
nothing happened but there is this
window in the top on all Z palettes and
it does it is a little bit concerning
that that has some flexibility to it and
you wouldn't want to get any of your
products crushed if you're going on a
plane and want to travel with your
pallet so I'm always extra careful to
like you know wrap it up in some clothes
it
my suitcase and I've had no issues any
makeup product you take has the
potential to break unfortunately but I
mean I would just be extra careful with
these because while they are you know
fairly durable and things aren't going
to come unmagnetized from the pallet you
want to be careful with this window that
as I said has a little bit of give to
this is the first Z palette I ever got
as you can see it's the zebra design and
it is the large size and inside I have a
bunch of my Coastal Scents hot pots so
these are just little individual shadows
they are all the size of like a regular
Mac Shadow and as you can see they just
magnetize in there there is no extra
magnet required in terms of the specific
shades maybe on my blog I'll point out
like specifically what's in here if
there's a certain color that intrigues
you this is a really nice selection for
me if I'm traveling if I'm going to be
doing someone else's makeup I feel like
it's a nice wide variety of shades
that's going to suit most situations
these the rest of these Z palettes were
sent to me for review so I've got
several different sizes to show you this
one however is a large just like the
zebra one I just showed and I did
something a little different here i
depotted a bunch of drugstore shadows
you might recognize what brands these
are from but these are actually
Physicians Formula and it's interesting
because these come as a shadow in kind
of a long story I did have to add a
little magnet there it's interesting you
know some things will just go right in
some things require the magnet but here
on you know I've gotten rid of some
bulky packaging that these originally
came in and with these I found I wasn't
using these as much they kind of got
stowed away in one of my makeup
containers here's are the stylish smoke
squads from Maybelline the packaging is
a little different on these right now
but I've got charcoal smokes natural
smokes and the purple smoky one and the
green one as well and so I just fit
those all in here this palette is the
pro size and it is just a little bit
larger than the size called large if I
set them right on top you can see the
pro size just has a little more space to
it and it's been designed to hold like
larger pans of products as you can see I
chose to put a bunch of eyeshadows in
here actually really wanted to start
getting more used out of some urban
decay and Too Faced palettes that I've
had for a while but they're just not
travel friendly the Urban Decay NYC
palette is pretty bulky also Urban Decay
Book of Shadows 4 that's what these are
all from so I pop them out of those
palettes I didn't even need to add an
additional magnet to any of these they
just worked in here and I just
configured them in a way that made sense
to me you know a lot of the neutrals the
medium shades the deeper shades and
there are a few that aren't in here but
most of the shadows that were in the
Urban Decay NYC and Book of Shadows 4
are here and I mean it feels like an all
new palette to me just because I was
able to combine those put them together
how I wanted and here these come from a
couple of different Too Faced palettes
the glamour revolution palette and
enchanted glamour land so um there were
there was some overlap in the shades so
not every single shade is included here
but most of them and so I've got kind of
a nice you know mostly neutral but a few
pops of color palette here and I'm
getting more use out of those shades now
than I ever did before this is the dome
palette and it's the same size all
around as the pro except for one thing
this one is a little bit taller or a
little bit has a little more depth to it
so it can accommodate those baked
product we have Mac's soft and gentle
this is a Mac limited edition blush I
believe the shade is giggly and here we
have several Milani blushes and this is
Dulce pink this is what's this one rose
deorro Luminoso and this one is gosh
berry something Barry Moore here I have
a Laura Geller kind of small mini sized
blush in Barry this is just a random
blush from Victoria's Secret and here
are the laura geller babycakes plushies
they came in like a palette form so
they're smaller as you can see then even
the mini size but I thought this would
be a good place to have them all
together so those are in several
different shades um pink grapefruit is
one of them of golden apricot this is
sun-swept and this is sugar-free
raspberry meaning no shimmer
I know laura geller always talks about
how her you know baked products are
baked on a terracotta tile and until i
depotted things i thought maybe she was
the only one who did that but with all
these different brands laura geller
Milani Mak even the Victoria's Secret
one all of these come off on a
terracotta tile so these are like cream
products that have been swirled together
baked on that time once you depop them
you'll be able to see they have that
made in Italy many of them do and that's
not going to be magnetic so I did need
the extra magnets for these but I mean
it works great on this palette is a
midsize palette there are some even
smaller than this but this mid sized
palette is called the for you and in
here I have 15 Mac eyeshadows this is
pretty much my whole Mac eyeshadow
collection once again I could blog and
tell you specifically what each of these
shades are kind of like having these all
in one place a lot of people talk about
having mac palettes and I've never had
one till now never D bought it a Mac
shadow till I kind of got on this
project it's really handy I happen to
have a lot of neutral kind of wearable
shades that work together so this will
be a nice you know on-the-go travel
palette for me as well so here you can
see we have the pro and dome size the
large size and then the for you size
these are the only Z palettes I have but
I do plan to place an order for more
just because I've got more products that
I think I can clear up and more space
that I can save by putting my shadows in
these I do really like the large size
but what I'm planning to repurchase next
is another one of the pro size just
because I think that gives you the most
flexibility like I know I'm going to
have a lot of Shadows to put somewhere
when I start taking out of more and more
of those bulky you know palettes land to
get one more of this for you sighs I
just think that's a very
handy sighs and I could see me you know
maybe just keeping one kind of open and
when I go to travel just taking from
maybe some of these others and putting
my own pallet together just for
on-the-go purposes you know so I think
it would be nice to have an extra of
this size as well and I hope you found
this enjoyable and informative I just
really got on a roll when it came to
deep potting things and I found I was
just you know getting such a thrill out
of figuring out ways to get the products
out and then filling up my own pallet
that's also the satisfaction with these
kind of comes from being able to adjust
and make the pallets exactly how you
want them to be so you can take some of
your favorites put them together I
didn't take a lot of my singles out
because I've got kind of a color-coded
storage system I think I described that
and showed that the last time I did my
makeup collection and that's still the
way it is I organized my singles by
color and that's good for me and I'm not
having a space issue with those so I
kind of focused on like I said the
larger palettes that I haven't been
reaching for as much and then also some
quads that I hadn't been using as much
either that I just like to clear out
some space thank you so much for
watching if you have any special tips to
share with me and everybody else who's
watching or reading comments just about
you know tricks for deep potting or your
favorite things to store in a Z palette
definitely include those in the comments
section and yeah that's it thank you for
watching see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
