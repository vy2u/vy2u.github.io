what's new at Ulta hull I don't know
about you guys but I'm kind of obsessed
with the section of ulties website where
there's a little button you can click
and it says like new or what's new and
I'm always checking that for some reason
I've got an obsessively want to know
like what are the new skincare items
what are the new makeup items and if I'm
honest I kind of want it to slow down I
kind of would like to feel like for I
don't know 24 hours like I'm on top of
the things but I got some new things to
new palates individual makeup products a
few new skincare items that I want to
talk about and also a few new items from
Walgreens I just kind of have to talk
about these things real quick because my
lip is kind of like the captain of my
look today so needs a mention new matte
lipsticks from Milani I picked a couple
of them up and I'm kind of obsessed if
you can't tell if you follow me on
snapchat you're kind of getting this
sense of it's too but I'm loving the
deep lips lately and I don't give a rip
if it's over I still think they're
awesome actually I think back to when
the absolutely gorgeous Chrissy Teigen
was on the red carpet a few times during
the spring and I believe more than once
she was sporting a really dark vampy lip
with her look and I thought it looked
amazing and it's like who cares what
time of year it is if you like it do it
right and I actually think these darker
tones on my skin tone look a little bit
better when I've got a little more Sun
or a little more depth to my skin anyway
but I'm just really liking the look so
when I came across several new matte
shades and there were some others
there's like a light pink there was an
orange in this line of new matte
lipsticks from Milani but I really
wanted a couple of these dark ones so I
am wearing the darkest one matte
fearless and it's like a really deep
kind of plummy grape type shade I had a
couple swatches on my hand but then I
washed my hands and they started to go
off one thing to note about this and I
haven't even been wearing it that long
but I mean naturally where lip products
tend to wear off is the inner part of
the center of your lower lip so you'll
start to see it probably even by the end
of this video it'll start to look a
little more berry ish and maybe a bit
less purpley but I feel like if I'm
gonna wear a deep lip color I really do
like the matte
shades because I feel like they're more
likely to just stay where you put them
you know as much as I love that really
deep butter gloss that I instagrammed
over the weekend like it's a tricky
thing to pull off I talked about that in
my review over on the Express channel
but anyways um this is matt fearless and
then the other one i got is called matt
love and so if you look at them together
you can see this one's much more plummy
this one has loads more red to it like
kind of a brick red and so here's those
two swatched how far can I turn that
love is actually quite a bit lighter
than I was expecting it to be so I was
glad I took the plunge and got Matt
fearless and these might actually be
really pretty
like maybe worn together like a little
bit of Matt love in the center kind of
blend it out with the other one I don't
know but those were in a new display in
at Walgreens seriously I've been wearing
this thing throughout the video I can
see like my hair caught in it yuck
Malati also has come out with some brow
pomade type products are actually called
stay put brow color and I got it in dark
brown which is the darkest shade that it
came in a lot of times I can make
lighter shades work in my brows for
example I've been using that elf brow
pencil in taupe and just loving it for a
quick fill-in but judging by the range
of shades that this product was
available in I felt like this was the
coolest tone this is what I'm wearing in
my brows today and I do think it's a
total match and it's just deep and dark
and definitely cool enough for me and it
comes with this little double-ended
brush so a nice angled very precise
angled brush there in a spoolie really
like the consistency of this it's not to
like smooshy you know it's creamy
without being too goopy like the salon
perfect was a bit goopy for me and I
felt like any time I put my brush into
it I picked up way too much and my brows
got overloaded this is like just a
really nice texture to put your brush
into because you can build up a little
at a time and not go too far but it's
plenty pigmented and it does have some
hold to it that wasn't even really a
claim I mean it claimed to be long
wearing but it didn't really talk about
like holding the brows in place and from
a swatch on my hand I did like a little
bitty swatch here but it's not rubbing
off either once that sets but that's it
from Walgreens the new
stuff from ulta I got the new toothpaste
born this way absolute perfection
foundation I really like the packaging
of visits like a frosted glass bottle
and then a pump so yay for pumps this
isn't the shade light beige that turned
out to be a really great shade match for
me actually I was so wondering as I was
looking at the colors on the website
like what the heck this does work really
well I'm a complete doofus and I forgot
to wear this for this particular video
where I'm trying to wear a lot of the
things that I hold it's like I
temporarily forgot about this but I have
been wearing this in some other videos
snapchat Instagram I think this has a
really nice finish on the skin I love
how it's like a straight-up satiny
finish once I put it on like blend it
out all over the skin I feel like I have
the most subtle but beautiful little
glow going on there and the staying
power has been great as well from the
first day I wore this actually I was
outside and I was sweating and it was
just SuperDuper hot it is really hot
down here hence the yeah don't be
jealous of my nursing tank I forgot I
had these actually I had like two and I
was wearing them all the time after
Belle was born and then I think I put
them away with maternity stuff and I'm
like yeah these are awesome super you
know easy access and lightweight and
comfy back to the foundation though this
had excellent staying power for me and I
fully expected it to you know break down
under the hot conditions because I was
sweating I was like blotting moisture
off of my face and this still looked
fresh and even at the end of the day so
I don't know I'm having really great
luck with this so far and I think the
coverage they called this I think they
said flawless medium to full coverage or
something like that I don't know that
this is quite as good of coverage is
even just the regular Estee Lauder
Double Wear I think maybe it's because
it's just got that hinted machine to it
it doesn't end up looking quite as flat
and matte and flawless you know as
something like double where does still
think it's really beautiful I'm gonna
keep trying it for a bit before I review
it just cuz I like to be sure how a
foundation is reacting with my skin you
know maybe it looks great but it's
causing some sort of a breakout but so
far so good with that
really been liking it got the new lorac
Pro contour palette which comes with a
brush the brush was part of the reason
why I wanted to get this and it is now
part of the reason why I don't really
like it very much I mean I like the
palette I enjoy the products in here but
this brush is really hard to use with it
because it's so like I think it could be
good with some other things that I have
but it's so dense and like not very
fluffy and these colors are like
pigmented right up there with what you
know and love from the lorac Pro I
shadow palettes so you stick something
so small into one of these contour
shades they tell you in this little
pamphlet like use the domed side so this
to lay down the product and then use the
flat side to kind of blend it out no way
no way in heck is anybody gonna be sad
with that look like it's it looks so
streaky and unblended maybe if I was
using this shade but I mean even using
that I could not get it blended to a
point where I liked it so then I thought
okay I'll just use this to apply and
then I'll pull in like a brush like this
to buff it out more still I thought it
looked - streaky if I use something like
this this is like the small contour from
Sigma if I use something like this from
the get-go I'll be happy with my look
it's like it's not the products fault
it's just you've got to be really
careful with this excuse me you got to
be really careful with this brush it's
soft dense nice quality but I think it
might be better with less pigmented
powders because then it would pack it on
more when you need it
these don't need to be like laid on
thick okay so there's light contour dark
contour and medium contour and then
beige highlight yellow highlight and
shimmer highlight I'm wearing the medium
contour here in a mix of the medium and
deep around my hairline everything and
the palette is matte except the shimmery
highlight everything like I said super
nicely pigmented the medium contour I
think is going to be a shade that's
really important to a lot of people
think some people might think that
that's a little bit warm so I don't know
if that's maybe a deal-breaker for some
of you but it worked pretty well with my
skin something I'm really loving is the
fact that the highlights are so
pigmented like even this beige matte
highlight look at how much that shows up
so if you really
want to create some definition and
contrast which I did like right up here
in the under eye area I thought that
worked great and that shimmery highlight
is quite intense as well so I'm liking
this so far I definitely like it better
than my honest hacia contour kit if you
like there's more like across-the-board
consistent pigmentation compared to the
NYX contour kit but I don't necessarily
know that you need this one over that I
need to do a little bit more comparison
there so stay tuned for more of a review
on that but I just wanted to tell you
what I know right now I also wanted to
get the lorac Pro matte palette so this
has the same size shadows as the regular
lorac Pro palette have but you're just
getting eight of them so top row classic
Brown neutrals and then bottom row
you're getting a burgundy and a pink
mauve not that I didn't already have
these kinds of shades in my collection
but I gotta say those those colors down
there that's what drew me into this
they're super pigmented I mean if you
enjoy the matte shades from your regular
lorac Pro one and two palettes I mean
these are just as pigmented maybe you
don't have any of those palettes and you
really only care about matte shadows is
a great basic matte palette because
you've got your black your dark brown
light and medium Browns
great highlight shades that you'll
definitely get use out of I was wearing
this the other day and be advised you
can get a really frickin dark look with
this even without using your darkest two
shades like I thought my eye was so like
deep and smoky I would say if you've
already got the lorac Pro one just the
original palette you might not need this
because you've already got a lot of
these neutral basics I think what's
really different that they're throwing
in is probably this burgundy color if
you're an avid pallet collector like me
you may still want it or like I said if
you only like mattes this would be a
great thing to have too I was so back
and forth on this but I decided to get
the Too Faced love palette this is the
same kind of packaging as the return of
sexy palette if you remember that from I
don't know that was probably a few years
ago that that came out but I was seeing
this online and not getting too excited
about the colors in here but then I saw
I don't know if it was two-faced and it
was on two-faced snapchat they were
showing some actual swatches of these
shades
and the green really pulled me in this
little quadrant here or quintuplet these
five looked really pretty also of course
I mean I have a lot of shades in this
kind of bronzy range as well it comes
with one of the perfect eyes waterproof
liners in perfect black I haven't found
these to be truly waterproof like I they
can do some smudging on my eyes but
they're really really soft and easy to
apply the other day I was wearing the
green shade and also some of these like
pinky moms and today I'm wearing the
four shades minus the pink in the center
I just did a really defined like shape
to the outside with this color this is
kind of in my crease and some of this
shape this kind of like golden lilac
color is on the lid this I didn't love
using this shade as my highlight it has
a little I don't know pinky lilac tone
to it but I guess it worked out okay I
mean it doesn't look bad but there's not
really like a classic Matt you know brow
bone highlight in here because this
shade is highly highly shimmery this
shade is kind of sparkly and a little
bit dusty there are some dusty shades in
here but there are also some beautifully
intense gorgeous colors these dark
shades at the bottom like ah this color
I mean look at that beautiful rose gold
nasai mean seeing it in person I'm much
more impressed by it than I was when I
just saw pictures of the palette online
I still got one more palette to talk
about but still all things considered
this is the most exciting like new
palette that's coming out to me now that
I have it yes it's more exciting to me
than the naked smoky eye I actually
didn't get this from Ulta I ordered it
off of Urban Decay's website as soon as
I could and I mean I'm not knocking
Urban Decay's quality because you know I
love it I sing their praises a lot but
this palette right now for me I mean
I've just got so much of this this is
these shades are so common to me right
now and I actually really enjoyed the
Urban Decay smoked palette when that
came out because it was like a few jewel
tones and some really great neutrals and
I loved using that still do I sure if
they're still selling that but that was
great stuff and I've only used this for
like a couple
we'll look so far over the weekend I
used this shade called high it's kind of
like a pinky tone really shimmery color
and I used smolder which is the plum and
it looked pretty just nothing really
super different I can see I've got a
nice range of maths right here but I
wish there were more mid-tones in this
palette I enjoy this dark brown called
whiskey but I mean something even like
matte and lighter than that would have
been nice or maybe not even in a brown
tone but just a matte that could be used
in the crease but not be too terribly
dark but I know this is a smoky palette
so the shades are gonna be smoky I need
to work with it some more before I give
this one a final verdict but you look at
side by side with this Too Faced one and
to me this just is a little more fun and
exciting you know oh goodness gracious I
do kind of like this packaging I really
like just the magnetic closure that that
has and then it does come with the
double ended brush it's a crease brush
and then what looks like a nice little
smudger brush which would be great for
you know a smoky eye look there on the
lower lash line trying some new lashes
from Ulta although I have seen these
sold at Target as well they're the Vegas
nay lashes by I work in case you didn't
know she is they say on the package
instagrams number one beauty guru not
interesting on the packaging in one look
she's got like really bright blue eyes
and here she's got like super dark eye
did I assume that's her here she looks
beautiful and I got the easy elegant
style which looks a lot like you know
the type of lashes that demi whispies
are maybe a little longer overall but
flared out at the ends you've got a
variety of different lengths in there so
I love how those types of lashes really
blend in with your own natural lashes so
I was pretty certain I would enjoy those
so that's why I got them but I am
wearing the shining star style and these
I swear I was looking at them sideways
they look like kind of a double-stack
type deal happening they're super
dramatic and they were actually super
long left to right I had to trim off so
much more than I think I've ever had to
trim off of a set of lashes they're
still going pretty far in they're going
like nearly into my tear duct I don't
like him going too far but they feel
great on my eyes but
was actually kind of thick but it was
easy to work with and it really laid
right on there I feel light as air for
as thick and dramatic as they are I am
really really loving this style and I
did something a little different on the
eyes today because I went with all the
drama up top I put no eyeshadow on my
lower lashline I just barely put any
mascara down there our girl has had some
jumbo gloss balms out for a while but
now they have put out something called
jumbo gloss balm creams and to me from
the two shades that I have it seems like
these might be just a little more
intense color wise than what they
initially put out and I have the shade
berries and cream and this is called
cherry cream pie does that make you
hungry berries in cream shade right here
I was wearing this recently in a picture
and got so many questions about it I was
so surprised and but it is gorgeous it's
kind of a moth with a little bit of
shimmer and typically that little bit of
frost in the shade might have been a
problem for me but something about this
very natural looking shade like all over
the lips it looks so pretty and then I
haven't worn this shade on my lips yet
but this one's just creamy there's no
shimmer in it the cherry cream pie color
this just looks like one of those pure
really pop and summery Reds not super
orange ii-in tone maybelline color blur
by lips studio haven't really played
with this a whole lot yet but this is
crazy I already had one of these I had
gotten this from Walmart
I had the shade cherry what's a cherry
cherry cherry cherry bang bang okay but
I didn't think it worked because I
opened the cap this wouldn't twist up
and I saw okay there's just end down
here but it doesn't twist out I thought
I had like a defective product and I was
talking to Lacey on snapchat I'll link
to her channel and she was asking if I'd
use these and I was like yeah I actually
have one but it's broken she's like well
you do know you have to twist up on the
end with the little smudger tip and I'm
like oh you're so why because I couldn't
believe I didn't try that why did I give
up so soon I don't know but I guess I'll
talk about this shade that I already had
idea is it says here on the cap apply to
center of lips and then smudge it
outward you could obviously do whatever
the heck you want to do but that's their
idea I guess to give maybe a little bit
of an ombre type look from the inside
out I don't know
and there's that red which pretty much
looks matte to me once I realized how to
work the thing I wanted to try another
color so I got plum please and this
again twist up from the bottom folks and
then here's the swatch of that nice and
dark another dark lip color to add to my
stash but I just barely played around
with these oh and there goes my lighting
again there goes my light
but I promise I will mess with those
some more so I can actually give a
review on them I had been using every
morning actually to wash my face
although it doesn't feel like it I've
been using that simple micellar water I
reviewed it already on the Express
channel I've continued using that I'm
about a little over halfway done with
the bottle and obviously I don't sleep
in my makeup so I'm not you know
removing makeup in the morning but I
just sweeping it over my face with a
cotton ball my skin feels very like
cooled a little bit hydrated refreshed
I've been using that liking that and
because I can't stop I want to find more
of these micellar waters to try yeah
that if it ain't broke don't fix it
mentality does not apply to me and make
my coupon to try new things so I found
that there were two under the new skin
care items section of Ulta I got the
Burt's Bees intense hydration nourishing
facial water with Clary sage says
absorbs quickly moisturizes improves
skins textures so I'm excited to test
that out and then I also got the boots
botanics micellar cleansing solution
three-in-one albright and here you're
just getting four ounces this is a
whopping 8.4 ounces in this bad boy
dissolves makeup unclogs pores and
removes impurities in one easy step for
all skin types with brightening hibiscus
and the simple one claim to be a big
makeup removing product also although I
felt like it could do it but it was a
heck of a lot of work so I don't really
like to use it in that way maybe this
one will be better that way but this
cleansing solution feels as gentle as
water on the skin to dissolve makeup
unclog pores remove impurities no
rinsing necessary for use on the face
eyes and lips so I have not used these
yet but I will be trying them out for
you but that's all for my haul today
thank you guys so much for watching lots
of new things from Ulta lots of new
review material as well so I hope you
enjoyed this and I'll see you guys later
bye are you a sweet baby bye bye bye bye
