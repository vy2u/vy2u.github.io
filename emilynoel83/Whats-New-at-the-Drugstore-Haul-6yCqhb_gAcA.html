joining me for this hall video has
anybody else noticed how hard it is to
resist all these new products coming out
especially in the drugstore right now
it's like every time I walk in I feel
like a different brand has a brand new
product and I really want to try it so I
can review it for you that's my excuse
but I have picked up a lot of things
here lately probably in the past month
maybe and so I wanted to bring those to
you in this haul video I also wanted to
thank you so much for watching the Emily
awards I had tons of fun putting that
together although it really was a lot of
work so I was pleased with all the kind
feedback that you gave me and I actually
have a recent blog post on beauty
broadcast net where I'm asking just a
few questions to get your feedback so if
you're interested if you have the time
and you want to check that out I would
really appreciate that for now let's
talk about some of the new products I'm
not going to give any in-depth reviews
some of these things I've only used a
couple times if at all so this is just
gonna kind of tell you what I've got and
tell you what I'm hoping to review very
soon
first thing I'm going to talk about is
some Rimmel stuff and this new
foundation actually the first time I
wore it was today and I I liked it so
far it's the Rimmel clean finish
foundation it says look 100 percent
poreless vitamins A and E it comes in a
glass jar here and it actually topped
twists off and it's got this crazy
little spatula in it yeah who's ever
seen that I like was looking at it and I
was looking at it in the store and I
kind of you know it took the top off and
I was like is this a tester you know is
this a sampler or something but no that
was pretty cool and I used it today I
had been out in the snow I've been
getting stung in the face with snow when
I was out reporting today and this held
up pretty well so I have to use
foundation for a little while before I'm
able to really give a verdict but liking
that so far that's Rimmel's plain finish
and it was less than four dollars you're
picking up one of these new foundations
you may not be the same shade as you are
and say Rimmel lasting finish because I
had to go for a completely different
shade it did not match up at all it was
a totally different and then there's
another foundation called match
perfection and this comes in a pretty
wide range of
it's a lot of people complain about
Rimmel foundation not having enough
color variety but this had quite a bit
and I haven't tried this at all yet have
but I'm excited to do that also there's
a new few new shades of blush that were
pointed out in the the whole set up and
a few of them were like labeled as new
and this one is called tickle me pink
and I just instantly was drawn to that
shade of blush I love that kind of light
pink for that pop of color on the cheeks
I have a little bit of that on today
with another kind of blush I'm going to
talk about a little bit but I thought
that looked good and there are new
moisture renew lip glosses check it out
so you know those lipsticks that are in
the pretty purple tubes these are the
lip glosses and they're just meant to be
super moisturizing you can tell by the
names this one is called pink protect
and this one is pink remedy pink remedy
is a little lighter pink remedy has
shimmer if they both do actually so I'm
going to be trying those and letting you
know what I think about them one more
Rimmel thing that I got it's not new to
the line but it was a little tidbit that
I picked up on from the Beauty broadcast
Facebook page there are boodles of
people on there with so much good advice
it's not even funny and I got this
lasting finish lipstick in pink blush
and some people on there we're saying
that this is a dupe for Mac's
Lady gaga so I had to pick that up and I
really do like this shade I think it's a
gorgeous pink and the lasting finish
lipsticks are really nice too from
Neutrogena I was actually at CVS not too
long though and they're doing you know
random items throughout the cosmetics
section are marked like 50% off or 75%
off and so when I found some Neutrogena
items mark at 75% off I thought oh yeah
this is happening and so I got the
healthy blends sheer highlighting blush
this is in vibrant and by the way I mean
some of this stuff I take it that
because it's being marked down to this
extent that they may not be bringing it
back also I got a lipstick this is an
Angels blush it's moisture shine light
pink looks pretty very creamy astir
shine soothing lipstick in sunny berry
sorry the print is so small on these
things so that's kind of like a berry
red
and then I wanted to try the mineral
sheers concealer kit so it's concealer
up top and then a powder on the bottom
very reminiscent of the Bobbi Brown
creamy concealer kit so see how that
works for me and check this out how
pretty a color is that that's 75% off
Revlon nail polish and pink chiffon I
haven't had the best luck with Revlon
nail polishes but I thought for 75% off
and that gorgeous of a pink color I
really like it few new things from
covergirl I'm gonna be trying the nature
luxe foundation this is the line of
stuff that you've seen Taylor Swift
plastered all over so I'm excited to try
this this is a foundation with a hint of
jojoba extract and cucumber water gives
flawless luxurious coverage with a
barely-there feel what I didn't like
about this was that the once again I
mean picking out foundation is
frustrating but the names of all these
shades were like random things like it
did not follow like creamy natural or
what any of the other covergirl shade
names are so you've really got to reset
and look over everything and figure out
what you are in that same line they've
got these nature luxe and gloss bombs
and I have one in sandstone so looks
like this with the packaging and then
you take the top off and it's kind of
like a mini like a skinnier lipstick
format you can see there the color
peachy pinky kind of like maybe just
enhancing then that color of your
natural lips you know how I love golden
pink in the cheekers blush from
covergirl is a great contour and now you
can't find that anywhere well they have
come up with what I believe is a new
shade called Sierra sands and it's very
very similar to golden pink and I know
brands do this they rename they
repackage and they try to make you want
to buy it so and this again looks very
similar to golden pink I used it today
as my contour which this is TV news
makeup so I contour somewhat heavily
under those lights so it will actually
show up under dangerously bright lights
but yeah I thought I'd pick that up and
see just how well it matte
and I think it's very close there are
new lipsticks from covergirl and these
are called the okay I can't find the
exact name of what they're naming this
line of lipsticks but I don't shade in
darling and one in siren I'll show these
to you more close darling looks like a
pinky mauve shade and then and it's
creamy it's no shimmer and then siren
check this puppy out yeah I like having
a good few bright pink lipsticks so wet
and wild I have not found those big
palettes that I think everybody is
trying to find it's slowly coming out
here and there in different locations
but they do have new trios out that I've
seen in pretty much all my local stores
so I got a couple of those one is called
silent treatment and one is called I'm
getting sunburned and you might have
seen these in my Emily awards videos
because I just showed a few quick
snapshots because I love the color icon
shadows here's the one called silent
treatment um see if we can get a good
focus on that what you're getting here
is some really pretty neutral shades
like a nice champagne peach shade at the
bottom you've got kind of a silvery
taupe and in the middle there it's like
super super deep brown with a hint of
sparkle in it and these I mean you only
need a teeny tiny bit of that color to
make it work for this this I love
love this grouping that gold is
phenomenal the middle shape we're
talking like rich Brown with sort of a
little more gold mini undertone when it
hits the light and then like this
lavender pink shade up top so
interesting configurations of color I'm
excited to see that and I can't wait to
see those bigger palettes from Wet n
Wild also been getting tons of questions
about this stuff the Maybelline fit me
foundation mainly the foundation but I
picked up the powder two concept here
with this line is that it's it's kind of
all numbered and you just kind of say
okay figure out my foundation
shade alright I got what did I get 235
I'm gonna get the 235 powder as well
there's concealer there's blush and
bronzer I think - from what I can I can
tell that what I had used of this so far
it's pretty light it's not very intense
coverage by any means some people it
kind of pertains to what your skin needs
are and I'll need to use this some more
it wore alright on me but my skin can be
a little bit drier at times this time of
year so I don't know I mean I still need
to definitely try that out some more
maybe I'll do kind of a mess a
foundation review after this haul at
some point but the powder I do really
enjoy that powder I think it's good
matte coverage it's nice for touch-ups
before the news and stuff like that well
that about wraps it up for this whole
video I know just a lot of drugstore
products here on some stuff that maybe
you already have or maybe you haven't
seen it at all in your stores so you'll
have an idea of what to keep an eye out
for in the weeks and days to come so
thank you very much for watching keep an
eye out for more reviews whether it's
here on youtube or on my blog of these
products and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
