browsing the drugstore I really hit the
jackpot when it comes to new products so
I have rounded up quite a few new things
that you might want to keep an eye out
for whether you're in Walgreens or
Walmart or Ulta or wherever different
low cost things some that I have
reviewed some that I haven't I'll give
you whatever information I can in this
video though and just kind of show you
what's new but the first thing and this
is something I've been getting so many
questions about and I finally found it
at CVS and it's the maybelline baby skin
instant pore eraser and for a little
application tip on the back it says
smooth on two areas with visible pores
trying to show you something clear now
this product is really completely clear
and it has a similar texture once you
blend it out to Smashbox photo-finish
but I feel like it's a little bit
thicker than that a little less moisture
in the product vans photo finish lately
I've been using this as my primer under
makeup and I got to say pretty much any
foundation that I put over this glides
on really really smoothly but all in all
it's that kind of silicone texture that
is really smooth tends to fill your
lines and pores and stuff like that
well we're on Maybelline that there is a
new kind of blush and actually a whole
new line of face products called face
studio you know there's been like eye
studio products for a while well now
there's some face stuff some new stuff
and it's called master glaze and there
were I don't know about how many of
these sticks I saw at Walgreens like
maybe five or six different colors and I
got this pink because it seemed like the
brightest one and I always like to see
you know if the bright colors that are
out there are really as bright as they
appear in their tubes you know and it's
called pink fever and I was so
pleasantly surprised with the texture of
this stick it's definitely different
from a lot of cream blushes because it's
so thin like I don't know if you can see
here is I just take it really lightly
across my hand
oops I hit it okay got a bump it's just
a really really light weight and then
you see how it really blends nicely
across the skin also it's not like one
of those cream blushes where you put it
on once
and then it's hard to like blend out
over your entire cheek so I use this
today and I just dotted it on like
straight from the stick and then I
blended it out with my ELF small stipple
brush worked perfectly I love how
lightweight this is and how colorful it
was too another thing from the face
studio line that I saw is a highlighting
blush this is something you don't see
too much from Maybelline these mosaic
kind of face products but this is called
pink rose and it says our multi-tonal
blush palette highlights skin and softly
contours cheeks for an instantly defined
glow so I put this very very lightly on
top of the stick most of the color
you're seeing is coming from the stick
but if you want to see what this looks
like just swirling your finger over
everything it's a soft shimmery rosy
pink glow and there were several
different shades of this tooth super
different from just other shimmery
blushes on the market I think maybe if
you went to a lighter shade you might
get that dual like blush highlight
effect going on packaging the pan lifts
up oops it lifts up there's a mirror
back there and then a little brush comes
inside I think Maybelline's been busy
because there's more and there's a new
powder dream Wonder powder so they've
got that whole dream line you know the
dream matte mousse and the dream matte
powder and stuff like to read you guys
the claims because I want you to know
what it's supposed to do and then down
the road when I do a review we see if it
actually does those things but sets
lights on softly and smoothly skin
perfecting silky finish buildable medium
coverage and I got this in shade 20
which is classic either he's a little
lighter than what I might normally grab
for but it's a really good match turns
out to be on my skin so similar
packaging to the face studio thing it
lifts up here and it comes with a sponge
so I could see this being like a powder
foundation type product surface of this
powder was kind of different and I don't
know if it'll show because I've been
using it but it was almost like a little
bit bumpy like you look right at it and
it's kind of did not one of those
squishy like cream textures or anything
it's definitely powder when you put your
finger in it or you put your brush in it
it seems like you just easily pick up a
lot of product
so I think it could be easy to go
overboard with this powder and apply too
much so you want to use kind of a light
hand with it but it does have nice
coverage it's very mattifying flame was
medium coverage I think it definitely
has medium coverage and then some so I
really want to try using this next week
as like a powder foundation so I can
really be able to tell what the staying
power and see just how much coverage it
does have on its own as opposed to being
more on top of a foundation is the new
thing that I saw from Maybelline was a
line of nude lipsticks it's the color
sensational line I can't remember what
like the heading was on the display but
there were several different shades I
went with shade 920 in nude lust it
really looks like a nice nude shade like
if I'm going nude this is maybe the kind
of color I gravitate toward here's a
little swatch of that because he's just
a very beige nude a little bit deeper
than like a Mac creme did you so far
I've worn this once and I my initial
reaction when I got it on my lips I
thought they look kind of dead like it's
a very full coverage lip product you
know it's not sheer so I just felt like
they look very flat and lacked dimension
so I put a gloss over the top and like
that much better there's definitely a
range of different nude options so if
you like things a little bit darker or
lighter than this there were some other
things out there Underwood nail polishes
they're here
I knew this line was coming out I'd
heard rumblings that Carrie Underwood is
getting a line of nail polish for the
Nicole by OPI line and they came out I
saw them at Walmart the line was
supposed to officially launch in January
but the display was already totally
picked over
not very many shades left but I got two
shades that I really do like this nude
one is called southern charm it's just a
creamy nude shade and I'm sorry I've got
a little chipping already this has been
four days on my nails and I wanted to
leave it because I wanted you to see
what happened on the tips of these two
nails and one or two on my other hand
just kind of already chipped off I had a
really good top coat on top that I liked
and nails Inc top I absolutely love that
nude color and then I put the gold on
here that's one coat on my ring finger
this gold called carried away it's
beautiful the nails that I have that
gold on are still going strong but if
you love carry hunter but like I do and
it means something view to have a nail
polish that says Carrie Underwood around
the handle I know I'm crazy but I start
just looking a little more closely for
these I see normally like special
editions of this line at Ulta too so
that might be another place to check her
girl has a brand new mascara it's called
bombshell Volume I do have a full review
on this on my Beauty broadcast Express
channel in case you're new to this
channel and you didn't know I had that
other one it's quick reviews I do a
Monday through Friday so something new
every weekday and it's just like one
product at a time like a little daily
dose of a beauty review so I've talked
about this one but it's a two-in-one
mascara one brush is like a rubber
bristle brush that reminds me a lot of
lash blast and then the other side is a
traditional like spiraled around the
wand kind of bristle they're a little
bit tapered at the tip I like the way
you know these two steps layered on top
of each other I thought it gave me
really nice volume nice length but it
was just so so hard for me to remove and
I don't like having to go to extra
measures and a lot of extra time to get
my mascara off you know but I'm taking
mascara off I just want to go to bed
anyway you can get the full scoop on
this in my review video but I just
wanted to let you know about that
Neutrogena has a new foundation and it's
called nourishing long wear makeup tone
correcting complex titanium dioxide
sunscreen SPF 20 in here I have it in
the shade buff number 30 I believe this
was the second lightest shade in the
line and there was a big gap between the
lightest shade which I found to be very
cool and very pink and then all the rest
of the shades seemed darker and pretty
orange II like this one is definitely I
mean it doesn't look crazy oranjee but
when I was first like spreading this on
my face I thought wow it's it's not
really my skin it's okay as far as the
depth of the color you know it's not too
too dark for me but it's just kind of
the wrong
but I've really been taking a close look
at this over the past few days that I've
been wearing it I'm not that impressed
I think there are liquid foundations
with better coverage and better staying
power from the drugstore and I get
through about 2/3 of my day and I
noticed this breaking down quite a bit
in my t-zone so not a lot of great
things to say about this I mean it's not
light coverage I call it medium coverage
and average staying power also on some
new lip products out from L'Oreal and I
wish they would put the exact name of
what these are on the product I'll
probably be able to look at they are
like a lip gloss style product
I got it in nude ballet and purple
Prelude I feel like the style of this
product is a lot like the Maybelline
Color elixirs because look at them it's
kind of styled like a lipstick tube and
then it's got that same kind of slightly
pointed applicator there and even the
texture is very similar I feel like
these are maybe a little less thick I
don't know they just feel a little less
heavy on the lips so I do like that
about these and here's a look at the
colors like this nude a lot I think
that's pretty I love the fresh kind of
shine it has on the lips
this shade I think it looks pretty in
the swatch but it looks kind of greyish
on the lid that's not what I'm wearing
I'm Hite lips today I'm wearing a
lipstick from Too Faced called um what
is it lollipop yeah it's called lollipop
like this is kind of what I expected
this to look like but instead I don't
know it's kind of dull these don't seem
crazy different amazing awesome compared
to other glasses that are out there but
they're not uncomfortable on the lips
and I do like this nude shade there's
just a lot of stuff to talk about in
this video another new thing is from
Physicians Formula and it's called
mineral where talc free mineral oh so
radiant powder and yes I was drawn in by
the pretty blue packaging and then you
look at what's in there at whoops so I'm
under there something wants out that's a
big brush but look at this it's got
little shimmery circles all over it but
see what happens when you go over one of
those you're you're taking off that
shimmer that's just like an overspray
and see how much shimmer actually come
self on your finger this kind of stuff
just confuses me I mean who wants that
just a temporary thing like you think
that's what you're getting and then a
few times swirling your brush through
this it's gone then what's underneath
seems to be like a semi matte powder
it's not really shiny I might have had a
little shine on my finger already I feel
like you go from too drastic places with
this powder the first when you're using
it and getting all that shimmer and then
what's underneath ends up being just a
typical powder so I don't know what to
think about this I'm going to keep using
it and you can bet your booty hell
review it for you and last but not least
always got a loose powder called smart
shade I'm pretty sure I found this at
all those loose finishing powder and I
got it in the shade light feel like I've
been trying a lot of different loose
powders that could be used as an
under-eye setting type thing but I
haven't tried as much for all over the
face type stuff so I wanted to try this
I got to say I love the feel of this
it's so lightweight silky smooth leave
there was a puff in here but I took it
out but I'm just a really nice texture
not a lot of coverage but kind of nice
for mattifying I've used this several
times like right after foundation just
to get a really perfected finish and I'm
liking that quite a bit so far so
hopefully that just gives you a little
information on some of those new things
that are out in the drugstore have I had
a crazy hair this whole time I don't
know no big umm if I have done reviews
on these I'll link to them below if I
haven't you can expect them soon so
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
