video it's kind of letting you know what
different products are new at your
drugstore or your discount store like
Target or Walmart or something like that
and I feel like it's it just must be
that time of year where a lot of new
things are coming out and I've been
picking some up I mean it's just like I
see it I'm excited about it I want to
try it I want to tell you about it too
so I'm just gonna go through some of the
different things that I've found start
with a new nail polish that kind of
excited me that I saw at Target and it's
from Sally Hansen it's called magnetic
nail color and I'm wearing it now so you
can see on my nails what's going on once
you put the magnet on top with your
second coat it starts to do this
craziness with like old sort of a zebra
ish stripe on to do is there's a little
cap here that lifts off so as soon as
you put on like your second coat on one
of the nails set this right on your
cuticle and you just hover it over the
nail for about 10 seconds and then you
lift it off and you've got sort of a
design there it's kind of cool for those
of us who don't like aren't super into
you know making all the little
decorative designs but you get a new
effect on your nails this high so super
excited about these new products from
Revlon you know I love the jumbo lip
pencils and I love the tarte lipsurgence
and when I heard people tweeting me and
facebooking me comparing it to Tarte I
said no freakin way you know this is too
good to be true because I love the tarte
lipsurgence it's kind of a minty tingle
it's a beautiful almost balm like feel
on your lips it doesn't feather outside
your lips it's just like perfection in a
lip product and so these are the Revlon
just bitten kissable balm stain very
interesting I've got two shades here
this lighter one is called honey and
then the other one is called lovesick
and that's what I'm wearing now you can
see it's got a little bit of a sheen on
it and that Sheen will last about as
long as I think a typical lipstick does
but what will seem to remain
Durney that is that hint of color I wore
the lighter of the two I like just got
these a couple days ago but I wore this
one yesterday and I noticed you know the
color will come off on a coffee cup you
know it'll this little bit of shininess
will go away but throughout the course
of I would say 3/4 of the day yesterday
even after eating I still had like the
stain I still had my lips were this
color underneath even though they were
maybe still shiny anymore they still had
that comes a little bit more like your
lips but better
that's a swatch of it so it's like kind
of a muted pink but this one's obviously
a lot brighter so I do like how they
have that minty feel like the tarte
lipsurgence and I also had no like
feathering outside the lip line
sometimes certain lip liners you'll wear
them and you put them right out to the
edge and they can't handle it they
continue to like migrate a little bit
outside your lips and I did not notice
that with this at all yesterday so I'm
gonna keep trying these keep using them
not intended to be like a full-on review
but more of a whole but I was just so
excited about those ones got another new
product out it's called the smoky shadow
stick from Revlon Colorstay and I have
it in smolder this was the option that
had like a dark this is actually like a
dark teal and a really light silvery
blue here and this reminded me a lot of
the covergirl smoky shadow blast which I
highly disliked because it could not be
worn alone and this having the Revlon
Colorstay label on it I thought maybe
here is a long wearing cream eye shadow
product in a stick form which I like
twist up sticks and I haven't used this
on my eyes yet but I have swatched it on
my hand and I know like for example Weis
watch one of the Mallee ever color
shadow sticks on my hand that thing is
on there through hand washing it is on
there till I make a real effort to get
it off these i swatched on my hand I'm
set
and then I rubbed on them and they kind
of came off a little bit they're pretty
I'll give you that but I really have to
try them on my eyes to be able to let
you know like okay - they crease like
crazy can they be worn
do they have to be topped with a shadow
but I'm just letting you know that is
new at the drugs that owes from
covergirl they've taken their eye
enhancers and kind of changed the
packaging and come up with some new
quads and trios so they look like this
they're a little more I guess squared
off the others are kind of like a navy
blue a little bit more flat but it looks
like basically the same size product in
here this one that I'm showing you is in
smoke alarm and that's what I'm wearing
right now it's kind of like your smokey
eye but a little bit lighter show you
the other ones I have first off the one
I was wearing back in the video I did
with my mom on her favorite products was
this one called Fairy Tail
so there you go you've got like a dark
color which is you know gonna come off
okay and then some lighter colors this
this set was probably one of the better
ones because you can see you're getting
a decent amount of color payoff then I
have another one called
sugar-coated and that has these kinds of
colors and so see what I'm getting at
you're not seeing a whole lot of pastels
but more of these deeper colors worked
in which I like that attempt at some
variety but this one I was kind of like
I thought these were actually a little
bit bland because I wore this a couple
days ago and they didn't go on with a
lot of pigment the swatches here show
the metallic nature of them but not a
ton of pigment but the smoke alarm one I
thought was really good these were nice
and soft and really easy to work with
and you've got like some matte colors
there as well so this is like matte
charcoal Gray's maybe a satiny one with
this one here on the end but overall I
mean I think this is going to be a
little bit hit and miss I don't see like
some kind of vast improvement in these
quads over like the quads in the old
packaging like these you know what I'm
saying you need to work with them some
more but I just wanted to let you know
those are new out there and of what I
have the one called Fairy Tail is pretty
good and the one called smoke alarm I
really like some new mascaras coming out
right now and there's the mega plush
volume Express from Maybelline it's in
the steel tube and then
the brush looks like this it's got like
a little bit of a joint right here which
I think a couple of the other recent
Maybelline ones have but it allows it to
flex just a little bit more and then the
brush is tapered at each end and it's a
traditional brush not a rubber brush
mascara it has kind of long bristles but
I guess what's supposedly making this
different it says it's a revolutionary
gel mousse formula it's supposed to not
make your lashes feel as hard and
brittle when you apply it like keep the
flexibility in your lashes I guess
formula was a little more lightweight on
my lashes and because I don't have like
super super thick lashes I liked that
but I didn't think it made them huge and
amazing doesn't quite compare to what L
may get up and grow does for me this is
a really thick brush a and B it is a
little bit drier formula that my sparse
lashes really respond to but this was
you know while it was lighter it didn't
do that much another new mascara that's
out there is the power volume collagen
from L'Oreal so that looks like this
they have already you know a collagen
infused mascara but this says 24-hour
powered-up lashes this is sort of an
hourglass shaped brush with long
bristles really not in love with this
one I have it on today I also have on
false eyelashes the thing about this is
it really made my last just kind of
cling together in places and it might be
that this is so new and the brush is a
little more loaded down with product
than it otherwise would be but as I put
it on I really had to be careful because
it would take my lashes and like team up
five of them and I look like ultimately
I have four eyelashes at the end of an
application which I highly dislike but I
didn't have any issues with this flaking
off or anything of that nature I've worn
this for a few days but like I said I
don't love the way this looks on its own
when I add in some falsies you know it's
another story speaking of which maybe
you've seen these in your Walmart store
but this was kind of new to me
I saw the ever Pro lashes from kiss in a
5
because I love these I love these lashes
I've got a set of them on right now
otherwise you would see one more bunch
of them here but yeah there are 1 2 3 4
5 and this is a style that I really
enjoy these are these zero threes
they're what I'm wearing now they're
nice for like kind of kind of a natural
look I'm minutes I'm going to call that
natural I enjoy the drag queen big lash
and I would call this natural but
they're easy to put on they're a great
length for my eye I don't have to trim
these whatsoever and I just think it's
cool that they're packaging you know
more pairs because you think okay maybe
I'm gonna get between 5 6 7 8 uses out
of each one and then you're getting five
pairs here I'm not gonna be buying
lashes for a while so I think that's
kind of cool something fun I need to
mention are the Girl Scout lip balms I
saw these at Target and I could not
resist because I love me some Samoas and
they've got a Samoa flavor although I
must say this doesn't smell this this
doesn't compare I mean I just it's not
quite sweet and caramel e-enough but I
mean it's okay but I must say the
trefoils and the Thin Mints those
flavors are pretty dead-on this
seriously smells like you know kind of a
sweet shortbread cookie it smells just
like the could and the mint is good too
so I just thought that's fun I haven't
bought a lip smacker in a long long time
finally you may or may not know that Big
Lots is selling philosophy products for
$3 a pop I was in Big Lots recently I
think I must have walked right past the
display because instead of being in with
the makeup in my store it was like at
the end of an aisle in like a really
little display so you might have to do a
little looking for it but they've got
some different philosophy makeup
products they've got the color of grace
which is an amazing grace face powder
really pretty packaging and it's like
it's this is like a light pink highlight
here and it actually smells like grey
select amazing grace fragrance so that I
really like they've got a cheek color
that really doesn't have a whole lot of
impact this is the lit-from-within
supernatural
cream blush so that looks like this and
it sheers out to nothing much I just
watched it right these are just initial
reactions guys because I haven't spent a
lot of time with this but they have an
eyeshadow quad here in plum delicious
and these look like some nice overall
looks like three matte shades and then
kind of one shimmery color but these
feel pretty soft there's three of the
colors right there so I'm excited to try
that one more thing from Big Lots if you
want to know how I got this here which
is really crazy curly all over some
people may like it some people may be
like oh it's too much girl whatever I
got this for it was either 15 or $10 and
it's this little tote it's from Conair
and it's these little sticks and I don't
know if you guys have tried these like
when you were a kid I remember my mom
used to put these in my hair like before
cheerleading and you wrap your hair
around and then you cork it in like that
basically and so you've got these all
over it you just twist your hair around
it they're super easy to put in and
there are two sizes in here you get a
little bit larger ones and smaller ones
but really it doesn't matter it's gonna
get real curly and I just thought that's
fun for more of an overall curl in case
you haven't noticed I'm obsessed with
like hair setting systems rollers
curlers whatever it may be and I thought
this was kind of fun and we'll see how
like if my hair can hold a curl
that's tight like this a little better
than a looser curl because it's real hot
out
thank you so much for watching guys I
hope you enjoyed this video let me know
if there are any new things I might have
missed at the drugstore and have a great
day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
