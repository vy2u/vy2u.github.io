video this is a different kind of
concept a different twist on although
what's new at the drugstore videos that
are out there I know I've done a lot of
those as well the focus just naturally
turns to the new products that come out
in stores via a Sephora and Ulta a
Walgreens that's something to think
about what about all those things that
are sitting on the shelves that have
been sitting on the shelves so long that
you just naturally walk past and don't
give them a second look those are the
kinds of things that I want to talk
about in this video I want to talk about
the things that I feel are very under
hyped the things that go under the radar
very often this is kind of like a hidden
gems at the drugstore type of thing but
the focus really is on those products
that have been in the drugstore for a
long time they've not yet been
discontinued they've been sitting on
those shelves and I just don't hear them
talked about much on YouTube now the
first thing I'm going to point out this
thing is a long-standing product that I
know has been talked about a lot on
YouTube more so a few years back then
right now but I'm just going to throw it
out there in case anyone asked the
foundation I am wearing is the Revlon
Colorstay just the plain old liquid in
the bottle I just thought in honor of
this video I would pull out a classic
foundation fresh beige it's like the
perfect shade for me and I just feel
like on well moisturized skin this
particular foundation it really looks
fresh it lasts a long time there's a
reason why so many people at some point
in time or another have fallen in love
with this foundation so I'm not going to
go on and on because I do feel like this
is one of the products that has received
a lot of hype over the years but it's
still really good now a concealer that's
been in Rimmel's line for quite a long
time I know I've mentioned it before but
in general it doesn't receive a lot of
love and it's the hide the blemish
concealer and I really think there's
something special about this shade for
my skintone anyway the shade light beige
102 it's just perfect for the under eyes
and any blemishes I concealed three
pretty good-sized zits on my face with
this today and I'm not sure you could
pick them all out because this really
did a good job it's just nice coverage
really smooth but with a lot of
concealer sticks if you told me okay I'm
going to just swipe that up on my under
eye area as well
I hesitate
do that because so many of them are so
dry and so thick but this one really
glides on easily I use no salmony
corrector alongside this actually when I
look at this I think it's kind of
like a really light peach and it just
works for me and while this is called
hide the blemish right there on the
packaging it says feel free to use this
anywhere on the skin so I think that's a
really top-notch stick concealer I have
been trying loose powders like they're
going out of style lately because I have
fallen in love with one that happens to
be really expensive I talked about it in
the Emily awards and shortly before that
it's the by Terry hyaluronic hydra
powder it's a $60 loose powder that sets
the under eye like nobody's business it
looks just undetectable but it takes
away tacky textures that a lot of really
nice amoliant concealers can leave in
that area and I've actually been really
loving a rediscovered drugstore product
in that area I repurchase this recently
it's been so long since I've heard
anyone mentioned the mineral power line
from Maybelline this is the translucent
finishing Vale powder this does not have
any shimmer or any glow it's a nice
lightweight powder and I have been
testing this quite a bit on my under eye
area I don't feel like it looks cakey in
the least again the under eye area needs
a good eye cream on there you need to
really kind of tend to and prep that
area before you go in layering on a
bunch of concealer setting powder etc
I've done the traditional like baking
method with this stuff and I actually
didn't feel like it ended up looking too
heavy later in the day the way I
probably prefer it most the way I use it
today I just took a lightweight brush
and just kind of dusted it over where I
concealed with this product so this is
my under-eye today my blemish concealing
let's talk about a really good powder
for those of you who have really oily
skin and struggle to achieve good
staying power late in the day the
maybelline shine free line specifically
this compact I have it in the shade
golden it's gotten a lot of use over
time for me it's a really nice very
mattifying powder I don't think this has
to be used all over the face but put it
down your nose forehead sides of the
nose wherever you feel like oil really
shows up on you it does come with a puff
- long gone
but this is the kind of thing that could
work as a touch-up powder but even if
you just find yourself occasionally oily
maybe you're just a combo skin person
start your day with this and I think
you'll be pretty surprised at how long
you can wear it and not feel like you're
getting oily got a couple blushes to
talk about these are the kinds of things
where I feel like if they were maybe
repackaged renamed re-released to the
drugstores I think people would clamor
for these and then once they got them
home I believe they would rave about
them but because they've just been
sitting around and the same old displays
for a long time they're just older
products they get no hype and they get
no love and I'm talking about the
covergirl instant cheekbones blushes
they're like blush trios you get two
blushed shades and a highlight in them
and I absolutely love these I don't even
know where to begin the glow that they
give the skin their nicely pigmented
blushes first off and both of these
trios there is just a little bit of a
satin finish on the blush shades and I
think it looks gorgeous I'm wearing this
shade called purely plum actually I just
think of it as a nice trio of cool pinks
and I'm wearing this shade right here on
the apple of my cheek that's what's
giving me that really fresh like just in
from the cold type of color there's a
deeper shade that you can work in and I
think deeper skin tones would really
enjoy these because you can kind of mix
in here and add as much or as little of
this deep shade as you want to I'm not
literally contouring my face with this
shape but I am wearing it just a little
bit deeper like I've got that darker
shade here and then on the apple of my
cheek I've got the brighter one and then
this highlight the highlight looks so
fresh so luminous this other trio I've
been holding up is called peach
perfection if you've been a longtime
user of the pretty peach cheekers blush
this would be the instant cheekbones
trio take on that and so you're getting
a little bit warmer highlight shade
you've got this deep peach color to work
with and then like I said the purely
plum deeper pink medium pink and then
this really light pearly pink highlight
yes David I'm not letting that brush
fall if you do decide to go out and try
these tell me which shades did you pick
up there are more shades beyond just
these two and
show me some pictures talking about
eyeshadows I wasn't sure how far to go
with this section because I feel like I
could talk on underrated drugstore
eyeshadow quads and trios for a long
time it might be a separate video type
of thing but for this video I'm just
kind of talking about a couple that I
think are really great that just don't
get a lot of buzz first one though
Kristin game gets all the credit I think
she actually sent this one to me a
couple years ago she was like you
haven't tried designer chocolates for
Maybelline yet you've got to have it and
she sent it my way and even at that time
it was an older product in Maybelline's
line so you look at it now it's like a
really old project in Maybelline's line
but it's great this little quad I think
for as much buzz and as much love as the
nude eye palettes get and as many people
who enjoy the rosy shades this is like a
very condensed version of that type of
style this color right here this rosy
tone is so nice on top of a reddish
burgundy base so if you've got
pomegranate Punk from the Maybelline
Color tattoos in the little pots that
would be great underneath this if I
would have been thinking this morning I
would have done that I am wearing kind
of a combo of these two shades as my
highlight this on the lid this in the
outer corner it's nicely pigmented it's
easy to wear it's just one of those
surprising little drugstore quads that's
really simple to create a quick look
with and I think a lot of people would
go nuts for that another single from
Maybelline that's really really nice
just as a standard like very soft crease
shade or kind of a blended out type
color it depends on your skin tone as to
exactly how this is going to work for
you but I think if you're anywhere close
to my skin tone makes a really nice
blender type transition shade and it's
called earthly taupe this is a matte
color here by the way the matte in this
palette is the dark brown
these two are shimmery this one has a
little bit of a satin finish but this
one is totally matte and I use this in
my crease today it gives me just the
softest crease color but then I brought
it back in just to do a little blending
around the edges and I love it and I
could see so many people clinging to
this and using this consistently
alongside other palettes that don't
offer that nice little blended out type
Eve another thing I want to mention for
eyes it's definitely a rediscovered
product for me no pun intended lash
discovery is the name of this mascara
tiny wand great for the lower lash line
my covergirl clump crusher
water-resistant kind of started to just
take over for this in that role of doing
the lower lashes but I really like this
and I'm going to pull it back in more
maybe in the summer months when staying
power is even more of a challenge in
that area
I'll let clump crush your
water-resistant do that job but in
general I don't have smudging and
smearing with this mascara on my lower
lashes the brush makes it so easy to
just get each and every one so if you've
never tried this I think it's going to
be very refreshing for you because there
are so many mascaras that come out these
days that have brushes that are probably
like three to four times the size of
this little guy so when you get this in
your hand you're gonna be like I can get
everywhere with that it's really nice
liquid lipsticks hit in the market like
crazy they're all over the place but
what about the og liquid lipstick I'm
talking about covergirl outlast folks
this has been around for so long my mom
it's her favorite kind of lipstick to
wear because it completely stays in
place it does not feather outside the
lip line it's a liquid lipstick that you
basically paint on but then there is a
balm
that's designed to go over the top and
the idea is that everything stays in
place but you've still got that
comfortable kind of creamy feel but a
classic cream lipstick would give you
and it's kind of unique that this works
on top of this because with a lot of
liquid lipsticks that are out there
these days you add an emollient balm on
top of it the staying power immediately
breaks down it's like you've real iqua
fide the liquid lipstick but that
doesn't happen with this product shade
I'm kind of gesturing with it doesn't
say it on here so I kept the packaging
it's called wine to five and it's like a
deep rosy shade there's nothing
particularly wine about that to me this
is just a straight-up creamy shade
you've got to kind of look closely at
some of these if you try to stay away
from shimmer because some of these will
sneak a little shimmer and into the
liquid lipstick and then like I said
this is just a balm you put this on you
let it get completely dry and then you
can slather the balm on top of it who is
this for I would say it's for the people
who
the hardcore staying power that a lot of
liquid lipsticks attempt to give you but
you don't want that just completely dry
parched feeling so you've got that balm
that you can reapply a couple of tips
with this I would say exfoliate your
lips for sure before you use this
otherwise flaking is going to be highly
likely I think with a product like this
also try to go with the thinnest
application possible the thicker you
take this on the more you're going to
just feel it on the lips and that might
be one complaint about this is that I
don't feel like it gets completely
weightless at any point even with the
balm on top I can still tell that this
is on my lips and you don't want to be
like biting on your lower lip or doing
anything like that because it can kind
of pull the product away from the lip so
exfoliate put this on as thin as
possible don't mess with it keep your
balm applied later throughout the day
and that's how I think you can get the
best results out of covergirl outlast
but it's been around so long and it's
kind of funny to see all these other
liquid lipsticks hitting the market kind
of claiming to do what this does last
thing this is a lip product from cover
girls continuous color line and this is
a whole line of lip colors that I would
say is so remarkable like they're loaded
with great shades or the formula is like
above and beyond outstanding it feels a
lot like a standard Revlon Super
Lustrous lipstick to me and I was
thinking about including some of those
in this video but I thought you know I
hear about those a little bit more in
the makeup conversation at least here on
YouTube covergirl continuous color never
never hear anybody talking about this
this is the shade called 5:50 and I do
think this is that cool mauve that a lot
of people are after these days it's a
hot shade encapsulated in an old old
product in the drugstore and so that's
what I'm wearing today I love this shade
is that pretty cool dusty rose there's
no shimmer in this I know there are some
shimmery shades in this line because I
think when I was about 15 16 years old
those shades were my jam if you could
find me a brownish shimmer that was my
color but this shade I think the color
is just fantastic and it really does
feel comfortable it's just a classic
creamy lipstick I think a lot of people
would love this shade so that wraps up
my what's old at the drugstore
video things you might have overlooked
not saying everybody's you know miss
these things I'm sure some of you love
certain things that I've mentioned in
this video but in comparison to a lot of
the brand-new things that get raves all
the time on YouTube I would say in
general these are the kinds of products
that are going under the radar so I hope
you found this video useful thank you so
much for watching give me a thumbs up if
you liked it and I'll see you next time
