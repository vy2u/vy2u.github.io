video this is my friend Kaylee she she
works at a TV station that we used to
work at the same station and she is just
awesome
great friend and we always have fun
whenever we're together and she's been
here for the last couple days and we've
been having so much fun but we wanted to
really do a video because I just thought
you guys would love Kaylee and somebody
hello um as you you know she just told
you that I worked with her at the same
station and that's where she turned my
hate for makeup into an action that like
I want to learn more I can't you know I
love watching her do it because she
taught me I mean when I first started
doing this she did my makeup at work
like whenever I could get her to good
I just didn't that was sort of like our
initial bonding moment was like well you
helped me with my makeup and I was like
yay because I love doing people's makeup
you know I get tired of just doing it
all myself all the time so I did
Callie's makeup tonight actually I used
the Smashbox quad for brown eyes that I
did a video on in the past on me but I
did on her eyes and she has hazel eyes
but it's totally coming off I think kind
of blue on camera - your eyes are but I
love the way it turned out no I love it
I actually have never used a blue before
because I don't go out on the limit
triangle thing but when I'm with her I
do because she just does it we didn't
worry we're on your eyes last night we
did like black like dramatic black and
like pink at the top and it was awesome
- um the whole point of this video is to
show you Kate Watson Kaylee's makeup bag
because there are so many videos like
this on youtube like what's in your
purse what's in your makeup bag and
people love to basically snoop so yeah
this is my tiny makeup bag this is all I
own makeup wise okay um I just keep it
simple because if I get overstimulated I
I can't hit look whatever in here is
from Emily she took me to the store and
people asked me at work now because I'm
the one they say go talk to Kelly about
makeup and that's awesome that is like
fulfilling thing in the world and I'm
like are you kidding I couldn't believe
this because I had no idea
but anyway so people are like well what
kind of makeup do you use and I'm like
what you mean and they're like what kind
and I'm like all kinds I mean there is
not just one specific situation going on
inside this bag I just pretty much go to
the Walgreens yeah and I pick out the
buy one get one freeze I only get one
50% Oh like if I like it I like it if I
don't eat up right and it's about trying
different things you don't always have
to stick to the same thing over and over
again and you don't have to think that I
mean Kaylee's on TV in front of people
most you know most days out of the week
yeah doing something and people might
assume that oh if you're doing that
you've got to be wearing you know
something special or something expensive
but you can get a really good look on
camera with stuff that costs just you
know drugstores a dress or items so what
do you have in here well um you must
hear the breath okay this is my brush
it's a little it's seen better days will
say that let's just say and it's it's
best and it's a shiny moment it was a
great breath it's now past its prime
let's just put it that way but this this
brush has taken me to all kinds of
different levels I use it for everything
which I don't think you're supposed to
do that but I use it for my powder
because I use mineral which maybelline
mineral powder lean mineral that's what
I use what's your shade in case somebody
sees this and thinks they're your color
to shade is sandy beige okay sandy beige
medium so you'll put that on this she'll
use that you'll use that for news right
I use those in where new stuff and ER
every day yeah I just do it different
okay if I'm on the news I maybe do an
extra you know I got another one in here
this true let's L'Oreal True Match
pressed powder yes that's a really
really good powder guys and it comes in
a lot of colors and I am obsessed with
it like I mean I absolutely love really
smooth it has good
Everage and it doesn't look like you're
wearing a lot I kind of like the mineral
where once you put it on it doesn't
really look like it and so sometimes
I'll add this on top mm-hmm when I do TV
because it gives it an extra and you're
not going it is shiny if you have like a
powder like that yep your L'Oreal and
different colors she's got one that is
um trying to find where is it this is
subtle berries so it's kind of like some
maroonish shades and this one is
landscape and it's kind of like some
green like earth tone shades so these
are gonna look good on Kaylee sighs but
I think what we discovered today is blue
is her color too like the NIA really
really makes her eyes pop so no and I'm
really excited about that because you
know sometimes when I go to the makeups
there's so much yes
stuff and you just get mm-hmm what do I
do I think everybody has felt that way
at some point in time or another or is
feeling that way now like where do I
begin
yeah I try to like just look at it and I
think to myself I just don't think this
is gonna work out I might have to go
back I'm alone natural bronzer its
minerals okay natural minerals Emily
told me to get this a long time ago yeah
now this this is in the shade is called
Sundance I'll take this off so you can
see it's got a little bit of shimmer to
it but it's not like crazy shimmery and
it's not super dark so if you're a fair
skin tone and you want like a bronzer
that's something to just kind of kick it
up a notch
this is gonna be pretty good it kind of
reminds me of the NYC sunny I think I
was in a store that didn't have that one
and this is like the closest the next
closest option so that I advised Kaylee
to get this but um I think a bronzer is
really important don't you think
absolutely I get people who constantly
are like do you go tanning
are you a dark tone person I I do have a
darker tone but I'm like bronzer I mean
this bronzer is it right here you can
see night and day like when I put it on
definitely but it doesn't look like I
tried to harder you know I mean it's
white and the judge if you think that I
you know dude this is exactly what I'm
wearing right now
so um I really really enjoy it a lot and
I also use this powder Revlon I'm not
really a fan um this is just some kind
of something that was 50% off or
something I just you know it's not bad
I've just I've had better wash that
worked with me and sometimes I don't
know what color I am when I go to the
store like blush wise and I get nervous
that's gonna be too pink or it's gonna
be right you know and so I don't know so
this guy's uh maybe I'm not feeling it
okay um this is another thing that I
really enjoy it's um Maybelline mineral
power concealer concealer um and this is
my go-to especially on just days I'm
like alright let's go let's make
business happen and what's your shade on
that my shade is oh geez
sand pretty much I think that's a nice
tattoo on that yeah it's similar to the
shade of the actual powder myself sand
and I recommend that to a lot of people
who say I want to cover up blemishes and
not irritating them more because you put
that on and it's really gentle it's not
going to like get in there and make you
make whatever's on your face worse and
you can use it on your under eye area
too yeah and it's not clumpy you know
it's just like it's very light it's very
lightweight mm-hmm you can layer that
with the foundation like Kaylee said she
does and it'll still all come off like
not too much me yeah
I'm here's I love this okay I absolutely
love this this is Maybelline it is
bronze glitz and it's just I really like
pop this open bronze colors on my eyes
because I really like what it looks like
most of the time and I like the shimmer
I'm a big shimmer kind of person and so
I I like having like the really bronzy
type situation I think it works with her
skin well and so this this is my go-to
Brown like any time while I have to put
it with this I usually normally put it
with this L'Oreal you know hip situation
here
and that shade is saw say oh that's
really pretty I think I think I want
that
that's like dark dark brown and like
kind of a shimmery like bronze there
yeah that would work great with those
colors and I put it like in the coin you
know like make its outer V outer V
little corners and I can tell you've
gotten a lot more comfortable with
makeup because you have a lot more
products in your makeup bag I did it
when I met you I came in this room
because she's got she's got more makeup
than Walgreens uh because that's always
a go because it's only clothes I can
reference like actually funny story real
quick
um my friend I went to the store with
her wishes and Walmart's just get some
groceries so they're going to pick up
some don't go to Walgreens like I have a
partial to the Walgreens now yeah now
you have an emotional connection to
Walgreens some like do not go anywhere
else the water this guy right here
L'Oreal True Match it's natural beige is
my color it's liquid um I pretty much
use this at all times this is a really
point a tunnel I'll say I bought this
the other day um I only bought it
because Rimmel um I haven't had any
colors like this the what's that call
her fever fever though it's summer cold
and pink pink I just hadn't had that
color yet so I am see that's the
attitude people need to have you know I
don't be scared no if you've never worn
purple like this this was probably like
a three to four dollar item you are not
gonna go out that much yeah if you can
get it on buy one get one free or buy
one get one half off it's only reason I
gotta test it out you know you're never
gonna know if it looks good on you if
you don't just try it and if it didn't
work for you hey give it to a friend but
maybe yeah that wants to try it too so
no biggie
um this is the mineral powder the fail
finishing powder young um and Emily
actually um this this is done with me
for a year now mmm it's lasted a very
long I don't even know how to take off
the top anyway whatever I did not
recommend this Emily did not this was a
by the way I have my field
the deal this is a deal and you know
sometimes when you get the deal you
don't always get the right thing yeah I
do not like this mascara lash fantasy I
do not like it
the primer I don't know why you need
that nothing you know a lot of mascaras
have come out with that primer and it
makes you think okay I put that coat on
it's gonna thicken things up and then I
put the black on and it's like twice as
awesome of a mascara and your lashes
look twice as big
some mascaras like L'Oreal double extend
I think do a good job with that this one
I have tried before never really got
into it I'm not a huge fan of a lot of
Revlon mascaras but yeah this one's just
kind of it doesn't it doesn't do what it
says it's gonna it's called spider eyes
mmm it makes my eyes look like all my
eyelashes are stuck together and it's
gross and nasty but now I have to use it
until it's gone
because that's where I roll this guy's
almost gone obviously I liked him I have
no idea what it is
because I took off all of the things I
judging by the packaging I think this
was Rimmel I am Not sure this is this
has been so loved that the there is no
label anywhere on this but the shape
makes me think it's Jane Doe going into
the abyss that is any lace makeup also a
lipstick I've loved very much so taking
this will leave us all still thinking
what is in Kaylee's makeup capture
coming back from war
you know this is the mineral powder
powder I couldn't guess that you're
gonna pull out a mineral power item yeah
no you can't guess but I'm not gonna lie
I do not like the blush don't like the
blood I'm not feeling it it does not
happen for me it does not show up I feel
like I have to keep going well your and
your skin tone is a little bit darker so
you might need to go with something
that's a little little brighter maybe on
the blush to make it really show up all
right here Revlon Colorstay pencil liner
love it awesome love it I use it at the
bottom I love on the crease right here
it's awesome
this guy a must have tweezers keep
things in check say no to the unibrow
no matter what they tell you new
experience rimmel rimmel and it is a
yeah kiss and stay it says so it's like
a lot I think it's a long word I've
never tried this it's a long wearing lip
gloss no it's like a coat oh it's a lips
color with a coat over the top right
yeah this this is the coat over the tab
mm-hm and I've only used this because
this color is a little too much for me
to handle it's a little Coralie what I
didn't take it off it didn't come it
just doesn't have a number on it but
it's like kind of a bright coral and
then light peach I guess on top it's a
Studio 35 it's a angled eyeliner and
shading brush so I'm guessing there used
to be a shading brush at the bottom
wait let me find the shading brush can
see it somewhere there's this it's in
her eye shadow you know what you do love
your things that's good like let me
check angle liner brush yeah it's good
to have but we're gonna get you hooked
up with some dips and brushes here
shortly oh yeah I feel really bad about
it okay because you know what your
makeup still looks great and people
don't need a whole stash of brushes you
know you can use the applicators you can
use I mean q-tips are amazing what they
can do like don't think that you have to
have a ton of brushes Kaylee has
survived on minimal brushes but still
looks great another it's a Revlon crayon
type eyeliner it's blackberry and I've
no like set oh I'm excited it came with
a on the plum color it came in the same
pack the reason I got it mmm-hmm it came
in the same package with the not so good
mascara mascara the Revlon I like Revlon
Colorstay liquid liner awesome no it is
by far I never get a different kind like
because I've just come to enjoy that in
a big way but that is Haley's makeup bag
