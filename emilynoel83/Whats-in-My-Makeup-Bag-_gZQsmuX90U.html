and watching this video what I'm going
to show you today is the make up stuff
that I take with me everyday in my
makeup bag my go to work so it's tough
to touch up with that kind of thing in
case you didn't know some of you might
know so you might not I work in TV news
I'm a reporter slash anchor a lot of
days I go in in the morning I'm out in
the field doing a story and so in the
field that's just like a TV turn like
out and about you know talking to people
out in the weather elements you know
doing whatever and then in the evenings
when a newscast come on I have to get
myself presentable and usually pretty
quickly get myself back together I
always do my makeup before I go and then
I just take some things that I can like
touch up with so um I get some questions
sometimes a lot of questions at work you
know what are you using what you use and
I'm not going to go through my whole
routine before I get ready just where
you catch up so first off I take the fig
bag it has what my note pads and
everything like that in there and in
there I keep my basic big things that I
would use for hair got have a curling
iron that can heat up quickly in case
you know your hair goes completely wrong
that day and they gotta get together
before you go on there um a brush is
always a good thing no matter what Oh
comb like this so you can kind of like
back comb your hair if you need some
more time spin it buy you new today so
that's a good one
I keep always keep some sort of aerosol
hairspray on hand
this is a really fast drying hairspray
by vo five it just really locks
everything in and keeps it it usually
keeps my hair pretty good throughout the
day no matter what I'm doing but I
always take it again just in case and
then a great product from Nick Chavez
Beverly Hills it's called dry volumizing
blocker yes I said full locker FL o cker
and this is something that basically you
can kind of rip out I think you had your
hair down and curly and you want to just
revive the curls at the end of the day
you would like put it in your hands
spread your hands together put your head
over get it all over into the roots and
it just brings everything back to life
it separates the curls a little bit it
just give you more body at the roots and
I love this stuff so that's just the
perfect tool to have in your touch-up
stuff like I said this isn't like
average base just you know bumming
around town step this is just the stuff
that I use if I'm you so I'm gonna go on
TV so that's that's in my bag I also
have a small makeup bag that holds all
my stuff to touch up my makeup at the
end of the day because to me that is one
of the most important things you know
get into those bright lights it's like
go time so you've got to look decent on
the news so I'm just going to pull it
out and tell you what I use eyelash
curler it's a very important thing to
have with you at all times even more
important than mascara because if you
can as far as ketchups go because if you
can just get those eyelashes back to
where they are a lot of times it's not
that you need more mascara it's just
that you need men to be curl again so
you can tell what you did earlier in the
day to them this one's by oh it's my
absolute favorite it cost me a dollar I
take a bronzer with me that's a great
thing to touch up with as well just kind
of revive your face brings it all back
this one's by wet and wild
it's called Bali bronze it's a nice deep
color but it goes on fairly here but I
mean pretty impressive color on this
room I paid probably two dollars and
seven
um I take two shades of blush all the
time because they both have very
different purposes for me one is a kind
of a brighter pink color it's plum very
blue glow my covergirl
the other one is golden pink from
covergirl and I use the pinky one right
on the apples of my cheeks and the other
ones to contour a little bit like I said
this may not be your everyday makeup
because you're getting on on the news
you kind of have to exaggerate certain
features a little bit more so I do try
to contour a little bit try not to make
it noticeable but I get my best and I
always take a press powder with me I
really really like L'Oreal True Match
because regardless of the foundation I
used beforehand sometimes I use Revlon
Colorstay foundation sometimes I you
better use bare minerals foundations
beginning of the day but I find that
this color I use Sun beige so if your
skin is like mine Sun beige might work
for you by the way all the splashing
liner by the TV you so much why all the
lights watching them but um no this is a
pretty good powder that works well
regardless of the foundation you have
underneath so to match from L'Oreal
decent power well notice a lot of the
stuff isn't too expensive because if I'm
going to carry it around in my bag I
don't want to something people that can
get broken I don't want it to be a big
issue if I lost it so I'm not doing my
big investment items just there are a
few but not a lot uh maybelline age
rewind concealer um in medium just to
you know I don't don't find myself
reaching for that a whole lot but it's
just like if the under-eye area gets
nasty or whatever use that as you take a
mascara with me just in case it's
usually either covergirl fantastic lash
or the L'Oreal hip mascara it is awesome
too
I know I'm a huge fan of the covergirl
fantastic lash but this stuff is amazing
amazing I have it on right now so he'll
you can't see that really can enough um
brushes I am able to tote around a few
brushes I'll just try to pull them all
out real quick a all over powder brush
sort of thing for my bronzer brush for
my blush just a typical blush brush and
two shadow brushes one bigger contour
and one is a very fine contour brush
they get to job then I take a liner with
me sometimes you guys go over your
eyeliner
even though Revlon Colorstay is great
and it's where that I have to go over it
by the time I'm a safety net I usually
have one color stay in the very black
shade um another thing let's have your
lip stuff I use usually a different lip
type thing everyday so I'll just tossed
a couple in here just for an example
here's that mary kay and persuade lip
color and a discontinued revlon shade
and get ready like a most beautiful red
lip gloss oh there you can see it now
that I have probably ever use so but I
you do I can't so much get away with the
nude colors on air so there's that a
couple of eyeshadow things Smashbox trio
and smokey eyes that came out of their
expertise kits and make up forever time
and shadow in a very flat color just to
go over the eyes and another things I
other get other things I keep in there
so floss hair things and bobby pins some
blotting papers and what do you know
that's it that's what I take every day
in my makeup bag just in case I need to
do a touch-up which is often before the
newscast goes on so uh thank you for
watching this and I'll look for more
videos to come
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
