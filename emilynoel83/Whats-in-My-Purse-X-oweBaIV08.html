afternoon I have a video to show you
what's in my purse and I've been this
has been requested several times and I
love watching other people do these kind
of videos so I'm kind of surprised that
I hadn't really thought to do it yet
myself but I have tons of different
purses I have like in my closet I have
like so many different verses to match
just about everything and a lot of them
are cheap but the one that I happen to
have my stuff in today is my coach purse
it's lavender lavender with the tan
detailing on it has a cute little
adjustable strap there no I did not pay
full price for this I got like a nice
coach outlet store so I've got a really
good deal on it but it's pretty cute
I love lavender so I love this purse and
so let's look inside and see what's in
here first thing I've always got these
fish teeth just you know to no end
there's no his feet in there but what
seats are really big like when you want
to spit out your gum and put them in
something those are always good
so they come in handy sometimes I've got
some gum some strawberry banana gum from
extra I shoe a lot of sugar this gum
because I don't know it just keeps my
mouth occupy
let's see I've got a business card from
somebody I interviewed on a story a
police chief person I've got my press
credentials where I have to like if I I
went to the State Capitol in Springfield
and did a story there and so to get
inside so I don't have to search all
your stuff you can see there's my um my
picture that's on the website so yep I
have to have that like clip it on my
shirt so people know but I'm not gonna
go blow the place up or something oh I
got more gum and some orbit citrus mint
gum I've got my car keys which is this
enough stuff on the car keys I wonder
yeah I got my gold gym membership I've
got my Sally Beauty Supply Beauty Club
Card I've got my nail file I've got a
teeny tiny mini lip gloss I've got a
bottle opener which I never use my house
key and my car keys so good to have
there and
they've got a little wallet just a
little basic black wallet I've got some
change in it some receipts my driver's
license very smiling you got some more
cards my debit card more receipt let's
see what else I got a little thing of
Tylenol so in case I get a headache and
prepared I've got my my pink iPod
shuffle see it just clips onto stuff
look use that when I work out pens gosh
I have so many pins in here cos Leah
reporting I think that's another thing I
want to show you is why what's in my
reporter bag because that's a whole
other ballgame there but I do usually
like if I'll be out on a story I will
have this bag usually with me at least
in the car
so pins are a must for that see about a
business card from my alterations lady
that did my being my bridesmaid dress
I've got a ticket from a southern
Illinois minors game it's like a minor
league baseball but they are actually
called the minors with a bit it's my
cute little logo
see I've got my oh these granola bars
these 90 calorie Quaker granola bars are
wonderful to have on hand because
sometimes when you're not doing a story
you don't know when your next chance
that eat will be so these like tide me
over so much so yeah you never want to
go without having some kind of snack or
something in your purse I dropped
because sometimes I usually use those up
when I'm anchoring I'll have those
sitting there on the desk because your
eyes can really get kind of dry as
you're sitting there waiting over and
over if you're not blinking as much as
you normally would and your eyes get
kind of dried out I'm saving a little
makeup items I have in here to last a
hair elastic bands got money clips if I
want pull half my hair back last-minute
this thing is my IFB you can see this
this little guy goes in my ear and this
is how I hook into a little box that is
clipped on my pants while I'm anchoring
the show and this allows the producer to
communicate with me and like if I'm
doing an interview for example she'll
say 2 minutes 1 minute 30 seconds and
then wrap it up so I know how much
yeah but I stick this in my ear and it
wraps around behind and it's got a
little clip here so I'll clip it on my
collar and then this cord goes down line
back and clips into the like I said the
the little box that so I can hear things
in and if I was doing out doing a live
report you ever noticed how sometimes
the reporter will be out there and
they've got their finger in there trying
to you know hear what the anchors saying
if it's really loud somewhere that's
what they're doing so they're trying to
make sure they can hear so that you know
if I don't have this I you know it's
it's it really creates a problem if you
don't have your iron being people have
lost money I got this little brush mini
brush is always good to have on hand so
it runs through your hair and yeah I
mean I don't have a ton of hair so many
brush works just fine and now I believe
we're just down to my makeup items that
I have in here
I do not carry a lot of makeup in my
purse now if we're talking my reporter
bag I carry a little makeup bag of
everything I would need to touch up my
entire face before a newscast day but in
my purse purse I only keep certain
things I do not ever usually put in more
than this I have a pressed powder with a
mirror this is my L'Oreal True Match
powder I carry it around because in case
of emergency this has really good
coverage and so I can I feel like if for
some reason everything gets sweat off or
worn off or something if I put this on I
will be okay takes away shine and it's
good for a last-minute touch-up if
you're out in the field before you do a
live shot or something
fellow mirror there and then we'll
sponge so that's my powder that is my
go-to powder that I have kept in my
purse I mean obviously ivory ivory
purchased this but I for years now I've
been that's been what I carry around I
always take my eyelash curler with me
everywhere I go this is my ELF eyelash
curler and I just she can see as soon as
I put my hands on it I have to use it
that's just one of the quickest ways to
revive your look I think is to just curl
your eyelashes and then I'll carry
around whatever lip stuff I'm using that
day so I you know it's not like I have a
ton lip stuff flowing around in my purse
that's one thing I'm really like you
know anal about I don't like to not know
where my makeup is like I don't like to
just have a ton of lip gloss floating
around in a purse somewhere I always put
it back at the end of the day or I'll
you know shift it over to my other my
make will makeup bag that
taking but like for today it's my Revlon
look glide and radiant rose and my
beauty rush Victoria's Secret lip gloss
in iced tea so it's better the extent of
the makeup that I carry around in my
purse just because I don't have a lot of
room you know I don't like carrying
around a super huge purse because just
for the fact but I don't know it's for
what I do I have a big bag that I carry
for reporting stuff so therefore I want
my purse to be somewhat smaller so I've
got two huge bags so you guys know what
I mean but I got like a lot of different
persons this is just my person today I
guess so thank you for watching I hope
you found this interesting I hope it was
all you hoped it would be
it's really not it's your your average
purse your average ten things that are
in there but anyway if you guys haven't
done it what's in your purse yet you
should do one because they're really fun
to watch and I think everybody just
really likes them so thanks for watching
have a good afternoon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
