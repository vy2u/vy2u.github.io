just a little cold I'm like wrapped up
in my blanket here because I'm a little
chilly in here I think I thought it was
a lot warmer than it was his getting
warmer outside and then I like took my
old jacket off and my tank top on like
actually still about that woman so
anyway this was a video that I think I
had alluded to the fact that I might do
it what I did a like what's in my like
what's in my work makeup bag or as you
know in case you don't know in case
you're just seeing me on YouTube for the
first time I am a news anchor slash
reporter and I had done some sort of
video on like what makeup I use for work
and take to work quite a while ago and I
think I had mentioned about maybe doing
something about like what's in my
reporter bag you know like what things
does it report a news anchor or whatever
keep in their bag and this is um I just
recently transferred my stuff into this
big bag and it's not really like a you
know super brand bags just like kind of
a little leathery bag like that
decent size and it holds you know not my
makeup bag because I actually have a you
know full-size makeup bag that I keep
all my makeup that I take to work in so
if you're not seeing a lot of makeup in
this video that's because that's a whole
other thing that I did I think it's with
my new makeup bag but anyway let's cut
to the chase here show you what's inside
I'll kind of describe it for you and I
think I want to do a video too in the
future about just you know what it takes
to get into the news business sort of
advising high school / college students
about maybe what things you should think
about doing if you want to get involved
in news because I've gotten so many
questions and I really didn't think
there would be that many people that
were interested but since you are I
think that's awesome and I'll do some
stuff on it but anyway in my bag here so
many different things I try to like
compartmentalize things since this is
such a big bag into smaller bags and
this little it's so cute it's like
actually furry on the outside and this
is what I keep my something I use every
day my IFB
and this is an earpiece basically that
you put in your ear and then you clip
this on the back of your collar so this
cord goes down your back and then it
plugs into a little box so you can hear
your producer during the newscast and
they'll give you time cues or they'll
tell you you know wrap it up and stuff
like that so you always have to have
that with you and I just I I never know
you know I if I have it in the bag that
I always take with me I will always have
it no matter where I go you don't know
if you're gonna do maybe a live shot one
day they're in some huge accident that
happens or something and you need to be
on the scene of something if you have
this sitting in your desk drawer at work
it's not going to do you much good so I
keep it in the bag I take everywhere
what else do I have in here I've got my
little boy shoes for my phone just
because sometimes you don't have hands
wait you always have hands you just
don't have hands to operate a phone all
the time we've got my little iPod
shuffle and my headphones which the most
valuable piece of this for my work is
definitely the earphones here because
sometimes you're out of the story and
you're logging video which basically
means you're looking back through the
video that was shot or the interviews
that you did and you need to listen to
them so you can pick out sound bites a
little ten-second blurbs that you
actually end up hearing on the news and
sometimes when you're on the go and the
car photographer might not have his so
or hers but we are photons are all guys
at our station so I've got my little
reporter tag here that well press
credentials if you're going to like the
State Capitol or somewhere where there's
a little bit of higher security what
else do I have in here I've got my
little mirror that I use I got this from
cherry culture I think I had it in the
haul video once but it's like got the
magnified in the regular mirror well
it's gonna make sure you look at okay
make sure there's nothing in my teeth
that's like my number one like little
thing before I go on I'm always like
anything about you my eyelash curler I
always take an eyelash curler with me
and that's about it for that little bag
so that's just kind of like stuff I
would pop in anywhere any bag that I'm
taking with me I would make sure I have
that little thing with me too I've got
some lotion just some hand lotion I got
this little thing that I also just pop
in my purse to ship I'm only taking my
purse somewhere and this is my little
lipgloss bag and it only contains
lipgloss I've got a Revlon lip glide
which is what I have on right now in
radiant rose and there's some random
pink lip gloss so I got my Revlon and
nude attitude might the new matte
lipstick and I've got my first B's
little whipped in there so this is so
cute this is by G Vaughn sheet and it's
just a little bag that came with some
lip gloss is in it a couple years back
for Christmas so it's just the perfect
size for this or my purse
um what else oh here stuff got a big
thing hairspray this is actually I ran
out of my bo5 whatever I was using that
I liked and this is pretty good too
so that's what I've been using the past
couple days it's freeze it mega freeze
hairspray 24-hour extreme hold I'm sorry
it's not the way per hour but it's
pretty good I got my just a brush that I
always keep in here to take with me and
my comb that I tease my hair with in
case I totally need to redo something I
usually do my hair at home before I go
to work but I will always take my
curling iron with me in case I need an
that hair spray and brush and stuff in
case I need to touch up you know freak
snowstorm or rainstorm on my way in the
door you know got to be prepared um I've
got a thing of looks like throat drops
or cough drops here because if you do
catch a sore throat and you have to go
on air and anchor an hour and a half's
worth of news and a bunch of cut-ins you
know your it really can affect how
easily you speak so I like to always
have drops on him because you never
know when you're gonna wake up with a
scratchy throat hair clip just in case
you're outside I learned the hard way
being out live one day doing a live
report
and the wind decided to kick up and my
hair was down and I really would have
appreciated having something on hand
that could pull it back so definitely if
you're a reporter anywhere keep like a
clip or an elastic band or something
with you because you will need it
someday oh it keeps inviting four
contacts in there just because my eyes
can get extremely dry it's amazing when
you're reading and you're reading off of
a teleprompter how dry your eyes can
become so that's important always keep
some kind of food with me in case I get
into a situation where I'm on a story
and the story is taking forever and I'm
not getting lunch or something so now
that this is really my idea of lunch but
it will get me through just one of those
things pens you know not too important a
little notepad Oh my mom gave me these
gel heel cushion and gel for foot
cushion like if you're wearing high
heels so I haven't used those yet but
thanks mom I'm sure I will sometime I
mean I I've got a bunion for drying out
loud so I probably need him um I got
this little I have a bigger notepad in
my desk at work but I've got one of
these little little guys hold the mini
notepad that I've got notes on from when
I've done stories or written down my
sound bites from interviews I've got my
business cards in there too
and also just notes from some random
story I did about how to reduce the
amount of break-ins in one town so I
mean that's just you know general
stuff you're gonna find in the reporters
bag what else I've got a ton of stuff
here for the cold weather because it has
been so cold lately I've got my little
little hat here I think it's kind of
cute it's like not your average little
hat it's like I don't know it's got a
little bill on it I thought it was kind
of cute at the time but I got it it's
reversible too it's like gray on one
side and black on the other and that
bill is kind of important to keep stuff
out here face when the weather is
acting up got one of those little ear
headbands from ear mob some gloves oh
I've got a whole array of those things
that keep your hint like your hands warm
that you shake them up and they you put
them in your gloves or your feet or on
your body
yeah I'm seriously though you've got to
be you've got to be prepared because you
can walk into work and have no idea
where you'll end up that day so the way
my job works is I I incur obviously the
morning newscast so I go in amazingly
early to work every day I have to be at
work at 3:30 and I'll anchor and then we
do things called cut-ins where ABC
affiliate so Good Morning America comes
on and then they'll break and come back
to local news for a few minutes so we'll
be prepared to do that and then
oftentimes we will either go out and do
a story if we're needed I'm tuck-in by
me I mean myself and my co-anchor and
some days we just stay in the station
and we'll do a story there or Sundays
they won't need us to do stories because
we do have full-time nine-to-five
reporters so they kind of take
precedence in terms of you know having a
photographer to go out with for that day
and stuff like that because they're
going to be there all day we leave
around noon or a little before so
anyways hopefully that gives you a
little insight as to what I take with me
for my day and what I keep in my
reporter bag or my anchor bag or
whatever you want to call it but I'm so
excited to hear that so many of you are
interested and this is a career path
because it's very exciting no two days
are the same and I will definitely be
doing something in the future sort of
outlining how you can break into this
business and have what steps you need to
take to get there so thank you guys so
much for watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
