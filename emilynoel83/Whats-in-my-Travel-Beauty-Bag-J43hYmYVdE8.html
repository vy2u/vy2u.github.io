for Christmas by now oh my gosh it's
coming so quickly and it seems like one
of the main things you think about in
terms of like a mental checklist is
getting all the gifts for the people on
your list and being ready to go where
that's concerned but sort of the
afterthought sometimes is packing and
really getting ready to travel to
wherever you need to go so if you are
planning to travel in this video I'm
going to show you hopefully quickly what
I have in my travel bag here that is
going to allow me to travel lighter than
I probably ever have before make up wine
it may vary person to person you may
need more or less or whatever but these
are just some ideas not only for travel
in general but specifically for the
holidays and still getting that kind of
glamorous holiday look you might want
but with sort of a streamlined a bunch
of stuff in your bag so in this bag I
have everything I'll need for skin hair
and makeup so starting off with the hair
stuff which is kind of poking out here
already I'm going to be taking my
Remington this is my pearl styling wand
here so this is just great for
maintaining any kind of a curled style
that I might have and I just find that
that's the hairdo that really lasts the
longest on me when my hair is curled
around that iron and so that's nice to
take kind of as a touch-up or to redo it
or whatever also a small can of the
Tresemme hairspray now this isn't the
tiny can this is kind of the medium size
can and I think this is just perfect for
travel the small ones I mean I have one
of the really little ones but the cap
just won't stay on and I've noticed at
the store the cap doesn't seem to stay
on any of them so I like this kind of
medium size I think that's great for
travel also I take comb and a brush my
brush is not in here at the moment but a
teasing comb like this that I can use to
help me style my hair and that is my
hair stuff so moving on to my makeup bag
this is gonna be my travel makeup bag so
take this not only as stuff you should
travel with I think but also you know
product recommendations basically so
open it up and this is what I have in
here
it's really not even half full right now
some of this stuff has to stay out here
for me to talk about it first but anyway
just to start off a great thing for
travel are these makeup cleansing cloths
these are the Olay Daly facials and
basically you wet one of these under the
sink and it foams up and you can remove
all your makeup with this for me with
the Olay Daly facials it doesn't even
irritate my eyes to take my eye makeup
off so take some of those and you know
if you're staying as a guest at
someone's house you don't have to worry
about taking one of their washcloths and
getting your makeup all over it or
anything like that so I just find these
to be a great great thing not only here
at home but a great thing to pop in your
bag to travel with I also want to take
along a moisturizer and sometimes you'll
find these and maybe set them aside or
kind of get them buried under some of
your other makeup stuff but like for
example this is my vino positively
radiant moisturizer it came free with
another Aveeno product and now I've got
this small moisturizer which actually
has quite a few uses in it and that's
gonna be great to be small and compact
and fit right there in my bag kind of
going chronologically with how I would
get ready I've got my Rimmel lasting
finish foundation in here why is this a
good travel product well it's in a
plastic tube so you don't to worry about
glass breaking it's very travel friendly
in that sense also it's easy to smooth
on with your fingers and I don't feel
like it requires a primer underneath to
get that really smooth even application
so not taking a primer cuts out one more
thing I feel like for me on my skin
anyway this goes on pretty easily with
or without a primer so I've got that
plus it's really long wearing if I'm
somewhere and I really don't have any
time to touch up concealer wise I'm
taking my benefit erase paste I feel
like I want to take this because once
again I can put this on without needing
any certain kind of brush I really in
fact prefer how this looks when I just
use my fingers and also I feel like I
can use this all around my face it works
great for under-eye and great for any
other imperfections on the face I would
recommend a powder that could also
double as a powder foundation in case
you are really in a hurry and you want
to skip the the liquid altogether new
thing I'm
is two-faced amazing face powder and
it's a skin balancing flexible coverage
foundation powder and my shade is
perfect nude so I'm trying that out I
will let you guys know how this
continues to work for me so far I like
it really flawless coverage but it's
nice to have that option to just use the
powder and not worry about the
foundation part of it next up this is a
product I know I talk about a lot and I
could have just pulled something else
out for the sake of talking about
something different but the elf
contouring blush and bronzer is such a
travel friendly product because you have
your bronzer in there which i think is
very good for contouring and with a
fluffier brush you can get that light
application of bronzer you just really
do need to be careful to not get too
much if you have fair skin but either
way I think I mean this is a great
bronzer to have and then this blush can
also sort of double as a it's such a
luminous blush it can almost give you
the effect of a highlight and if you
look closely at it and you can see that
it's got sort of some golden shimmer
there it's definitely a light luminous
peachy color so when you've got that you
don't necessarily need any other blush
or highlighter product with it however
one that I probably will grow into my
bag anyway is my ELF studio blush in
blushing Rose because I feel like that
gives me that kind of glam cheek look
you know if I'm going with kind of a red
lip a light eye and a little bit more
blush on the cheek I think this gives
you a really pretty color they're
talking about eyes need a primer I've
got my mini urban decay primer this is
another thing when you might have a mini
one in your collection either way I
shadow primer doesn't take up a lot of
room but just to have something to give
you that long wearing eye base and then
for my shadow I actually have it still
in my bag I'm gonna take my Z palette
and I talked about this I vlogged about
it if you care what colors I have in
here that's on my blog but this offers
me as many colors as I could possibly
need to get a neutral eye look a smoky
eye of more colorful eye whatever I
choose I also can use this matte brown
shade
- double as my brow powder so I'm all
set where that's concerned for my liner
black liquid liner can't go wrong with
that I feel like in almost any
circumstance for the upper lash line so
I have my hard candy walk the line
liquid liner I have a mini in this so
that's a extra convenient but this
actually is really good this is one of
the richest blacks I have so that'll be
great if I feel like doing a glamorous
cat eye you know that nice kind of
holiday look I just feel like that works
well and kind of a rediscovered product
the perfect point plus from covergirl
this is actually quite a nice eyeliner
and I have it in black comes with the
blending tip here and a nice fine tip
for the liner itself and that's good for
you no smudging it around on the lower
lash line very good to have on hand also
the voluminous carbon black mascara if
you're just looking for full black
lashes I mean this is gonna be a go-to
for me it's got to have the eyelash
curler though before you do that elf one
dollar eyelash curler is a must-have for
me and then for lips um I want to have a
lip balm with me of course
anivia a kiss of smoothness I am giving
this to several people for Christmas
this year because I love it so much and
I know it's just gonna be one of those
lip balms that you sort of fall in love
with - it's so silky so I have that and
then guys I'm so excited to tell you
about this I got to open one of my gifts
early and it is the it's from bare
essentials and it is the buxom city
slickers set I don't look so it's
exciting because there's nothing in
there right now but I just wanted to
show you the packaging what this is is a
set of not only the lip gloss but these
things called what are they even
referred to as big and healthy lipsticks
and so they're kind of like jumbo lip
pencils and when I saw this I instantly
kind of thought oh my gosh if you were
gonna travel somewhere if you were gonna
go somewhere and you wanted every shade
you could get this would give you all of
that and I absolutely am falling in love
with these lip glosses I tweeted about
it not too long ago and a ton of people
were like oh my gosh I love those too
minty tingly
but not too tingly I mean I've tried
some nightmarish lip glosses in terms of
the feeling they give you on your lips
but this feels so fresh I absolutely
love it and these these sticks are
really cool too I'm gonna need to do a
full-out review to really describe it
but you can see they're kind of like the
size of a jumbo a jumbo lip pencil just
fantastic but more on the shades on the
shade I am wearing now is sort of the
red shading it's called brandy and I'm
just wearing the gloss right now but so
you've got your red and that red lip
liner the jumbo pencil is really nice
and red too so you've got a duo of reds
a duo of nudes pinks and like a a
brighter future berry shade and I just
think wow if I throw that in my bag for
travel I've got all the glosses all the
lipstick colors I would need and bam
there I go a travel brush kit is a great
thing to have especially if it contains
pretty much everything you need I've
reviewed this and gone in depth on this
before so I will also link to this but
this is the Sigma travel brush kit it's
not the premium one but here you're
getting stippling brush powder brush
blush pencil brush larger blending brush
concealer or a flat shadow brush and
just that perfect shadow brush to get
that initial application on your eyelids
so super quick run-through there I'm
sorry if you didn't catch it all but I
mean this is basically going to take
care of my face there were just a few
brushes I needed to throw in first off
my tweezers also I needed to put in
there but I've got to have my essence of
beauty crease brush duo just got to have
it hasn't been duplicated seem that I
mean I just love the small size of those
brushes and then an actual eyeliner
brush that also comes with that nice
kind of spoolie brush there to deal with
your brows so there's a little pocket in
there where I can easily stick those and
once that's back in my bag I'm good to
go so I hope this gives you some ideas
for traveling around the holidays I know
I really breeze through this but my
concept was how can I pack lightly but
also give me the tools I need to
a holiday look which I tend to like to
be a little more festive so thanks again
for watching have a wonderful day and
Happy Holidays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
