this video I thought I would lump
together three kind of similar products
that you might be running across are all
fairly recent releases and they all
pertain to the skin containing different
highlight and blush type shades from the
ball we're going to be talking about the
manizer sisters you got mary lou manizer
cindy lou manizer and betty loumanizer
in this one becca has the afterglow
palette out which contains three of
their shimmering skin perfectors and
also a couple of blushes from
bareMinerals there's the royal court
palette and this has kind of your
standard bronzer blush highlight type
trio the least expensive would be this
one from the balm that's $28 bare
minerals one is 29 and this becca one is
like thirty nine thirty nine fifty to be
exact on ulties website and I'm going to
start here this is the one that I was
really most intrigued by and I had the
most experience with the shades in the
one from the balm I already had all
three of those so the one from
bareMinerals I thought you know it looks
nice I'm not sure if it's going to WoW
me but this one from Becca I was very
excited about because I only had
experience with one element of this
palette and that is the shimmering skin
Perfector in rose gold so you've got the
shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
rose gold and topaz and then these two
are the mineral blushes in wild honey
and a flower child over here is the pink
one size wise this is set up just the
same size as like their ombre Rouge
palette let's say for eyeshadow so these
shades are fairly small however and I
don't seem to have a problem getting
into it with my brushes usually it's
going to be a blush brush or smaller
that I'm going to be dipping into these
with and it seems to work out just fine
for me the claim to fame of Becca's
whole line seems to be glowing skin and
I personally still say that the
shimmering skin perfecter liquid I think
looks even more natural on the skin it
gives your skin this kind of like I
don't know x-factor type look where
you've got the glow it doesn't look like
makeup and I have always thought that
the powdery ones
look a little more like product on the
skin when I missed my finished look with
some setting spray that's one method
that I think helps sort of correct that
look but that's just I don't know my two
cents on that but one thing that across
the board I've noticed with this palette
everything in here is soft pigmented I
like that the blushes aren't nearly as
shimmery as the skin perfectors over
here the blushes seem to have like a
satin finish and I adore wild honey
that's one of those like subtle blushes
that you can't really predict how that's
going to come off on the skin but like
I'm wearing it today and I think it's a
perfect like neutral blush blush without
looking too blushy if you know what I
mean and if I'm really feeling like
using this palette and just go into town
with it using it to its fullest extent I
find that I will use the shimmering skin
perfectors that have a little more color
to them so the rose gold and the topaz I
will kind of pair those with these
blushes in other words I'll apply one
you know maybe underneath and then put a
blush on top and I find any pairing
looks good and gives a little different
twist to it and then I kind of reserved
moonstone which is so bright I love that
so much I couldn't believe I hadn't
tried moonstone until now but that gives
just a nice little pop of radiance two
key areas on top and another way you can
use this which i think is gorgeous as
well apply a little wash of moonstone
first like underwear you would use your
blush and then put one of these blushes
on top it kind of disguises the level of
Sheen that moonstone has it's just a
beautiful effect and I think as you play
with this you'll realize like different
combos you like maybe you just like to
take one of these shimmering skin
perfectors like rose gold and just use
it alone I just really like it and I
will show you the way I used it today I
actually used a little rose gold on the
cheeks first just lightly with my blush
brush and then I put wild honey over top
and I used it like a little bit lower
and it's just such a gorgeous
like not too obvious but still really
radiant looking blush I love that and
then just targeted moonstone right on
the tops of the cheekbones down the nose
Cupid's bow area so my curiosity
for this palette was highest I think and
I was really really excited to get this
and just try the different shades and
I'm very very happy with it if you're
not someone who's into shimmery
highlights this may not be worthwhile
for you but if you're like me and you've
only tried like one or maybe you haven't
tried any of the shades that are in here
it's really a nice sampling now let's
talk about the bombs
the Luminizer or the manizer i think is
what it's actually build the manizer
sisters mary lou manizer cindy lou
manizer and betty loumanizer so this is
going to be your classic kind of
champagne type super glowy really
catches the light kind of highlight very
very popular highlight there cindy lou
manizer is a little more peachy it is
the kind of thing that light to medium
light fair skin tones could maybe even
wear as a blush and then betty
loumanizer i won't call it a straight-up
bronzer but it's kind of like just a
bronzy glow that you could apply just
all over the skin now the ball markets
all of these not only as highlights but
also eye shadows and I've done quick you
know shadow looks with this and it works
really nicely that way too these are all
very soft and the textures of these
powders it's like you only need a little
bit when you tap into it a similar
texture to the shimmering skin
perfectors from becca but i don't know
about you guys but i find these to be
just a bit softer what is so interesting
though is the similarity between the
three shimmering skin perfectors that
are in here and the three shades that
are in the palette from the balm i mean
could they look any closer and they
really look quite similar in the
swatches as well so it's kind of crazy
what's going on here and it's the kind
of thing where you got to look at it and
say you know am i just an avid collector
of products from the balm like i kind of
am because i already have these you know
individually but I was excited enough
about this and I wanted to tell you guys
about it too so I went ahead and got the
trio but here you're getting those very
same kinds of shades plus a couple of
blushes albeit everything in here is a
little smaller size and one note about
this palette from the balm well I think
it's great quality and these are really
fun shades to play with I have already
reviewed the in the ball
of your hand palette and this I would
say is even more the must-have compared
to this one I mean they're both great
but you do get a mini mary-lou manizer
in this palette plus how many other
blush products 1 2 3 4 5 other cheek
type things plus the eye shadows plus a
lipstick
there's the mary lou manizer right down
here so if I was going to put my money
into one or the other I would go with
the in the ball of your hand Greatest
Hits palette but just wanted to mention
that this one from bareMinerals this is
the royal court and you're getting clear
radiance GoldenGate
that's your blush and then warmth so the
pressed version of warmth I always
remember warmth as being like one of
those products you would get if you
ordered the whole bare minerals kit and
you get that loose warmth powder but it
says introducing our best selling face
colors in bare minerals ready format and
it is a nice little palette and as far
as the glow factor you know the thing
from the balm and the one from Becca
those are highly highly glowy this one
is definitely stepped back a notch so if
you are looking for a little you know
trio of products that's not going to be
too shiny on the cheeks you might
consider this because like GoldenGate
the blush I'd call that like a satin
finish just got the slightest bit of a
rosy almost a bit of like a berry glow
to it I think it's very pretty and clear
radiance is an interesting product as
well because it's got some brightness to
it
I sense a little bit of like a pinky
tone in this product but it's very muted
it's not going to be one of those
hardcore like strobe highlighted looks
and then warmth I think one of the
criticisms of this product you know at
least in the loose format is that maybe
it's a little too warm on some people
they feel like it looks a little too
muddy
you know warmth is in the name so I
guess you've kind of been warned but um
just think of it more as something that
really is going to kind of amp up the
skin tone not necessarily be something
everybody enjoys contouring with after
using this you know I like it it gives
me a pretty look on my skin but I'm just
kind of okay with it it didn't Wow me
it's not like it gave me the
kind of look that I couldn't get
anywhere else with any other blushes or
bronzers or highlights in my collection
the highlights from Becca and the bomb I
really think are some of the top
highlights on the market and I really
enjoy the fact that they took things
that are part of their regular line you
know not just a bunch of random kind of
anonymous limited-edition things they
took products that are really popular
and really have a following and stuck
them into you know a palette lets you
sample and kind of get a better value
out of it to me personally for just
talking face products I think this one
from Becca really gives you like the
widest range because you get the couple
blushes you get these really fun glowy
highlights each one looks totally
different from the next you know you're
not even getting a close effect from one
to the next paired with the blushes are
used alone they each have I think their
own distinct effect so just wanted to
get some info out there on a few little
palettes you know they're not your
standard like a gigantic holiday
eyeshadow palettes that you know I'll be
talking about as well but something you
might be curious about nonetheless so
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
