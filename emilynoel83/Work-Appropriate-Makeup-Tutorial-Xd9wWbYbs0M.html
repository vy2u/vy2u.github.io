in for this video I get a lot of
questions about makeup that is
appropriate for the workplace I know if
you're watching YouTube a lot you see
tons of tutorials and a lot of them are
you know really bright or dramatic looks
you know something that would be great
for a night out but what does that look
that's really good for every day that
you can accomplish very quickly and just
get out the door and manage to look
polished and I feel like I have a look
that I can share with you today that is
gonna accomplish just that for you not
everyone goes to the workplace you may
be a stay-at-home mom and you just want
something a look that you can put
together really quickly you know so you
kind of look you know put together if
someone comes through the door or if
you've got to run out and do some
errands this is just a good everyday
look so if you're a student this is
another thing to think about that might
be a really easy look for you to pull
off and I'm going to be using some
products from this kit from Lola it's
really cute it comes with a little
lipgloss keychain here but it also comes
with one two three four five products on
the inside and I'm going to be using all
of those in my look I've got a shadow
kind of a neutral eyeshadow trio here
I've also got an eyeliner and a mascara
and a lipstick and a lip liner so
throughout the course of this tutorial
I'll show you how to use all of those
products to get a really wearable really
work appropriate after applying a primer
to my eye I'm gonna take my Lola eye
trio here in suede you can see true the
shades are kind of matte one has just a
little bit of sparkle in it but it's
really on it I find it doesn't really
show up much but I'm going to take the
lightest shade here with my ELF eye
shadow brush just pick up some of that
color and put it on like the inner half
of my lid just kind of Pat that on
you'll notice it just kind of
neutralizes the shade of your lid it's
not going to you know be it a real
intense color although it is pigmented
for what it needs to do so put that down
there and then I'm just gonna flip my
brush over and go to this shade it's
kind of a you know a beige with a little
hint of
charcoal and I'm going to Pat that on
the outer half of my lid you can see
that gives off a little more color it's
just kind of a warm light brown and then
I'm going to also take that shade and
kind of blend it up into the crease as
you can see I've sort of flipped my
brush over and I'm kind of wedging it
there in my crease and that way we're
kind of applying a little base here for
the darkest shade so it will blend even
easy go over all of that with a blending
brush this one that I have is just from
Revlon it's a contour shadow brush and
just buff right over the edge it's not
gonna be hard this is a really blendable
shade and it's not very dark to begin
with but go back to the lightest shade
and that is what we're gonna use is our
highlight so pick up some of that on
your brush and just kind of go right
under your eyebrow with that creamy
shade and this has no shimmer to it so
you're gonna put it on there and it's
just gonna you know lighten up the area
without being too harsh and I'm gonna
take my fine crease brush so any small
this is from essence of Beauty available
at CVS but any small brush you can use
that you feel like you have quite a bit
of control with take that into this
deepest Brown which really I mean I
can't quite call it a dark brown I call
it a dark to medium brown maybe on this
shades and it's matte so just get a
little bit of that on your brush and
just kind of look down into your mirror
and take that right into your crease get
a little natural you know depth going on
there take it you know follow just your
net where your natural crease is here so
I'm going in a little bit and then you
know if you want to just kind of pull it
out a little bit in the outer corner
just a little more you can see where
we've got just a a hint more darkness
there you can do that just pick up a
little more shadow and kind of work out
from the outer edge of your eye
it's nice and mad it's not going to if
you had sort of some fine lines or you
know some wrinkles in the outer corner
of your eye shades like this that are
matte are not going to you know really
spotlight those areas so that's always
nice and I'm using a little fluffier
brush here it's again that Revlon one
that I was using before and just going
over the borders of that color these are
extremely easy to blend out the you know
outer edges of your shadows so there we
go that's the shadow look a really
simple and easy next we're gonna go to
the liner that's provided in this kit
and it's called the fine line eye pencil
it's very very skinny as you can see and
it's I mean it's they're super skinny in
terms of the little part of the
applicator where the liner actually
comes out of you know how sometimes you
get a liner from the store and it's kind
of been sort of filed down to a little
bit of a tip at the end and you're
thinking okay this is nice it's nice and
defined but eventually that wears down
and you're just kind of left with that
rounded tip this will only get so wide
you know it remains very fine because
that's the very fine tip that it's
coming out of so what we're going to do
is sort of a technique I like to call
undetectable eyeliner we're able to keep
this very very close to our lash line
we're just gonna kind of darken up the
lash line without drawing it out any
further or making it real thick so this
is a really really easy thing to do with
this kind of liner so get right I
started kind of in the middle and
staying really close to my lash line I
just kind of draw that out just a little
bit you can see as I look up you know
it's just kind of deepened it up but
it's not too much and this is a black
liner as well so staying really close in
you know just kind of now start to work
your way a little closer you can use
short strokes kind of like I'm doing to
really ensure that you are staying as
close to the lash line as possible and
just kind of slowly work your way into
the inner corner next we're going to
just do a little
we're not going to Ram our eyes entirely
in this shade but you can see I'm just
putting a little bit of that right here
like I'd say the outer yeah if you split
that up into thirds maybe it's the outer
third of your lower lashline and then
I'm kind of just going over that with my
finger a little bit blending that out
okay so they're just that's really just
gonna help to make your eyes look wider
when you've got that kind of going out
here and then a little bit here you're
giving a nice framework to your eyes so
you can put the liner away now and find
a liner brush and we're gonna go to the
darkest shade here this Brown the matte
Brown that we were using our crease and
we're just gonna top that off here and
just go ahead and carry whatever's left
right in under your eye it's not going
to be defined it's not going to be very
dark but it's going to be polished and
it's really going to finish your look if
you have a smudge brush that you like to
use you can totally take that like any
kind of pencil brush you can kind of
take that under at this point and make
that even more diffused the one I'm
using is from bourgeois Paris it's just
this pencil type brush and just smudge
it out you know doesn't have to be that
precise I'm going to curl my lashes and
I'm gonna apply the Lola eyes ultimate
mascara in black the tube looks like
this pretty red tube and this is what
the brush looks like kind of a large
brush but I find it really defines and
kind of separates the lashes so I'm
going to put that on and I'll also tell
you what's on my lips right after this
okay guys here is my finished look just
a really polished natural look using
some neutral shades I've got my mascara
on there curled my lashes of course and
on my lips there are two products that
come in this kit for lips and it's a lip
pencil in foxy and this short sort of
reminds me of Rimmel exaggerate only
it's not quite so red it borders on more
of a berry red meaning it has a slight
bit more of a pinkish tone to it and
then this really really awesome lipstick
which is great thing to be able to toss
in your purse because it has actually a
built-in mirror here's a look at the
packaging so cute and this shade is
called Vijay it's a lip sheer it says
and when you open it up that opens there
and it says there's a little Lola in
every woman and it has a little mirror
there so you really can't I mean it's
big enough to where you can just like
check your lipstick as you put it on and
the shade that I have on is kind of a
creamy umm it's like a creamy rose it's
it's got a lot of red to it but it's not
like a pure cherry red it's not super
bright I think it's really wearable and
I think using a shade reddish shades
like that on your lips give you that
really polished look makes your teeth
look whiter just kind of pulls
everything together and looks nice with
the natural eyes so yeah that's the lip
color I have on there with that and to
put it back together you just kind of
push that in and then there's a little
this little jeweled part here holds the
mirror back in as is so all that comes
in this little kit there's also a mini
lip gloss which I just kind of dotted on
the center of my lower lip there it's in
enchantress it comes on a keyring so you
could put this on your keys as well and
everything else can go in that little
bag toss it in your purse as you go to
work and it's a really easy look and
that's kind of why I sort of identified
with this as a workplace tutorial
because I feel like it didn't take very
long to do and a lot of times when we're
getting ready for work we don't have a
ton of time in the
morning so hopefully this helped you I
give you sent a little bit of an idea of
what might be appropriate as you go to
work and have a great day and thanks so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
