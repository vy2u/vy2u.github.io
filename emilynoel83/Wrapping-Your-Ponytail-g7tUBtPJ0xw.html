hair tutorial for you this one is going
to kind of go off of one that I did
before I did the hair tutorial on the
half-up kind of poufy style um if you
look I didn't do it too long ago so if
you find that keep in mind that you can
play off of that style where it was kind
of poufy and use the bobby pins and the
hair was kind of like poofed up in the
back you can do that with this but I
didn't happen to have my hair that way
today so I'm just going to show you
basically how to wrap your ponytail and
create basically it looks like your own
hair is wrapped around ponytail so this
is something I think a lot of people do
and you may there may be a lot of
different strategies out there for doing
this but this is just the way I do it
and I thought you know it's fairly easy
for me so I'd go ahead and show you how
to so basically what you're going to do
is whether you had your hair and that
half up with the poof you can grab it
all or you can just do it you know more
natural ponytail like I have right now
with my hair not poufy and you can do
this right in the middle of the back of
your head or you can do it that side
ponytail and for just even showing you
i'm going to go ahead and do a side
ponytail today and i use these elastics
that are kind of like um not the thicker
one see if i have one my door here um
see like how thick this one is compared
to this one if it's thicker you're going
to keep in mind you to have more to like
cover up with your own hair so use I
would recommend using a rubber band or a
small elastic band like this that
doesn't have any of them it doesn't have
any metal on it or anything um that can
kind of catch your hair up on it so
basically I'm just going to pull it over
and I'm going to kind of pull it
basically behind my ear over on this
side and I'm going to go kind of low so
sort of like nape of your not only the
nape of your neck but it's kind of like
even with my jaw I'm just going to go
back and pull it back
they're so once again if you had your
hair in the half up style just pull it
all down here and it's you know no big
deal to do that so go ahead and get that
in ok so now you've got your little pony
tail here and you could stop here and
have a perfectly fine a pony tail up
another thing you could do here is also
twisted into a nice little bud I know
those are kind of trendy right now the
side buns but as for wrapping it i'm
going to scoot a little closer to the
camera here what i'm going to do is grab
a piece I've got all the hair in the
ponytail I'm going to grab a little
piece of hair on the bottom underside of
the ponytail so right here I'm going to
take about this much hair if you can see
you take about that much hair looks like
about maybe like half an inch worth and
then what I'm going to do is just wrap
it around the mud that elastic band it's
here ok I don't know if you can see this
but I'm wrapping around as many times as
it will go so that's what it looks like
so I'm in the shop here I don't know
hold on ok that's what it looks like so
basically you've gotten that hair now
pulled all the way around and you want
to secure it so I secure it with two
bobby pins I'm going to take one and I'm
going right underneath my ponytail and
putting one down there and now it is
secure and then I'm going to overlap it
with another just to make sure and this
is all happening just right underneath
the ponytail ok so the look that you've
got is just sort of its own it's all
nicely nice and clean it's all wrapped
up you don't have to worry about your
the ponytail holder not matching your
clothes or anything
that and a lot of people like it's
pretty dressy and I think for most
people they see it and think oh my gosh
you know it looks a lot harder than it
really is but following that I would go
ahead and take some hairspray just to
make sure that would secure spray this
bobby pins and spray the hair that's
wrapping around it and then like I said
you can go from here there's a lot of
different alternatives you could further
lap this into a fun you could you know
have your hair a little more poufy like
that but either way um it's a good
option for your ponytail don't forget
you can do plenty tell in the center you
could do a high ponytail you could do
two pigtails you know whatever you want
to do so hopefully you were able to see
what I'm telling trying to tell you
about in this video I do have a new
tripod that I'm testing out so that's
working well but it's still kind of hard
for me to see you know make sure i'm in
the shot when i turn around so please
let me know if you have any other
particular hairstyles you would like to
see demonstrated something that can be
done you know in a short amount of time
on a video like this so I would
appreciate it thank you so much for
