day I'm going to bring you a big ol haul
today I'm calling it XXL because it is
an extra extra large drugstore hauls the
results of quite a few different
shopping trips so I just wanted to round
up some of those products pass along
some little reviews on the things that I
have tried which is most of them and in
case you guys were wondering yes I still
love makeup wear my favorite shirt today
I just had a real fun past few days by
the way I got to go out to Westchester
Pennsylvania
this past Friday did some video projects
with QVC they're doing a big fall beauty
event on their website I believe it's
this Friday and they had like some
different fall trends that they wanted
to demonstrate in videos and talk about
tips and tricks and whatnot and so I got
to go out and do those and it was just
an amazing amazing experience I had such
a blast I had such a blast getting to
actually see the studio's as well
so I talked about that a lot on beauty
broadcast live over on my vlog channel
so if you want some more deets on that
check it out also I was at the Rams
football game yelling my head off
yesterday they did beat the Arizona
Cardinals sorry Arizona fans but it was
an awesome game and I was just yelling
like a maniac the whole time so yeah so
did you want to see a haul yeah that's
what you came here for so um let's get
started and talk about lip product you
guys know I love lip products but I've
seriously been rotating the same three
products lately because I love them so
much like the one I talked about in my
favorites video is the Sonia Kashuk and
this is the shine luxe sheer lip color
and this is the sheer pink lust shade
this is the first one I got I loved it
it was a favorite in August and I've
just been wearing that a whole lot so of
course I had to go to the store and
check out the other shades so a couple
of the other colors I got were the sheer
fuchsia and the sheer plum and these are
really cool because if you are browsing
the store they have these colors on the
caps and they are extremely accurate to
what the shade is on the inside and
they're all sealed up so this way you
know you're able to tell what you're
getting so I love the fuchsia shade
wearing that today it does have a little
Sheerness to it but you know it's very
shiny it's a total hybrid of lipstick
and lip gloss for me I love the amount
of shine these halves so sheer fuchsia
is great in my fails video I was wearing
the sheer plum oh love it love that for
fall this is on several other great
shades as well but these were the two I
felt the need to really jump on right
now so love those also new from Sonia
Kashuk new palette new eye on neutral
except this one is all shimmer it's
called eye on neutral shimmer and the
eye on neutral the first one is
completely matte so now she's done a
totally shimmery one these are not
glittery shadows because I know some of
her quads do have some really glittery
sparkly shades these are all more of a
pearly finish and so pretty
unbelievably velvety soft on these guys
like seriously as creamy as a powder
shadow can be you know this is it and as
a result they're so easily blended on
the eyes today I am wearing a few of
these shades I used this champagne color
this taupe and a little bit of the brown
just for an ultra quick look but I can't
wait to experiment with this some more
maybe do some looks combining this and
the matte palette but this is really
nice if you want to try some super
high-quality shadows this palette I
think is totally worth it also at Target
Kristin game was telling me how much she
loves the elf baked shadows I do have
several of those and they're really nice
you know they work nice dry or wet some
pretty neutrals and one of them she
mentioned she had but I didn't have is
in the shade called toasted and
immediately when I got this home its
watched it I thought that is the perfect
rose gold if you're addicted to all
things rose gold get this one and toast
it it's a gorgeous sheen on the lid
thanks Kristin for reminding me how good
these are I'm glad I picked that up a
couple of new covergirl outlast nail
polishes this shade is called lavender
get it
I was wearing this one recently really
pretty creamy light lilac shade these
seem to build up to the color I want in
about to code there's nice and shiny I
don't feel like they're chipping on me
super quickly so that's great and then
the one that I've yet to try but I think
it's gonna be great for fall is called
smokey taupe and that's this color so
just a nice neutral I think it would
work with a lot of things there are some
new Maybelline eye studio quads out now
for fall many of you had tweeted me your
pictures of what you'd found in your
drugstores so I finally found a couple -
I found these at Walgreens and one of
the quads is called Violent Femmes and
this I don't know this shades looking a
little purple in my camera in person and
on the eyes it comes off very burgundy
this shade you know a deep plum this
just looks dark on my eyes I don't see a
lot of purple coming out in that and
then you've got a taupe and a cream
color so I guess the point I'm trying to
make here is that don't get this if
you're thinking oh I want a real purpley
look on my eyes because I feel like it's
mostly color wise the burgundy pops more
I think it's beautiful I really like it
I think it's great for fun but it's not
so much violet as the name implies so I
just want to let you know about that by
the way all shimmery shades and that's
pretty much the case with all these eye
studio quads another one I got which I'm
so pumped to use in a video it's called
autumn dream check it out these just
look like some gorgeous jewel tones
you've got champagne kind of golden
champagne color a purple which really
does come off purple jade green and a
navy so how much fun is that gonna be I
haven't used it yet on my eyes but i've
swatched them and was very impressed I
also got a nice to do quad that's from
the regular line that I couldn't believe
I hadn't already tried I was wearing
this in a recent video this is taupe
temptress very very pretty they seem to
always give you that shimmery pearly
champagne color you've got kind of a
rose gold a taupe and a burgundy super
wearable love the way all those shades
work in harmony with one another again
just part of the regular line so you can
find that any
of eyeliners I picked up the Rimmel
scandaleyes I got taupe and deep blue I
have used and talked about the one in
nude quite a bit because I like to use
that in my inner rim my waterline there
to brighten it up as much as I like that
I was so surprised I hadn't ventured out
and tried some of the other liners so
taupe seemed very interesting to me
because a lot of mid-tone liners that I
have like this are shimmery this one is
pretty much matte you know just a creamy
matte color I've used this on like my
lower lash line when I'm doing a smoky
look maybe I've got like black on the
inner rim and then fade out a bit with
this color it's very pretty used in that
way and then the Navy shade or it's
called deep blue and some navies really
do border on black this one you really
can see some of the blue coming out and
that these go on super creamy they're
not only great for the waterline but
also just you know across your natural
lash line I feel like they glide on very
smooth so thumbs up for the Rimmel
scandaleyes dollar-store alert my local
Dollar Tree is carrying the elf matte
lip colors so I think they had some
other studio products there too but I
can't remember what they were but
normally these would sell on the elf
website for $3 or $3 at Target but at
the dollar store at the Dollar Tree they
were only a buck and I got natural which
is a gorgeous nude I've worn this
several times as a great base to a nude
lip and it really does just neutralize
the lips it's got a little bit of maybe
a pink undertone in there so I love that
and these are totally matte also if you
don't choose to top them off with
anything they will be a true matte lip
and the other one I got was rich red so
a nice stick product there these twists
of so on the end is a sharpener so you
can make sure you keep that like pointed
tip on the end if you want to my fellow
lip balm junkies are you with me right
now
I've got a couple updates for you this
yes
Walgreens is making their own version of
like an EOS lip balm exact same shape
and size on the
it says well at Walgreens and this is
watermelon this is the only one I've
seen so far and I really think it's cute
that it's green on the outside and pink
on the inside
delicious watermelon scent goes on very
smooth you know there's something a
little different about the EOS lip balms
like different ingredients then your
typical like stick lip balms they maybe
don't glide on with quite that semi
greasy shine that's why I love using
those as like a lip primer cuz stuff
clings to this however does give your
lips that little bit of shine like you
know a lip smacker might let's say so
more like a traditional lip balm but
they put it in this form as you can see
it's not totally domed it comes with a
flat top watermelon has got to be one of
my all-time favorite like fruity scents
so I had to try this and I really liked
it so I was watching a fresh tubes
videos and she was talking about some
new stuff and mentioned this chapstick
double-ended green apple caramel who
loves those green apple caramel suckers
those are so good and she was talking
about this I'm like that's like the
caramel apple sucker in a stick the
green apple scent could not be more
dead-on like green apple candy in the
caramel side is pretty darn accurate -
that reminds me of like the craft
caramels that are individually wrapped
in like the little squares yeah it
smells just like that so kind of cool
you could do like one side on one lip
one side on the other lip or just one at
a time but neat concept they had
different flavors of the topic of new
wet and wild stuff they've come out with
some new trios it's called the tough
girl collection they look like this some
of them and I have all of them I was
sent most of them from the company to
review and I have reviewed them and
swatched them all on beauty broadcast
Nets so go there for the lowdown on
those but as for things I was just
roaming around my store trying to find I
found these wet and wild Fergie
collection limited edition ones here
these are 5 pan palettes if you see me
review these kinds of palettes before
from the Fergie collection they're not
the exact same formula as
typical wet-and-wild color icon eight
pans or trios or anything like that
they're a little different when I very
first swatch this one which is called
bulletproof Glide I wasn't in love with
it but I thought it was gorgeous on the
eye for classic smokey love that they
threw in this khaki shade another high
point for these five pan palettes is
that they put in some matte so like
matte cream matte black got a shimmery
silver shimmery charcoal have a satin
finish on that khaki shade but really
turned out to make a nice look on my
eyes so I give that one a thumbs up the
one I haven't used yet is with these
purple and pinks
I'm attracted to anything with pink
eyeshadow it seems like I just gotta try
it
this one's called Rose Parade really
interesting shimmery it's like a lilac
with gold shimmer matte purple pink your
matte black and a lighter pink in there
so I'm excited to try that something
brand spankin new the color riche la Lac
it says shiny full coverage lip color
I got it in this red shade call laconic
and it's just kind of like the same
format as those elf sticks that I just
showed you so this is a pretty red I
have not yet tried this I'm sorry I
haven't tried it before doing this video
but you can bet there will probably be
like a blog post or some Instagram pics
or something with more details on that
or one of those situations where it's a
product I absolutely love the formula of
so I had to try another color the
Maybelline Color sensational gloss I got
it in glisten up pink and the almond
crush which was included in my makeup
starter kit is a gorgeous shade for
topping off on pretty much any lip look
and adding a little shine and I think it
looks especially gorgeous paired with a
nude lip so I got this because it was a
little more pink tone this formula is
really nice because it gives off good
color and it's not too thick and sticky
so love those it's not something from
NYX called the illuminator and the shade
is chaotic it says for face and body and
I was intrigued by this shade because
look how it almost seems like it could
be a blush but like a
really pillowy blush I would say it's
pink with golden shimmer just not
SuperDuper colorful to wear it alone on
my cheeks I just don't feel like it's
enough but it is pretty like what I've
done today is just layer it on top of
another blush that I have on so I like
it in that respect I don't see it as
like a total must-have thing but I do
think it's nice though is that the
amount of shimmer does not feel like too
much to me it doesn't seem completely
metallic it just seems kind of glowy and
nice so interesting product there and
last but not least I got a duo from
boots number 7 this is in the shade Oh
what is it
moonlight shadows and I've tried several
trios reviewed them on my blog really
liked them so this is like a matte taupe
and a sparkly black in there I thought I
could get a lot of use out of that so
thank you guys so much for watching this
hull I hope you enjoyed I hope you
having a great day and I will see you
again very soon in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
