this video this is going to be a you ask
segment I have this series going a while
back and I kind of want to revive it
again it's basically where I address a
question that comes directly from a
viewer usually I've already answered the
question to them specifically and then I
see if it's okay if I can feature their
question in this segment because usually
these are questions that are asked a lot
and I feel like by answering them in a
video I can reach a lot more people and
hopefully get you know your questions
answered as well so this questions from
Ali and I'll just read your briefly part
of her email she sent me and she said I
was wondering if you could help me with
something I'm 18 and in a few weeks I
begin my journey as a freshman in
college as an honor student yay good job
and I was wondering how one might keep
up a healthy skin care at / makeup
routine thankfully my genetics prove
that within a few years all my acne
problems will be gone I just had the
occasional unsightly blemishes most
girls do during these teen years I have
Irish porcelain combination skin and
wear everyday minerals if any of that
information helped I just want to fit
some pieces together and see what I can
do whether it be on the run looks or
something I can do when I have more time
in the morning or evening I'm curious to
know the routes you took when you were
in your college years so I think this is
a great question because I think a lot
of people are making that transition
from high school to college and it's
time to start thinking about you know
being on your own and getting in that
good skincare habit even though you
might be super busy maybe you've gotten
involved in a lot of activities that are
taking up a lot of your time or you know
it's just kind of it's it's a lifestyle
change colleges so these are some great
things to think about and i just thought
i would give you some skincare and
makeup sort of bullet points so you guys
can maybe have some things to think
about if you are just starting college
or you know really for anybody i think
this kind of applies across the board as
well so skin care um one of the big tips
I gave Ali was to wash your face every
morning and night no matter how tired
you are and this is an
other one of those tips that I think
everybody tends to give but it is truly
so important to wash your face at night
even if you are just super tired if you
can get a wipe and you know just get
that off real quick and get rid of all
all of the makeup that's been building
on your face all day and then in terms
of actually getting it off I really like
the Olay facials daily cleansing cloths
those are what I use every day to take
my makeup off and it gets rid of my eye
makeup too so one swipe you know across
my face and I've been able to take off
everything even like waterproof liners
usually waterproof mascaras it does
pretty well on those two they come in
like a combination oh um like oily two
combo skin or a dry to normal skin range
there so those are really great they're
awesome for travel so you don't mess
mess with wash cloths and stuff like
that and it's and I also really enjoyed
him in college for that purpose that was
when I started using them because I was
like you know I don't want to mess with
always having to wash wash clogs and
stuff like that I've got enough other
laundry and stuff like that to deal with
so i started using these and you know
you just use them dispose of them
they're easy to use in the shower or
wherever so yeah the daily facials
cleansing cloths are really good so in
the morning if I don't have makeup to
remove I'll use like a gentle cleanser
like Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson's purpose it's
like as gentle as water and it really
does like break up any oil or anything
like that so that's a very very mild
soap to use and it doesn't overdrive you
and other things for the occasional
blemish I really like the clean and
clear personnel I'll put that on if I
noticed something's coming on or even
you know you kind of feel it under your
skin and it's like hasn't totally
evolved into a blemish yet you're like
oh it's coming well I use that person
gel it really does a good job just
drying it up and usually it can take
care of it you know in a couple days and
i put it on at night before I go to bed
and just
a bit on the problem spots if you're
really around your nose you might want
to put a little more on there but yeah
that's another drugstore product you can
pick up and moose trizein is also really
important even if you do have oily skin
you still want to make sure you
moisturize you just need to make sure
you're using the right kind for people
who ask me you know say I have oily skin
but I don't know what moisturizer I
would use for that i really suggest a
product from Neutrogena called oil-free
moisture I think this has SPF in it
there's like a sensitive skin option
they used to sell this in a tented
version that was great too but that's
really really light and it's just good
because you still need to moisturize
bottom lines for all this you need to
remove your makeup you need to tend to
your blemishes if you have them you need
to moisturize your skin and with eye
creams I don't think college is too soon
to use an extra moisturizing hydrating
cream around your eye area one that I've
really liked is actually on beer oil
products com it's from be luscious and
it's the long tea and carrot oil eye
cream it smells delicious but it's just
a really great hydrating treatment for
the eyes for a more heavy duty like
firming cream I know there's one from
Mary Kay that works very well the
firming eye cream that I've actually
been using lately just to pad around
like this area you know and and sort of
right in here just trying to keep that
area very you know youthful moving on to
makeup just some quick of makeup tips if
you or if your s if your SPF if your
moisturizer does not have that SPF and
it makes sure that at least your
foundation does if you're using that if
you're running a kind of a light finish
consider maybe like a tinted moisturizer
to give you that light layer of moisture
and then because that can give you some
really light coverage but then topping
that off with like a mineral powder and
it's kind of like taking two light to
medium coverage products and using them
together to get sort of a natural
all yet somewhat flawless finish and so
that's just one way I mean for those
people I get a lot of questions like you
know I don't want the makeup look I
don't want it to appear that I've got
makeup on my face but I want that light
coverage liquid foundations like Rimmel
lasting finish and Revlon Colorstay are
probably my top two liquid foundations
because they provide a lot of coverage
and I mean they're just great for
everyday flawless look but you don't
always want that much and I understand
that so tinted moisturizers mineral
foundations sometimes used together can
be a good option there under eye
concealer yeah I use this a lot in
college and I found it very beneficial a
couple of my favorite drugstore
concealers are the knicks concealer in a
jar that's as close to the bobbi brown
stuff as i have found in Bobby Brown is
like ultimate favorite and kat von d
tattoo concealer those are like way up
here and then just underneath is the NYX
concealer in a jar and maybelline
mineral power I like using that because
you can use it on any blemishes and it
doesn't I don't feel if you like it's so
gentle it doesn't irritate those problem
areas even more don't forget about blush
and bronzer it can make a huge
difference enlivening up your face you
know bronzer to lightly contour i love
the Milani ones the sunset duo's are a
nice two in one product because you've
got the bronzer that's it usually a nice
matte tone that you get with that and
then a little bit of blush is in the
same compact those are awesome covergirl
blushes I always enjoy and it's very
quick to do you know you can get a big
fluffy kabuki brush swirl it all over
your face it does not need to be precise
but just getting that layer of color on
your face is really good in terms of eye
makeup um I you know I was telling Ali
that you don't need to get too fancy
during the day for your everyday look
especially if you don't have a lot of
time but I have a lot of videos labeled
teen tutorials or everyday eyes that I
think are very very everyday appropriate
for anyone whether you're a college
student or not
I think those are very appropriate
everyday looks that is a real question I
get asked all the time and if I could
just shout it from the rooftops look for
my teen tutorials my everyday eyes video
any video that says natural or whatever
if you're ever looking for any kind of
you know video that I've done I've done
more than 250 videos now so there's a
lot to look through and I get that you
know not everybody's seen everything but
if there's a key thing you're looking
for if you go to my channel page and
then scroll down to where it's got like
about nine videos listed on the front
page there's a little search box in
there and if you type like everyday eyes
or teen tutorials it'll pull up every
video I've done like that or if you want
to see the celebrity looks under the 100
most beautiful series you know just type
that in there it'll pull them all up for
you and you'll see what I have if you're
looking for you know purple I mean a you
type in purple and you'll probably get a
few there too so um but yeah those sorts
of tutorials I've made very just
beginner friendly but also easy natural
polished and a look that lots of people
are looking for for an everyday basis
plenty of tutorials for nighttime looks
as well so that's kind of what I have to
say about eyes there you know there's a
big range so just kind of look through
some of those tutorials and for lips I
would say and there's tons of ways you
can go with lips we different people
prefer different things some people are
lip balm girls or lipstick girls or lip
gloss you know you've got all all these
different options what I would say is
just get a look get a formula you like
and get a few different shades and it
gets something that's like a red or
berry toned lipstick or lip gloss or
whatever get something that's nude that
means like it could be it doesn't have
to be like complete your brace your lips
nude I'm not as huge a fan of that as i
am those with golden or peachy tones and
get like a light to medium pink shade if
you're just starting out getting kind of
those three things going on is going to
give you some nice options to experiment
with that is basically my answer to her
question my very
long answer to just what are some tips
you going off to college to get that
develop that makeup routine that you can
it's definitely like a go to look for
every day and also taking care of your
skin so i hope this cleared some things
up for others as well i really hope this
was useful um there's obviously even
more details I could have included but
these are just the basic bullet points
that I wanted to get across to you all
and thank you so much for watching and
have a great day in a great school year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
