for this video I'm really excited this
is a question for my you ask segment so
that is kind of a new thing I've been
doing we're actually I've just done one
video that way so far but I have been
compiling some good questions just
haven't gotten around to actually
shooting the video on it but that's
where you know if I get a really really
great question from a viewer I'm going
to share that question with you and then
go through some possible solutions or
answers or give me whatever but I also
wanted to let you know that i did this
style today this kind of side pulled
around ponytail with the height here
with the bump it i have a bump it in
there today so really liking this look
and i didn't have the time when i did
this to actually shoot a tutorial on
this look today but i will be doing this
in a future tutorial as well as half up
half down and you name it a number of
other styles have been experimenting
with so it's just a matter of time on
that but i'm going to go ahead and get
my laptop over here and actually read
you this question um this you were asked
she said I know you have many different
types of foundations and I was wondering
when you use each of the different I was
wondering when you use each of the
different types like when do you choose
mineral makeup rather than liquid
foundation or when do you use liquid
other than powder foundation is it
because some days you want more coverage
because of blemishes some days are more
oily or more dry which ones do you use
for which occasions doing a video
explaining wish foundation you use on
which days and why would be really
helpful thanks so thank you to a wife
and mommy 83 she messaged me that great
question and how many times have you
wondered that I wondered that myself
even like okay why am i choosing to do
my makeup on this way on this day but I
kind of sorted it out here in my mind
and kind of thought about this I've been
thinking about this for some time and so
I thought I would share with you what
some of those
occasions are that you might wear liquid
or wear powder and you might come after
watching this video you might come away
with some ideas on what sort of
foundation you want to have more of in
your collection or you know what kind of
foundation you want to go out and get so
first let's go through liquid what are
some occasions when you want to wear
liquid from what I found when I want
more coverage I'm going to wear liquid
foundation so on those days like for
example when I'm going into work and I
know I'm going to be on TV doing the
news that day I want good coverage on
that day you know I want to not worry
about anything showing through for
example I have on my little lasting
finish foundation today it's long
wearing that can also be uh huh i'm
going to add that onion coverage / long
wearing I find that my liquids generally
speaking last they last longer than
powders or minerals so i splinted seven
in two categories liquids and powder and
narrow so if you want coverage if you
want long wearing if you want a dewy
look now I do not want really a dewy
look with my foundation it's totally
optional but it is something that you
can't achieve more effectively with a
liquid foundation than with powder
foundations you know you can take that
foundation and maybe blend in some sort
of like shimmer powder or a bronzer gel
or something like that sponge it on and
you've got a more luminous look that is
sometimes harder to achieve with powders
I realize in powders nowadays you know
there's lots of powders that you have
shimmers in them and different ways that
you can get that effect but generally
speaking that truly dewy glow um you
think of kind of getting in the
summertime you know like just a glow
that is coming from a real health of the
skin sort of look that dewy look
generally comes for the liquid
um if you have dry skin or patchy dry
spots then hey liquid might be for you
sometimes that's not like a chronic
problem but it's like with the weather
you may want you may have some dry areas
and you find that the powder foundations
or the minerals may just not really
agree with that or it may highlight it
in some way so just keep that in mind
that liquids can sometimes replenish a
little bit of moisture although you can
get them oil-free so they're not adding
you know bad things to your skin but it
can just the moisture itself can't help
you out there also may be if it's a
special occasion you can get some very
full coverage I'm sorry I'm like shaking
it or you hear if it's a special
occasion you may want a full coverage
there and you can get really
full-coverage out of certain foundations
like I would put under the liquid
category i would put stick foundation
under that category sticks screams you
know creams that may become a little
char or something like that those can be
very very full coverage and reason why i
call them liquid is because they're
definitely not powders so you know that
cream based product and you know if you
do you have that really important event
and you want that very very good
coverage that's where you might reach
for liquid now talking about the powder
and mineral makeups which there is a
difference I mean obviously mineral
makeup is enriched with or are supposed
to be I realize not all mineral makeups
are created equal but many mineral
makeups are known to be very good for
sensitive skin they contain natural
ingredients and that sort of thing but
one time a time when I reach for the
minerals is when I want to give my skin
a break like on the weekends for example
if I have been wearing a lot of liquid
foundation and it can sometimes feel a
little bit heavier on your skin I tried
to do a light a thin application
whenever I use liquid so I'm not like
feeling like I'm noticing makeup on my
skin a lot but if you do want to just
feel like you've got a lot more
lighter coverage on your face if you
want to give their skin that break I
will reach for a mineral foundation at
that point sometimes on the weekends and
that sort of thing if your skin is oily
if you're having an oily day or you know
you're going to be out sweating that may
be a powder foundation time that you say
okay I really don't want to add any more
liquid to my face I want this to be as
light as possible and maybe I'm just
having a great skin day or I just do not
feel like I need that much coverage and
then you're going to maybe reach for
that those powders and those minerals
because you don't want to add any more
moisture to your skin a matte finish
that's something you can definitely
achieve with a powder foundation you can
achieve that with many liquids these
days for example like the Rimmel stay
matte you can get a matte finish with
that but what is it powders and minerals
are sometimes known to give you that
more matte finish a powdery sort of
softer look soft focus look to your face
that can easily be achieved with some
powder foundations I've tried and less
time if you just have less time to do
your makeup I can very very quickly
throw on mineral makeup and it doesn't
take me much time at all if you look
through some of my applications that
I've done a mineral makeup I think I did
like a 10 minute makeup video what what
foundation did I reach for when i was
doing 10 minute makeup when I was on a
time constraint there I chose my
everyday minerals it's just a really
quick way to do your makeup you can
literally just swipe through your whole
face and get some decent coverage I mean
I'm not saying just by when I put
coverage under look what I'm not saying
the only way you get coverages with
liquid yes i know there's like some
really great coverage minerals out there
i'm just saying in general some general
rules to think of this these are some
things that maybe you should keep in
mind so i hope this answered some
questions i hope i didn't further
confuse anyone but I just really wanted
you to know I think that's a great
question you know
you wear this or that those are these
are from my personal experiences those
are some of the reasons why I'll pick
one foundation over the other but you
know we all have our own reasons so I
just keep that in mind and there's no
hard and fast right or wrong with this
it's just you know what works best for
you and your skin type skin type comes
into this a lot so thank you so much
guys for watching keep those great great
questions coming questions that I pick
for the US segment or ones that I feel
like maybe one person asks but everybody
may wonder about at some point in time
or another so thanks so much for
watching and have a wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
