this video this is going to be a new
series I know I'm all about doing series
with my videos but this one is going to
be called you ask and I get a lot of
really great questions in my message
inbox here of where you can send the
personal or private messages on here and
I get some of them and I read them and
answer them and think wow that's a
question that I think could help a lot
of people and it's not necessarily a
request for a particular tutorial or can
you review this or something like that
it's more of just a question about
makeup applying it doing something with
the makeup process and so I'm going to
kind of do this kind of like a little
classroom sort of exercise here I'm
going to share with you a one really the
first question that really inspired me
to kick this off I'm going to answer it
and sort of give you my answer in a way
that if you even wanted to take some
notes or just you know one sort of a
visual way to for me to express what I'm
saying I think you'll enjoy this so
let's go ahead and start this is a
question from Diane she says I was
wondering if maybe you can help me I
curl my lashes and they look more bent
than curled and when I apply mascara the
curl Falls and they go straight again
I've tried lash blast and it did not
work for me now I have define eyelash
and they still go straight so maybe you
can give any tips or recommendations on
products please Thank You Diane and I
just went as soon as I read this
question I thought what a universal
question I mean what a problem we've all
been there haven't we and this is my
little board here this is what she was
trying to tell me I think
this was the problem she was having the
eyelashes look like they have one
distinct bend in them rather than that
gentle curve that you see in the ads and
everything like that then I swooping
curve that you think you should have but
not ever
lash curler gives you that and not every
mascara lets you keep that so if this is
a combination problem we're dealing with
on the process of curling lashes and
also the mascara to maintain that curl
so this is basically a three-step
solution to this and so the first thing
that I told Diane was to think of it
think of your lashes as hair okay that
is step one number one on the bullet
point list think of it as hair your
eyelashes like let's pretend you are
going to do your hair and you're going
to use a curling iron on it what you
would want to do is lock in that curl
with some hairspray afterward well you
need to think of your eyelash curler
it's like your curling iron and the
mascara as the hairspray you what have a
good lash curler one that I really like
is this one from ELF it's got these nice
places so your fingers are nice and
secure and you want to do one eye at a
time with this concept so I would go in
and curl my eyelashes curl this eye and
then do my eye mascara
immediately after it's like there's the
curl and now you're setting it okay and
then I would do my other eye curl it and
then do mascara don't curl both and then
come back to it and do your mascara one
curl then mascara and and repeat on the
other eye that two-step procedure there
you will notice that the curl holds
better and you don't lose it especially
if you haven't eyelashes like mine that
really like to be straight down and just
naturally they like to be straight and
almost cover up part of my eye so I
don't I hate that so you really want to
do split up into two steps okay so the
second part is as you curl don't curl
all at once that's a really important
step there and it's something that a lot
of people overlook so we've got first
think of it as hair think of your curler
as the as the the curling iron
and the mascara is the hairspray that
locks it in and then don't curl all at
once in one spot I curl my lashes for
about 15 seconds total the best way to
do this I would say this is just my
personal strategy is to hold for 10
seconds as close to your lash line as
you can okay hold for 10 seconds there
pretend that was June 2nd and then you
want to work your way out a little bit
on the lashes and go for 5 you're going
to work on getting that nice curl okay
don't work your way out very far you
want to stay sort of close to where that
initial clampdown was and again this is
before you put mascara on and stay kind
of close because that's going to help
you get that curve okay this bin can
come also if you do your curl too far
out on the length of the lash you want
to keep it fairly close to next to your
lash line so it's like one pretty close
10 seconds that's your main Carolla and
one more just a little ways outward and
that is going to give you a little more
of that curved effect rather than that
single Bend okay and you're going to get
more bang for your buck so to speak
because you want the more of your the of
your lashes sticking up the more is
really visible on your feet you know on
the whole look of your face okay it's
when you curl only a little bit and
that's only a little bit turning up and
you don't really want that either
and um another thing I'm going to
address really quickly right here while
we're still talking about curling um
I've had some questions like can you
still cool after you have mascara on I
do
I know it's maybe not the best thing to
do I really it's not a lengthy curl and
I really don't try to clamp down too
hard but I do find that I can kind of
refresh my face without any more mascara
just by a quick literally something like
this and in their bag and you just have
to be careful not to tug on them
and not in pain you just have to use
some common sense and be careful you
know I think clamping down hard is going
to perhaps get some have some problems
between your mascara getting attached to
this and you don't want to pull on
anything but if you keep it light you
know you can get away with something
like that another old-school trick would
be to take a spoon and take the rounded
back of the spoon and press it up
against your eye on that that's like a
real like last resort trick some people
talk of but last question is your
remember Diane mentioned well I use
mascaras and then the curve goes
straight so the key there is look for
fast drying mascara and what's hard is
there's none the advertise themselves as
fast drying you know that's not a common
thing is I want to just show you what
I've been talking about here so you can
all stay on track with the bullet points
but a fast drying mascara think about
that I mean when you're putting a wet
thick mascara that is not want to dry
the more time it spins wet the more
chance it has to weigh down your
eyelashes so look for those that are you
know quicker drying and that's easy for
me to say because I've tried a lot so
you need to take I guess kind of take it
from someone who has tried a lot of
different mascaras there's been a lot of
trial and error to this I'm going to
give you three here they're all
drugstore covergirl fantastic lash it
comes in a red tube it's fast drying and
it does not wear your eyelashes down
Rimmel volume flash mousse I have that I
used to have that one but I ran out and
I actually had to pitch it a little bit
ago but Rimmel volume flash mousse
another lightweight one will definitely
continue to respond to your curl fast
drying and a third option that may be
slightly heavier than those two but it's
still fast drying and it will give you a
more dramatic look in my opinion is the
L'Oreal hip high intensity pigments
mascara all of those should be
your local drugstore so check those out
and you know try them for yourself
I know not everything works as well for
every person and sometimes after you've
had the mascara for a little while
now past the expiration not past the
general three months you're supposed to
have a mascara for but after you've had
given it a few uses sometimes the
formula gets just right sometimes as
soon as you get it it's a little slick I
don't know what to say but there but um
after you've used it a few times it gets
a little more air in the tube and it
gets a little bit drier and easier to
work with just a thought
I've had a lot of observations over time
but again lash curling 101 that was the
topic of this week's us question I hope
this was helpful to you I hope you guys
have liked kind of some visual ideas of
what can make your eyelashes curl well
and some product recommendations there
too so please keep in mind when you ask
questions you know I am listening and
I'll pause if at all possible I will
make a video of it so thanks a lot guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
