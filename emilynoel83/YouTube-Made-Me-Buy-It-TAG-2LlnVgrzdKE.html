this is a video I have been meaning to
do for a really long time and it's
basically all about the things that I
have been influenced to purchase by
various other youtubers and I know there
are more than the ones I'm gonna be
naming in fact there may has to be a
part two to this because just as I'm
sitting here like other things are
popping into my head but I mean you know
we all watch a lot of videos and even
though I'm on there you know telling you
guys about different products the same
is coming back at me not only from
people who make videos but also people
who randomly tweet me and say I think
you'd really like this product and then
I go and I try I think we're all really
influencing one another really so in
this video though it's all about other
YouTube people who I watch and the
things that they prompted me to buy and
as we go along I'll kind of tell you you
know if the stuff actually ended up
working for me or not but by the way go
cards go Cardinals boohoo yadi yadi you
know what I'm saying if you're a
Cardinals fan or a Cardinals opponent
maybe it just got really dark outside
it's raining really hard okay start off
with makeup by Tiffany D and I will link
by the way below to everybody I
mentioned in this video um but first
thing is this age rewind concealer you
know she talks about loving this a lot
thinks it's a really great concealer and
I've been really impressed by this as
well I've actually tried a couple of
them and I really enjoyed the concealer
but the packaging failed on me and it
like stopped twisting up and stuff so
that was really odd so I had to get
another one and so far so good on this
one but it is a really nice concealer
surprisingly good coverage and kind of
thin consistency so I really like that I
don't know if you can hear the rain
coming down but it's really coming down
also way way back in the day Tiffany D
was one of my first influences to buy
Coastal Scents yeah like early early on
like I've been making videos for a while
and I've been watching videos for an
even longer while and I remember her
talking about like the 88 warm
Hallet which I think this is still a do
I need to go to my safe spot it is
coming down okay I'm just gonna keep
going so keep me calm
I don't like crazy weather the 88 warm
palette though seriously great palette
full of neutrals not just your brown
neutrals but some even plum tones and
smoky tones so I really like that and I
remember tiffany do using that way back
when
so of course Sigma brushes Tiffany D was
one of the first people I remember using
Sigma brushes I'm holding up like you
know the synthetic brushes that I know a
lot of us love for our foundations but I
mean like the original kit like the
essential kit that was my first kind of
heads-up to Sigma makeup was through her
okay let's talk about Kristin game for a
moment shall we
Jesus influenced a lot of things that
I've bought one of the most recent is
something I'm loving right now I
actually it's the lorac unzipped palette
and when I met her in Minneapolis she
showed me this puppy and I said that
needs to be mine
great rosy topi bronze type colors just
gorgeous so I'm really happy with that
Kristin also did not steer me wrong
recommending the Sonia Kashuk eye on
neutral palette I know quite a few
people have probably talked about this
but it wasn't till after seeing her
video that I decided to pick it up and
I'm really liking it so many great
Basics in this palette oh that's a
target product also the Ben jebel brush
tree I actually am a subscriber of my
name's Susan sent me the original size
and I really enjoyed it and then I saw
Kristen talking about and I'll just
assemble it real quick here for you
I saw Kristen talking about the mini
sized one and then I decided I needed to
get myself one of those so I ordered
this i ordered it in pink and basically
the way this works is like when you're
washing your brushes and then you go to
dry them you poke them up through those
holes and they dry so all the moisture
is coming downward instead of seeping
back into the ferrule of the brush and
potentially loosening the
the whole sub rissoles blah blah blah I
do believe they drive faster this way
I'm convinced of that so love my little
brush brandt beauty blogger i love
watching her here on YouTube and she
prompted me to get the tarte emphasize
inner rim brightener and this is so
great retractable brightening pencil for
your inner rims finding this I've tried
the Rimmel scandaleyes in nude which is
pretty similar and cheaper but I still
do really like this also she prompted me
to get the lorac 3d liquid lustre these
are these fun little glittery drops and
it's a very very fine shimmer in these
but you can like dab them I like to dab
a little bit right on my hand and then
get some on my finger and like blot it
right on the center of my eye and it
gives such a pretty glow so thank you
for recommending that okay Julie g7 1:3
I've been watching her for so long and I
remember she raved and raved and
reviewed the almay one coat triple
effect mascara which is a great one by
the way if you especially if you like
really FRA formula mascaras but she
tipped me off to that and really the
whole world of Almain mascaras which
I've been very impressed with so thank
you Julie also um false eyelashes
I remember her using you know different
false eyelashes Ardell and whatnot in
her tutorials and thinking oh I want
that look and so she started that for me
that was huge and then just loose
eyeshadows in general like I mean I'm
going way way back you guys and I
remembered seeing her using like
pigments and stuff and that was before I
ever tried anything of that sort and I
saw her using you know fun bright colors
and loose pigments and I thought that's
something I want to try as well typed
out my ideas by the way so I don't
forget but yeah those are my main Julie
G inspirations candy Johnson um the idea
of doing makeup inspired by anything you
know like she did some great celebrity
looks and just kind of out there looks
but just the thought of putting together
a tutorial inspired by something else
like it seems like everybody's doing
that now but she was kind of the
original in my mind for that so matte
cream blush in Posie I think this was my
first
Mack purchase or was among the first
things I ever gotten this is a cream
blush in a beautiful color and I
remember her candy Johnson talking about
how beautiful this isn't it indeed is a
gorgeous cream blush you San Tropez
bronzing mousse which remains to be my
favorite self-tanner I remember her
talking about it candy even talked about
using it on her face and I do that too I
haven't been using it for a little while
here but it's a great sunless tanner and
probably the most quick drying of any
self tanners I've used and I use it with
the mitt I need to pop up a picture or
something because I forgot to bring it
in from my bathroom but I love that and
I remember candy using that a long time
ago gold girl Marni oh she's gotten me
into buying a lot of stuff and one of
the things made things the Real
Techniques expert face brush here's mine
freshly cleaned and this is a nice way
to apply your foundation I will
sometimes use this interchangeably with
like my Sigma f80 InStyle this actually
got me started buying a few other Real
Techniques brushes but I remember Marni
raving about this and saying how I think
she has like three back there exactly
look that is multiples on that so you
know it's got to be good if somebody's
buying backups of brushes also she
actually recently prompted me to
repurchase something that I had run out
of years ago and it's the Rimmel stay
matte pressed powder
she says this is her favorite like
mattifying type powder and it reminds me
a lot are you hearing that thunder out
there hmm it reminds me a lot of the
maybelline shine free which I like but
yeah that's what that looks like Scarah
it which is spelled funny like mascara
her name is Kara and I found her first
because of her blog and then her YouTube
channel but she prompted me to buy the
Stila in the light palette and she had a
really nice blog post explaining every
reason why she thought this was a great
palette and I agree this is really nice
I especially love this top row of
shadows I used those in my bridal look
at a really liked how it turned out um
now my personal Bridal look but a
YouTube tutorial recently and also the
L'Oreal voluminous smoldering eyeliner I
have gotten really into using this to
tightline like it right up in here
underneath kind of like the
upper inner rim area and it works really
well for that once it starts to dull
down I'm not sure if I'm gonna like it
as well like if it's gonna sharpen up to
this point the same way but she prompted
me to get that as little Maurice Evan I
love watching all of her videos she's
got a lot of great hair videos outfit
videos and she actually prompted me to
get that high-low leopard dress from
forever 21 I totally got this idea from
Lola Maurice Evans channel she did an
outfit of the day in this dress I
absolutely loved that dress
and so her outfit of the day caused me
to get it help me figure out what size
to get as well and so I got it and I
loved it so check her out she's also
just inspired me to try a lot of
different hair things she's got very
great instructional hair videos on here
missglamorazzi just recently ingrid was
talking about the caress pomegranate lip
butter I got this and loved it so
comfortable on the lips gets a pretty
reddish coral look to them like a very
natural door lips but rosier type look I
really like that Mel mphs I recently got
the boots number seven beautifully matte
foundation because of her rave review on
this and I really really like it
seriously amazing coverage I was so
impressed and kind of shocked by just
how much coverage this has and how it
looks matte but it doesn't look dry you
know it's an interesting thing so I
really like that foundation and she also
talked about this shadow quad from
L'Oreal called kappachu as a great all
matte basic quad and I gotta say I'm
like in the studio why are you youtubers
you know you stir be the right way with
this stuff but this has been really
really nice it's very velvety soft a
couple of the colors like there's not a
whole lot of difference between these
two mid-tone shades but they are great
for like blending out other colors so
I'm really liking hey see from Kats
makeup she got me into the Maybelline
sun-baked neutrals which I love love I
blogged about this is like a hidden gem
of the drugstore this is a great little
eight pan neutral palette kind of
reminds me of wet and wild comfort zone
only you do have
a really nice matte shade in here with
this taupey brown and just two greens
instead of four but this is a nice
little palette to try if you really like
those neutrals she also uses the
covergirl and Olay simply ageless
corrector and I think these are being
phased out because I got mine discounted
from Target but this is the yellow based
cream concealer that you can use to kind
of correct under-eye discoloration and I
don't know that for me it's working as
well as peach toned correctors it's
definitely brightening so I picked that
up because of her crystal makeup here on
YouTube I remember seeing her I think
one of the first videos I saw of her as
she was talking about a great Laurie
Grenier travel bag
kind of a tote bag that had a bunch of
other like travel bags inside and how
she loves to use that for on-the-go and
that actually prompted me to get two of
those for two of my sisters-in-law and
they loved them so I was really glad
about that but that idea all came from
Miss crystal and think about getting one
for myself also she talks about loving
the elf pink ice ice shadow as her
highlight and so I did end up getting
that you can get that from Target make
your own little palette out of it but
that is the pink ice shake very
pigmented and pretty also just various
like drugstore lip colors I feel like we
have very similar taste in lip products
so I've loved so many different
lipsticks I picked up because of Miss
crystal and various food brands as well
um because on her vlog Channel she will
do a really neat thing once a week
she'll do like a what's for dinner like
she's taking video each day of the week
of like what their meal was for dinner
every night and that's just inspired
different things on my shopping list
week to week so I really like that
makeup geek okay uh NYX makeup in
general where did I sit mine like you
need to see a visual aid here but makeup
geek I felt like was one of the first
people I heard talking about Nick's
stuff her and Julie G maybe a little bit
too from way back I remember a lot of
recommendations that I took from them
for NYX and also deep hottie makeup I
pretty much learned how to deep ha my
prod
according to makeup geeks D potting
tutorial and I think it was called how
did you pop Mac eyeshadows and I'll have
to link to that because that was super
helpful and I was able to deep hop
pretty much all of my Mac shadows with
no problems but not least the wonderful
encore talked about one of the first
people I was watching on YouTube he
prompted me to make my own brush cleaner
I used his recipe and I still have a
little bit left here in this spray
bottle so that made a great little like
spot cleaner for my brushes mac fix+
i remember him mentioning that and the
whole concept of what is a mixing medium
what do you use it for
he had very helpful just basic videos
about stuff like that and just brushes
in general how to use them what
different kinds are for I mean when I
was getting in on the ground floor of
learning about makeup
I remembered learning so much for me
that's really what it's all about you
know is that there's so many people
putting out information on YouTube we
can all be in this constant state of
learning something new because
everybody's bringing something different
to the table you know it doesn't really
matter how many subscribers someone has
like their information can be just as
valuable as someone who's been on here
for a long time I find I love learning
I'm grateful for so many great youtubers
out there and even more that I you know
didn't even think of in this video like
I said there may need to be a sequel but
I hope this was fun for you to watch and
maybe brought up some things you had
forgotten about that certain gurus on
here liked because I've been watching
people for a long time and some of these
ideas go way back so thanks for watching
guys if you want to do this video
consider yourself tagged and post a
video response and I'll talk to you
again next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
