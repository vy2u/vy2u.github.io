this product review because this is just
one of those products that I'm like oh
it's so good I can't wait to tell
everybody about it and this is called a
Z palette and I don't know if you've
heard of them before you probably have
but they are basically these pallets
that are magnetic and you can just
customize them to hold whatever you want
you could put your own blushes in here
your own eyeshadows powders bronzers
whatever you want to do and basically
it's a matter of taking them out of the
container they come in and putting them
in here and sometimes shadows will
magnetize on their own and then other
times you may need to add the magnet to
the back of them but whatever the case
may be you can take the shadows you own
and put them into a palette like this
and it's just great to be able to you
know not have a definite size you know
like okay this shadow is the size of a
quarter and it can only go into a
quarter size slot you know this gives
you just this open flat space with which
to add all of the eyeshadows or blushes
or makeup products you want
so I by the way I got this as a gift not
as a gift from the company but I get
from someone I met through doing my
makeup videos so thank you so much Lucci
for sending this to me and I blogged all
about it the day I got it and I've just
been so happy with it ever since as you
can see that what I have here is one of
the large palettes and there are
different sizes I think you get a can
get them in black pink zebra print like
this one or leopard print and this is
one of the large sizes I'm just going to
point out some of the things I like
about the palette and by the way if you
want to know more about the shadows I
happen to decide to put in here go to my
blog I will map that out for you if
you're curious about that but first off
the size is really nice what I have in
here are 1 2 3 4 4 6 7 8 9 I have 18
shadows in here and some are large and
some are small and I mean I could have
done rectangular you know whatever shape
they might be I could fit them in here
but this is nice because this not only
is it a magnet that's holding those
shadows in there but
top really snaps down here so you don't
have to worry I wake up k you don't have
to worry about this kind of coming open
because it's a really strong magnet
that's holding that there also another
thing I was thinking about when I saw
these on the website is is this plastic
piece that's on here
is that something that's going to be
like if pressure is applied to this is
that gonna smash my shadows because it's
not one of those flat hard tops I
thought but no this is very hard this
plastic piece here is not going to allow
anything to really damage your shadows
in any way that I can tell I mean I just
kind of threw this in my bag over the
weekend had all the shadows and more
that I would have wanted and I had no
issue with anything happening in my
shadows cupcake is checking it out as
well but it did come with this nice
little brochure and this kind of lets
you see what can be done you see the
products that are you know as they are
in the containers and then you can you
know sort of deep pop these things and
you can hey
hey cupcake yeah you just feel free to
look around over there now the way this
works with the products that are in here
this is magnetic and then like for my
hot pots they just snap right in here as
do these shades these larger ones which
are from Stila and that one's from
makeup forever you have to kind of
experiment with some of your others for
example NYX they don't have the magnet
in there so you may have to add a magnet
to the back and they also sell that
there but you can also get the magnet
strips that you can like cut up to fit
the size and just they are like an
adhesive sticker on the back here and
then that will allow them to stay in
your palette but you can pick those up
at like Hobby Lobby Walmart any kind of
craft store but anyway as you can see
here the way the magnets work if I want
to sit this shadow right here BAM it's
in and you know you can shift them
around a little bit or whatever but
basically they're going to stay put like
if you want to put a brush in there to
you know use one of these it's not going
to slide around on you
was something that really impressed me
as well it's like the magnet can hold it
and it can slide around but I can you
know use my brush on there and it is not
going to make the product ship think the
zebra print is so cute think about when
you're somewhere and you pull this out
and it's like oh my gosh what do you
have there love that it is this clear
plastic so I can see exactly what's in
here I am so going to get some more of
these v palettes for other things in my
collection I think it's going to
definitely cut down storage wise on all
the individual you know single shadows
that I've got sitting around I think
it's going to be a great way to collect
them in one place keep it organized and
you know I might go by color or finish
or whatever I've got like all these
ideas in my mind about how I want to
pull that off but I am so pumped thank
you again for this wonderful gift to my
friend Lucci and if you have any
questions about this you can visit ya
the websites right here on the back Z
palette comm and what a great gift for
someone to if you want to give the gift
of makeup this season but you don't know
exactly what kind of makeup to get I
mean a great way to help somebody
organize their collection would be one
of these so thanks again for tuning in
guys I will see you soon and have a
great day
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
