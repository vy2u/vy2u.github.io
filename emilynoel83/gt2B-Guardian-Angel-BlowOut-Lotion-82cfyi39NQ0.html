for part two of today's review a thon
I'm gonna be talking about a product
from got to be and it is called the
guardian angel and it's a 425 degree
heat protectant and gloss finish blowout
lotions so basically you can squirt this
on your hair before you blow-dry and
it's supposed to protect it keep it
shiny keep the healthy-looking and I've
got to say I really love this product
picked it up in the drugstore not too
long ago have been using it for about
two weeks now but any time before I blow
dry and I feel like my hair overall is
in better condition and I have long hair
too but it feels in in so much better
condition than when I before I was
really using something to protect my
hair against blow drying you know I
would typically spray something on my
hair before I curled it with the curling
iron and whatnot but you don't realize
you know the the blow-dryer is yeah it's
not like locked clinched onto your hair
but that's still providing you know
plenty of room for damage and you know
issues with your hair just getting
really dry and unruly and so I've been
using this before I blow dry here that
basically the different scenarios that
I've used it if my hair is really
basically wet and I still need to
blow-dry it kind of somewhat immediately
after I shower I'll spray this on it
doesn't take a lot like maybe three or
four sprays all over and then I'll
blow-dry it and I find that my hair just
feels so smooth and it's more manageable
really for me um as I said and style it
so that's great I have really really
fine hair I can tend to get a little bit
of a static issue sometimes when I blow
dry and so I really like this for sort
of helping keep everything under control
and just the smoothness that it had
afterwards and the softness was great so
I noticed that and then another time
I'll use it has been just when it's
somewhat damp sometimes I'll shower
before bed of course you guys know I
wake up really early and so I will
spritz a little bit of this on and just
kind of blow-dry my hair to a get any
remaining dampness out so when I do curl
it it can have the full effect and also
because I just like to smooth out
sometimes you sleep on your hair and it
just doesn't look quite as fresh and
smooth as when you would have just
blow-dried it so I'll spray a little bit
on it then and you know it's I feel like
I'm protecting it but I'm also keeping
it smooth and so I just feel like I this
is a great product to get it's not
expensive I think it's five dollars or
less at the drugstore but I've also used
this before I curl my hair and I cuz I
just thought you know I had this out on
my little bathroom countertop area and I
have typically like a Tresemme product
that I'll use before I curl but I tried
this before I curled and I thought hey
you know it's got just a similar effect
isn't it just because it says you know
blow out lotion it doesn't mean that's
all you can use it for it smells amazing
so I mean we've got to pay attention how
our hair smells as well as the rest of
us because our hair is we don't blow it
around and you want that to smell nice
as well so I noticed this has a really
fresh good scent to it and yeah we just
really recommend this if you blow dry
your hair a lot and if you're
blow-drying kind of carries into styling
and you want to use this before a
flatiron
or a curling iron I know there is a
separate Flatiron thing but I think this
is fine for blow-drying or other other
uses as well so again that's from got to
be it's the guardian angel gloss finish
blowout lotion I think it will really
help your hair probably last longer
without some split ends and some dryness
that you may have noticed before and
after using it for a few weeks I've
noticed a definite improvement in the
can
my hair so hope you guys liked this

still more videos to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
