with you for this video and if you want
to hear about one of my current favorite
products it's really the focus of this
whole video and it is the nude tude
palette from the balm cosmetics and you
know I've been kind of into all the
great nude eyeshadow palettes lately and
this is what this one looks like I just
fell in love with this when I got it
about a week ago I've been using it ever
since I traveled this past weekend this
was the only eyes shadow product I took
with me which is rare I normally take
way too much but I knew that this had
everything I wanted in it and to sum up
this palette how I feel about it I feel
like the quality of these shadows is
right up there at the same level as
Urban Decay but comparing this to like
the naked one in The Naked - I like the
configuration of Shadows I like the
colors they give you best in this
palette over though I love the amount of
light medium and dark shades you get
standoffish is a gorgeous kind of like
pinky peach shimmer sultry is like the
perfect matte Brown
I like the mid-tone shades selfish and
sophisticated I think those are very
wearable just throw those two together
for a day-to-day easy eye look and sexy
serious and sleek all really really rich
matte shades and with this look today
you're going to see how those matte
shades can function as a liner I'm not
bringing in any outside liners for this
look because these shades are so
saturated they can work really well as
your eyeliner stuff I primed my lid with
some Too Faced shadow insurance just Pat
that all over the space from your eyelid
up to your brow bone then I'm using a
great brush it's actually just the store
brand sold at Target and it's just
called a smudge brush but it's a great
smallish eyeshadow brush I just have
found so many functions for this but I'm
going to take the shade selfish which is
a pretty taupe color and just put that
down all over my eyelid
using that same brush I'm going to go
into silly which is a pretty kind of
sparkly deep plum it sort of reminds me
of one of my favorite Mac colors called
beauty marked and I'm going to Pat that
on the outer part of my eyelid and then
because I have so much control with that
little brush I'm just going to sort of
pull the color up a little bit into the
crease and just grab any fluffy crease
brush and just really go over the outer
edge of that color to blend it out and
smooth it out a little bit using that
same big brush I'm going to go into the
shade called sexy which is that pretty
matte plum color but I think is just so
beautiful and when you wear it kind of
sheer like this like you could
definitely pack it on with more
intensity but I'm just using it with
that big brush just going back and forth
throughout the crease and just it only
takes a teeny bit with all these shades
it only takes a literal highlight I'm
using pretty much my favorite light
shade in this palette which is
standoffish is a beautiful thing to put
on your area right under your eyebrows
so just take a fluffy brush you've
cleaned off and just sweep that under
the brow I'm also going to use that same
shade with a smaller brush to go right
around my tear duct area instead of
reaching for a separate eyeliner I
thought why not use these wonderful deep
dark matte colors as liners themselves
so I'm using one of the new Sigma
performance brushes this is the smudge
brush it's really small it's great for
getting a not too harsh but very defined
line around your eye so I am using
serious which is the matte black and I'm
going to take that on my lower lash line
and really get the most concentration of
color right on the outer part and then
just take whatever is left just continue
smudging smudging smudging toward the
inner corner and then it's going to be
the same kind of concept on the upper
lash line you're going to get the the
highest concentration of color where you
first put your brush so we want that on
the outer part and then keep smudging
inward till you kind of run out of
shadow and that's the look and then if
you want to you can sort of use that
brush to buff out the shade in the
corner and just make it a little bit
deeper than it also chose to line my
inner rim with a sort of off-white liner
I use the L'Oreal double extend eye
illuminator it's a double-ended thing
but I find myself using that lighter end
when I just want a little bit brightened
up I look and then I curled my lashes I
applied a couple of coats of the Sephora
atomic Volume Mascara which is kind of
like it seems to have this sort of comb
like brush that gives me a lot of nice
length so I enjoy that and then my
favorite standby for lower lashes is the
Maybelline lash discovery small brush
doesn't clump up doesn't smudge so I
really really that's my go-to for lower
lash mascara I hope you enjoyed this
look I just really wanted to kind of
give you my take on this palette and
demonstrate how some of my favorite
colors and it work there's not a bad
shade in the bunch there's not a dud in
here that I would point to and say well
they really kind of missed the boat on
that shade I really like them all and I
like how easy they are to use and to
blend they're nice soft pigmented colors
and I love that you're getting dark dark
shades some great medium colors and it's
just I love the way it's all been put
together is what else is on my face um I
used my Neutrogena Healthy Skin
Foundation and I used my Too Faced
chocolate Soleil bronzer just to warm
things up a bit and for my blush
Physicians Formula happy booster just to
give a little bit of an illuminated rosy
glow didn't really use a highlight
because this has a sort of some glow
with some pearly glow to it and then for
my lips I used revlon colorburst lip
butter in peach parfait so it's giving
me that peachy natural shine I would
love to hear what some of your favorite
current favorite palettes are to use I
know the nude palettes are huge right
now whether it's this one or the naked
palettes or whatever I have done a video
on a drugstore nude eye palettes so if
you're trying to save
you know there are a lot of options in
the drugstore too so thank you so much
for watching have a wonderful day and
I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
