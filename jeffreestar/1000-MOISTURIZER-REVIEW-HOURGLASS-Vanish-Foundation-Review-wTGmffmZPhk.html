channel now I'm sure you saw today's
title and you were probably like last
night um well that's debatable now for
today's video I'm gonna be diving into
some new skincare that I found now I am
a skin care junkie I know everyone is
waiting like um hello where's your
skincare video I promise sometime soon
that will be coming it's going to be a
lengthy one but for now let me just
start off by saying I am an anti-aging
fanatic now my skin is very just normal
I think a lot of people if there's any
estheticians out there we need to spread
the word we are all kind of born with
the same skin like type but as you go
through life you become oily combination
normal dry it also depends on your
climate your diet there are so many
factors that a lot of people just forget
about myself included sometimes so I
stumbled across this brand called dec
Earth Day and it is a Japanese skincare
brand and I looked at the price and I
said a thousand dollars I'm like bitch
this moisturizer better pay my rent it
better drive my car for me and better to
get my groceries but for real this is
the jar now the packaging oh my god as a
packaging whore this spoke to me I
looked at this and I was like oh my god
I think I need you but I'm like okay a
thousand dollars is expensive it
is probably the most expensive
moisturizer I've ever held in my hands
so I'm like okay I got to review this I
got to research this and I got to find
out who the hell is making this what is
the brand and is it is the worth it
bitch is it really worth it so today
we're gonna be talking about this guy
now this is from a brand called
dec Earth Day and this is that aq Milly
earthy intensive cream now when I looked
at this I was just like first of all I
was mesmerised I was like oh my god hi
baby can we cuddle um and it comes
in a gold box which I accidentally threw
in the trash really good reviewer right
slapped me in my face so it is very
heavy it is hard plastic with a metal
band and here we're just going to open
it up inside and oh it does come with a
little seal so I always put that back on
after I'm done using it do you have to I
don't know I just feel like you should
now this product does come with 1.5
ounces of cream and I think that's
pretty good for a high-end brand because
with this one a little goes a long way
so I definitely think we need to dive in
a few facts about this brand as you can
see there's a lot of nail marks in there
I definitely do not like to review
skincare unless I've tried it for longer
than three to four weeks I think that
some people they read a label they think
it's gonna be like some magic trick and
make them look youthful after like two
days of using it but you definitely need
to get your skin used to the product you
got to try it out so I definitely
recommend trying things for weeks at a
time before you go and this sucks so
obviously with this one I was like bitch
I'm in chemo research on their website
it says that they have been working with
world-renowned University researchers
and acclaimed scientists to create a
life force that the body can assimilate
and understand so basically this
moisturizer has some crazy stuff in it
now a lot of these brands will patent
ingredients where you have to if you
want to use it like let's say I wanted
to use the same ingredients or something
similar I would have to reach out to
them and get almost like a licensing
type of deal or an approval from them to
use it so right now they have a lot of
ingredients that I guess only they're
using right now now this is sold
exclusively at Saks Fifth Avenue which
is a chain store here in America I know
there's a lot of viewers out there so
some people might be like what the hell
is Saks
so this says that there is a formula 30
in there which is an I guess an
abbreviation for a powerhouse up over 30
carefully selected active ingredients
I'm like oh
now it says that there are botanicals
that act like hormone like activators
working to specifically supplement a
woman's needs well and also quickly in
this video later after I put this on I
am going to be demoing the new hourglass
foundation look how cool these sticks
are I'm like so these just hit the
market they are brand new on sephora.com
and we'll dive into this in a second but
back to skincare so for the last four
weeks I have been using this every night
now it is a very heavy moisturizer so
during the day I will take like the
tiniest bit and kind of like work it all
over and then I'll do my little you know
top chef' spray and everything else and
I'll do my makeup but at night is where
I go a little bit more heavier I just
lay my pillow and I just feel like
sleeping beauty and I'm just letting it
sink in also when I was looking up this
brand you guys it says that there are
double peptides which is like an amino
acid and there are ingredients in this
that helps stimulate collagen produced
by fibroblasts to rebuild structure and
elasticity sign me the up girl so
I'm just going to put a little bit of
this on right now now I think I've used
about 25 to 30 percent of the product
thus far maybe a little less now I just
take this off with my nail just like
that now this is a lot I'm sure a lot of
you were like yeah right doesn't that
gun cover for some reason watch I'm
just going to touch it like this okay so
you see how much product is on there and
I just massage it into the skin now a
little goes a long way right now it is
still really dewy now the only thing
that kind of bothers me about this for
the price is it maybe because there are
so many ingredients the smell is a
little intense for me now as it dries
and soaks into your skin it does go away
thank God but it is it's kind of like
that old lady grandma face cream um kind
of vibe kind of like Chanel no offense
because I love them but bitch some of
this smells like my
in grandma's house now what I like to do
is I like to take it between my fingers
and I like to massage it into the skin
for a minute so I'm not just like
alright let's go
like I love to just massage it and work
it in and I like to always pull down and
just mmm and I like to go all the way
down the neck a lot of people forget
about the neck I think that the neck can
age over time so definitely want to
focus on that
now what happens everyone's probably
like waiting for my skin to like
transform to like an infant or that's it
you let it sit now it gives you this
kind of like luminosity a little kind of
glow but it starts to really soak in and
in about 10 minutes if you run your
hands over my face you're gonna be like
Oh happen it just feels really really
smooth like that's the only word I think
I could use because it just feels like
what are my final thoughts on this guy
you have to continue watching but I
think we should dive into some makeup
for a second so hourglass which is one
of my favorite brands they have some
really good products now they just put
out a new foundation and it's labeled
full coverage so I was like hi there
so this is the hourglass vanish seamless
finish foundation stick now comes in a
shiny like kind of bronze Brown you know
carton just like all their other stuff
and I got three shades because obviously
you guys know how it is when you buy a
foundation online or Sephora how do you
know if it's really gonna match I mean
you just kind of guess and play it by
ear
Sephora does a really good job of
labeling the colors which I find very
helpful so I bought three shades
I got balanc and then I got alabaster
and I got ivory so these retail for $46
now here's the one thing that kind of
shocked me there is only 0.25 ounces in
this I'm like girl now if you compare it
to a Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick
this has 0.44 ounces in it so for $46
there's
a lot of product in there now this
product says that this formula is highly
concentrated so you know very pigmented
only a small amount is needed and then
it says this is a foundation stick with
the coverage of a concealer the fluidity
of a liquid and the weightlessness of a
powder for invisible full coverage on my
girl hmm
we're gonna put you to the test
hourglass I think I'm gonna try all
three shades today I'm sure a lot of you
were like what the hell I'm gonna do a
little highlighting with this with the
foundation and just kind of we're gonna
mix and match now I really haven't tried
these so let's just pray that they're
the pie colors also I want to mention
for the same price of 46 dollars you can
buy a brush for the foundation this is
the vanished foundation brush I've heard
very mixed reviews about this so I'm
gonna try it on half my face and then
we'll we got it and then we'll maybe use
a artists brush for the rest and we'll
see how these blend out now the brush
says that it is a high-performance
foundation brush designed with ideal
shape density and a texture to achieve
the most seamless finish I'm like oh
that is that's a lot okay so this is
shade Blanc and oh this is a really
light okay so I'm just gonna take this
oh okay girl and I'm gonna just kind of
put it where I normally highlight oh wow
this is really light on my okay now
it says a little goes a long way so that
maybe you've been too much now earlier I
forgot to mention I did quickly prime my
skin off-camera with a little bit of
that grill on gold primer hi I'm gonna
need a new one soon I'm also going to
take shade and the Bastyr and we're just
going to do a little bit mmm those are
my new eyebrows and then with shade
ivory now when I think of ivory I think
a lot lighter but this one is like I
think this is my skin tone if I had a
tan
this is me like a month ago when I was
trying to go a little darker so we'll
just do a little bit here oh yeah that
is like tan oh I wouldn't mind putting
this all over me though so I'm just
going in right here everyone we're just
going in honey also delicious scratched
my face this morning so if you see a
drop of blood
we were playing rough okay right off the
bat the coverage though I'm like okay
okay let me let me keep buffing and
blending first now the brush it's a
little stiff but it's working I always
like to put foundation on my lids as you
guys have seen me do a million times
this is this is a full-coverage mask
bitch yes and I'm applying this really
with like hard motions and I'm just kind
of like buffering it into the skin oh my
god oh right okay that is full coverage
like oh my god now something I'm
noticing right now is that my pores do
not like stand out they're pretty good
I'm like okay I hate foundation that
kind of coagulates and gets really like
I'm just calling gummy near your pores
or patchy this looks really nice now for
the right side of my face I'm gonna be
going in with that artiste oval-8 brush
and you guys know how these work by now
you just brush and this is gonna blend a
lot quicker this is like a drag queens
dream like all my homies watching this
laganja honey you need this foundation
oh right oh my god of course we're gonna
hit that ear we're gonna get behind the
neck Oh see how this is like becoming
blurry here let me just go over this a
little bit so you guys can see how full
coverage this is my tattoos like uh-huh
we're blurry now
all right this foundation is a ball
lended to fill so first impressions are
it didn't settle into my like little
fine lines at all my pores don't look
extra crazy now I haven't said it yet
which I'm about to do but I gotta say
now this might sound shocking to
everybody
but I don't think you really need
concealer after using this like I think
using the different colors was really
cool and helps but um this is a lot of
makeup they were not playing when they
said a little goes a long way like I
barely touched it and this was like
ah our public could've used the last but
hey it's me we're talking about so I
move these down for a little more but um
definitely do not need as much as I put
on there I think putting concealer on
under the eyes is just gonna make it
look cakey and I see a lot of people
just put on way too much makeup and I
don't think that's realistic you guys
I'm never the one to tell anyone to tone
it down put on 20 bottles under your
eyes if you want you but this foundation
particularly I don't think you need
concealer shocking right but I
definitely think you need to set it
quickly so I'm going to be using my
natural loose finish powder from Chanel
one of my faves besides that Laura
Mercier and if you want you can just
take the powder puff that's in there I
like to pour some out on the lid and um
let's see how this looks is that baby
oh my gosh she said she is a teen oh my
god as soon as I set this you guys my
pores like a vanish you see the
difference okay now some foundations
when you set it they don't always look
the best this one is not bad alright
this foundation really is like a mask it
is really really pigmented now I
definitely think for the price you get a
full coverage face now I wish they would
have put a little bit more product into
this but the packaging I think is very
unique very flawless I just love that I
just want to like I don't know might
start a band right now brush is not a
necessity i think that morphe has a
million foundation brushes for way less
that work um better and but i really
really like this
now i've never
wearing this out so I definitely want to
go run some errands spend some time with
the dogs and go get lunch and see how
this all settles because something can
look cute right now in front of the
camera and then an hour later it's like
so I want to go hang out for a little
bit and see what happens so I will be
back in a few hours with my final
thoughts on the foundation and the
skincare all right guys it's been about
four four and a half hours oh my god it
is about 107 degrees today in Calabasas
girl so I was testing out something so
here's a test I always do that I've
never talked about before sunglasses
lines a lot of people are like how do
you never have them clearly I do and I'd
like to try out the foundation and test
it out to see if it will get um lines
now obviously every pair of sunglasses
is different so I get asked a lot how do
you prevent it it depends on the pair if
it has like the little grooves in here
that are like really intense you're
definitely gonna get these no matter
what you do but a lot of the times I
will take a setting powder like the
Chanel when I use earlier or the Laura
Mercier and I will put just a little bit
of extra powder right there just kind of
let it bake and just seep into my skin
so a lot of the times when I see this if
I'm out I will always keep like a little
damp Beauty Blender this one's not damp
or a dry one and I will just take it
with some extra powder like I'll keep a
little luminous silk in my purse I'll
dab it and then I rub for a second and
that will help really minimize it and
then also your skin is like dented from
the weight of the sunglasses so act you
know after about like one or two minutes
your skin kind of like pops back up and
that dent is gone so that's my little
tip and trick real quick so that's the
foundation first impressions you guys I
think that this hourglass foundation
might be in my kit for a minute now one
thing I will say is that this foundation
brush is not necessary by any means so
definitely it's not a waste of money I
just don't think you really need it
you love a beauty blender or a morphe
brush I think those are gonna work
completely fine
so all in all I'm a fan now final
thoughts on the deck or day intense
cream now I will say this this is a very
expensive moisturizer is it a necessity
for you know your everyday life
no is it something a really pricey that
actually works yes is it something that
I feel like everyone on earth needs
definitely not I think if you are very
into anti-aging extreme skincare this
could definitely work for you but if
you're just a normal girl and you
already have a moisturizer that works
there are obviously a million brands out
there you guys know I love Neutrogena
Lemaire Clinique keels there's a there's
a million more out there so if you have
the money to indulge on this I think
it's definitely worth it but I would
rather go get five hundred packs of
Cinnabon delights and stick with my
Kiehl's moisturizer but all in all I'm
gonna finish this bottle and if I'm so
obsessed with it I might buy it again
but um I had so much fun trying out some
new products for you guys if you guys
have any new suggestions for products
brands weird to try out tell me in
the comments below and I will see you
guys on the next one my love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
