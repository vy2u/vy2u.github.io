channel first of all happy fucking New
Year now this weekend I am gonna upload
my favorite beauty products and my least
favorite beauty products of 2016 but I
thought you know what let's start the
new year off with a bang and try out
some crazy ass shit so today I'm gonna
be trying a twelve dollar primer against
a hundred and forty dollar primer yes
some ran thought they were slick enough
to price a motherfucking primer that
much so I'm like I think we should just
dive right into it and if you want to
see what the hell these makeup brands
are fucking up to then keep on watching
one of my favorite website is Beauty
lish calm now they are one of my
official retailers they ship worldwide
and they have a bunch of amazing brands
like honest hacia sugarpill charlotte
tilbury natasha de Nonna they have a
bunch of brands and I love shopping on
their website I know that sounds like a
shameless plug but I just you know I
might come on if there's a website with
good a skincare and crazy makeup you
know my bitch ass is going to be there
so I was scrolling through the website
the other day and one of these brands
it's called by Terry they have a lot of
expensive skincare and concealers and
foundations so I just bought a bunch of
stuff but while I was browsing they have
a new limited edition a hundred and
forty dollar primer I'm like girl what
in the hell is in here to make it that
price point so you know my bougie bitch
ass had to pick this up so I'm going to
do a little battle of the primers today
I'm gonna do one half of my face in the
hundred and forty dollar and the other
side a twelve dollar primer so I went on
Twitter literally just a few minutes ago
and I and I tweeted what's everyone's
favorite drugstore primer and I was
literally on the way to Rite Aid and if
you don't know what write it is that is
like a Walgreens a CD as type of
drugstore here on the west coast
do they have write on the East Coast I
don't know so I asked everybody what I
should get and you guys sent me so many
recommendations like
oh my god it was thousands and thousands
of tweets and I picked up a few and one
that you guys kept sending it was the
L'Oreal magic perfecting base I'm like
whoo okay little pink black carton right
away you guys should know by now that
the Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched face
base is what am I tried and true for a
long time and it reminded me of this
because it looked like a mini version
but by another brand so I was definitely
attracted to it you guys were like going
off like you gotta go get that one so I
am going to put these to the test now
I've never opened either of these before
I've never even tried them so my skin
right now is bare but if you do notice
along my lash line and maybe on my
forehead and hairline I still have bits
of glitter from my full face using only
glitter challenge which I'm actually not
mad at because when I'm looking in the
viewfinder I'm like oh hi lid like it's
in my lashes this shit is not coming out
so probably another month or two maybe
they'll float okay but um yes for
everyone wondering there's still glitter
everywhere and my beauty room the whole
floor help me now I am going to go over
the L'Oreal one first and now this one
was $12.99 now this magic perfecting
base is supposed to obviously be a
makeup primer it says under you can put
under your eyes to smooth fine lines
okay it says that it's going to hide
pores it's going to vanish imperfections
I'm like okay girl huh it is silky a
lightweight it glides onto your skin
leaving a velvety smooth to the touch
feeling it is suitable for all skin
types it is derma logically tested and
okay great it's time to open this up and
see what she looks like
so the L'Oreal one comes in a little
glass pot like this the philip glass is
that plastic maybe it's hard plastic
feels huh so it says put this to use
under any foundation I also forgot to
mention that after I do both sides of my
face I am going to use one foundation
with a Beauty Blender and do my entire
face so we can tell or see if there's a
difference all right so back to D primer
this
one has 0.5 fluid ounces in it
the other one has 1.0 one fluid ounces
so it is basically double the size will
unbox this in a second I am going to see
if there's a fragrance not really I'm
gonna touch it with my nail real quickly
like I'm just gonna put the back of my
hand oh wow it's like very tacky holy
okay that feels cool I'm like oh my god
okay it feels a very velvety okay
packaging you weren't lying
what we'll see in a minute on my face
all right I just used a little Burt's
Bees makeup wipe to wipe that primer off
my hands and now we're gonna in box in
box we're gonna embalm we're gonna unbox
the by cherry primer
now this was a unicorn no like real me
and you guys expensive packaging like
draws me and I'm like hi hi hi alright
so this is called the elixir de parler
it says a premier illuminating
concentrate alright
so besides being limited edition this is
a youthful radiant elixir this true
premium concentrated luminosity infused
with precious freshwater pearls and
multi reflection pigments reveals a
perfecting ultra smoothing rosy peach
pearlescent glow fuck those mouth balm
like I need to come up for some air okay
so this is supposed to be used
underneath your makeup so let's take her
out the packaging is gorgeous I just
have to keep saying that I'm like oh
okay so this is what she looks like it
comes in a glass jar as well of course
as I mentioned it is double the size as
the l'oreal one now it also comes with a
little spatula as a lot of you know
high-end expensive skincare stuff does
it basically is like you know for
sanitary reasons you kind of scoop it
out with this instead of touching with
your nails or fingers okay so this one
has
a little plastic I like to call it the
like sanitary scream that you remove to
get into there oh okay this one smells
really fresh it's kind of like just
smells fresh is that such a weird thing
to say it smells like floral sunscreen
kind of mixture all right let's get this
hair back let's get these curls fucking
out of my way okay so my right which
will be over here I'm gonna do the
l'oreal drugstore primer so let's start
and I'm gonna stop right here I'm
literally gonna go all the way up like
the face and only do this side okay so
already I can tell that my face looks
kind of blurred it really does not gonna
lie I'm like okay right now a little
went a long way I use two little nail
scoops and she's laid all right now for
the left side of my face I'm going to
use the little spatula is this enough we
will see in a second I'm only gonna use
my left hand because the right side is
tainted and I'm just gonna dip this one
around now don't try to say that I'm
using more on this side because I'm
definitely not I'm just spreading it
with this because that's what it told me
to do all right
that side is on BAM is there a
difference look zoom in and take a look
okay this side you can see is kind of
like definitely luminous it feels a
little tacky as well but and then
different almost like not sticky I hate
that word because that sounds like
negative but like feels a little like
come on foundation work and then this
one feels a little oh this was 90s okay
now only difference I'm noticing is that
the dietary one obviously it's on a
blurring one it never claimed to be so
it definitely did not blur I see a
little shimmer over my skin kind of
living for that because you guys know
I'm a glowy ass bitch all right I guess
let's put these to the test and see
which one makes our foundation look
sickening so I'm gonna go in with one of
my favorite foundations of all time the
Armani a luminous silk
I mean how many years but I've been
wearing this by now you all should know
this is one of the motherfucking best so
we are going to put her to the test
since I always use this I will
definitely be able to tell the
difference right away so I'm going to
use a damp Beauty Blender and just do a
few pumps and coat my entire face so
let's see wow bands okay guys let's
bounce
all right so I think it's only fair that
we zoom in a little bit and see what the
hell is going on all right so let me
zoom in on myself let me zoom in with a
mirror and let's see if there is any
differences now I'm not shocked but the
mattifying side looks a little drier and
I don't want to say patchy but like a
little just not like as like amazing I
guess as this side the side looks really
oh my god look stunning
this side not awful actually all um in
the area that I really don't like my
pores around here
it definitely minimized them under the
eyes looks pretty but yes my fine lines
are a little bit there and on this side
the l'oreal side there is zero fine line
so hey yes god um yeah the set actually
looks a little more hydrating though
which I mean give or take right so I'm
going to do a little turn little side to
side here is the twelve dollar primer
and here is the 140 dollar primer side
now I definitely think that the more
luxurious primer I look a little more
hydrated a little more like I don't know
a little more time - a little more a
little more summery a little more fresh
the other side is definitely very matte
and I actually like it I think honestly
for the price point this one is awesome
because all you have to do is really add
a little bit more moisturizer before you
put this on or even mix like I kind of
want to do for the for next video just
on a tutorial is to put this first and
then this and see what happens I'm kind
of curious to do that so I guess let's
give our final thoughts and our final a
review okay so I did not expect this to
happen you guys I am torn like I'm like
I'm kind of mad I'm like okay is the by
Terry primer
Jeffrey Stehr approved or is the L'Oreal
magic we're fighting base
Jeffrey's are approved I'm gonna shock
you all
drumroll they're both jeffree star
approved primers there was not a lot of
cons really for either they both looked
great I'm like I'm just looking back and
forth um I don't know I mean maybe
because the first time I've used both
them I'm not like in love dying I think
they definitely need a few more tests
under other foundations and in tutorials
to see how they are going to you know of
course wear and tear throughout the day
you guys but yeah I'm like shocked here
I'm a little confused oh I hate either
one of them I'm like sorry guys today
they're kind of both approved so hey I
wish there was more excitement I wish
one of them flopped really hard because
I am shocked but um shout out to both
brands I think these are definitely fun
now of course you guys all know this one
I know a lot of you were gonna roll your
eyes like bitch that was not good enough
for $140 and I'm not actually mad at you
because I kind of agree with ya but it
was fun to try and I'm definitely gonna
be wearing it under the um you know
future future tutorials and future looks
and see how it compares to my favorite
gold primer and everything else but um
alright I think that is it fuck I don't
want to leave you guys if there are any
more new products or anything that you
guys want me to try of course leave some
feedback in the comments down below and
let me know what you guys think like did
you see a difference between the right
or the left side give me your honest
real thoughts because you guys always
see it better than I do but um alright
mwah I love you guys and I will see you
on the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
