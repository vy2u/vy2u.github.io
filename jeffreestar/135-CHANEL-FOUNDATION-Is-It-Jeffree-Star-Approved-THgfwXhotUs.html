channel alright you guys so today we are
going to try out a crazy foundation that
just launched from Chanel Beauty now
listen you guys just saw Chanel lip
gloss in my March favorites videos I am
obsessed with it tell me why I can't
stop wearing it even though I'm not
wearing it right now I was at the mall
the other day and the lady at Saks she
goes Jeffery there's a new Chanel
foundation have you tried it yet and I'm
like before we even talked about that I
know you guys are all going to slap me
if I don't tell you about this today I
am wearing pink pearl gloss which is
from bike Beauty Love Bites
they are cozy free they are vegan it
fucking smells amazing it's like candy
and there's a brand from Canada if you
guys don't know bite is there also in
Sephora I love them now back to the
foundation this foundation tell you guys
is a hundred and thirty five dollars I
know most of you are like a girl by now
this is called the Chanel some of the
Maj la tenth foundation now comes in
this gold unit carton we're gonna do a
little unboxing as well this feels
really happy I just want to put that out
there
Chanel always feels really luxurious if
you've been watching my channel for a
while you know that I am obsessed with
their loose powder recently I've been
using lemare a lot but this is like hi
it's like almost empty it's amazing and
I've also been using their powder
foundation a lot which we're going to
use later on in the video after we apply
everything it's this little guy right
here and the mirror is so dirty I throw
this in my purse so we'll use that in a
minute
alright so now on to the foundation you
guys this is crazy I think a 135 dollars
is fucking insane
but it's Chanel so you guys know what do
I say in every video you know you're
paying for the name on top of this
formula and whatever else is going on
here so if you want to see me test out
this crazy Chanel foundation since we
keep on watching now I love their
packaging is always looking expensive so
when you open it you see that right
there that is a spatula to take out the
foundation which already tells me it's
going to be in like a glass or plastic
component so this little spatula
basically just to scoop it out
and it kind of allegedly for like you
know sad for sanitary reasons they're
not dipping your fingers are in there or
your brush and has a cute tiny little
Chanel symbol at the top which you guys
know I'm obsessed with that already now
when you open it it is a little smaller
than I thought
so there you have it it actually comes
with another product with it this is a
brush okay I was going to apply it with
an artiste brush today but since it
already has its own brush I think it's
only fair to maybe at least you have to
face with this and then we can see how
this works with it now the bottle of
course is a little smaller than I
thought for 135 dollars on my girl but
let's open it up and see what happens
alright so it has of course a little
protector BAM this is what it looks like
something that's a lot of product
not going to lie I think for the price
point I think there should be a little
bit more but I guess let's to see what
kind of coverage is giving us now you
guys are going to love to give you all
the facts so this has the 30 grams of
product which is 1 ounce pretty standard
for skin care and foundation honestly I
mean this has one ounce
I guess maybe just because packaged it
really it looks a little smaller but
same amount of product alright so now I
am on Chanel calm you guys know I have
to always build a tea before I try it
because I don't want to you know judge
it unless I know when I against all the
facts alright so this is an exquisite
lightweight foundation it's creamy
texture offers buildable light to medium
coverage for a glowy healthy and
luminous look so this says that the
formula harnesses the intense power of
vanilla plena folia okay that's the
signature ingredient along with the
luminosity of diamond powder and the
comfort of plant-based ingredients to
leave the complexion radiant revitalize
and optimally revitalize okay some
reason this is saying that for the first
time ever Chanel foundation formula is
enriched with diamond powder all right
so let's dive in to the review and the
application now of course we're going to
prime the skin like I always do and this
was in my favorites I'm obsessed with it
this is the first lolli unicorn essence
it is just a really good primer for
minimizing pores and keeping your skin
really snatched I'm crying maybe
I'm just gonna rub this all out with my
breakfast out it's awful I'm going to
rub this out with my hand I guess that's
how men are rubbed out all right we are
going to dip well I don't know how much
to use so let's just start and normal I
would never put that much on my forehead
there we go
I'm just going to kind of smooth this
out
now I do want to say one thing right now
I always talk about smell texture
everything just feels like literally
like expensive skin care with color to
it all right I'm just gonna grab a
mirror and let's blend this part out
right here and let's see what happens
this is really light but it's covering
my like discoloration areas the brush is
not bad it already kind of shed it and a
piece of hair just came up on my
forehead girl okay this isn't the worst
thing I think it's a little bit of an
annoyance to me that it's so short like
I need a long brush to like really go in
I feel like but now I know this is still
on this side but you're just going to
already see the difference it does have
a little nasty like it said it's very
light which I'm not mad at like a little
everyday moment but you know I'm a
full-coverage bitch so I'm like
let's look subscribe for a second and
I'm just going to give you guys first
impressions already just like right away
from just trying it now I did forget to
mention what shade I of course bought
sorry about that
now I got three shades and I tried shade
matching after I did the primer just
like right here and I swear to god this
one is a really good match
this is shade 20 beige forever another
that's a similar skin tone to me I tried
some lighter ones and I'm at a
last-ditch but the lighter ones were
actually like ghastly like really pale
and I was like oh my god hell no all
right now the only thing I'm having a
problem with is this shade range online
there's literally only ten shades I'm
like girl and they all look pretty kind
of light now I am twenty beige it goes
up to a sixty beige but even the color
looks not as like tan or dark as I would
have expected from Chanel but maybe
they're darker in person I don't know of
course I did not buy them all but let's
zoom in with my mirror and let's see
what this looks like
alright now remember I only applied one
layer I do want to do a second one maybe
to see if we can get it like medium
medium coverage but looking like
close-up I will say this it's really
pretty like I was shocked because you
know a lot of times with these expensive
ass products they haven't been working
out lately on my channel but this one is
really nice
now I will say this of course I haven't
done concealer or set the skin or the
face and I haven't done any powder so it
feels a little I don't want to say khaki
like the primer but it just feels a
little not like it's sticky is the wrong
word but it sounds a little like because
it just feels like someone's on my face
I guess it's definitely light like it is
a light coverage but for some greens
it's could be like it easy like hey I
have five minutes to get ready and just
going to the movies or I'm going to the
grocery store or I don't know you're
about to go on your knees and you don't
want to look fucking rubs gross but what
we've all been there let me add a little
bit of another layer to see how it would
look with a more medium type of moment
all right so we're just going to down a
little bit more around the cities one
for a my foreheads like fishes me a mom
I think my nose has enough coverage okay
so we're going to go back in with a
brush and let's see what this looks like
okay cool so now that we have the second
layer on let's take a peek here it's
crazy because it doesn't look really
thick or cakey thank God because a lot
of times if you kind of let the first
layer dry and you go in again it gets a
little weird it's a little funky I know
we've all been there so putting the
second layer on top of the first one
didn't change the formula it still looks
really pretty I'm pleasantly surprised
at the coverage actually like it is
definitely I think it it's a light
medium I'm not gonna say this is a full
medium but um it's really pretty I'm
looking in the monitor and I really like
it like I'm not seeing any discoloration
of course I would personally go in with
concealer in a minute just to brighten
so I definitely want to do that and see
how it looks after huh the only thing I
don't love is when I put that lid back
on girl
messy alright now I just put on some
Urban Decay concealer we are going to
use a artiste brush to buff this out and
let's see how it looks on top of these
chanel foundation yes now this is an
extreme highlighted look if you don't
want this look emulate
all right concealer holy shit
so you see the difference right here you
guys this is where I'm going to put my
contour I know it's a little extreme on
camera all right now we are going to
take this Laura Mercier contour book
this is a cream contour palette I love
it we're just going to take a little
synthetic and we're going to go in here
to contour shade one and we're just
going to go like that alright now I'm
going to take a little bit of this and
go down the nose for some extreme
contouring okay now this may look a
little dark but once it's blended out it
really blends nicely with the skin so no
one freaked out I'm here
alright now you can use a Beauty Blender
you can use our teeth brush again I'm
kind of going to wipe off if there's any
concealer there real quick and then I'm
going to use the same brush and buffing
blend all right now I'm just going to
finish up the face real quickly with
some setting powder and I'm just going
to use a Chanel it's going to be a
Chanel day so we're going to finish off
the face with the Chanel under eye
setting powder and then we're going to
cover it the entire face with the double
perfection of the Maneri powder and I'll
be right back alright guys we are
finishing up the face right now it's
looking pretty snatched like a very doll
like very stunning now I'm done being so
extra I'm using this Chanel powder brush
an image of the brush and I kind of
soften the contour but I definitely
think we're missing some highlights so
let's just plug myself and use me in
Manny's new shade of clips I think
that's kind of fitting I'm just gonna
pop that on the cheekbones like it ain't
shit girl don't play me all right so now
that the concealer is on the face is set
we got foundation powder we have
highlight I'm I'm looking and like it is
really really nice you guys like I
really don't have many complaints and
you know this bitch likes to complain
and let you guys have it but like it
looks really really really nice that's
what I really have to say I have a dog
here in my mouth excuse me so I think
it's only fair if I go to the office run
some errands I have some shit to do
today I have some meetings I'm going to
go
Manny Laura and then I'm gonna come back
in public like six hours and let's just
see how it all settled so I'll be back
later today whoo all right everybody
it's been a long day it is what time is
it okay it's 9:00 at night and I am
leaving for Las Vegas tomorrow morning
and everyone did so by the time you
watch this I will be in Sin City on a
little business trip with Nikita and
let's get back to the review I have some
notes y'all I have some notes so it's
been about 6 6 hours and 45 minutes to
be exact and I will say this the
foundation overall health up up mazing
but one little flaw I did notice is let
me push this hair back it did cake up
under my eyes a little bit now remember
I did do heavy concealer and then we did
be Chanel loose powder under it so maybe
the concealer was a little bit too heavy
for the foundation remember the
foundation was very light weight very
luminous and light comedian coverage
throughout the day it really lasted
nicely I really don't have any
complaints except my under eyes look a
little uh I guess a little rough they
look a little cakey to me personally may
be on camera you guys aren't really
seeing it but just right under there I'm
having a little bit of an issue so
normally I would like take a Beauty
Blender or sponge and just kind of touch
it up I didn't touch up throughout the
day like I normally would I want you
guys to see it raw but overall I really
really like the foundation I'm shocked
because you know I am a very full
coverage type of ho but overall I think
this is an amazing foundation but for a
hundred and thirty-five dollars that's
where it gets tricky with me when I
start to do more and more more of these
reviews because to me like wet and wild
photo focus for $5.99 could do the exact
same thing but no no but I was going to
say that you know maybe there's like
skincare in this but no we went over all
the ingredients or
nothing like spectacular it's not like
an extremely expensive anti-aging agree
in here that is going to change your
mind so here's where it gets tricky it's
a it's Jeffrey Stehr approved based on a
working the formula work
it looks amazing I love it but I also
want to throw it out there that just
because I approve it like yes it did
exactly what it said it looks amazing
it's been hours I love it it's actually
really pretty like I didn't really even
need makeup on it through all in
sunglasses I have a little glass of
marks right here excuse me the price
point it's too ridiculous honestly I
don't love enough where I'm probably
going to use the entire thing down to
the jar where it's empty and I'm going
to rebuy it on like you know me I'm
always going to be honest with you I
think it's beautiful I'm definitely
going to try out a few times
I think just for an everyday moment it's
cute if you want to splurge on something
I think it blended out flawlessly but
there's a million dupes out there and it
didn't like blow my mind where I'm like
oh my god this foundation no one else
can make it like you know no one else
could do this it can be duped so you
guys turn it here that's exactly how I
feel I think that I'm going to be using
in a few more videos just for fun and
everyday use because I did love how it
like really gave it this nice look I
think I would love to wear it without
the heavy concealer maybe something more
light and not so much powder but I love
the kind of like light foundation which
is the highlight moment at some gloss
huh mattes but that's gonna be how I
look all the time don't get it twisted
because I need that full drag eye every
other day but I'm alright guys I think
that is it for this review the Chanel
supplement foundation is just our
approach are you guys until the next
time you see me I miss you I love you MA
and I'll see you on the next one bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
