channel and if you're new how the fuck
did you find me you must have been
diving to the deep dark places of
YouTube just kidding but hi guys so I'm
sure you saw today's title and even
rolling your mother effing eyes again
you're like has this bitch lost his mind
again we know the answer in about one
but today I am going to be doing a first
impressions on the hourglass cosmetics
brand new the curator mascara now this
is the price is hefty I'm just gonna say
it right off the bat the price is crazy
for a mascara now I know we are all used
to the traditional mascaras you know I'm
just going to show my favorite one right
here now we're all used to traditional
mascaras that have a wand and a little
applicator and you know that's just it
that's how we know mascara but when a
brand is innovative and they create
something new that no one's ever done
before you know I have to try it so it
comes in three parts so I'm sure you're
all like $150 what it is because it
comes in three parts so you have to buy
the mascara applicator it's a stainless
steel wand
so maybe applicator ain't the right word
and then you also have to get the primer
separately okay and then you also have
to buy the mascara and everything comes
in a gorgeous bronzy brown unit car in
so let's open this guy and see what it
looks like oh this looks like a deadly
double-oh-seven type of weapon just jack
reacher have one of these I feel like
it's like a secret like taser gun okay
but for real it comes in this gorgeous
little package like this oh right oh so
you see the hourglass logo is right
there and it is beautiful it is very
heavy which I love when something feels
expensive that means they put a little
bit more money into their packaging and
I like that so this feels really nice
now the primer comes in a little jar
type glass component like this and then
the black mascara the realist is what
they're calling it comes in something
like this they also feel really nice and
I think this is like a hard kind of
plasticky kind of looks like frosted
glass but it feels sturdy it feels
really nice
from doing some research on this little
guy this is the wand so let's just show
this off and see what it looks like in
here oh my god there are no crazy
bristles like in normal mascara it is
like the stainless steel of wonder as
you can see it has tiny fine little
ridges on the applicator and I guess you
were supposed to dunk it into this once
and coat your entire lash line from
bottom to tip now with a traditional
wand you guys know how obviously a
normal mascara wand looks you really
can't get as close to your lashes as you
are supposed to you know allegedly now
of course when I do mascara you can't
get to the very very ends of your you
know the I guess the root of your lashes
not being excuse me the root so this is
supposed to help get the closest to your
eye as you humanly possibly can I'm on
their website and it says that the lash
instrument is engineered to give you
ultimate precision and control with the
high performance primer in mascara for
the most stunningly sophisticated
defined and lifted lashes
goddamn that's a bold statement so I
guess um we're gonna give this a whirl
I'm excited you guys it is very weird
we're diving off of course the weird end
of makeup and I think that's what
YouTube's all about it's fun to try new
stuff if you guys were like rolling in
your graves like I would never try that
it's okay I'm gonna try it for you so
this is the hourglass primer and we're
just going to open oh I thought that
this part would open but it's this
little guy oh okay now for safety
reasons they want you to dip it and then
do it on your eye and then wife before
you put back in there so there's no
bacteria which i think is cool so I have
a little hand towel here to a wipe off
and keep it flawless now let's just see
what happens
all right it's coated you guys it is a
fully coated so I am just going to let's
just try the right eye first and my
eyelashes might have some crazy glue in
it from wearing fake lashes for you know
six months straight so just ignore them
but um all right let's get this the
world so I'm just going to take this and
coat all my lashes now I am going to
wipe it off and then we're gonna go back
in one more time now it's time to coat
the bottom lashes
all right lashes are coated now of
course I'm going to close this guy up so
no air gets in I'm sure I'm just got in
a little bit but hey what can you do
alright now time for the mascara is it
gonna work I don't know I'm scared you
guys so let's just undo this and we're
gonna go and then oh that is coated
completely you'll see that okay alright
guys let's see what happens so it's
definitely grabbing at my lashes a
little bit from those little ridges in
there it's definitely coating them all
like completely as you can see the
little ridges from my lashes are there
and on the little instrument you can see
where the product has been used so
alright now I think it's only fair that
we dip it in one more time let me just
wipe this off and let's see what happens
with the bottom
uh-oh
I may have bumped my eye one second
please
all right we're back I accidentally
bumped my eye but the bottoms are a
little tricky they're not separating how
I normally do them which you could
easily fix with a lash comb of course if
you have one all right so here's the
difference this has the full primer and
mascara on it and this one literally has
nothing so you guys can see the
difference now definitely there is a big
difference I think the bottom ones look
a little spidery
maybe a little too ranchy if you will
but I kind of like that it's very Tammy
Faye Bakker if you will and for the top
one I think it looks really pretty now
of course I think without a traditional
wand you're not gonna get added crazy
volume like maybe I'm used to but for
this sort of soft glowy glam look like I
think it works really well now do I
think the price point is worth it mmm I
don't know about that let me go do the
other eye and then I'll give you my
final thoughts all right so I was about
to do this eye with everything but then
I thought well since I'm so obsessed
with the benefit roller lash mascara I'm
sure everyone is gonna be like well I
want to see a side-by-side comparison so
before I do this I I was like oh well
duh let me just do that so you guys can
see my favorite mascara compared with
this guy and let's just give it a whirl
right now
alright guys time to compare now hmm
right off the bat I noticed that this
one is definitely a heavier well this
one did separate nicely the bottom is
kind of look identical but this mascara
was definitely heavier a little bit more
glamorous if you will a little bit more
like that drama that I crave and love
but if you were someone that loves a
natural makeup I definitely think that
this could be pretty but let's just give
my final thoughts alright guys so I've
let the mascara just kind of sit on my
eyes for about 30 minutes I wanted to
see if it would get any like little
mascara dots because a lot of times if I
look down at something for a few minutes
and I look up there's like mascara dots
which is why I felt so in love with
benefit because that one didn't do it
and guess what this one didn't do it so
it really doesn't transfer on your skin
which is nice because who the fuck was
to do with that now final thoughts on
the curator
I definitely think if you are a beauty
obsessed a weirdo um this is a good idea
and it's fun to use and play with but I
think the price point is way too much
and I think it's a little absurd it's
definitely for beauty collectors and
makeup obsessed crazies I just think
that you could go to the drugstore and
get a dupe for this to look the same so
I think for the effect it ain't that
impressive but I love the packaging the
style and it's definitely something
innovative and a first of its kind for
the beauty world so I'm definitely glad
that I tried it out but girl go get
yourself a wet Wow mascara if you think
this is some bullshit so looking at the
root of my eye I'm looking up crazy and
this will got pretty damn close actually
and this one of course the hourglass
side got way to the tip but I don't see
any crazy major difference I'm glad I
gave it a whirl but will I be swapping
out my normal everyday I don't think so
on this one but s Kara is mascara and we
all have our favorites now if there is
any other crazy Beauty invention
or anything else that I've never seen it
you guys are like girl why have you
tried this yet
just leave some products in the comments
below and I will definitely try them out
I love seeing you guys recommend me
stuff I always click the links and if
they look cool I buy them and here we
are trying them out Oh magic
alright so besides that you guys I have
a lot more videos coming I'm finally
listen when I say finally I've gotten so
many requests to do the tattoo tag and
talk about all my tattoos I have over a
hundred so I'm like you know what there
might be part one two three maybe a part
four I don't know how long it's going to
take but I'm definitely going to be
doing that and besides that I'm going to
be doing that boyfriend Q&amp;amp;A part three
with Nathan finally and I'm gonna be
doing part three of jeffree star
cosmetics on the road now I've been
traveling a lot doing photo shoots and a
