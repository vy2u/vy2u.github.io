channel today we're going to be diving
into this classic simple easy little
glam look and I'm going to be using a
lot of products that I've never used
before there is a 200 dollar primer that
just hit the market from one of my
favorite brands so we're going to try
out this today did it do anything
special or is it all you'll
have to find out in a minute and I'm
gonna be using some foundations and
powders and stuff and lipstick that have
never worn or even tried before until
now so it is a little bit of a first
impressions of a bunch of stuff so you
guys will just see me play with a lot of
new stuff and I just want to kind of
recreate the look I did for my Kylie lip
swatch video earlier in the week
everyone is like happy feet now I think
when I tone down my eye makeup and
switch up my face routine you can
definitely tell you guys always clock me
and know me the best so I'm gonna be
recreating that look for you guys with a
classic red lip with a twist there has
been so many new things coming out from
every brand across the board we're about
to dive in the holiday season and I'm
scared but I'm gonna try out as many new
things as I can like this highlighter
today two highlighters from two
different brands that I've never used
before that if that's not shocking
enough then I don't know what is besides
that you guys take is a really exciting
day my lip a munition has finally
launched all 10 shades just hit my
website so I think while you guys are
watching this you better get the
shopping baby I'm like I'm over the moon
so I'm gonna go celebrate my launch and
of course if you guys want to see how I
created this little classic glamour then
keep on watching so let's get started so
for primer today I'm going to be using
something I've never used before and
there's gonna be a lot of firsts in this
video I'm a said virginity there's gonna
be a lot of firsts in this video so this
is a new primer from Sicily it is called
the double 10 CR instant and long-term
so basically this primer which by the
way $200 I'm like this better give me
some new skin because
is a hefty huge price for a primer and I
think it's a little absurd but I had to
try it now Sicily is one of my favorite
brands now let's go all the way back to
my may favorites video I talked about
that Black Rose cream mask which is so
good if you have dry or normal skin this
oh my god listen it's everything
now I also use the Sicily floral toning
lotion it's basically a liquid toner
it's one of my favorites after I take
off all my makeup I gently toned my
whole entire face and neck with this guy
oh my god it's everything so I've been a
huge Sicily fan for a minute so when I
saw this primer I'm like alright girl
well the price tag is insane but
what does it really do so looking on
their website it says that it is a fresh
gel with a second skin effect so this is
supposed to be the balm before you put
on your foundation and it's supposed to
be sickening so it says that it's double
effective both immediate and long-term
so it's supposed to firm your face and
give you a kind of uplifted look and
take away any signs of fatigue I'm like
dude Buju
and it says after four weeks the skin
will look more tone and more denser to
the touch
is that true though bitch guess we'll
have to find out so I am just going to
take this like this oh okay it has an
interesting texture and I want to do too
much yet I'm scared I'm just gonna rub
it in oh it feels kind of like tacky
almost like a little sticky not in like
a horrendous way it just feels a little
like mmm okay mmm smells really really
fresh like just that like amazing like
skin care smell that we all love
it feels really tacky and I think we're
ready to dive into foundation all right
now for foundation I'm going to be using
my favorite do your air flash for a
little base now I've been doing this for
ever I love my your air flash now
there's been so many new foundations put
out lately I really have kind of put
this on the back burner for the last few
months and it's sitting there like bitch
why'd you forget about me alright so I
like to apply this by just giving it a
shake and then I like
hold back my hairline and course get the
neck and that is like my little what I
like to call it the base and it can just
sit there for a minute I love the
foundation because you can talk and it
doesn't dry down crazy and you know any
hard to work with now I'm also gonna be
going in with a new foundation that I
discovered at Neiman Marcus this is the
claw radiant cream foundation now this
was a pricey one as well I think this
one was like 120 bucks so if you're like
me I'm kind of there with you you guys
know I love my luxurious makeup but this
is tiny you guys look how tiny this
bottle is like the door one it's like
girl allegedly this is supposed to be
the it has SPF 24 in it why not 25
um and it's just supposed to be
sickening so I'm just going to give this
one a shake and I am just going to apply
a little bit cuz I don't know how you
know I don't know the coverage on this
one yet I'm just going to dot it all
around let's get to blending
all right we are Bowl ended out and I
don't know if it's the foundation or the
primer but whoa a bitch of skin is
looking match I love it now the primer
didn't really minimize the pores too
much in my troublesome area that I hate
but um the skin it looks really really
beautiful it's not too cakey it is full
coverage though which I love but it
doesn't look full coverage if you all
know what I mean let's continue for
concealer I'm going to be going in with
the tarp shaped tape listen I've been
addicted to this ever since I used it I
am such a fan and for everyone that will
be asking I'm shade fair so I think this
is the lightest one they just added some
new shade extensions to the brand and I
love when brands do that so let's just
uh dot some on and see what happens
and of course we're gonna go back in
with our damp Beauty Blender and buff
this all out all right concealer is bull
ended now I'm actually gonna do
something I haven't done before I'm
scared I'm gonna be using the laura
mercier compact translucent but I'm not
until I put on my Mac shimmering white
Studio Fix under the eyes you guys
already know it just applies so
beautifully so I'm just going to pack
this and we are really gonna highlight
those under eyes and also set them at
the same time all right now I'm gonna be
going into with a morphe 3 with that
Laura Mercier and I'm just gonna hit the
spots that I already highlighted so that
chin she's being set baby and then I'm
just gonna hit my under eyes BAM and
that's it put that in your
eye out for the rest of my face I'm
gonna be going in with the same brush
but I'm going to be using a another new
product today so many first today now
the foundation clip ah I love that brand
also have a powder foundation comes in
something like this I'm like what is the
point of that huge brush and this tiny
compact and just so everyone's aware you
had to buy the compact like the whole
unit by itself and then add in this it's
like what in them and remember I'm just
gonna go around the spots that are not
highlighted to fill and see what happens
I gotta say I'm a little mesmerized
right now the skin though this is a
really good combination okay we're
feeling very mannequin or feeling
airbrushed
now let's contour now to chisel out
these cheeks we're going to be going in
with Tarte cosmetics tardes
contour palette and I love this shade it
is a perfect for that carved out bitchy
look and I'm going in with my Surratt
Beauty this is like a blush brush but
the other day I was just playing around
and it really did a nice job with the
cheekbones so what I did was I just kind
of started moving the brush back and
forth in circular motions and it blended
really nicely all right now we're gonna
chisel out this jaw bone and just
lightly go over 3/4 I'm not gonna go all
the way we're just gonna stop right
about here and I love to just take a
little bit of powder and go underneath
the chin in the jaw and just give it a
really defined shadow look like we
carved out of granite pinky and now with
the morphe M 5 to 7 I'm just gonna give
my hairline a little definition because
that's definitely what happened doing
lately and we're just gonna go back and
forth and just create some definition
come on depth and I'm just barely
running this just around the nose a hair
I'm not really gonna contour my nose
crazy today we're just gonna give it a
little just a little moment and because
I have OCD I just can't stop blending
now today for highlighting I might be
going in with the new sleek makeup
highlighter palette you guys know they
make some bomb-ass highlighters so this
palette is called the Cleopatra's kiss
and there are two powder highlighters
and
two cream now this one it looks to be
really really gold and I listen you know
you you guys know I love my pinks in my
silver tone highlights but the gold
though let's bring it back a second
we're gonna go old-school everyone was
like how did you get that gold cheek in
the
I live video this and I mix another one
of course you guys know a bit change is
gonna wear one so I'm gonna be going in
with that more feet 510 and we're just
gonna BAM put this right where my
contour and my oh girl look at that
bitch what hmm uh-huh we're gonna put
that right where the contour and the
highlight me now this color is a little
dark for my skin tone but because of the
contour I don't mind it it is by lining
like you guys see that you guys see that
 cheek oh and of course we're
gonna take that almost into my
eye and just go up now of course we
can't forget the Cupid's bow and we're
gonna get that nose because it's time
it's time for the nose I want it to look
like a lighthouse cute now I
guess it's time for another highlighter
now I'm gonna be going in with the Oprah
Rodeo Drive highlighter this one is
super gold like literally listen
like if a mummy's in a sarcophagus this
is the color of its
because this is blinding now do I
need to use two highlighters no this one
is bull lining on its own but if you're
a sick twisted bitch like I am let's get
to packing took a gold rush on my face
like it's so blinding okay we're down
with the look good night the
highlighting is done now I'm quickly
gonna draw on some brows off-camera
let's get some benefit could Brown get
to work alright the browser snatch come
on brows um I get so many questions
about the brows so I'm gonna do a full
tutorial um of how I do everything I
shave them off if you don't know about
my brows go check out my Howard's I
might make my high school video for a
quick laughs now let's get to the makeup
all right we're going to be taking this
busy art eyeshadow palette and this
shade in here
mmm this cream color it is perfect for
under the brow and the entire lid now
this look today does not involve any eye
primer this is kind of gonna be our
primer and we're just gonna put this
right under the brow bone and drag it
all the way down
all right we are done with this part now
this eye look it's so simple you guys
I'm about to blow your mind because and
simple is easy um this is an everyday
quick little go to eye look
so for that sparkly wet type of a look
that I did I know everyone is like what
the hell did you use I used a little
synthetic brush and then I actually used
these Stila Magnificent metals if you've
never tried them what are you waiting
for
they are everything now they are a bunch
of shades um I used metallic dusty rose
the other day now these also are
supposed to be good with applying with
your finger when your nails are this
long hmm it's a little more difficult
but hey I'm just gonna try so what I
normally do if you don't have any nails
this is a lot easier if you do have
nails um well we'll do this together so
I'm just going to take this and
literally Pat it on my lid and this
formula is unreal it gives your eye a
wet sort of metallic look now of course
if your nails are 3 inches long and you
can't get inside your eye that's where
the brush comes handy and I like to just
take this guy and wet the brush
literally a tiny bit mac fix+
and we are just going to go back in with
this guy and grab some product oh you
see that you see it in we're just gonna
go directly on and I'm only gonna take
this up to the crease area I'm not gonna
bring it any higher now it can look a
little chunky but if you move the brush
around it does spread the product and it
gives you a nice little Terminator
effect all right we're done with this
guy now for the most hardest part just
kidding this is really simple we're just
going to take a little blending brush
and we're gonna go into the mani mua
makeup geek palette and we're going to
dip into Sora and beaches and cream
come on combination the best crease
combination ever all you're going to do
is take this and you're going to go
right in that crease and you're just
going to blend now if any of the silver
move
you can move it right back but we're
just going to keep this really simple
and gorgeous today and that's really it
it is a really simple and that white
eyeshadow that we already put down for a
base is really going to help this blend
out and just really blend nicely
together so I'll just take this light
shade beaches and cream on one more time
and we're just going to kind of drag up
and away
SOTA has that really nice airbrushed
finish that we all love in a door BAM
all right now that the little brown
moment is in the crease that we're
almost done we're going to take my
favorite liner for the waterline this is
a color pops honey dude and we're just
gonna pop that right in there voila
I love the shade it really opens the eye
without looking too intense if you are
afraid of any white liner so this is
perfect and it's five dollars so I think
everyone needs this in their kit now
this look is almost over you guys all we
gotta do is lashes so of course you know
a bitch ain't gonna go anywhere without
her benefit or roller lash mascara my
tried and true baby so we're just gonna
pop this on and get some lashes on
all right mascara is done now before I
do some lashes I'm just gonna go into
shade Artemis or right here and I'm just
gonna add a tiny bit right in here just
a little pop with something still a
sentence then you really don't need the
step but it's just gonna add a little
extra flare and who doesn't want that
now I know I just use Artemis eyeshadow
but there's also a lash brand called
Artemis and they make really dope lashes
and I had someone do my makeup for my
lip ammo shoe shoutout to Anthony what's
up girl and he used this on me and this
style is called a mistaken identity love
that name and this is what I was wearing
in the video the other day so let's pop
these on and I'll be right back all
right
lashes are on now all we need to do guys
is lips and we're about done so for lips
today we're going to be bold we're going
to be dramatic we're going to be
naturally classic and we're going to go
with a red of course so I'm going to be
using the Joey a lip cream and shade
Brooke hey now these are liquid to matte
lipsticks so yummy and let's see what
this looks like
oh this color though this color
oh I'm obsessed with it um I love this
brand because these lip creams are a
very lightweight
feels like nothing's on there um another
big fan and look I'm like do I need one
lip or do any to lips they also have a
lip topper and they have two shades this
is a new one called tan lines and you
just put it right over the liquid lips
so you definitely can stop here you do
not need a lip topper but you kind of do
no but you really don't you don't even
need lashes for this look if you want to
just take off the last shoes and do a
glossy nude lip you definitely can I
think for this type of moment any lip
whether it's black blue or nude or red
um it flows it works so we're just gonna
see how this looks real quick a hardly
smells so good and let's see what
happens
hmm okay
uh-huh wow you guys hmm this is pretty
dope I almost think you don't need to do
the top lip it looks kind of cool with
this dimension maybe I'll dodge it's a
little in the middle one definition mm
ah okay I'm not gonna do the entire
thing I want to just live and have a
moment this is not a necessity but maybe
it is okay I'm not gonna do the outer
edges I'm gonna kind of keep it living
in the moment so it's very like and what
do we need we need some setting
spray all right now for setting spray
I'm gonna go in with the dermablend set
and refresh let's get to it
okay all right this look is complete all
right you guys this is the final final
final ah final look and I am loving it
this lip girl I'm obsessed so I just
kind of want to do a quick a recap of
the video because I know I used a lot of
stuff that I've never used before so
this Sicily double tensio primer was it
worth it I gotta be honest you guys my
skin like let me get out of combat my
skin looks really really snatched like
the foundation just settled amazing on
my skin like I'm like a really huge fan
now of course this is the first time
I've ever used it so I think I'm gonna
go to dinner later and see how
everything wears anything changes um but
I'm a huge fan and then this powder
foundation hmm and where's the
where's the foundation even though this
little bottle what makes me want to slap
the brand um
these two combined with this now I know
it's a little astronomical and you're
all gonna read me to fill but these
three not saying it's the Holy Grail yet
but let me you know wear this throughout
the week and um see what happens but um
as always thank you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
