channel now today we're going to be
doing something a little unique I
normally don't review products but I'm
like listen I spend thousands of dollars
a month on makeup personally now I know
a lot of youtubers and instagramers get
sent a lot of free product which I do
get my fair share but I also spend a lot
of money on products because you all
know Dior and Tom hoarding sending this
bitch a damn thing so um I was googling
the world's most expensive foundation
the other day and this popped up and I'm
like okay if you've never heard a lot
free before I have used their skincare
in the past some of the stuff is a hit
some of its a Miss so I'm like let's see
what this is all about when you look at
a price tag for a foundation I know
everyone watching is like $200 that
I agree with you but if it works we'll
see now this is the Lawry's skin caviar
foundation and let's open this up
this has a concealer also on the top so
the packaging is unique and then it has
a big thing on the bottom with all the
foundation and we open it it has a
little spatula thing okay now I was
looking at the weight and the grams of
how much product is in this because the
packaging is a little weird it looks
kind of small so I compared it with like
a Kat Von D foundation and it's actually
the same amount of product so that was
cool so I did some research and I saw
that a few other youtubers had recently
used this and I know that Toddie What's
Up Girl shout out to you love you what
we're gonna do and get ready I saw that
Toddie reviewed this and I was like like
gotta try this foundation so when a
foundation has skincare in it there's
added benefits to it obviously right and
then another thing is you know we look
at price tags for a lot of stuff now
when you are a working makeup artist
this is the tax write-off so I know a
lot of people are gonna leave comments
like that's away some money
that I'm with you guys
sometimes but I am a makeup artist I'm a
makeup lover and makeup is my job my
career in my entire
so I love trying out everything I want
to see what everyone else is doing so
we're going to give this the world and
after I tried the foundation I'm going
to normally set it and do my normal day
to day routine I say a lot of people
review this kind of stuff and then then
they'll set it you can't just slather on
foundation and walk outside and expect
it to hold as well as your normal
routine so I am going to be doing like a
more natural a more soft and we're
pretty type of look today so let's get
started to get started we have to
moisturize our skin I'm not about to put
foundation on a bare ass face so my
go-to moisturizer that I use every
morning before I film my videos and what
I've been using for the last five years
is that
lemare softening cream if you haven't
heard of the mayor they're kind of like
la pari now la Prairie and lemare they
both have Elle's in front of their name
so don't get them confused Lemire is an
amazing skincare line I tried lemare
about ten years ago I got a few free
samples at the mall hi free samples and
I was obsessed with it it made my skin
feel like a baby's ass so of course a
lot of people are gonna roll their eyes
at this this is about four hundred and
sixty dollars so if it's not for you
that's fine but this face definitely
needs it so oh so good now I like to
take just a little bit with my fingers
you don't need a lot so another thing is
when I look at price tags I think about
well look at this jar you guys okay
first of all this is a big-ass jar there
is so much product in this this is
probably gonna last me a whole year so I
think you know it's an investment it's
definitely an investment and a lot of
these items are luxury items they're not
for everybody like even before you can
try this foundation I want to make a
disclaimer if you are a normal person
that just works in an office there is no
reason to buy a two hundred dollar
foundation I know that some of my old
clients I would do make a bond would
request expensive stuff for weddings or
events or special occasions so I think
it's fun I don't think you have to you
know talk about someone else
because they want to you know look nice
for a night it's definitely a luxury
item and the skincare girl please when I
was
on someone's couch working at Mac y'all
know I didn't have this now of course
there are other alternatives some
moisturizers there is a million there's
even a dove one at the drugstore that I
use when I travel sometimes that's about
like what $15 whatever works for you you
just gotta find it it's all trial and
error so we're gonna have to soak in for
a second and let's try this foundation
now I normally apply everything with a
Beauty Blender so I figured why not put
it on with one I think that's only
fitting I know a little goes a long way
I shade match myself at Neiman Marcus
this is a perfect match shout out to
Neiman Marcus thank you for shade
matching me no the spatula I don't know
how much product you're supposed to use
I don't want to overdo it and put too
much so let's just kind of start there
and then if we need more we'll leave
more about this might be too much we'll
see but you guys know the drill with
that beauty blender oh wow definitely
going to use more like you guys know MA
foundation junkie I need a lot it seems
like it's really light coverage but then
you look back and you're like oh wow
look at the difference between under
this eye under this I'm ready now I'm
gonna use a little more because I did
not put enough on so we're gonna go back
in there one more time BAM and you all
know it cannot forget that Nik one thing
I have to say right off the bat it
smells so good you guys know sometimes
foundations smell like really crazy and
my girls a trap poison this is blending
like head then now I like to put
foundation on my eyelids as well it's
kind of like my pre primer to the primer
now I'm gonna take it down and cover up
my tattoo it's just a little hair now
for everyone asking the shade that I'm
using today is cream peach if you are
similar and have cool toned light skin
this is definitely good it's hard
sometimes for me to find a foundation
because I'm really pale and I'll end up
taking like a shade darker just because
I can't find mine okay
this is pretty much blended out at first
I'm like try one
more but I really don't need it I'm used
to like cake face and this gives it such
a full coverage but it doesn't look like
it like I wish you guys are in front of
my face right now because I'm like oh my
god
so I guess I am going to start doing the
rest of my makeup and we will see how
this foundation holds up now this does
have a concealer with it so of course
I'm like I gotta use this on top so I'm
just gonna dip my Beauty Blender since
this is just for me oh wow this is a
really thick okay so underneath the eye
oh wow okay oh I used a lot okay we're
gonna put some over on this side so the
foundation I would say is like a medium
to full coverage this concealer
oh she's full coverage she is full and
beautiful any discoloration I had in my
skin is completely gone thank God and I
don't know how this foundation looks
buffed out with a brush but the Beauty
Blender is my favorite applicator for
concealer it just makes it look
beautiful now I like concealers to be a
little lighter than me this one kind of
matches the foundation not that that's a
bad thing I just like to have like a
luminosity under my eyes so I definitely
would want a little lighter shade but
the coverage is beautiful okay now
before I powder the face I definitely
want to set this and I'm gonna be using
my Laura Mercier translucent powder so
let's set into the eyes quickly before
it's too late
now I love using the damp Beauty Blender
as you guys know if you've never tried
this trick you're missing out because
the powder literally melts right into
your skin
okay okay okay now for powder all over
the face I'm gonna be using my
Giorgio Armani luminous silk powder
compact I love you guys know luminous
look foundation is my go to the powder
though ooh it's like such a good combo
so I'm just gonna dust this around some
parts of the face this might be my new
favorite combo I'm like damn foundation
is done now let's start finishing the
look before a contour I'm going to give
my lips a little bit of moisture and I'm
gonna be using my jeffree star cosmetics
the lower lip scrub in flavor strawberry
if you've never used a lip scrub before
girl you don't got to use mine any lip
scrub you can even make some at home
mine are vegan cruelty-free and actually
edible some brands you can't eat is they
got petroleum which is made out of bone
char thank you so I am just going to rub
some on is now the cool thing about this
is edible and if you are twisted and
sick like me you can just lick off the
dead skin hmmm I'm full all right now
for contour I'm not gonna do as severe
as I normally would and I'm gonna be
using that Kat Von D shade + light I'm
gonna take this map one two now a little
blush brush and I'm just gonna dab in
the contour normally you guys know I
like a severe harsh bitchy cheekbone not
today we're gonna go all natural so when
I'm doing this I'm gonna start this
right here and I'm just gonna really
lightly go down the cheekbones and I'm
not gonna do it as severe as I normally
would where I take it all the way down
we are being so light handed today it's
scary I'm like am I even doing makeup
this feels weird that's going to be the
extent of my contour now normally I
bring it way far down not today I'm
doing the most basic contour I've ever
done in my life and now I'm into a
little bit on the jaw line using the
NARS little contour brush the IDA brush
called Yuta Ida fold some but I
love this one because it really gets in
there and it's like Dario what's up
bones you chiseled now and I'm just
creating some depth and shadow I like to
take it even under my jawline and bring
it down for that extra effect and then
I'm gonna go with another NARS brush the
little kabuki one and I'm gonna take the
light shade in the palette and I'm just
going to just a little bit over it
diffuse it down alright next step the
brows to get that blonde signature
Geoffrey drawn eyebrow I love to use my
uh Nastasia if I really Hills brow Wiz
and the dip brow this is how I achieve
my brows almost everyday unless I'm
doing a different color so I am just
going to draw these on
now that the brows are sketched out I'm
going to be taking a little brush I
found at Walgreens it was like a 99
cents it's so thin and the solute I use
every day to get ready and I'm just
going to use the dip brow very sparingly
I love this because a little goes a long
way and for the pencil I'm shade taupe
and for this I'm going to be blonde
today so let's get these going another
reason I don't talk a lot while I'm
doing my brows because I'm usually
holding my breath and just seeing a
silent prayer to Jesus so let's do this
together
alright now obviously there's really
nothing natural about me but we're gonna
do some natural makeup and I'm gonna be
using my busy art basic 0/1 matte
palette now clearly uh these have been
abused and used so I'm gonna go in with
that cream color and that light one and
we're just going to go back and forth
and I'm using my of course Mac two five
two brush and I'm just gonna coat my
entire lid all the way to the brow with
that color all right now this look is a
really simple it's like almost done so
I'm going to be using this tomforde
cream color for the eyes this is shade
platinum this is so pretty now if I just
want to go out real quick I use this I
love it it is exactly what it is it's
the cream color so I'm gonna use a
little synthetic Mac - one seven brush
I'm just gonna dip in there that's it
already like you barely dip in and
you're good so I like to create a little
bronze II will call a little bronzing
you know JLo moment and I'm just going
to take that cream and put it all across
my lid so I am just taking this across
my lid and just moving it around now
this is a really soft bronzy color
really complimentary to blonde hair and
since I'm a blonde this week I'm gonna
use it so you see the difference I mean
it's it's not much and that's the fact
we want and the reason why I love these
little creams because you can easily
blend them out once you have that that
lighter shade already down it just
really creates a nice little little
moment on your socket we
Braun's down now I'm really not gonna do
much else except add some shimmer and a
little depth under my eyes this is the
most simple look you will ever see me do
so now I'm gonna be taking Kat Von D's a
thunderstruck eyeshadow and I'm gonna be
just doing at my inner corners nothing
crazy nothing dramatic and one brush do
I want to use today let's do that morphe
507 brush that little detailer and
everyone loves to use this product wet
so let me be on the Tran and wet this
little brush now if you've never tried
these metal crush eyeshadows oh my god
they are intense so I'm just going to
take this and put it right in my inner
corner now if this doesn't look like an
alien's landed on your eyeball then you
didn't want the brush properly see
already it's like whew
I tell you guys these shadows aren't
playing I want extreme pigment if a
brand's eye shadows don't make me cry
from how pretty they are they go
immediately in the trash okay so I'm
gonna also bring it down a little bit
here you really want to get in there now
we are going to go back into our busy
art palette and I'm gonna be taking this
shade and this shade like a chocolate
and topi and I'm just gonna really
lightly I'm actually gonna use the same
brush BAM and I'm just gonna dip in
there really softly because these eye
shadows show up really easy and I'm
gonna take it right under my eye I'm
gonna start in the middle and I'm just
gonna go right under there feels so
weird putting on this soft of the look I
just want to like sameer all over now
for a little added dimension I will dip
into this gray color barely barely just
add a little bit more BAM and I'm just
gonna sweep that under the eye see to me
that's already too much I might diffuse
it a little I just want to kind of get
it in there now we're going to go back
with a brush for the cream and just kind
of go over that darkness now I told
myself we're gonna be really natural
here so I'm going to take a Beauty
Blender and I'm actually gonna buff off
some of that black
look at me my hand was like no bitch
you're going back to your old ways now I
got these new Mac pencils they are
called modern twist aligner and this
shade is called polar ice it's supposed
to stay in your waterline for up to six
hours or eight hours who really knows
we're gonna see it right now so I'm just
gonna put this white right in the
waterline I love white because it really
opens the eye all right now to complete
this look we're gonna add a little bit
of on a stop Sia's pink champagne on my
lid and I'm gonna use that same two one
seven brush just lightly dip in I need
to get like ten more these because this
is my favorite shimmer so I'm just going
to take it right in the center and it's
really not gonna be too drastic I just
want a little bit of pop in there an
extra little hmm and that's it now I'm
gonna be using my trusty benefit roller
lash and we're gonna coat our entire
bottom and top lashes and get through
this storm
all right
and I think mascara is so essential for
this look because just makes your eyes
go like biome it just really completes
it so this is the softest makeup you'll
probably ever see me wear the only thing
that's left for me is highlighting which
come on we're not gonna not highlight
I'd rather like drop dead I found a lot
of highlighters that I bought because
they look pretty and I never wore them
who else has done that like I'll see
something pretty and I'm like oh my god
like the pan is so pretty I don't want
to use it what the it's gonna
expire a few years about I'll use it now
so this is the illuminating powder
mosha dip youth day from Chanel this is
came out like a few years ago so I'm
just going to use my morphe five-10
brush as always and we're just gonna
sadly have to ruin this pan one now
highlighting is really essential for
this natural look you can even tone down
the eyes and just do like a little liner
if you wanted to and skip the extra
shadow but highlighting is key here so I
am going to go back a little and just
kind of just kind of Judaea and I love
to layer a few times so it's like extra
balling in this look is all about the
glow and you guys know keepeth bow now I
also like to take a little eye shadow
brush get in there
and I'll go right under my brow just
kind of halfway in to give it a little
extra like tiny little bit of extra nest
when a bitch says why are you late why
are you always late it's the extra nests
what else can we highlight my entire
body I think the pan will cover it I
think we're just gonna do a little here
go do it there's a little tiny bit it's
a little peep and now lastly we got the
lips now I want to be really soft and
pretty so I'm going to be using that YSL
nude beige lipstick first so let's put
that on bottom parts done whole mouth
done that was like what two seconds
alright now to top this off and I'm
gonna be using this Revlon lip gloss and
shade sky pink I love this gloss to put
over any nude because it just gives it
that little pinky cute moment
come on lips alright the lips are dead
and now for setting spray I'm gonna
shock you all and use my mac fix+ this
is the lavender flavor and I
of this because it just gives you a
little something subtle it's not too
crazy let that settle in all right guys
this look is complete after filming this
look I just looked in the mirror and the
foundation is beautiful
now obviously has not been 10 hours I
will update you guys on snapchat and
Twitter about how the foundation stayed
and I will talk about it in my next
video so I am really loving this I know
the price tag is a little absurd but for
someone like me who is always gonna be
an HD and on camera I am really loving
this it is just gorgeous it's almost
like a second skin while still looking
like medium to full coverage so I'm like
hmm I'm have to wear this all week and
give it a whirl so as always if you love
this video replay it again and have your
husband jack off to it also give me a
thumbs up and I will see you guys on the
next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
