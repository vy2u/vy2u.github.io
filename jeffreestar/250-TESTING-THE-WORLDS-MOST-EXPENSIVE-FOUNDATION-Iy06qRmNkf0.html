channel oh my god okay so I do this
thing where I search late at night for
new makeup products to try out for you
guys and of course you guys highly
request a lot of stuff as well so I
really appreciate when you guys show me
some crazy ass shit
the other day I was scrolling on
neimanmarcus.com now Neiman's always has
some crazy luxury shit and I stumble
across a brand that I tried out on my
channel a few times they are called clay
Depot and they put out a 250 dollar
foundation I'm like oh my god so I was
back on my channel and I'm like what is
the most expensive foundation I've ever
tried and about a year ago so if you've
been following and subscribed for a
minute you know about this already
I reviewed the laferrari skin caviar
foundation which is this guy right here
I will link this down below if you want
to watch it now this at the time was
about like 200 to 225 dollars it was a
foundation that also had a concealer on
top so it's kind of like you get two
products for one so I feel like okay
this brand over here that I'm about to
review just stole the show and came out
with the world's most expensive
foundation I'm like oh so of course you
know my bougie ass has to try it I did
order three shades a no shocker here
because you know I'm not trying to match
myself with one shade online with a
little circle swatch that probably
doesn't even look like the damn thing
also I wanted to remind all of my East
Coast subscribers that on September 9th
and September 10th I will be the main
makeup sponsor at RuPaul's Drag Con and
is a huge convention if you haven't
heard of it check it out and my brand
will be there I will be there Mannie and
Laura will also be at my booth we're all
doing meet-and-greets and you can shop
my entire collection so everything will
be linked down below if you want to look
at tickets and of course I do have a
discount code for the event for you guys
and so that will be everything will be
linked down below as usual so I really
can't wait to be back in New York
alright let's jump into it okay so what
are the world's most expensive
foundation look like well the box looks
something like this it is a nice gold
kind of brush
metal-looking feel it is very is big
this is a big box to our foundation I
will say that it feels like a break like
it feels heavy which is great because
the inside better be good now this is
called the foundation all right I mean
look what that parts pouring do you even
need a catchy name I don't even think
you do
so this foundation does have an SPF of
21 in it which is great because mama
don't like the Sun now let's open her up
and see what the hell is going on in
here now it does have the shade names on
top so I did get three now I also
reviewed I know you guys were but I also
reviewed a clay Jo post on nation a
while ago and added a foundation battle
versus what in wild and I reviewed this
guy right here and in a lot of you were
making jokes because the foundation was
so small now this one is from the same
brand and this one was a hundred and
twenty which I thought was insane I
liked it I wasn't the biggest fan of it
and it didn't even have an ounce of
product it's like 0.87 ounces is in here
and I'm like for that price point bitch
are you out of your mind
so when you open this up this is what
you get now I have been saving this for
on camera I have not even peeked inside
yet oh wow okay I don't want to fall out
so there is a looks like an instruction
manual and then we have let's take that
out oh my god this is stick you guys
like a damn book okay so it comes with
this and it comes with a spatula I'm
going to assume to scoop out the product
because it is in a jar and it you want
to be sanitary of course and then it
comes with this oh wow this is like a
kerlick looking plate looks like really
like a diamond cut it type of little
moment and then after all of that to
peel this back and wow here is the
foundation okay so I'm just going to say
it right now this is heavy it feels like
a weight like this shit is heavy alright
so you guys see it has this kind of like
glass acrylic type of feel to it this is
the lid and this part is kind of like a
frosted moment you can see through it
when you zoom in
and it just says the foundation on it
nothing much to say huh oh okay so I'm
just looking down at my table so this is
like a look your foundation gets its own
little moment look it can sit and have
its own little seat and then I'm going
to assume this goes in here so let's
just open this up while we while we're
here so your foundation not only gets
its own furniture it gets a spatula with
a little holder look at oh it's right in
there BAM
all right you guys so I think it's time
to read the instructions and try it on
all right so here is the long list that
it has to I guess put on the makeup what
it's supposed to do oh my god this is
like the longest list I have ever seen
for a foundation before so let's dive
into it I am not about to read this
whole thing let me just skim through the
highlights here so this foundation
allegedly has a innovative formula that
instantly fails at your complexion with
moisture and promotes more beautiful
skin over time so maybe this house
luxury skincare in it that's kind of
what it's saying here this foundation
encourages a heightened sense of beauty
today and beyond girl did someone that
write books write this damned pamphlet
so let's go over the highlights of what
this is going to do this is going to
work to reduce the appearance of damage
caused by environmental stress we all
got that hunting it is going to have a
smooth texture it is going to there's a
lot here you guys it is going to provide
a finely textured finish without looking
powdery it is going to promote the
appearance of firmness and resilience a
foundation is going to do that for me
girl it is going to infuse my skin with
moisture it is going to give it read
texturing effects let's continue to use
it is going to enhance my skin with
softness and suppleness it is going to
reduce visible signs of dryness it is
formulated with rose essence that
inspires a feeling of elegance and
luxury hold on you guys
mommy needs a break I'm like
all right so before we read on how we're
supposed to apply it lets go in with
some primer so I'm going to use my
Sicily double Atencio primer this is
$120 so if we're going to be trying out
of bougie ass foundation let's just go
in for the kill with this one this is
actually amazing I know a lot of people
have tried it since I have used it I
went to the store in Vegas a while back
with Tati and our get ready in my
private jet video and the people at the
store in Vegas were like girl the sales
on this have been up since you've been
using it and I was like happy but no
that's really cool that so many people
have been trying it because of me the
price point it's fucking stupid but
fucking work
all right so we're going to let that
soak into the skin for a minute now
let's get out our book again and to use
apply the foundation following skincare
or the application of a pre makeup base
we just did using the spatula provided
applied foundation to five points
forehead nose chin and cheeks great to
smooth the foundation over your cheeks
with two or three circular motions
working upward and outward until evenly
blended that's kind of confusing am I
only allowed to do one to three motions
and it's supposed to be good or until
evenly blended well obviously I'm going
to probably do like a hundred brushes so
it's a lot less complete the application
by smoothing condition over your
forehead and nose and around eyes and
mouth girl I'm going to put the
foundation over my whole damn face
obviously my ears my ass my fucking
teeth Synovus gang okay so the
foundation I've tried from them before
was in shade B 20 so I got B 20 in this
one as well doesn't mean it's going to
be the exact match but we are going to
try it out alright so when you open this
foundation you get this and I'm like oh
my god what the hell it is actually
sealed which is great for sanitary
purposes but it looks like it's filled
to the brim which I love so I forgot to
mention that this foundation actually
has one fluid out unlike their other one
that not even a fluid ounce I'm like
bitch okay woah it is filled to the brim
so the foundation a lot of it is on the
little thing this is probably like what
$50 worth on here so it also looks like
this inside and you know I got to do a
smell test everyone clear my palate very
floral but it has that like luxury skin
care like scent under it which is nice
it's not like overpowering where the
floral makes you want to like throw up
it's pretty nice so we'll just try a
little bit on my face and see what
happens I'm a little scared like is that
too much I don't know I mean I guess I'm
just going to take the brush I'm just
going to use this little Lancome brush
and let's see what the hell is about to
happen
okay and we're blending we're blending
oh wow that is really sheer for how much
I put on and it's glossy so as to be
like matte esque but look at that it's
like huh my skin looks like it has life
though I'm not mad at it okay let me put
some on my forehead and a little bit
more on my face so let's see what
happens okay there is the second layer
on this part of my face there's a little
bit on my forehead I think it's only
fair that I put a little bit more on my
forehead just like I did on the face so
we'll do that it's not like looking
cakey at all even with a second layer
it's looking very lifelike all right now
while that dries let me just hit my neck
a little bit
all right so now let's take the little
mirror
oh I'm looking the monitor and like yeah
you see a little discoloration in here
and then you turn here it's like oh this
is like a very like it almost looks dewy
like not almost it does look dewy it is
a WoW I'm like kind of shocked right now
I'm like my face looks like really shiny
does it not I like a more of a full
coverage matte look so I'm not sure how
to feel about this yet it is like very
sheer something medium to full on the
website but I don't know I'm like doing
a lot of it or hate I can't figure it
out yet okay let's take a damp Beauty
Blender sponge and apply it to this side
of my face alright so there is the first
layer with the Beauty Blender and my
face looks like the whole thing is
glowing now definitely I don't even
think it's medium light coverage to me
because I have a little pimple here and
you can definitely really see it so I'm
going to do a second layer and see what
happens all right so now that I'm zoomed
in on myself with the mirror I am
pleasantly surprised at how like shiny
this looks when I'm looking at the
monitor I don't necessarily mind it but
up close it is really shiny and I'm
going to take like a dry clean hand and
when you touch it it feels a little
tacky like it almost feels like the
primer which is weird because normally
foundation when it dries does not really
feel that tacky so yeah you can feel it
on your face when you touch with your
hand but right now it feels very like
lightweight like I really don't think
there's anything on my face right now
which is nice we are going to do
check-ins later in this video I have an
event I'm going to later so I will be
bringing my vlog camera again so many of
you really liked it when I did it a week
or two ago in the laura mercier video so
much you know why let me try to do it
again so I am going to do some concealer
contour foundation I'm going to actually
do my entire makeup because I do have to
go out tonight
and then we will really see how this
looks but right now before I do anything
else
it's very share like I like a full mask
and one that when they said medium on
the website I expected medium and I
don't know
this is teetering on the verge of sheer
and medium I'm not mad at it it did have
to put two layers ok I'm not living and
I'm not hating either I'm just kind of
like maybe not used to this type of
finish but like on me I'm just telling
ok now that this have a lot of
anti-aging and crazy stuff in it is
allegedly supposed to do so I think it's
only fair that we do some concealing and
some light powder just to really see how
this wear is so let's get into it
so I'm going to go in with the new Dior
skin forever concealer this is a I think
this just actually just came out I think
oh yeah if you just once I'm like do I
think you know I do when you review a
lot of products you guys sometimes you
forget I'm like try this I think this
one drives quick so I'm just going to do
my under eyes and then do the rest in a
second look just use this and see what
happens
all right so that actually blended
really nice over my foundation now we
all know sometimes when you put products
on top of another product they just
don't mix well together but overall this
concealer is great but I almost wish it
was a lot almost I do wish it was
lighter so if an some Dior's watching
make a lighter concealer please okay so
I'm going to take this and do a little
bit here we are going to just do a
little under my contour today we're
going to brighten the stand face up
honey all right this is a blended to
perfection now I am going to set it with
a little bit of my bougie-ass setting
powder from Allah Mayor of course this
is the powder one of my favorites of the
year so far and let's send this
concealer of course you guys know we're
going to use a damp Beauty Blender dip
into that powder and have it melt into
our skin now if you guys have been
following along we are we have now used
the foundation and now the powder so if
you can't remember these product names
that I put down the pipe
all right so I am going to go finish the
rest of my face I'm going to do
literally everything full glam tonight
and then I will check in and let's see
how the hell the foundation is wearing
all right guys it has been about two
hours since I have put on the foundation
of course I finished my entire face and
I've been outside for a minute
and look at my phone so if it is 88
degrees Farenheit here it was like 90 95
degrees like it a few hours ago but the
Sun is finally setting it is now 6:35

then head on over to Manny's house we

my review hahahahahaha okay you guys I
know what's up my eyes you out
okay so I know most of you out there
watching you don't want to hear this but
the 250 dollar foundation actually works
and thank God because if it didn't work
I was ready to scream and I'm wearing
the wet and wild highlighter by the way
you guys I'm obsessed with it but yeah
it really didn't break at all and I did
not touch up my makeup like a normally
open my compact throughout the night I
would touch up my nose in my forehead
but I really didn't not really I didn't
at all tonight so I think for no
touch-ups I'm really not even shiny like
I know the foundation had that initial
glow but I'm a little shocked aren't you
guys so the foundation from Plato Poe
his Jefferson are approved I didn't want
you guys I didn't want to but it work I
