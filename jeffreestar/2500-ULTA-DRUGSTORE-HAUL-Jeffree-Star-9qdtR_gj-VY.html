all right we are back in the studio I
have some makeup on now so I don't look
like I'm dying and I got so many items

point was to get enough products to do a
full space of Maybelline and also a full
face of NYX now which video do you guys
want to see first I'm going to leave a
pin comment down below and just sound
off and let me know if you want to see
Maybelline first or NYX regardless I'm
going to film both over the next few
weeks but I want to hear what you guys
mutters so I am just going to open up
the first bag my lord now a Nathan help
me unwrap all this stuff because so much
of it has plastic on it and like so I'm
just going to dive in here and let's see
what the hell we got the cool thing
about this is I really haven't played
with most of these products you know you
guys know I am a luxury brand whore but
I have been diving into a lot of
drugstore stuff lately and a lot of it
is like amazing I feel like when I was
younger and I was falling in love with
makeup the drugstore products overall in
the formulas they were a little scarring
they were not good I remember being in
like ninth grade it's like stealing yeah
I just steal I did still make from the
dark storm which I do not advise on ever
doing oh my god anyway so back in the
day when I was when I was like really
getting into makeup a lot of the stuff
in the drugstore I was like girl but all
of a sudden the last few years they have
really stepped it up and I am in shock
so I'm just going to dive in here this
is the first bag oh my god is so heavy
let's just pull up the first thing and I
see the now I kind of separated the bags
for my Maybelline NYX and random stuff I
got the perfume as well so this is the
where boosting setting spray and master
fix okay now come on setting spray whore
right here so I cannot wait to try this
out girl I know this isn't even the
fuckin tutorial but hmm okay girl
Maybelline has so many like space
product now I got a bunch of like
everything so we have the classic
Maybelline fit me matte poreless
foundation now and I tweeted that I was
going to buy maybelline stuff I asked
you all what do you recommend so many of
you said this formula so I can't wait to
try it
now a lot of stuff I got like
different shades so I'm sure a lot of
you saw that price at the end of the
receipt and you were like oh but here's
the deal I can't swatch and test
everything in the store so I got like
you know if I'm gonna get a foundation I
got like three of these each also got
the dream cushion liquid foundation on
the go okay I'm not really into cushion
foundation but I want to start trying
more because so many brands have them
out now so definitely be on the lookout
for that what does it guy here Matt or
list powder thank God and then we have
the master contour oh my god my first
ever drugstore video from like a year
and a half ago I use this it's actually
amazing I donated it to a woman shelter
like a year ago so I'm glad to have it
back I literally tried it once then I
was like you know what I'm so much
makeup girl we have the setting and
perfecting loose powder more dream
cushion and then I think are these new
that fit me blushes so they have a whole
fit me line is obviously what I'm
finding out here and then what do we
have here ooh color contour lips palette
let's open her up girls so means there
we go okay so this is always this is
literally like lipsticks are in here I
can I want to touch one is that weird
let's use the brush okay let's just dive
into one of these we'll see what happens
by pendulo slot right here oh okay color
payoff that's not bad
now with these I like to do like a lip
liner and then fill it in and these work
amazing oh my god there's more fascia
okay everyone was sad bitch if you go
tie the baby skin primer we're going to
slap you across your mouth and then they
have something that is called the dream
velvet soft matte hydrating foundation
how the fuck am I going to do a tutorial
with all these foundations I'm an
athletic tried them out like throughout
the year because there's so many
formulas I'm like Maybelline slow it
down now what else do we got here
we got more of EG fairies now where did
I say earlier so many lululu you guys
all requested and gave me the advice to
get the instant age rewind eraser circle
Laura Lee said that this is very similar
to the curse shaped cape obviously we'll
see about that because this is one of my
favorite formulas but I'm excited in
look another applicator okay we also got
so many eyeshadow palettes the 24-karat
news their graffiti nudes I'm like watch
one of these was already chaos don't
fucking shiny honey
now eyeshadows in the drugstore even
high-end like Tom Ford it comes with
these little applicators I never use
them but this blue one is speaking to my
soul as their names on this you know
names okay I mean it's cute it's not
sure like I'll be really honest
obviously my hand is my hand isn't
primer or anything like I would do with
my lid but just pretty okay and then
just because I really want to try this
pink I'm like dying and let's see what
happens
hmm I mean that ain't bad these two
together would be kind of cute let's
move on great laughs my grandma was
using this when I was a baby I used to
wear this like in high school definitely
in high school this is my thing and I
haven't honestly like health entities in
so long
I love how thick the bristle is it's
like good morning now you guys internal
like we talked because there's so many
things here so if you're like girls slow
it down I can't okay we also got the
primer base this is supposed to oh the
master prime Buller and smooth which you
know I'm all down for that
we got more blushes like like a little
peachy brown one
now I also got the Big Shot mascara you
know Manny MUA was in that commercial it
appeared in front of all my videos for
the last few months and I never tried it
am i horrible friend no life has been so
busy I had I really honestly haven't any
time but whew this applicator reminds me
of like Dior show mascara
okay so Laura recommended that I get
these color tattoo I Chrome

amazing on the lid so I just want to
swatch on my hand real quick
ooh that has like a lot of pigment look
and so pretty I just want to pop that
like right there I got a bunch of those
colors but I will of course try this owl
and then Laura also reminded be 24 hour

mess but definitely has a lot of payoffs
I could be like a right on the lid on
