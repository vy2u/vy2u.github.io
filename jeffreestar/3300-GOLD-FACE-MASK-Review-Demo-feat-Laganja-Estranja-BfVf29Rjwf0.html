actually a lip gloss from bite Beauty
look how stunning this gold is son I
can't get over and the shade is called
gold Oh creative okay no creative
choices okay I love this brand no
they're really cool and this is a cream
lip gloss it feels I mean we'll see how
it looks when I'm talking I mean it
literally looks like liquid glitter is
laid on your lips is it yeah okay now
besides the lips we're about to do some
skincare now we've gotten ready so many
times together I'm like you know what
let's just chill and yeah let's be nice
to ganja for once now they're riding a
bumpy car or holding here there's always
some challenge over here like Fear
Factor shit well this might be even
scarier than the car no this looks love
I did my last first impressions I asked
hey if there's any crazy shit out there
that you guys want me to try
send me some links I'm sure you got some
crazy shit I got a lot of stuff now the
internet is flooded with so many new
things I clicked around and I found this
brand called adore cosmetic adore I
thought this was supposed to be my
moment did you just have her on your
channel it's her secret site project a
secret cyber bulgar leave it to a door
to have a secret 24 karat gold yeah I
project she was uh-huh now this is a
brand
that everything's expensive there is a
sister from Miami Florida work okay
local okay now USA
yes exactly they okay all right so now
for $3,300 which is the most expensive
base mask I have ever fucking bought my
life
that's a fucking feet that's a gig yeah
I did a thousand dollar moisturizer
which was crazy but this is a whole
level of extra miss so this is doing the
most so but the cool thing is it comes
in this beautiful white leather suitcase
to get it for your mouth with this
beautiful gold detailing and when you
open it up you see your Hannibal Lecter
mask 24 karat gold yes so this is 24
karat and it comes with 12 so okay which
is not too bad so like that's like 275
dollars and I like totally did not
calculate that before though yes you
better fucking now it comes with this
crazy booklet now instructions galore
yes now what is this um masks old golden
touch 24k techno dermis facial mask oh
that sounds like a DJ's name that's
right got a touchscreen dermefface
scared so basically this pure 24 karat
gold calms and equalizes electra
electrical energy of the skin in the
most delicate areas of the face
absorbing down to your skin's carotene
level to help halt all the come and oh i
was a cut right to halt the elastin
break down okay escorts Backpage an ESCO
at escorts oxygen molecules to the
cellular level for deep renewal and
slows down melanin secretion to diminish
age spots and celebration what kind of
your sin is the crit your skin is
secreting i mean that's a i think you're
done that if you guys this summer
it also has lavender in it of course the
of course it does i say shows yeah um
and then it's gonna
vitalize our skin with the boost of age
defying ingredients to help you look and
feel your most radiant yes well you know
when I feel my most radiant when you
smoke some gotcha yes God Cheers
I want you to have green sincere ah
you're visiting the house okay out of
the little ice-cream job gigs nice round
all right you guys so is there
instructions for this I'm scared oh
there is I mean girl peel it off and put
it on your face right yeah take the mask
out of the packaging put on your face
and relax there you go leave on for 15
minutes Oh usually once every four weeks
Earl why I set you up for a month baby
so you hit me up in a year I will do the
legs on that again okay so wait so if
every mask you're not supposed to do it
once a month
everywhere we go so that's I'm Glen blue
oh look this says use every four weeks
so that's basically once a month yeah so
you buy this whole thing and this last
you a year oh this is really reasonable
okay yeah okay so we smell them you
should just a normal like the glam glow
silver mask you can do a few times a
week right
but this see I used to do no masks I
didn't believe in them I thought all you
girls were extra over here but you know
once you got me onto the Beauty Blender
I said you know what I'm gonna just
start trying all these things you
suggested and Alyssa totally got me on
the glam glow I love I think it's such a
good product your pores are kind of gone
but I'm just saying I just like it
because let's be real I look cute on
Instagram and I look like ten man and
they work which is grand they were and
they were just super cool which is nice
so do you know I'm thinking like okay
this is an investment but if it really
works if it really works it might be a
whole year know that that's what I see I
haven't even obviously the first
impressions I haven't even open to see
it so now it makes sense yeah
so here's your mask all right miss adora
all right mr. Dora Dora the explora oh
my god well it's it's sealed it's sealed
it's $275 so don't you drop this on the
floor bitch all right oh my god am I
breaking ham oh whoa got it you better

okay so it comes like this it feels
crazy and feels like gelatin so this
must be the outside of the mask
obviously right yeah and you peel off
and put well I'm glad you're here cuz I
was about to just pop this on my face

Tosh talk just love tatcha give it a
little shake and let's work I saw you
get the back now - oh honey go you're
going to get the fucking back but do you
get the inside of the mouth oh nice
puzzle tea final thoughts tiny how do
you feel about it well I like that I'm
not gonna lie like I said I wasn't
really for like face masks in the
beginning and I wrote I mean I'm
addicted I am addicted I love them I
think you know even if they're like
don't work the most it's like a mental
thing like for me and then I put a mask
on I know it's ten minutes of just doing
nothing
yeah my glasses with them cuz I agree
it's nice to just sit and chill and yeah
I'm hoping for it works yeah and as long
as I feel like a little since like
tingle sensation I got a little like
glow afterwards then I think it did its
job so okay adore you score all right
word why
well I think it would be cool to see if
it really does work so I'm gonna send
you home with a few okay I'm let's both
try them out now remember we have to
wait four weeks and between yeah I feel
like when you go home we're puttin on
both you know I do get really creative
with my product use from you I feel like
I'm gonna see some video of you on stage
in three weeks and there's gonna be all
three on the fucking wall you're really
gonna be gagged when I actually laminate
them and make an outfit out of them huh
for Christmas is a gold edition but
don't see okay great so what rekindle in
March and see if we're any different at
March well we're gonna hang out way
before then I think well they have a
baby in the corner but happy Halloween
happy Thanksgiving happy on I got me New
Year's yeah Happy Valentines baby a girl
and then you'll see me as our chicks
with the toffee gold glow whole fucking
glow
yeah it's definitely the most expensive
product I've ever reviewed on my channel
yeah like I said this was the most
expensive facial I've ever had and I've
had a lot I mean I love a good facial I
love the radioactive waves have you ever
had that no with the light they use a
light radioactive way you guys is that
Michael me no no it's amazing yeah no
