channel today oh my god I feel like I
need to make a my own channel
just for lip swatching but I'm back
again with more lip swatches another
brand came out with a brand new liquid
lip hybrid formula and you know this
bitch had to try them out real quick so
of course you guys hopefully by now know
Giorgio Armani has amazing beauty
products not to sound like QVC but their
foundation I've been using for two years
straight now and I am obsessed with this
one and I'm excited today because guess
what Giorgio Armani just put out new
liquid lipsticks called lip magnets I
thought this is my Harry Potter
highlighting one okay anyway
oh okay so they put out new liquid
lipsticks and they are called lip
magnets now they look a little something
like this
they are really cute I love the
packaging I love that red plastic at the
top now I'm gonna give you guys a little
a little facts about this brand and this
product so it comes in a unit carton
that looks like this very standard for
their brand is black with silver foil
love it now when I saw that they were
coming out the liquid lip I was like oh
another brand okay I'm down I cannot
wait to see what uh like what the
formula is because you guys know it's
either a banger or it's a Judd
now these are all at Sephora so I got
six shades and this basically says that
it is a second skin intense matte color
now I was wondering why they were called
lip magnets you guys know I've used this
skincare and the face masks that came
off with a little magnet but these do
not have magnetic technology or not to
my knowledge and the packaging screws on
like so with the little G love their
little logo so it just comes out like
this woo oh and as that really thin like
it's a really short one I'm not that
into short ones but at least the red
thing is kind of like fat and thick so
it is probably more easier to apply than
if it was really thin but the applicator
I'm like oh what's
i nee let's smell the bitch huh there's
not really a fragrance now I do have a
stuffy nose it has been windy in
California like no other I'm like no
this is kind of flavorless which okay
holler so let's do a little breakdown of
what this product is so according to the
website well first of all these are
thirty-eight dollars each which I'm like
I am I think this is one of the most
expensive liquid lips I have ever tried
on my channel and I'm like of course
you're paying for the Armani designer
name it says that this is a long wear
lipstick with eight hour wear and eye
comfort with a no makeup feel so this is
supposed to be really pigmented but
you're not supposed to feel it which I
love that so it says that this
weightless liquid lip leaves lips with a
smudge proof okay so that's good to know
it's already stating that it's not going
to come off and an ultra matte finish
the formula is four times thinner and
has twice as much color as a traditional
lipstick I'm like oh that's a big
statement girl and then also says it
delivers a tower wearing Cumbre and it's
unique slim quill applicator design
gives ideal position for a perfect lip
contour all right this sounds
fancy and it basically says that it's
the classic Giorgio Armani the classic
shade that they've been revamp with the
look of tattoo inks someway hmm all
right honey well I'm about to do all six
shades for you guys and I'm gonna talk
about what the hell happens when you put
on the damn thing so I guess you guys if
you want to see a if these work or not
and if they're Geoffrey start approved
then keep on watching alright so I'm
gonna try this little Barbie pink color
it is called mania now the shade names
it's kind of weird you guys so on the
bottom of the bottle it just says a
number which a lot of the other products
like their powder foundation it just
literally says number two so I don't
mind that but it's bizarre because on
the unit card in on the top it says all
of the shade names so you see that one
says mania this one says vibrato so this
one is called mania and I guess let's
see what happens y'all
I'm going to dip in there one more time
we are dipping in a third time
all right so I'm gonna give you my first
impressions I felt like the applicator
was a little too small definitely I
think should be bigger to distribute
more product you guys saw I had to like
I normally have to never dip more than
twice front liquid lip up with this one
and how like narrow and little it was I
had the dip in there are three times to
get my entire mouth covered now I'm
noticing that it's a little streaky in
some spots now remember I put a second
layer over the bottom lip after I dipped
in twice and then the third one was just
for the top lip so it says that it's
supposed to be really long-lasting so
it's been about two minutes so I'm going
to take my fingers and lightly the
product did come up not a lot so but I
do want to make a note that a D come off
a tiny tiny bit I will say this the
disclaimer of being really lightweight
and like no makeup feel that's
definitely the case because I'm like
literally it feels very thin very thin I
do think just looking at it I think it
could have more coverage maybe the shade
obviously pigment and and all different
color shades are going to be different
so I guess we're gonna have to try the
next one all right these came off pretty
easy now I've done a lot of lip swatches
this year and sometimes they are so
difficult in between shades to remove
but these ones came off pretty
effortlessly so I'm gonna now try shade
over broto it looks like a brick red so
let's see how the pigments on this one
is that me or does it look like the
color to me looks better in the bottle
than it does on the lip but let's finish
it before I give my
all right this one is done it is drying
down right now it was a little streaky
I'm looking at the side of my mouth like
uh like it's like a little darker on the
edges and a little more sheer on top but
besides that no major complaints I just
really had to dunk in a lot again um but
let's move on to the next shade let's
try this Suez this plum this dark plum
type of color looks pretty cool so this
one is called attitude hi
she looks pretty let's see what this one
looks like
all right so I'm sure you guys already
know I'm about to read this one to fill
this one not the good not the greatest
one of all um really really streaky now
I'm gonna dip in and do another layer as
this one is drying down I can definitely
see my lips through it it's blotchy I
feel like the darker the color the worst
the pigment is but let me do a second
layer in the bottom to see what it looks
like we're fun oh wow going back over it
like remove the color like ah okay
definitely do not love this one let me
try a lighter shade and see what happens
so we're gonna take this one off alright
now this one it looks to be like a soft
rose coral it is called glow
alright glow let's see how we got onto
girl uh-huh it's like the lighter the
shade the easier and more pigmented they
are those so weird
all right miss glow ain't too bad she's
actually one of the best ones from the
group so far now it is a very light
shade compared to the ones I've already
swatch but um it's nice
it was definitely easier to apply has
better pigment and this might be my
favorite one so far sticking out alright
now this shade is called Hollywood it
looks like a neon hot Orange almost
looks like my liquid lip and Nicole but
various I got this extra neon miss to it
so let's see how she looks
hmm alright i think i've swatched enough
to know my final thoughts
umm I think let's just get right to the
 end because this is very
hit-or-miss for me alright so I was
waiting for this one to be completely
dry this one isn't as bad so at the top
I'm seeing some streakiness and just the
overall pigment of them they're not as
opaque as I would have imagined so the
claim of being a really pigmented it
kind of fell flat for me I feel like the
darker the color the worse it got the
lighter ones were a lot easier to apply
now I gotta say the applicator it's way
too short so my my hands were definitely
not into it maybe some other people
might love that now the actual
applicator itself I liked how pointing
it was because I could really get into
the lip line and make it really precise
but I didn't love how flat it was it
didn't hold a lot of pigment so I had to
keep going and dipping over and over to
get like full like opacity now you guys
saw when I layered a few of them like
with two layers it definitely helped the
coloring but I feel like for $38 should
you have to swipe twice I don't think so
bitch this ain't tinder so I don't know
overall thoughts I'm having mixed
feelings you guys I'm like is this
Jeffrey's are approved
I don't know these really remind me of
the Chanel ones i swatched um a couple
months ago and the
were worse than these ones I don't think
these are that awful I think this color
looks stunning um not the best so I'm
kind of like I don't know what's the
what
what is the in-between like don't love
it don't hate it it's very lukewarm for
me so I don't know this is like half way
Geoffrey's are approved because I
definitely think for the price point it
should have been a little better I don't
know you guys sound off below and let me
know your thoughts on this product also
let me know what your favorite shade was
and if you want to pick up a few of
these I don't even know if I recommend
these I feel like there's so many liquid
lipsticks on the market do you really
need this $38 ink type of liquid lip I
don't know I feel like I can even go to
the drugstore and find as like a dupe
for this that's like similar or even
better honestly so I don't love these I
feel like I've definitely reviewed a lot
better liquid lipsticks so you guys like
me oh your thoughts but um it is time
for me to I'm actually while you're by
the time you're watching this I will be
in Atlanta getting some extreme dental
work and then I'm off to Hawaii for the
holidays so I hope wherever you are
today you were having an amazing morning
or night and I was doing the next one so
thank you for watching and my love you
guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
