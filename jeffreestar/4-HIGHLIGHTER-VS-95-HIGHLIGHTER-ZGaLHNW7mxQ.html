today because today we're going to do a
battle of the highlighters now I have
seen so many videos on the trending page
and floating all over YouTube of like $2
steak versus $300 steaks so I'm like you
know what let's kind of take that idea
and bring it into the makeup world and
as we all know I am the highlighting
whore of the universe so I thought you
know what I went to Walgreens and I
found a four dollar highlighter it's
from the brand elf and I'm like you know
what I've never actually really used elf
on my channel before maybe a few times
like a long time ago so I'm like you
know what let me give them a shot this
one is four dollars it is the elf baked
highlighter and the shade is called
moonlight pearls I love that name and
then I went to the mall and I went to
Neiman Marcus and there is a brand I've
used before called clay topo and they
have a $95 highlighter this is the
aluminized face enhancer and the
packaging is pretty sick it's like
woohoo like the packaging alone wrapped
me in of course I haven't even tested
the formula or anything like that we're
about to do both this whole video I am
going to be comparing the elf versus the
clay to Poe so if you want to find out
which one wins then keep on watching
alright so I'm going to compare the
weight on these so the elf one is 0.17
ounces and this one is 0.35 ounces so
there is more product this one is 10
grams and this one is 5 grams so of
course you're getting a little bit more
product with this guy now with the elf
one let's open her up and see what she
looks like
whoo so it does have that little round
domed type little guy going on here and
now the packaging microstate is like
overly cheap but I mean it's cheap
packaging or it feels very lightweight
you get what you pay for I definitely
feel like with drugstore brands and what
I mean by that is like the packaging is
not always spectacular and heavy and
luxurious but the formula could be
bombed so that's why I like to of course
we're going to try it out the other one
though ooh it feels a little heavier
it's luxurious let's open her up okay so
it has this little piece of clear film
on it it says put this film back after
use over the powder and the brush okay
so this snaps off it's like a little
clear window and this one comes with a
brush so of course you get that included
the other one is just by itself now
besides the brush it is a big crazy it
almost looks like a diamond cut shape so
it has this fine layer of glitter which
I don't know if it runs through the
pigment or if it's just an over shell
which I hate when that happens so we're
gonna of course see that in a second and
I mean packaging of course this one is
sickening in my mind and this one is of
course basic but who is gonna blind my
motherfucking cheeks let's find out now
I think it's only fair that we use the
same brush for both so I dug out my
morphe brushes these are the packing
highlighting brushes now I love these
because unlike the fan brush love a fan
brush they're very it's a staple
everyone has a fan brush in their kit
I'm sure by now but these ones are more
of like Packer brushes so it's gonna put
on the highlight head V and blinding
which is basically my goal every day so
right now you guys can tell my cheeks
have no glow on them there is no
highlight in my entire face which is a
little scary because my face is like
bitch hello
we need to glow so I am very matte right
now and I'm kind of hating it so I am
going to use the elf highlighter first
all right so the elf highlighter I am
going to take it with my clean finger
and just lightly go over the top oh oh
girl I'm already I'm a little shook
right now okay we're going over it we're
going over it I'm like let me try my
other finger in case that one just
needed some guidance okay so this one
came oh look I'm a judge a little harder
I don't want to break the dome but I am
going anyways I am pressing hard and
that's the result okay finger tests a
little scary
I guess let's put her on the cheeks and
see what happens
cool thing about the dome is that you
can easily go back and forth back and
forth so let's see that and I'll put a
lot on there you guys see I'm going back
and forth the bitch is hoping and
praying right now and let's just take a
little mirror and put it over my cheek
and let's see what happens
okay now the glow is actually I think a
little bit better than it looked on my
finger because that finger swatch sure I
was like mmm so it's looking really
pretty so far I'm gonna put it all the
way to my hairline because the bitch
likes to shine let me look at that open
the monitor it looks pretty it's a
little bit more subtle than what I
normally wear I'm now gonna do a second
layer just for I'm gonna thought I'd
normally do I like to layer in layer
okay I think we're good um wow it's just
pretty stunning I'm like I love moving
my face back and forth like oh yes honey
work okay that one is not as bad as I
expected when I swapped with this index
finger I was kind of like okay videos
over by but it would definitely redeem
itself on the brush so now I'm just
gonna take a little bit and put it up in
that brow yes huh okay guys now let's
try the $95 one all right now we're
going to dip into the clay dopo
highlighter now this one oh I just love
that prism on the top it's like very
aesthetically pleasing so I'm gonna take
this hour to use his finger so now we're
gonna go to the middle one and I'm just
gonna lightly go over it I'm going in oh
oh okay a little bit more pigment on the
finger so I'm gonna quickly take the elf
one and I'm gonna go back and forth on
my finger and I'm just gonna go on my
hand right here and just show you guys
kind of blinding the brush picks it up
more which is very weird because usually
with fingers there's like more oil and
then the clay depoe one I'm gonna put
right next to it and you guys can see
the difference both are kind of share on
my hand but now it's time to put the
clay to put one on my other cheek BAM
there's a little more kick back than the
elf one so just kind of
dab the brush all over and that top
shimmer layer it's gone it's like
literally girl blowing on it she's she's
a little dusty who else hates when they
freshly washed her hair and it just
doesn't want to do anything that's me
right now I'm like let's put this on my
cheekbones where's the shine I'm like
what the hell girl where is the shine
let me move my hair back so y'all can
see the shimmer is almost non-existent
it's like if I took like loose powder
with a faint hint of glitter and dabbed
it on my cheek I'm like what not okay
let's go back in there and try a little
bit more I'm like hmm I'm like shit
there is no fucking pigment it is so
sheer I'm like what ends up all right so
the luxury brand definitely is not
blinding now I'm just going to go on the
website really quickly and see what
exactly it says so it says how to use
apply as the last step in your makeup
routine okay I just did that sweep brush
back and forth over the surface of the
powder and apply it to your face for a
more dramatic look use additional powder
on the temples well if it doesn't show
up how the motherfuck is gonna meet your
baby okay
description this exquisite highlighting
powder uses innovative light diffusing
technology to define contours and
illuminate your complexion
I'm not illuminated I'm like Dold
actually my cheek is dull and I'm like
trying to put on more and praying that
it's gonna work at any gonna work so
alright you guys I am I'm kind of
fucking shook right now I guess let's uh
compare the two so after a few minutes
of debating back and forth I'm still in
shock you guys now you guys know this
shady bitch right here I'm not always
about drugstore makeup I just love
luxury brands that's just my thing I
think after this challenge you guys I'm
shocked I might want to go back and do a
full face elf
tutorial just using only elf products
because I was really pleasantly
surprised I'm staring at this and I'm
like ninety five dollars and there's
like I mean I'm looking in the monitor
and it's like this side of my face looks
dead deceased it's cremated it's like
mmm we're bored and then over here I'm
like oh my god now of course you guys
saw my shock and horror when I tried to
swatch this with my finger but a lot of
the times I mean well no our fingers
have oils on them or it depends if you
just wash them I mean your finger
obviously is not meant for applying
highlighter a brush is so once the brush
hit the pan it's really pretty I'm like
pleasantly surprised it's not like to
blinding or maybe the average person
that isn't into extreme high light like
me might you know love this way more
than something extra extra extreme but
this one ninety-five dollars I could
have literally bought like 20 of these
so what in the hell I definitely went in
here thinking that this is of course
gonna be the winner but I have seemed
wrong and this one is definitely the
winner Chi Chi I think it's all about a
brands formula just because something is
priced hefty does not necessarily mean
it works which you guys have seen on
this channel before with some luxury
liquid lip brands you're like so I'm
sorry I don't know even know what to do
with this I'm definitely gonna add it in
my pile to donate um or give to a friend
but I don't even know who would want it
because it doesn't show up so all right
you guys already know the answer to this
one this clay dopo highlighter is
definitely not jeffree star approved but
the elf baked highlighter is jeffree
star approved i highly suggest you guys
run out and get these they're amazing I
also bought another color called pink
diamonds which I think I'm gonna use for
the full face elf video if I do that
later this month if you guys want me to
it of course leave some comments below
and I will do it for you guys um besides
that clearly this is the winner
hallelujah you all know what the Realty
is and I'm I'm happy I think it's
fucking cool that brands that are so
affordable are fucking sick and they
work because his face now she's quote
one so I guess that is a you guys thank
you for watching my little battle my
highlighter vs. highlighter video if you
guys have any more products you want me
to battle they'll leave some feedback in
the
comments down below and I'll see you on
the next one what bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
