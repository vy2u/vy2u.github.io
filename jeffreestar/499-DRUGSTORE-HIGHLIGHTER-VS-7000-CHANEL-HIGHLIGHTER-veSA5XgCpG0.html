channel today we are doing around our
the highlighter battle and what the hell
does that mean well I'm sure you saw the
title and by the way look at me I look
so mad where's my glow you guys I'm so
naked and also I'm wearing a bathrobe
and I have no panties on but anyway
today we are going to be testing out two
highlighters one of them is a drugstore
brand and the price is $4.99 and on the
other side we have a $70 highlighter
from a luxury brand and basically in
today's video we're going to put them to
the test we're going to battle them out
we're going to see which side of the
face glows the hardest now I did you
round one before about four months ago
if you want to catch that video it will
be in the description box of course so
if you want to see a battle and keep on
watching
now last year one of my favorite
highlighters ever was from wet-and-wild
and they have something called the mega
glow highlighting powder and they put
out a few gold shades last year they
were a huge hit they were probably one
of my favorite highlighters of 2016 so
when I saw that they were launching new
shades the last few months I was like I
need them too right this second and then
they had to go and do crazy colors so
not just gold we get a beautiful kind of
like pinkish color of course we haven't
watched these yet so I don't know what
the real color is but this shade is
called
the sweetest bling now both of these
highlighters are limited edition they
are cruelty free and there are only 499
the other shade is lilac to reality of
the Q shade name and it looks something
like this they both have hearts in the
center and they look really cute now you
know when you look at something you can
already tell that they're pigmented
these look pigment it has this weird
kind of like Frost you glow over it and
the heart in the middle is white I'm
sure you can swirl them around and mix
them we are going to test those of
course to do swatches on my hand and of
course on my face now we are going to
put them to the test against a newish
Chanel highlighter this
is also a limited-edition it comes in a
compact with a dark red top on it with
the black logo now this is called the
Camilla Deschanel illuminating powder
this retails for $70 girl I'm lying you
better fucking it shit don't work with
us for this price point we all know what
happened in the first battle it was
awful
so today we are going to be testing out
this guy now Chanel does not play games
so this brush comes off like this and
you get basically like a barrier
protecting the powder from your hand so
this comes off like this in your hand
and then voila a flower though that
flower the powder looks so stunning now
this is more of a gold champagne color
of course these ones are a little more
funky so today we're going to just see
which one is more blinding I'm going to
use them on my brow bone up here who
needs eyebrows it's 2017 I'm also going
to be doing my Cupid's bow and the
cheeks so let's get started so before we
dive into these on my face I'm going to
read you a little description on their
website you guys know I like to be very
thorough and make sure that this does
exactly what it says so this says what
the same formula as a must-have mega
glow highlighting powder this duotone
powder adds a pop of dimension when used
together so silky smooth highly
pigmented formula it gives an all-over
glow when applied to the cheekbones of
brow bone and Cupid's bow okay amazing
let's take out the color the sweetest
bling it looks something like this it
comes in a little compact that is clear
on top which I like that you can see it
now I'm also going to do this little
fingers watch on my hand first to see
the shade before I kind of mix them
together so I'm just going to take my
finger on the metallic pink part and go
like that okay so you can see how the
pink kind of went into the white because
I touched it and it feels really soft it
feels very smooth it doesn't have like a
powdery feeling it feels like oh sorry
to stop my finger for the first time I'm
like oh look at that that is really
blinding on my finger let me take this
on my hand right here oh wow that is
like a beautiful pinky rose gold color
oh my god
okay that is cute now let's grab a lilac
to reality she looks something like this
and to me this looks like a purple
duochrome kind of shift I'm going to
take my other clean finger here and go
in oh wow oh it's a little more
reflective than the other one definitely
has their like a blue undertone and we
will swatch her right next to this BAM
it's very like unicorn
as I like mystical type of vibe now the
other one looks to be a little bit more
pigmented on my hand and this one not
going to sheer but it does look a little
less she doesn't look like blinding them
on the monitor I'm looking at the camera
like oh okay so I think I'm gonna layer
both of these and just try these on this
side of my face so my left will be the
drugstore side and then the right side
will be the luxury side so I am going to
take the morphe brush I'm just going to
swirl this around the heart and in the
middle one two three the brush is up
pretty coated now let's go in Oh hmm
that is nice you guys okay hold on now
let me get a mirror and look up close
whoo I'm like that is really really
pretty I'm not a little bit more you
guys know I like to take on the
highlight now this white and wild
highlighter it's really pretty I didn't
expect to like it just quickly on my
face but and with that peachy blush oh
my god okay I want to take the lilac to
reality same brush okay okay okay and
I'm just going to put this over on the
high plains of my cheekbone oh girl hmm
those mixed though alright so first
impressions it is blending out really
nice it's effortless it's like the brush
is like living for the powder I'm like
oh my god oh wow that wood does a liner
the world don't try me
it's just shook right now Shh she's
feeling shook it okay now we're going to
hit our Cupid's bow and put a little bit
over the lipstick and this is sweetest
late again oh wow I think I'm going to
do the whole keep its bow because it's
going to look a little weird if I don't
so let me just go in mmm I love it
alright now let's take another brush of
course I'm going to use a little on a
sock via a 23 this is very similar to
this it packs on the highlighter amazing
now for the right side of my face I am
going to be trying out the Chanel
highlighter of course it looks something
like this I am going to take a clean
finger and I am going to swatch the
middle of it oh my god I hate touching
like I hate ruining the patterns on like
pants I like just bothers me but um it
looks like this which is like a very
pretty
blinding champagne gold and I will
swatch it next to these put her right
here the tone is so different than these
other ones I kind of look for it as you
can see that one is just as blinding it
has tiny tiny little knot pieces of
glitter but like finely milled glitter
in the formula I can see already on my
Beauty lights and it looks really pretty
I'm like dream let's get our pictures
and we have any highlighter way oh wow a
lot came off the brush like immediately
and as you can see in the pan it like
shows the ridges of the brush of where
it went so let's give it a whirl
Wow okay we're going to go in with a
little a little more for her cheekbones
that looks almost wet on camera I'm like
holy mean okay I'm just finessing it
into a cheekbone now all right you guys
let me go in for a closer look this one
is just as blinding as the drugstore one
but very similar it's not like any more
blinding I don't think it's not like
crazy and I'm also going to take a
little bit and dust it down the center
of my nose I love a little blinding nose
highlight okay on the nose though it is
like extremely blinding like come on out
of space how are you and then I'm going
to do a little bit on my chin because
we're trying to highlight my whole face
is glowing I'm gonna go downstairs and
Nate is gonna be like oh my okay now
we've been doing up there
I go in for like an hour okay I have to
stop but let me zoom in on my face
and take a peek at what the hell is
going on okay
now this one is just as blinding as the
drugstore one now of course this color
is a little more you know we're going to
call it normal if you will of course I
really love it it does look like this
wet on camera it's pretty it's not
powdery at all it was really lightweight
it applied with ease um I'm kind of
shocked right now you guys like nuts
both of them didn't stop um I am I want
to do a little quick test on Nate before
I gave my real final thoughts and make
sure that these were blinding enough
there's not so pretty what we checking
on you so either drugstore highlighter
yeah you went wild yeah lead for this
it's on this side of my face
yeah and on my mouth I know I've seen
yeah your lips was like blinding all I
know I came into the room radioactive so
I'm just going to try this lilac one on
you see if it looks pretty or not
alright no Nate no makeup on oh damn I
test a lot of my own
highlighters and stuff on ages how they
wear throughout the day so he needs to
being the makeup to make a guinea pig
that looks pretty cool okay now we're
gonna do these Chanel little pretty that
flower is and I like it like a stamp and
click my hole alright now we're going to
try the camilla day before the bullshit
called
this chanel pattern is Amanitas girl
fucking me I took Spanish okay work it's
crazy how this one is not looking as
like blinding it's not like okay there
it goes you had to kind of layer for a
second yeah there we go
so it took a few layers to get nee to
get to blind blind world just like it's
like almost my skin tone so it's like
yeah it is look at this is the same
cheap you literally don't even like see
it's just like shiny I mean yes it's
definitely there I think they're both
really pretty and glowy definitely think
do a little turn this way you know right
well when it's extending I kind of want
to take the POS well bad we just blame
the sweetest bling having a such a cute
name
yeah like a rose gold moment I'm gonna
put on top see what happens okay cute
and it's really nice I will check out
with a flash a lot of times you guys
will take my iPhone turn on the flash
and then turn the same oh I mean that
shit is look ha whoa it looks so
stunning and then let me see this Chanel
one on me I'm more interested in my brow
bone I'm sorry
just gone alright babe thanks for
letting me make sure I knew what the
hell I was talking about of course made
alright now I'm gonna give my real final
thoughts
alright guys um that's a giggles and I'm
looking around me and get so giggly I'm
like okay so my final thoughts on the
for $99 highlighter versus the $70
highlighter
are both of them got the job done they
were both very pretty they were glowy
they were stunning they were I mean they
applied amazing they were not chalky
they were not powdery so at the end o at
the end
and I will say this the $4.99 eyeliner
is dropped it looks good bitch okay so I
will say this the Chanel and the Wet n
Wild are both Jeffrey jar approved
whoo what does that mean it means that
of course a drugstore product can be
just as good as a luxury brand now I
will say this this Chanel one feels
heavier it just come with a brunch
it came with a protective piece it came
in this beautiful compact which is you
know it cost a little bit more money I'm
sure to manufacture this one and it
comes with a mirror so you've got the
mirror you got some pretty pan you get
the full shebang as I like to say now
the wet and wild one it did the job it
was amazing is the packaging as crazy as
this Chanel what no now at the end of
the day when I leave my house and
someone complements me and my
highlighter or they see this on my cheek
they don't even know what this look like
at home so of course if you don't care
about packaging and you just care about
something that works that is affordable
and amazing the wet and wild one was
unreal and I highly suggest it if you
want to splurge a little bit and try out
something else a little more crazy of
course be my guest
but I think they were both amazing and
I'm just really glad that unlike the
first battle this one had better results
because last time Lord Jesus who won the
battle I think that it was a tie they
both won and they're both amazing so
sadly there are no losers or winners
today if you guys like these type of
videos let me know in the description
box down below and I will be doing some
more battles for you guys thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you on the
next one mwah mmm bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
