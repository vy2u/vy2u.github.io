channel and you know what if your new
high because there's a lot of new
subscribers lately so in case you
weren't aware my name is Geoffrey Starr
and I have been a makeup artist for over
15 years I also love to review products
I love to do a lot of first impressions
I love to do a lot of lifestyle videos
and you know we are
it's just crazy I'm like I'm stuttering
because 2016 was so crazy last month
with my one year anniversary from doing
YouTube now I had a channel and long
time ago that just kind of went stagnant
I revived this bitch and it's been such
a wild ride so one year later and over a
hundred videos later I'm ready to start
the new year off so today what the hell
are we going to do today we are going to
do a battle of the foundations we did
the highlighters we did the primers and
I'm like okay what could we do and then
I stumbled across a new foundation on
the internet that is just 5 and 99 and I
was like huh I had such a good
experience after filming my full face
using all elf products I'm like okay any
drugstore y'all bitches ass over to the
fuck up so I got a drugstore foundation
from a wet and wild wet and wild they'd
Stephan it up like last year they're
highlighters were one of my all-time
favorites of 2016 which got me shook to
the core and PS before we start diving
into everything a lot of you have been
requesting for me to not wear any
contact lenses and show my real eye
color so here are the baby blues okay so
here are the brown eyes they're kind of
hazely they're kind of brown my driver's
license it says hazel but yeah either my
real eyes no contact lenses so hi
everyone me so if you guys want to see
the drugstore foundation versus the
luxury high-end foundation and keep on
watching now because these price points
are so drastic I need to start off this
video with a fucking hit and shout out
to the state of California we finally
passed the recreational use of cannabis
so thank God we can get medicated
legally so what's up California Happy
New Year
and this is a brand that me and Nate
found on Instagram they are called
mystic toke I will leave their info down
below and look at they make a
personalized jeffree star cosmetics
fuckin page I was like oh is this is
sickening alright so today I'm going to
be applying one foundation on this side
of my face and of course the other on to
this side now we're just going to have
an invisible line and you guys are going
to see me apply it pretty much full-on
and we're just going to compare of
course like we always do in these types
of battle videos so if you don't want to
hear my whole spiel and you just want to
see me apply the foundation that part of
the video starts right here so don't
leave me
alright so the drugstore foundation that
I'm going to be trying out today is the
brand new wet-and-wild photo focus
foundation okay girl a lot of people
have been asking me to review this so I
thought you know what let's put it up
against a luxury brand and see what
happens so if you guys all will rewind
back to the highlighter battle you
remember that the brand clay to pose
highlighter was a little a little
lackluster but they have a brand new
foundation that just hit the market as
well and this is a hundred and twenty
five dollars I'm like oh okay girl now
you guys know I had tried a few
expensive foundations of course and
reviewed them and a lot of times are
really bombed because they have extra
like magic in it I don't know what the
fuck they do but obviously we're going
to talk about what is even in this to
make it that price point or what they
think is going to make it that price
point so we are going to put these to
the test now on my table I also got
several shade you guys know how I have
issues with finding my shade even though
you know the shade match websites help
it's kind of hard so I got three from
wet-and-wild and I got three from clay
topo one is still in the box and I'm
going to read what they say they're both
supposed to do so let's just talk about
the wet and wild now I will say this
this is like a glass glass right I mean
it's still pet what's that love I'm like
this is only $5.99 and it actually feels
like a high-end
brand like it feels heavy which is crazy
because a lot of drugstore brands you
know the packaging is very cheap and it
kind of feels weightless I like a
product with weight I want to do
weighted down so I am on their website
and allegedly this is supposed to be a
new high-performing skin perfecting
foundation that underwent major road
testing under seven different photo
lighting conditions to deliver the most
flawless camera-ready makeup every
single time and I'm like oh shit so the
major plan that I found a little like oh
okay for this one is that it says that
it was specifically made with a matte
light diffusing complex to give your
skin a no filter a hashtag no filter
perfection and yes the hashtag is on
their site I'm living for it I shade
match this color earlier this is called
rose ivory I do have a cool undertone to
my skin so hopefully this will work and
also I do want to note that wet and wild
is a cruelty-free and vegan brand for
everyone that always asked about that
alright now let's get to the high-end
ones now this is the radiant cream
foundation now when I saw the price tag
of $125 I was like oh okay okay so this
is a moisturizing full coverage cream
foundation with a smooth texture that
transforms skin into a natural dewy
lustrous complexion okay now it also has
key benefits and there is a lot you guys
I'm talking on nine or ten bullet points
of what the hell of foundation does not
like that is like an extra but allegedly
there is silk and pearl elements to this
it is going to help moisturize and
retexture my skin while reducing the
appearance of damage caused by
environmental stress I wish every
Belgian would do that now it also says
that there is a reflection oil that
develops a lustrous layer that spreads
evenly across the skin's surface for
captivating lustre I'm like this is like
poetry whoever wrote this by the way
there's a lot of claims with this one
this one is supposed to look sickening
on camera this one is supposed to be the
same but look even more like beautiful
so I guess I'm ready to put these on now
I
that it's only fair to of course put a
primer on my skin the weave that's how I
normally get ready and I'm going to go
in with 2016 1 1 a 2 favorite primers
which is the Bobbi Brown vitamin
enriched face base and this is for any
skin type which I love so if you want to
try any moisturizer I would definitely
recommend this one now I'm just going to
get a little foundation brush a
synthetic that is completely clean
now I'm just going to dip in there and
I'm going to coat my entire face now
that this is on I am going to do the
drugstore foundation at first so I'm
going to do that on the left side of my
face which is your guyses right and the
clay dopo on my right side so let's
start with this now I have to really
damp Beauty blenders this is how I
normally apply my foundation I'm going
to do the red one with the drugstore and
then the new baby pink Beauty Blender
with the luxury so ok so it has like a
spatula which is cool not a lot of
brands do that so I'm just going to put
a lot on my face because you all know
I'm full coverage bitch all right let's
bounce
alright let's take a really big peek in
here huh oh wow
that is really nice I'm like why is it
so smooth that I'm like sitting here
remembering reading the description it's
not going to go and I'm like okay I mean
I think it did what it said I mean let's
let it settle for a minute and let's do
the clay dopo side and see what happens
alright now you want to note that of
course that wet-and-wild had a spatula
this one has a little applicator at the
end so I am just going to squeeze it on
top of my beauty blender and for the
price point seems like such a verage
boring component I'm like the only thing
I like is the top it's really cute and
shiny looks like a disco ball but this
is so underwhelming just trying to say
it alright let's apply alright I think
that might be enough we shall see in a
second I am just going to of course dot
this all over so let's bounce
alright let's grab a mirror and see Oh
oh wow they're so different
look how lustrous like this side is
that's crazy huh
whoa man first of all this one is
definitely more full coverage and we
look at the foundation on my lips
compared to the other side this side is
a matte and it is kind of blurring hard
to say now I did not use of course a
pore filling primer I just use a very
moisturizing one so like my pores not
really showing that much on this side I
think actually showing a little bit more
on the high-end side I also love the
finish of this like oh wow this really
does those you like there's not much on
my face if that makes sense like this
one I feel like I could tell like okay
this is like heavier you all know what
I'm talking about course you all wear
foundation but like I don't know man
like this is cool but this one is also
very like I could see myself using this
more just because it's just like I
always want to look like a matte fucking
bitch all right guys so clearly they
both do such different things but we are
forgetting one big thing if I were to
wear foundation of course I would wear a
concealer and a powder so I think that
it's only fair that we do that and then
I am going to go about my day I have a
lot of errands to do I have shopping so
I'm literally going to wear just
foundation and the concealer and the
powder so I'm going to do this right now
on camera for you guys and then I'm
gonna go shopping and hang out and
probably just wear sunglasses and look
like an alien so I think it's only right
that we use one of my favorite
concealers not one is always the
favorite concealer of 2016 which was the
Tarte shaped ace it's just great you
guys so let's put it over of course both
foundations and see how it looks and of
course it's only fair that I use the
beauty's
that I use on each side so let's bounce
and go in cool that was a damn workout
you guys I feel like I just jacked off
like a hundred penises okay so now I'm
even going to give my thoughts about the
concealer over the foundation so on the
drugstore side the concealer looks great
and I find it really nice it's like
fucking clean okay and then on the
luxury side
whoa okay we're going to zoom in a
little bit right here it's like a little
blotchy like I don't think the concealer
formula loved this foundation which
happens a lot it doesn't mean it's the
concealer or the foundation sometimes
brands do not mix together and here we
are seeing that I hope you guys can see
it it's like it's not as pretty as the
wet and wild side this one is like and
this one is a little like I just want to
keep popping it and trying to like make
it work a little better it's just not
living and loving for it now I am going
to set the under eyes and throw on some
foundation now we're kind of setting
cottage a nice Bowl
all right so that was my favorite chanel
setting powder it is it's beautiful you
guys and then I'm going to take my
enjoyed your money luminous silk
foundation compact with the same brush
and just desk this all over my face
all right now that the whole powder and
setting powder are in I'm looking
closely and huh okay okay well I don't
want to get my final buff yet I am going
to go about my day and I will be back
and I know I guess I'll tell you when I
get back so I'll see you guys in a
little bit much
Oh hi everybody I know you guys are
gonna see me from five seconds ago or
wait one second but it has been about
where's my phone seven and a half hours
and now I am cozy in pajamas and I'm
looking on the monitor like these
foundations don't look as crazy as I
thought they would be now of course we
set the entire face and that is going to
really help but I want to zoom in a
little bit and give my final thoughts of
both on Aging
so we have the drugstore foundation on
this side of the face and I'm like a
little shook right now you guys because
it wore really really well I'm like holy
shit man
and on the high-end side it wore really
well but I could definitely see my pores
a lot more in this area and on this side
it's like really nice like you really
don't see them so that is definitely
eight minus four this and then my little
you know my last lines right here this
side is really like smooth and that's
how I'm seeing it closed up and then on
this side it's more it's a little more
severe like you can see line way more if
you like then this side now under the
eyes with the concealer over it and the
powders I think that they both pretty
they look pretty good now this side
looks a little more flawless to me where
is this one I want like take the Beauty
Blender I'm like I want to buff it and
fix it so bad I'm not going to do it I'm
not gonna do it all right
so Wow okay I am a mess I'm not mad at
this you guys but I think it's time to
give my final stop all right so I'm
going to be really real right now I'm
actually really excited because
no drugstore makeup has really been like
pulling my mind the last few months I'm
like okay this is only five and
ninety-nine and it's fucking great like
I'm just going to say it right now it is
amazing for some reason it really did
the job it did exactly what it said it
was going to do it looks flawless after
like I like slopping my face inside
really coming off like after almost
eight hours I am like oh my god hello so
if you guys have not seen this yet or
tried it is worth it I mean it is worth
it for this price and for what it looks
like I'm like it's sick now on this side
the clay Depot radiance cream foundation
I like how it looks on the part where I
don't have flaws which I know that
sounds kind of weird but like my pores
are really bothering me I'm like oh my
god I want to take powder like but
besides that it more well now it does
feel kind of like a little more oily and
dewy and it definitely gives you that
more glow which is what it said it was
going to do so it got a little more dewy
and kind of oily more so throughout the
day of course than this side this is
like matte like my so if you don't mind
that I kind of like how I don't even
have highlighter on my cheeks a little
more glowy right here this was not bad
like I actually really like this I just
wish that I would have used a course
better primer for my trouble areas and
the things that I don't like so I would
probably go with like you know the
benefit Porefessional or something more
so along those lines and then put it
over with so now I will say this this
one is the winner over this in my eyes
but they're both Geoffrey start proof
because this one isn't like horrible it
wasn't like oh my god I look like shit
it's just I don't know like it's so
beautiful I'm like trying I'm not
grasping for air here but you guys
hopefully will understand what I mean
we're like this doesn't have so many
cons and it doesn't look bad alright now
it's time for you guys to sound off in
the comments down below and let me know
your final thoughts which side do you
think one or which side did you guys
think is the best now there's a lot
about to make up items out there you
guys there is under eye setting powder
we got concealer we got let's
that's scary that's a fun one so if you
guys want to see more I think that
battle videos of course let me know down
