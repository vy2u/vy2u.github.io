channel now today I'm gonna be doing a
little first impressions on this
expensive-ass foundation I found on
Sephora it is by a brand called Seurat
beauty and this is their foundation one
Oh what the hell right I'm like okay new
foundation you better work and I'm also
going to be trying out a new
highlighting brush from the same brand
that is over $100 does this drive my car
for me we'll have to find out later I am
really excited to get back into makeup
tutorials the fall season's approaching
but I got so many requests last week
when me and Manny try it out liquid lips
that soft little moment which I
recreated today everyone was like why do
you look like a hundred years younger um
what did you do different so I'm gonna
show you how I created this really soft
little glam now there are no false
lashes there is a no under eye makeup
and I'm wearing gloss for the first time
in a minute so if you want to see how I
created all of this and keep on watching
alright so let's dive into a little
first impressions before I do that
tutorial now I was browsing on Sephora
calm for highlighting brushes the other
day now you guys know I am so loyal to
my morphe 510 brush but I wanted to see
what else was out there there are so
many brands creating highlighters I know
there had to be some brushes out there
so while browsing Sephora calm I came
across this brand called Seurat Beauty
which I had seen at Barneys before but
now it's on Sephora
now this highlighting brush is from the
brand really cute and I'm sure a lot of
girl like okay it's matte black it
doesn't look that great I wish you could
feel the bristles through the camera it
almost feels like my god now I haven't
tried the brush yet I was saving it for
a rainy day so let's try it for today so
I will use this for highlighting later
but to get back to my point
Sarat Beauty just put out these new $65
foundation wands now when I saw
foundation wand I was like what the fuck
some hocus-pocus bullshit I'm all about
new foundations and when it said full
coverage on the website I was like hmm
you know I'm a full coverage Queen so
let's talk about this guy for
this does retail for 65 bucks now when I
see that price point I'm like girl girl
now quickly it comes in a unit carton
like this now it's kind of iridescent
maybe kind of hard to see if it has like
that oil slick kind of sparkle to it
biome no this is not my dildo this is
makeup now it comes in this big stick
it's heavy it feels really nice
and it has a little thing on the end
that you click down and then the
foundation will of course come off now
earlier I did not try this on my face
yet I did click it out because a lot of
the times when you get these products
you click it and nothing happens you
know you have to click like 20 times to
get any out from the pump so a little
bit of foundation did come out I have
not tried it yet have not felt it has
not touched the skin but I'm really
excited now I am shade 3 I took a guess
so if this doesn't match I'm giving you
full permission to read me to fill it's
really hard to shop for foundations
online which I always mention but it's
like you know it just says your
undertone so I try to guess and just
pray that it works so a little bit of
information about this it says the
surreal real skin foundation wand leaves
your skin looking flawless and
innovative design makes application easy
and it instantly melts into the skin
reducing the appearance of pores and
fine lines now that's interesting so
allegedly there are ingredients in this
to make your pores less visible it also
said with a number of shades to choose
from it's perfect for every skin tone
self setting oil-free formula that
provides an invisible medium to full
coverage with a long wearing finish it
dispenses on the brush and you're
supposed to be able to put it on with
the brush so what I'm gonna do for you
guys today is I'm gonna apply this half
the face with the actual brush and the
other half with a damp Beauty Blender
you guys know this is my favorite and
we'll see what happens
alright now I'm going to prime my skin
like I normally do so I don't really
think that's cheating whenever I do
first impressions I always do the primer
and I set it just like I would any
product so I'm gonna be using that
Grillin gold primer and we're just gonna
use a little drugstore brush from gucci
huh no but i love this brush this feels
really nice so i am just going to put
this all over my face and let it soak in
for a
oh this primer you guys I can't tell you
enough how good it is it like makes your
face kind of like like just kind of
tighten a little bit and the foundation
though girl all right
face is primed let's get to the
foundation so all as you do for this
foundation is you whoa she's coming out
the top now like I said before I will
try to blend this side of the face am i
right with the actual one and then we'll
try a Beauty Blender for the rest of it
so just to start I'm going to oh I can
already tell us full coverage I'm just
gonna kind of dot this around okay is
that too much who fucking knows so I'm
just gonna take this brush and okay I'm
already I'm like I don't know about
blending with this when you're when you
go like this see that so if you guys see
it's like streaky um I'm not down with
streaky foundation so I am just going to
cut some corners and just apply the
foundation everywhere and then go in
with the Beauty Blender oh there she
goes and let's just buff this out and
see what happens
thought right away our ain't bad you
guys oh my god it doesn't really look
heavy like it covered up a lot of my
discoloration and it looks very just
like real it looks very skin like I'm
like oh my god I'm like I'm like waiting
for something horrible to happen and it
just looks really nice now that it's
drying down I think I actually picked
the perfect color I was afraid it was
going to be a little too dark but since
summer kind of you know ruined my face
um it definitely matches now on here it
said that it was a self setting
foundation I'm like how in the fuck does
that even happen so am I supposed to set
my face definitely need to do concealer
and some powders now regardless I could
never just start you know doing other
parts of my face without really setting
it in my mind with more powder because
that's just the effect that I like we're
going to start off with concealing with
the Urban Decay Naked skin concealer and
shade it fair I just can't get over this
concealer I just feel like I'm always
going back to it because it is so just
oh just blends amazing
we're gonna use more foundation because
I'm a sick twisted ass bitch we're gonna
go in with my favorite Mac sharing white
powder I've been using this since high
school and she's never failed me now now
for a really youthful bright look when
I'm not doing any false lashes this is
my best friend it is very very
brightening so I just like to take a
little NARS kabuki brush and it makes
the foundation and the powder just blend
like heaven and I'm just gonna take this
and really brighten up these under eyes
and if your brush doesn't blend it as
good as you want just use your Beauty
Blender now to set the rest of my face
I'm going to be going in with my giorgio
armani luminous silk foundation compact
this is one of my best friends and i'm
gonna be using an artiste brush I'm sure
a lot of you were like what the fuck are
you about to do I like to hit the pan
and then hit my face now I'm being a
little aggressive a little hard then of
course we're going to hit that neck and
this just leaves you really airbrushed
really flawless really cunt and never
ready to contour now this is the Tom
Ford contouring cheek color duo and I
love to use this shade right here now
there are a few of these that came out
this is in shade number two now this
shade is called stroke go figure and I
just love this contour color because
it's just not your typical like in the
brown family this is just like a almost
corley bronzy color so I'm going to be
using a little Smith one one two brush
and I'm just going to start right here
and I'm just gonna do little circular
motions and I'm not gonna bring it down
all the way down like I normally do I'm
just gonna keep it really focused right
here and we're just gonna stop it right
here see that guys we're not going any
further even though I want to my wrist
is like bitch bitch Shh I'm not doing it
and I'm just gonna soften the edges
voila that's it for today now blush is
going to be my main focus for the cheeks
today contour is cute but I want a
little soft peach moment which
perfect because this is the Gucci blush
in shade soft peach and I'm gonna be
going in with a little Mac 129 brush and
these are really pigmented so I barely
touched the pan it's like good morning
so hi cheeks how are you and I'm just
going to put these on the apples of my
cheeks I love it it's very soft and hmmm
alright now for the first time in a long
time I'm gonna leave my forehead uncon
toward I'm feeling my hairline we're
really not going to contour the jaw at
all the cheeks are feeling very peachy
and fierce I'm gonna be trying a
benefits new brow products now this
pencil is called precisely my brow
pencil packaging a honey and a now I got
to go to Vegas a few months ago and try
out all these products and also this
product just called Co brow is like a
brow gel it is it's amazing it's unreal
if you've never seen this it comes
unscrewed like this and then look at
this this unscrews oh hello little brush
she's gonna brush you guys mm-hmm and
then it just kind of snaps in here like
that and you're ready to get flaky so
I'm gonna go do brows off camera and
I'll be right back
alright the brows are done and now let's
get started on these eyes now to prime
my eyes I'm gonna be using the YSL
Couture eye primer this always just nice
to have in my kit girl love how this
feels now I'm just gonna put this all
over the lid well that was a lot bitch
we're trying to prime my soul honey
we're trying to prime my existence today
so today's eye look is gonna be really
simple I know that's shocking to
everybody I'm gonna tone it down today
and I'm gonna love it
so what I did to create that look when
me and Manny tested out all the liquid
lips I only used three little products
so first up we're going to be going in
with the Kylie cosmetics cream shadow
and shade rose gold now when I did my
first impressions I use the other shade
with the fucking dumb motherfucker call
that one was called copper and I loved
copper it looked really cute so I'm
gonna be dipping in with a little Mac
synthetic brush you can use anything
that has a synthetic bristle and I'm
just going to be going in on this
girl a little goes a long way which I
love and just oh the color though the
color oh it's just really really pretty
on the lid alright so now we're going to
be getting into some eye shadows which
is going to be a really simple and fast
for this one now I'm going to be using
that makeup geek many MUA eyeshadow
palette this one is oh it's just so
pretty it is a very versatile and I've
definitely been using these two a lot
when I'm not filming now I do know that
this palette is a limited edition so if
you want to get this before it's gone
forever I would get on it soon because I
know this is almost gone forever
okay so we're going to be dipping in to
Sora and beaches and cream now this is
Sora one of my all-time favorites
mani you killed it with this one and
then a little bit of beaches and cream
I'm just going to kind of go back and
forth and mix now I'm just going to take
this and put this in my crease and I'm
also going to merge it with the rose
gold so the cool thing about these Kylie
creme shadows is that they blend with
powder really nicely so I want my eye
sockets to look very airbrushed come
through mannequin now I'm going to dip
into beaches and cream one more time and
we're just going to just go in there and
really just soften the edges and make
sure we look really airbrushed now we're
going to go in with a little Mac two to
one detail brush and I'm going to be
dipping into Mars I love this shade you
guys it is everything and mixing this
with that rose gold is gonna look so
amazing whereas Manny would say stunning
how stunning okay maybe I added the
whole part but anyway Mars is about to
be right here in my crease and we're
about to change this look girl now
notice how I'm not going to bring this
all the way in like I normally do let me
tilt my head back so you can see I'm
gonna stop it right there and just kind
of give it its own crease moment which i
think is cool because I always put my
shadows kind of in the same spots and I
think it's nice to get out of your
comfort zone try
something different and now you guys
know I love to drag it all the way down
to the lash line today we're not gonna
do that I am just going to keep it right
in there and just drag up so lightly and
then to buff out we're gonna go back in
with Sora and peaches and cream and to
make sure it's blended we're just gonna
go over the red and just soften it a
little bit all right now this ilyich is
almost complete now I want to keep this
really soft and pretty so I'm gonna be
going in with Artemis right here and
this has kind of like a shimmer Sheen to
it which I'm loving for so we're just
gonna highlight the brow bone with it
and I'm just going to take it and put it
right below the brow and just softly go
in there okay you better work Artemis
all right now shockingly we're almost
done with the eyes to finish this off we
are going to do a little nude eyeliner
in the waterline and I'm gonna be taking
that color pop gel liner and shade honey
dude this is my go-to forever I'm gonna
take this and just a lightly run it in
my waterline and this is just gonna
brighten the eyes and give it a moment
all right now to finish off the eyes we
definitely need some mascara now I ran
out of my benefit roller lash so I got
another roller lash this is my all-time
favorite lately I'm just like oh cannot
get enough and that feeling of a brand
new component of course grab your
favorite mascara if you don't have this
one and just very thickly do your tops
and bottoms and let's get to it
all right mascara is done now what's
left on this face we got a highlight and
we gonna do some lips for highlighting
today we are going to go back in with
that Sarat beauty and try this $115
highlighting brush goddamn and of course
I think it's very fitting to try a my
girl kathleenlights
new highlighting palette with makeup
geek first of all this packaging look at
the girl she look a real cute there are
three shades now this middle one is
called starlight uh-huh so you know I
gotta use that say I got my name in it a
minute a minute but the brush the brush
let's see what happens
oh my god ah this is so pretty oh my god
hmm
hi Glo how's your day yes oh my god come
on nose now obviously these formulas are
I'm just gonna use my finger so
pigmented let me swatch the other one oh
this gold oh I can't wait to use this in
a tutorial next all right
Trimspa baby now this is definitely a
good brush to have in your kit if you
are someone that is a working makeup
artist that maybe does celebrities or
weddings or that type of stuff it is
very nice to have some luxury items in
your kit to show your clients you know
bitch need some luxury alright now that
looks like I've been sucking on a metal
popsicle it's definitely time for some
lipstick now for lips I'm definitely
gonna be prepping them because I've been
doing so much traveling my mouth is like
god help me now of course we already put
a highlighter on there but my bottom lip
is a little crusty so I'm gonna be going
in with my strawberry gum the lower lip
scrub now my lip scrubs are all back in
stock oh my god look at that pop bitch
I've been using her up and there's also
two new flavors coming for the Fall so
get ready everyone is been begging for a
pumpkin spice latte to come back so uh
that's coming back that's one of them
and then the other flavor you have to
wait to find out so of course I'm just
gonna dip in with my occur like nails
and go to town
and of course if you're a sick whore
like me hmm come on dead skin give me
some fucking calories all right now for
lips today we're gonna be using that
Otto Stasi at Beverly Hills eye lip
gloss in shade undressed this is one of
my go-to zhh I just love this now I
really kind of been staying away from
gloss this whole entire year until
recently I think I'm back on this um
little gloss kick I'm ready now these oh
come on pigment and they just smell so
good oh come on this lip gloss is
everything probably one of the best
formulas I've ever tried shout out to
Noor being a bitch alright so this look
just needs a little setting spray
obviously I haven't set my face in a
minute on my channel I feel like this is
like definitely time for a little extra
so we're going to use my little travel
Urban Decay all nighter
you know mix it with a little tatcha
luminous dewy skin mist my all-time
favorites ever let's get the engines
revved and ready both of them require a
little shakedown
all right face are you ready Holy Spirit

father God are we ready let's get to
fucking spraying oh my god yes I'm back
let's keep going oh yes okay this look
is complete all right guys this is the
final look I'm feeling really soft
really gentle now let's get back to the
first impressions real quick and do a
little final recap on the Sirat
foundation wand now it's been a minute
now I obviously finish the look I pause
I put on some hair
I had a few snacks and I'm really loving
this foundation of course I haven't
tested it for hours and hours like I
normally do but like I always say right
off the bat I'm living for it it is a
very human-like shall I say
it just looks very natural very real I'm
looking the viewfinder and I'm feeling
Conti um I really love it you guys it's
really great I think for the price point
there are definitely other stuff out
there that are kind of similar I just
feel like you don't need it but hey it's
expensive foundation do I need it
no but I really really really want it so
is it worth it I think it definitely is
it's very full coverage but also very
natural which I love because having a
cakey face is not cute so I'm obsessed
now of course final thoughts on the
brush I love it I'm gonna use it a lot
more now that I have it um definitely
way too expensive though I'm not sure
what the hair is I'm gonna go google
that and let's just pray it's not
anything crazy now that we are
transitioning into fall I had a lot of
fun sultry dark fall licks coming so if
you guys have any ideas or anything that
you want to see on me leave some
comments down below I definitely am
feeling black lipstick gray lipstick
blue lipstick I'm feeling I mean come on
we gotta bring up unicorn blood at least
16 times this uh fall season but um

always and I will see you on the next
one mwah love you guys
