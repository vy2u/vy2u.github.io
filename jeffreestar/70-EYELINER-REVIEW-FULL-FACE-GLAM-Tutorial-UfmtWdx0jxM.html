comfy and wear my bathrobe wear my wig
cap and I'm just gonna get ready but I
kind of wanted to talk about my hair
surgery for ten seconds because everyone
keeps wondering what in the is
going on under that damn wig cap well I
will have the video up in a few weeks
about the entire surgery the operation
the healing everything we've been
filming it through several doctor's
appointments so I know a lot of you were
like um where's that video but I am
still healing and the hair takes months
to grow so all summer I'm gonna have 30
different hair colors also going to be
reviewing this new liquid liner that I
recently purchased this eye liner is
called this so intense a good liner now
I saw the price tag and I was like
seventy mother-effing dollars for a damn
liquid liner
now I've been using the Kat Von D
trooper liner which looks almost in the
same component of course the design is
way different the cat one is $19 and
it's in Sephora the Sicily one I got
from their website now $70 I was like
this better be good so this is one of
those liners where you take the cap off
and it has that long kind of ink pen
what it looks like you're about to sign
a check or a death wish oh my go getting
let's try this now a lot of these you
guys if you try them they get kind of
dry right so like you use it on half
your lid all of a sudden you're like
where the F is a product interesting
thing about this one the Kat Von D one
you can shake right you can feel the
shaker in there you can hear it this one
silent like there's I don't hear
anything I don't hear anything moving I
don't hear anything so I don't know how
the liner is going to keep coming out
without you forcing it to maybe it just
naturally does which would probably a
gift from Jesus so we're gonna give this
a whirl today and do your extreme black
liner I have already done my full
foundation my brows and a
the contour so if you want to see how I
do that look through my channel bar down
and find the jeffree star official face
routine alright let's get started
as always I'm gonna coat my entire lids
from brow all the way to that lash line
with a white shadow now I want to look
very mannequin very Barbie today so I
found this brand on Instagram they're
called Suva beauty love this cute
packaging now the formula for these is
unreal if you haven't heard of this
brand yet I would definitely check them
out on IG here's one of their palettes
this is the neutral necessity palette
really cute name
now I swatch these on snapchat the other
day oh my god they look really good so
this white one looks amazing it's called
Prohibition pub and I am just going to
be dipping into their morning let's
start blending now I want this really
light under my brow bone so obviously if
you are not really pale like me use a
color that little more suit your skin
tone this one can be really harsh but
I'm going for that doll-like effect
today do you guys ever have this moment
where you kind of like your right
eyebrow more than the left now listen
when you have to draw them on every
single day and try to match them
sometimes I like the right one a little
more and that's definitely happening
today
now I'm going to do some warm toned
little smoky neon drama in my crease
before we try out that liner and I'm
gonna be starting off with my violet vaz
Holy Grail palette I have been using
this so much off-camera like what I've
been going out lately to events and
stuff I've really been obsessed with
this one hi hashtag is like a godsend so
we're going to be dipping into that one
today the brushes this is a Mac two
one seven I'm gonna coat my entire brush
BAM this is such a good warm neutral
color literally MIFA news 8
it so then I'm also going to take some
and bring it a little bit down on the
lash line and I'm just being really soft
and gentle and dragging it out now that
this transition color is laid down I'm
gonna dip into my melt cosmetics
radioactive eyeshadow stack these are so
pretty oh hi good morning the shade is
called radon and I am gonna be placing
this right over what we just did and I'm
gonna start on just that this half of my
eye so just the outer edges or corners
and that white shadow should really help
to blend this and make it look pretty
put a dip into that Orange I'm actually
gonna bring it down I just love the way
neons
look blended out so I'm actually gonna
bring it in even more so this is really
gonna give us that plastic doll-like
appearance with that really dramatic
like oh hi now I'm gonna go back into
this palette and dip into this beautiful
warm chocolate brown the shade is called
Islander and I'm going to take this
little Mac two to one detailer brush and
I'm just going to add in a little bit of
warmth and depth to my crease really
lights almost like we are doing surgery
let me lift up my head a little bit now
there will be liner going there so I'm
not going to connect it if you're like
bitch what the hell time to dry the
system Lee eyeliner we're going to put
it to the test we're gonna give it a
whirl
alright now I'm going to start dragging
the wing now I will say this liner does
have a lot of pigment usually by now I'd
have to like shake and twirl and try to
get more pigment out but this feel like
keeps on coming out I'm surprised the
eyeliner keeps on coming it's kind of
like my last bukkake it's just not
stopping and I still this still has
pigment maybe because it's holding it
down and it's like seeping into the
applicator which would be genius high
but um this is still full of liner like
it's not stopping
one side down one to go
oh jesus take the wheel alright guys we
finally hit our first snag the ink is
drying out or the liner excuse me and it
is getting kind of hard to use this is
not acceptable it is drying up a little
bit so I'm going to close it give it a
minute
and we're back okay so basically we had
to shake it and twirl it and now we're
back okay alright so let's finish this
eye so I want to see how this is gonna
wear throughout the day but so far oh
I'm like I like it I like it a lot
first impressions it's black it's great
full coverage and I need a full coverage
liner now does it beat the Kat Von D
liner it has its pros and cons this
brush is bigger and I felt like I could
do the top part quicker but kind of the
same so do I think it's worth $70 ah not
really sorry I was so high on LSD I
forgot to put my white liner on so I'm
going to take my Mac fascinating as
always and we're just gonna paint that
waterline ghost white but be careful it
doesn't touch the black liner it will
turn gray and I don't want gray my
waterline
once that whites in there bitch it's
over it's like hi game changer now today
before I do my lashes I'm gonna try a
new mascara as well this is the noir
Couture black satin mascara now listen
this kind of looks like the top of my
packaging so I was obviously drawn in by
the Stars this component is really cute
now here's what got me when I saw this
 at the mall y'all see that
okay so we're gonna give it a whirl
today I never used this brand new fresh
out the tube so let's try it together I
don't know how that F you're supposed to
use this but let's try it
not really seeing that much of a
difference here
definitely subtle not really loving this
one in the drawer she goes now Sicily
same brand is the liner they have a new
mascara out got that this week today I
haven't tried it this is the so curl
deep black mascara love this cute little
tube now the brush has a slight little
angle okay cute let's try this one
oh wow okay already uplifting now not
that this is like a huge huge difference
but it definitely lifted my lashes more
like on this side of definitely didn't
know now bottom mascara is very key with
this look because we are doing no shadow
I know it breaks my heart as well it's
really weird but I feel like if you have
no shadow with that white liner it's
very uplifting and very mannequin like
so I'm gonna hope me pray this is not
 up my bottom lashes or our Zambia
problem now today for false lashes I'm
gonna be using the hood of beauty fara
mmm these 3d foam inks girl now when I
talked a few videos ago about lash glue
and how I hated smell you guys like
overwhelmingly scent made thousands of
tweets and snapchats about the house of
lashes glue now you said it smelled
amazing and it was really good and held
on my inner corners so ah so pleasant
I've tried this over the last few days
it does really work great shout out to
house of lashes hi I love you and we're
just going to paint that entire lash and
we're gonna get to glowing
oh these are vicious now for
highlighting ooh do I got something
special for you guys today
so I was shopping around the other day
getting some groceries and bam
wet-and-wild
slapped me and my mother effing faced
with this gorgeous highlighter now when
the store lights ran down this palette
and my eyes first locked on it I was
like oh and cool thing about this it is
a cruelty-free brand
now this shade is called precious petals
and this is only 399 girl I open this up
I tried it the other day delicious so
I'm gonna be dipping it with my honest
ostia a 2/3 brush bam bam it's all you
need girl and I'm just gonna place this
right above my contour this is so pretty
it is like a light golden yellow oh you
see that
mmm like mm-hmm where else am I gonna
put this the Cupid's bow duh Bing can
you see me now now that I'm blinding
everybody let's get down to the lips the
lips today I'm going to do kind of a
classic 90s nude lip I'm gonna start by
using this Mac lip liner in shade hover
and I'm just going to outline my entire
lips and I'm kind of creating a little
ombre effect already by just taking the
pencil and just kind of flicking up
really lightly so it just gives it that
more soft appearance while giving you a
harsh darker line down here alright we
are lip line but now for lipstick today
I'm going to be pulling out a little
Christian Louboutin if you've never seen
this packaging oh I mean this a
full-blooded Instagram and when my
favorite shoe brand created a lipstick I
about died so I picked one of the matte
nude shades um Hines packaging is
amazing
good morning now I'm just going to take
this out of the packaging you just have
to
to screw the top off and it comes out hi
this looks like a Christmas ornament or
it could be a butt plug the packaging is
genius it's expensive it feels amazing
no the shade is called to tell I'm not
sure how you say that I think it's
French so there's that this shade is
such a pretty gorgeous nude let's try it
oh I'm dying I don't need more I'm just
applying more because it just feels so
damn good this is such like a pretty
everyday color now I love to do is I'll
go back in with the lip pencil and I
will just kind of lightly go over the
lines again just so you keep that kind
of ombre effect now I think the only
thing that is stopping me from being
done is a little setting spray and a
damn wig now besides using my favorite
Urban Decay all nighter I found
something new at the mall now Kiehl's
skincare I have loved and adored for a
really long time we have some really
good night creams
hello anti aging now they have a new
spray it's the cactus flower and Tibetan
ginseng hydrating mist oh I was a
mouthful now hi it's green really cute
it smells really fresh so I think I'm
gonna give a little a little double
fisting again today so this one you do
not need to shake this one I'm
definitely gonna be shaken better let's
get to town oh this feels so good okay
so I think I'm hydrated huh a little
more care all right hold on maybe decide
well my ear it feels a little dry okay
now let me get some heroine and finish
this look this is the final look I am
obsessed with this a liner and this
highlight I think the liner did pretty
good until I think this liner was worth
the price not really I think there are
definitely a lot of dupes out there so
this is not a necessity like dick cotton
candy and lip gloss but it was
definitely
but right now I have a huge surprise for
my next video yes I will finally be
swatching and revealing all the shades
in my first-ever eye shadow palette this
is called beauty killer and it comes out
May 25th
no one's seen the inside yet but it's
finally time so let's do on the next one
