Channel today I'm naked and I'm just
trying to live my life so I have
something really special today one of my
favourite fashion brands who have now of
course enter the beauty world a few
years ago
Christian Louboutin Beauty has put out
some brand new products for the eyes so
if we're wondering Geoffrey where's your
eyelashes where's your mascara where's
your eyeliner I'm about to try on some
products that involve all of that so I
just kind of did my make a very minimal
enough where I can try on everything but
still not look like you know a dead mole
rat so I'm really excited because a
little bit ton is oh god they make the
dopest shit so just to recap in case
you're like what the fuck is a brand if
you've ever seen someone wear red
bottoms this is the brand now look at
the slow fur if you're not obsessed with
the shoe like I am log off but no on a
real level you guys this speaks to my
soul fashion is like you know they're
like all pieces of art to me so
Christian Louboutin puts out shoes high
heels loafers sneakers we also put out
amazing bags I mean look at that pink
color are you kidding me I might be the
color inside of my vagina but anyway
today we're going to get back to makeup
of course we are going to be reviewing
and testing out a $75 eyeliner and a $70
mascara yes a brand is ballsy enough to
price point and their makeup that high
but I mean you're paying for the name of
course you're also paying for this
stunning packaging but does the formula
work were of course about to try and
test it out so this is one of the cute
little PR packages that it comes in now
I also got some on my own because there
are more shades than just what came here
today so this is the packaging for the
eyeliner oh my god we're going to take
it out of the box because I am shook us
down to my soul look at this it looks
like a dangerous weapon now everything
that I've showed you already has spikes
on it their brand is very deadly
it looks very dangerous I mean this is
everything now if you've seen their nail
polishes on Sephora or all over the
internet you know the nail polish wand
had this crazy spike as well and then of
course their lipsticks look like amazing
jewels out of a you know
I don't know Queen our king's entire
life and I just think that the packaging
itself is beautiful now the mascara oh
my god okay so I picked this up the
other day and I was like this box is
like heavy this mess scare you guys
first of all probably the prettiest
mascara I've ever seen in my life
it is heavy I'm talking heavy like this
is like I don't know if it's real metal
or what kind of material it is but it is
like oh this one feels a little lighter
than this one this is like a weight like
a paperweight and this one is just kind
of like more normal so today we're going
to be testing out both of these on my
eyes now I only have one shade of
mascara of course in the black but I
also have two other colors so this is
actually literally red because you know
the iconic of course red from all their
shoes got turned into a liner so red
liquid liner which really not a lot of
brands have done that before so I'm
excited to test out this guy and then
there's also two more shades which are
dark navy blue and pitch black which I
cannot wait to try these on my eyes so
if you guys want to see me test out the
new Christian Louboutin makeup - keep on
watching so this guy which oh my god I
must poke down my eye this is the vinyl
luminous ink liner so this does retail
for $75 the Lord Jesus take a wheel
this brand is very prestigious and you
know you are of course going to be
paying for the name like a lot of
products that review before but I am
going to give you guys a little tidbit
about this product obviously I've never
used it before so this product says that
it was inspired by patent leather and
brilliant leather iconic for the house
of Christian Louboutin this finish is
not introduced by the designer for the
eyes okay so basically this is now you
know I like to read the website because
all the claims are important because if
it doesn't work or if it doesn't work
that is what is going to tell us okay
well this is what was supposed to do
here's what it's doing or not doing so
this product is highly pigmented ink
with a glossy Sheen for the eyes that
are lined with intensity so you know a
lot of times when liners dry they are
matte black or their matte this one is
of course a Ledge
they going to have a glossy finish it's
soft and flexible texture ensures that
the formula applies with integrity oh
I've never heard of branding integrity
before in their description I like that
faceted like a precious stone and
slender like a dagger with clean lines
paying homage to calligraphy okay I mean
I let you know I'm a packaging whore if
you've been watching my channel for a
while you know this bitch loves some
good packaging it also says its
innovative blocked applicator delivers
the finest color payoff and ultimate
precision without needing to be reloaded
allowing for both fine lining and bold
tracing all day where smudge proof smear
proof and humidity resistant god damn I
feel like I'm at the doctor right now
like I mentioned before there are three
shades and that's it so also in case
people like to know about the like
ounces and stuff this has 0.135 fluid
ounces which is four milliliters all
right I think this time to test
motherfucker out now of course behind
has a different texture than the eye
some going to just quickly just washing
through the colors on my hands where you
guys will just see first color you know
I'm dying to go in I love a black liner
so this color is called Col great so it
looks something like this and of course
this unscrews and and there she is
work alright so of course the applicator
I'm just going to show this you right
here is a very slender and fine so I'm
just going to take this on the back of
my hand and let's do one little swipe
holy shit that is oh wow that is jarred
black okay work I'm just going to kind
of trace the lines here that is very
nice payoff okay cool amazing
let's swatch the navy blue one now this
one is called lady twist of the cute
name and I don't know what color it is
is I hope it literally is like a navy in
here okay cool so let's give this one a
little swatch oh wow
the color is cool it looks to be maybe a
little more streaky than the black one
it said you're really not supposed to
back in but I might do that anyway but
the color is cool it's almost like a I
thought I was going to be Navy but it's
more like a hot peel type of color and
now you know I've been dying to try to
thread this is the Rouge a little bit
I'm a liner and let's see what she looks
like
oh wow alright and let's give her a
swatch oh wow that is hot red the red
one looks to be item we're going to
obviously going to try on the eye that I
want to say something's like really
streaky or kind of streaky yet but on
the hand it does look a little more like
a less opaque than the other two but
we're glosses dry for a second alright
so it's been about five minutes and this
is I think dry completely I'm just going
to press it hard with my fingers
nothing really let me go down literally
nothing like we're talking what's up and
how are you doing girl Wow okay I mean
it's it's much proof and smear proof and
that is definitely accurate this shit is
fucking dry I think now it's only fair
to test it out on my eyes so I'm going
to grab the black one Shay Cole and I'm
just going to grab a mirror here yes I
am just going to go directly in here
alright here we go
I mean that is some black liner y'all
okay now it said you're really not
supposed to dunk again I think it's just
that but I am going to go in one more
time in here quick little side note is
that the actual brush I just wish it was
almost more like thicker at the base and
then it like King more to like a point
it's not like letting me put the
eyeliner on as best as how I guess maybe
I'm normally used to but let me finish
man I will tell you the rest
all right the liner is dry now let me
just give you some quick sauce well I
think I actually would try out the red
one first to see but it's one of those
formulas where you can kind of feel it
on your eye if that makes sense like
it's not so lightweight where it's like
non-existent it's definitely like has a
more heavy feel you can kind of feel it
on or not that was like a bad thing I
can just tell from one I that this is a
little more like heavy I guess if you
will now the brush I think is maybe my
only complaint about applying it I think
it could have went on a little more
smoothly
it's just kind of like a little more I
don't know as a kind of finesse it a
little bit but when they say smudge
proof like the shit is not coming off
which is amazing so I'm going to
actually try the red liner on the other
eye so I'm about to look a little funky
if you will so let's give this one a
whirl
all right now I'm going to read ring one
more junk in here all right you guys
view red is dry and on my eye I kind of
love this two-toned
liner effect going on here so this one
has the same kind of like brush moment
where I wasn't like obsessed with a
brush but the product went on I think
even a little bit better than it looks
on my hand obviously my eye you know the
skin of my eyelid is a little bit more
nice in the hand but I love this shade
it definitely was not streaky I think
the color payoff was good I've never
really worn hot red eyeliner before so
I'm kind of into it to be really honest
Wow okay I'm presently shocked at red
liner I did not know what to expect at
all and I am pleasantly surprised so
cool okay I'm going to see how this
wears after we try the mascara so let's
move on next product I am going to be
trying out is their mascara so this is
called the lash amplifying lacquer
mascara now there's also a bunch of
crazy French words you guys know I
always watch them I'm not even going to
try let's go try to say that y'all don't
slap me across my mouth so basically
this says the product description is
supposed to deliver a dramatic volume
enhance
the definition length list and curl of
your lashes provides highly concentrated
pigments for fierce color that sets with
a luminous finish for impactful color
that lasts all day so basically I can
suck a dick with this on my mascara
won't run down my face thank you Jesus
all right it also says its design with a
brush uniquely compressed of both
vertical and horizontal bristles to
ensure a smooth and precise application
okay we're going to test that out in a
second the bristles at the tip of course
at the tip of the brush lift and shape
even the smallest of lashes this
packaging is intricately ribbed brass
which is reminiscent of the Art Deco
architecture I mean the are enormous
deficit packaging it's a gold silhouette
is talked with a delicate black shiny
crown dress and spikes and is encased in
a jewelry like box all day aware full
length proof smear proof and again
humidity resistant now this was made in
Italy but assembled in America this
product has no silicone is fragrance
free and without te a tea and I know
that is what we'll look at it later now
this does come in two colors one is up
like a burgundy and then of course we
have the jet black color so let's give
it a whirl alright so let's open her up
and oh wow okay so it has a big
applicator alright so I'm going to try
the one with a black liner first and of
course my lashes have no primer on them
they are just bare from me waking up so
let's try it on
all right I think I'm gonna let that dry
before I do the bottom lashes so Alessi
the difference between the eyes all
right so the mascara is on of course
only on this eye so I'm going to give
you guys a little head turn see if you
guys can notice the difference of course
the sight is blank and naked and then
this side has the mascara all right now
let's do the bottom lashes before I give
seaming a painting into a thigh okay
this is going to sound probably a little
strange to you guys but I actually like
how the brush applied the bottom esker
really versus the top I think that the
top mascara looks cute it is very black
which I love you know some mascara Saul
most like on the gray side where you're
like there's gonna be a little more
black definitely there the pigment is
strong it coated my lashes great I just
feel like the top lashes could be maybe
a little more separated but the bottom
ones I'm kind of like living for it was
very like I don't know high fashion I
love how it's like very thick it is I
mean the pigment is there it's amazing
but um I don't know let me do this I
well let me show you guys first of all
the difference I mean this eye compared
to this obviously you guys can
definitely see the difference down here
up top not like obsessed with it but I'm
living for this moment very like 60
Twiggy alright I just applied to mascara
for the red eyeliner side and I mean
it's been about 10 minutes I took a
little break walked around the house for
a second and I think I'm ready to give
my final pass alright guys it's me not
surprised anyone here but I don't think
that I can really justify the price
point for the results that I got today I
mean here's a battle with reviewing
luxury items you all know you are paying
for this brass metal huge stunning
beautiful packaging I don't know what
people think high price points are going
to bring them
I mean mascara is mascara of course
there are different wands did I
necessarily love this wand I mean it was
cute it wasn't horrendous definitely
love the bottom lashes way more than the
top I think the top it did what a normal
match
gara maybe even from the drugstore would
do it's kind of basic there was nothing
mind-blowing about it I think they're
packaging how it looks is mind-blowing
it feels like a like a brick and it's
amazing I love feeling it I love looking
at it I think if you love to put things
on your vanity and you like collecting
things this is a really cute collection
for you but I don't think that the
mascara is worth $70 overall because
you're really just getting a mascara I
think you know something like even
benefit roller lash mascara even might
be a little better I kind of like that
wand better for me personally I don't
think my lashes like any more amazing or
crazy than they normally do if that
makes sense
I'm moving on to the liner now I do love
this packaging obviously it is deadly
I'm like oh hi Dexter
but um all jokes aside I love how this
load is obviously stunning if this was
sitting by my vanity it's obviously
going to get a lot of attention now the
formula now that it's been more than
five minutes it doesn't really have that
heavy effect maybe because it's both you
know because on both eyes I'm not really
noticing it the black liner was very
pigmented as well as the red the red was
like a tiny bit more streaky but you
guys see full coverage on my eye I mean
I really can't complain about that I
just don't think that the formula was
like mind-blowing where I couldn't you
know pick up a Mac liner or something
else or a tart liner and kind of get the
same effect you know what I mean I just
didn't love the tip mmm no but I really
didn't love the tip I felt like it
should have been a little more pointed I
guess it just kind of like dragged a
little it on this minute like a little
bumpy or a little streaky where I
definitely I'm like this OCD right now
like I just want to go up and clean it
with a brush so bad but I want you guys
to see the real results it's not like a
crazy negative for me I didn't hate this
at all I also didn't love it I keep
saying it I'm obsessed with packaging
that's just who I am but I really can't
justify seventy and seventy five dollar
price points for you guys out there
because I didn't get my you know my mind
blown away with the result
all in all these guys I think is just
going to get a jeffree star approval
sadly I don't think so now that is not
where it's like in previous videos where
I'm like oh my god the formula flop I
just think for the price point it's like
short show out but hey that's the brand
new meaning for right now I'm going to
go on a date with Nathan and by the time
that you guys are watching this I will
be on Richard Branson's and Necker
Island with Benefit Cosmetics with Manny
and Nathan and Laura Lee and everyone
else so I'm probably getting a sunburn
right now but um it doesn't thank you
guys as always for watching and I'll see
you on the next one ma bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
