Cosmo and Wanda show yes hi
wait we really do look like Cosmo yeah
and Wanda what's the little other
character's name timmy turner timmy
turner that has to be man your zag all
right hi guys welcome back to our
channel or my channel whatever the fuck
I mean we're kind of we're like Siamese
twins but not related okay this is
getting weird
hi guys all right we're back for another
we're going we're going we're back for
some more skincare and I can't even
speak because this one is a weird one so
I asked you guys all in a I've asked you
in a few videos if there's any crazy
expensive products you guys want us or
me to try just to see if it's really
good or full of shit so I got a lot of
links to this crazy brand called trace
or rare now these boxes are really big
you guys kept sending me this link like
oh my god please try it out is this a
legit brand what do these products do
and I had never heard this brand before
so we were like okay let's try them out
there's two products that you're
supposed to use together so this is the
ultimate pearl facial peel and what do
you got babe the ultimate pearl
protecting and defending cream cover
well allegedly this is supposed to what
the fuck is supposed to do I bet I guess
as plant stem cells and what do we got
here we got witch hazel in here we got
glycerin and I guess this is just
supposed to really help your skin and
just feel magical so I guess trace or
rare means a rare treasure in French
that's at the box says so if it's wrong
it's not my fault and we couldn't figure
out where this came from like where is
this made is amazing
San Diego is it Holland I don't fucking
know and there's no answers online so
I'm scared to put this on my face we're
gonna keep it really hood and if I'm
scared he's fucking shook yes a little
bit so I've seen a lot of crazy reviews
and of course people say a bunch of shit
about everything so I wanted to find out
for myself so we're gonna try this out
today and if my skin melts off it was
really good seeing you all but the thing
is is when you go to look up this brand
there's a lot of reviews saying that
it's like a scam or people have renamed
the brand a few times and they're like I
don't even know so it's hard to put your
finger on what's actually going on I
have no idea exactly now I know there's
stores in different countries I know a
lot of people sell this like a
wholesaler so I don't like it no but it
comes in this gorgeous unit garden okay
so let's just get to that I love the box
I think it's cute and it's Ft I think
the packaging looks really cute it feels
heavy so it was really expensive now
these are both four hundred dollars each
so it's a $800 little treatment girl
okay so this is the packaging gold kind
of like baby pink really pretty what
else does it come with comes with this
little utensil thing here I don't really
know maybe to apply to your face oh this
is just scoop it up so you don't touch
it with your nails like you know me I'm
just I'll scoop it out with a fingernail
I've washed my hands and they're clean
but who knows what some people are doing
so I guess even this kind of feels
expensive ya know it feels heavy because
some brands feels a little cheap so this
peel is supposed to be first and then
we're gonna follow it up with that yes
so let's open this and see what the
hell's going on in here oh now this did
have a little protectant seal which I
peeled off earlier because I was like
what does this even look like I'm scared
so this facial peel is supposed to
cleanse brighten deep pollute in
condition of skin creating a softer and
lighter and fresher looking complexion
rare blend of ingredients to thoroughly
and comfortably remove dead skin
oh it's also supposed to remove excess
oil and impurities leaving the skin
feeling flawless okay so it says to
massage
in small circular motions and then on to
dry skin which we have weight one to two
minutes and remove by massaging again
until the peeling effect occurs what the
hell avoid applying to the eye contour
area so we're gonna avoid the under eye
area where the skin is really soft um
let's just go ahead and try this oh the
texture looks crazy it's really gelling
to me the smell is almost like a dude
Cologne I don't know what you think it's
fresh it smells really friend's a little
strong
alright so I guess we're gonna take this
oh my god the texture is crazy it's like
is this flubber you know right it looks
kind of like glue almost I'm just trying
let's just go for it together
oh my god I'm fucking scared oh my god
is already dead skin coming above my
face
that's not even dry yet feels like it's
just like watering down like really like
oh shit you see that skin is skin on
like fingers oh my god it's like you're
supposed to leave this on or yeah for
one to two minutes and all just want it
too much yeah okay I know little dick
right now you're not used to look at me
using my nail like fuck it oh my god has
the weirdest texture it's like she's
just weird mm-hmm oh my god the dead
skin is already coming up what does he
have faces oh my god it's all over my
fucking hand show your hands girl what
the lack to smell I still don't love it
it smells kind of weird I can't tell if
it's taking the skin off my face or off
my fingers maybe both okay so I guess
we're gonna wait two minutes I think
it's already been 60 seconds yeah I know
it's pretty quick so we're gonna wait
literally one and we'll be right back
okay it's been literally 60 seconds
let's rub off and see what happens I
guess let's check it out now it says
when you're wiping it off or rubbing to
be a little more harder than how we
applied it so I guess let's go in see
what happens oh oh shit oh my god semi
skin people oh oh my mom sees my long
nails and I'm sure everyone's gonna read
me down but put my face just feeling a
little tingly after rubbing it oh really
not like hurt tingly like it just like
sensitive
okay okay and then it says to wipe off
with warm water to get off all the
residue all right it's time to go get a
washcloth and I'll wipe this stuff on
whoo what do we wear how I feel
ah I mean my fate my skin feels pretty
smooth mine's a little red right here I
think maybe where the razor was a little
bit ago I think I did remember reading
on alcohol on it too as well y'all know
I hate with alcohol in my face but the
alcohol ingredient on here is very low
on very very far down it's after a leaf
extract and I don't know what the fuck
is sure teams but over half way down
over half way down which who knows what
that could really mean because people
lie in their packaging which some other
brands on Instagram I'm definitely doing
that so anyway okay back to the real tea
like it's like a little tightening but
kind of not almost like there's a
barrier on it now or something I don't
know right yeah I guess I could I could
see that it doesn't feel like my skin
yeah it was like a weird robotic version
which I don't know if that's good or bad
but okay so I guess let's move on to the
ultimate pearl moisturizer now this says
a rare blend of ingredients that's what
the last one said the same shit okay
treats the skin leaving it feeling
luxuriously comfortable and supple oh
application put it on cleanse skin and
soft circular motions okay what happened
that one baby
now I don't know if pearls is really
good for your skin I'm gonna have to
research that later okay what does this
one look like pure white it looks like
it's a very gooey consistency look so
this one smells better than the other
four right now yeah does it feel
moisturizing I'm scared look at me being
a pussy I'm like I don't want to do it
don't feel too good
hmm how are we feeling about our skin
okay for you mmm that's really it's
actually pretty smooth I feels nice yeah
well I'm ash look up baby
my for it feels really fucking smooth
which is crazy so weird because it
doesn't feel like really moisturizing
now like moisturizing
right I just feel smooth I just feel
like clear eyes for a dry you guys this
is crazy my skin like feels different
like my brain is like this is a good
thing just a bad thing right it's not
fully moisturized to me it feels like I
don't have to explain it this is so
crazy and I've had explain something
this is fucking weird it feels like
really slick
well teen sam'l I don't know if the like
product created maybe a little barrier I
mean it's just a deep loop maybe it's
like not letting anything in now the
crazy thing is when I was trying to find
other reviews on YouTube
we heard crickets like there was really
no one talking about it except um their
own channel which is bizarre so I don't
know how to like compare others
experiences so I think we should go hit
the bong and we'll be back in 30 minutes
and we're gonna see if it feels any
different because I'm choked just a
little word Zak we're feeling it alright
so this is crazy
listen this price point is fucking
ridiculous lo there's that right now of
course we all know I've gone off the
deep end before but I kind of wanted to
hate this just because there was really
no information about the brand online so
of course that's a little sketchy right
yeah just a little bit um so I was a
little sketchy and I saw some weird
reviews from people yeah got like they
got scammed yeah I said you know the
fish got really dry afterwards so we
were tripping like yes and I don't like
to listen when people say of course we
all have our own experience exactly but
my skin kind of feels great my skin
feels like silky it's weird like I said
earlier it almost feels like there's
like a barrier between my like when I'm
touching it and the skins like my
fingers to my face
almost but it just feels it feels thanks
yeah no it feels different I was really
scared when I was reading some stuff not
gonna lie so we were a little nervous in
the intro now we haven't use this for a
long period of time so I think we're
gonna try it a few more times right yeah
definitely my face feels great we're
currently in London right now and we're
see what happens after we use this for a
week yeah now overall the packaging was
heavy it felt fierce yeah um the gel was
kind of weird
yeah was didn't love putting that on all
that dead skin and like the mess was not
my favorite thing so that was a little
negative for me yeah it was just it was
a little weird it felt a little tension
on the face didn't like the smell a
normal boy stur Iser or even a primer
like y'all know I love my Bobby Brown
face base it feels really like plump and
like kind of like creamy you know that
cream moisture feel and this doesn't
have it it was so watery like turned
into nothing it's like the second it
touches your skin yeah it was weird but
I don't feel dry no which is what I was
scared of which was yeah it's bizarre
well I guess we're just gonna have to
keep on exploring this now would I
recommend this for anyone I don't know
because I don't know what the fuck I'm
feeling right now alright but as always
you guys thank you so much for watching
us and we'll see you on the next one
ceiling bye guys uh oh my god I can't
speak on mmm oh my fuck oh alright
oh oh moisturizer no spills and pearls
I ain't smelling them pearl</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
