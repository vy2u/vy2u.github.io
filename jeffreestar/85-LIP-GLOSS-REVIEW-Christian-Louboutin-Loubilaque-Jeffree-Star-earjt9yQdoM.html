channel today we're going to do at first
impressions on one of my favorite
designers Christian Louboutin put out
nail polish and lipstick alas twas the
last year I think it was yes and there
was a lot of controversy the packaging
was dangerous the price points were
crazy and now they have a third product
when I saw these lip glosses which I'm
about to reveal right now I was like oh
my god like this shit looks real good
but I've heard so many mixed reviews
from so many youtubers and a lot of
bloggers and the rating on sephora.com
is Conti so I was like okay well let me
get these for myself and let's give them
a whirl now I gotta say right off the
bat that Christian Louboutin is the shoe
god and if you've ever seen red bottoms
that is a Louboutin a staple shoe I know
most of you rolling your eyes in the
back of your head like bitch we already
know but they make some of my favorite
shoes ever like their men's sneakers are
so fucking hot I'm obsessed with these
I'm just obsessed with anything mr. Ross
skis and they do really bitchy heels
like this amazing mustard velvet that I
just had to have and then come on you
guys let's get some funky boots I love
wearing weird boots and this come on I'm
like okay I see you so they're just
unreal one of my favorite brands ever
these are called the Lu black lip
lacquers now there are eight shades they
are $85 a piece which of course I think
is a little crazy but let's remember you
are paying for the packaging which is
unreal so it comes in this big box which
is pretty huge for just a single lip
gloss and then you open it and it's like
ahh boom if that doesn't make your head
turn I don't know what will they come in
this gorgeous clear packaging with gold
on it it looks like a big Christmas
ornament it could be a spear to stab
someone in the eye it could be a butt
plug it's really you know whatever you
want to see so anyway it comes in this
velvet case which i think is so pretty
and then you can also you know
feeling up to it you can put this on
your neck you can wrap it around let's
pull this guy out it comes with like
this little yarn type string thing on it
with the name of this just say the name
of the shade on it oh it doesn't well
nevermind
it just says a little bit laughs lip
lacquer and that is that I like to
personally take these off with the
lipsticks that they came out with I took
all these off as well it's just easier
to use so this is what it looks like
it's like a good morning um it also
comes with a little bag that is
underneath the velvet thing and I don't
know this is really something that I
would personally use but I guess if you
want to put it on the go you can just
slip it in it looks like a little condom
and you can just Center up like
someone's waist on Instagram and call it
a day now I got all eight of these oh my
god it's like raining LaBeouf's on me so
I bought these with my own money of
course I know a lot of you were gonna be
like bitch has way too much more lip
gloss I am of course trying these on
camera and if you are a makeup artist
makeup is a tax write-off
I am NOT gonna do all eight in my mouth
is probably gonna fall off but I'm gonna
do five for you guys and there are
different ranges of colors some of them
are like hot pink ooh that one's calling
my name and then there's other ones that
are more like dark burgundy there's
nudes and then oh my red so I'm gonna do
five out of the eight for you guys and I
was doing a little research on them so
we can really know what the tea is and
this says that this is a transformative
dramatic lip lacquer to create a
brilliant bold color with high shine
finish so these are supposed to be like
glass on your mouth so we're gonna put
it to the test today this says that this
is mr. Christian Louboutins most
dramatic lip formula to date I'm like a
little brutal Street and it says that
they are bold sexy and arresting it says
that these are specifically formulated
to reflect light this lip color takes on
a brilliant dimension so I think we need
to put these to the test today and see
if these are really worth this much
money and if they even work so if you
want to see me swatch all these then
keep on watching as you can see there is
nothing on my lips I have prepped them
with my own of the lower lip scrub it's
just a sugar based scrub that is
and edible and it gets away all the dry
skin and whatever the fuck else do you
might have on your mouth
okay so let's dive in now all the shade
names are derived from French and I'm
gonna put all the shade names on the
bottom of the screen right here so if I
don't say one you'll know why and you
can read me for it later all right so
let's dive in now this pink one this one
is called a bikini hi can I know what
that's I know what that means no bikini
is a really gorgeous soft like baby pink
of course I haven't tried any of these
yet so this does feel really heavy and
nice it doesn't feel cheap at all it
feels very expensive like look at that
detail hmm Oh Mike hi mr. play games the
gold is really pretty it has the spikes
like they have on some of their shoes
and let's dive in alright so let's see
how long the one is oh okay very cute
and I love that dope foot it is flat you
can really get the curves of your lips
oh wow
the fragrance is really strong it kinda
reminds me of like kind of floral e like
a YSL or your lipstick it's not like
crazy overpowering where I want to like
die like those Milani liquid lips oh my
god it is a little floral e I'm more of
like the sweet sugar type of person
that's the sense that I love but this is
not horrific now my fingers are really
long so this a flick here is a little
short but I don't hate it I'm checking
to see if it's sticky definitely not
which is a plus I hate like when you go
and your lips are like glued together or
they feel really crazy this does not
have that issue I love that it's not
really sticky that's a really good thing
for me I'm like huh okay now the weird
thing is is that once it's on your mouth
since it's not a dry down product like a
liquid lip it definitely still smells
strong so like as I'm breathing in right
now the fragrance is like actually not I
don't yeah I guess it's kind of
bothering me I'm like let's just keep it
really real here I'm like oh wow so
let's try a different color and see if
it's the same all right now the second
one I'm going to try is this hot pink
I'm like Hello pink this one is called
Bengali and
so pretty well let's give it a whirl I
love how bright this is it better look
right on my lips Wow
okay so right off the bat it is very
shiny but I almost feel like the lighter
pink had more coverage right away
see if I like that a little girl okay
for me this one is a lot harder to apply
you see the streaking it is I know it's
a very high glossy so I'm sure all my
beauty lights are making it look really
crazy but like this is really patchy I'm
like ah now this one still has that
really intense smell so while it's
sitting here on my mouth my nose is like
oh girl I'm like I need something else
for a minute ah I'm back okay so this
one definitely is Street here I'm
looking at my monitor people always ask
what the fuck you looking at over there
it's my monitor and yes definitely a
little more patchy than bikini so okay
great let's wipe this one off and try a
nude shade now before I try what I was
going to tell you guys that in-between
swatches I wipe them off with a wipe and
then I take my Beauty Blender that has a
little bit of foundation on it I just
kind of buff everything out so there's
no residue of makeup remover on your
mouth I don't think it's fair to try
something when it ain't gonna work if
you had makeup remover on your fucking
lips let's get to is such a pretty nude
brown shade this almost looks like my
celebrity skin it is really gorgeous and
I'm holding it at the light it looks
like there's like little flakes of like
glitter or shimmer in there I love
anything that sparkles now this one is
called a Kenya a canet ya girl this is
how you spell if someone help me out
here still has that really strong
fragrance I'm like girl you need to tone
it down okay so this one does apply a
little streak like that last one but not
too bad I think also because it's a nude
it's a little more unlike you know it's
a little more
where is the penguin up here come on now
okay now this shade is really pretty but
it's definitely a little streaky I'm
kind of like going over and over I'm
kind of like finessing the product in
which happened sometimes I know it
sounds so repetitive and annoying I
really can't get over the fragrance I'm
like I'm like really tasting in my mouth
it's like I think as I'm talking my
tongue is kind of touching my lips and
it's kind of like taking away a tiny bit
because I'm like oh I don't want to wear
it now there are some darker shades
which I'm like oh I really want to try
this hot red which is like literally
looks like the bottom of the soul so
let's try the dark red in this Burgundy
and see if there is any difference
all right now the hot red one literally
looks like the bottom of one of the
shoes and this is just called Rouge
Louboutin yes it literally matches the
shoe which i think is genius the
packaging is different than the regular
one it comes in black only and the side
is red and the normal ones are gold
which they did in the lipsticks as well
and I think it is so cute when it comes
with a silver and gold cap instead of
all gold so let's give this one a whirl
oh okay red oh I mean I love a good red
and already I'm like boom all right now
since I make cosmetics I'm definitely
intrigued by these because the very
first one I tried bikini that lighter
pink has the same consistency as this
one
where there is a lot of pigment whereas
the two in the middle were a little more
sheer so for some reason these ones have
more pigment added which I'm not sure
why the formula is not consistent across
the board but as you can see this one
looks like oh my god it looks like AG
like full pigment whereas some of the
other ones I was like huh like that is
so pretty
alright Wow I'm like oh my god this one
is so pretty it's making my teeth look
ferocious this one it definitely has a
lot more pigment than the last two and
if I didn't smell so strong I feel like
this is Mike might be my new favorite
red gloss I'm just such a fan of red
this color is stunning it looks like red
glass is sitting on my lips and I love
it
this might be my favorite one so far now
there's one more I want to try it like a
dark burgundy so let me take this off
and we'll give that one a spin you know
the last shade I'm gonna try my mouth is
like yeah it is this amazing like dark
burgundy color this is called Casa
novella and let's see how she works this
one looks really pretty I'm like okay
whoo yes okay is it just me or just not
as pigmented as the last one that hot
red like it's cute but it's kind of
drinking this dark one is hard to put on
it looks cute on my monitor I'm not sure
how it looks to y'all but it's like
streaky as all hell
okay now this color was a good idea but
this one does not apply good the darker
one is like worse than all of them I
think I don't know like it looks cute
over here on this monitor on here and in
real life with my mirror I'm like I
don't love it I'm like let's do final
thoughts because I really want to wipe
this off I never thought I would be
disappointed in a little baton and
beauty product but I gotta say these
smell so strong I know I've like said
that a billion times and they're all
like I'm sure honey like every time I
breathe in and that taste I'm not over
it I'm like this is my wife but with all
the colors I'm like I need this off
right now I'm like uh-huh
all right I had to take that off my
mouth is like please help me now okay
final thoughts you guys ready for him
now I am such a fan of Louboutin in
general I've already said that but I
gotta say this product was a huge
disappointment for me for $85 I expected
it to pay my electric bill and be the
best lip gloss on the planet and it just
fell flat for me I think the fragrance
is way too strong they need to tone it
down
I definitely think you're paying for the
name this is very you know collectible
the packaging is amazing I can't ever
fault them for that this looks stunning
there is nothing cheap
on the packaging whatsoever so I feel
like if you want to buy a few to try I
definitely think the red one this one is
the best one and I think it was my
favorite so I'm gonna go drink a Red
Bull and heat some sentiment alight and
try to get this taste out of my mouth if
you have any recommendations on anything
you want me to try of course leave some
feedback in the comments below and I
will see you guys in the next one bye
guys
mm-wha so let's try and I do it now this
color is stunning I love a little oh um
you see that that's on my motherfucking
- ah and the back one oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
