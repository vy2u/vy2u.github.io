Channel today I'm jet-lagged and mommy
needs her redbull but besides that we
are going to test out some $85 metallic
lip glosses I know that price is a
ridiculous y'all you know what's up with
this channel
now I've had a little bit of a rough
time with the Christian Louboutin beauty
brand on my channel a lot of stuff has
not been that great in the past now I
will say this like I said in all of my
videos that I've used with their stuff I
am obsessed with Christian at Louboutin
shoes and bags I have a half a million
dollars of sneakers in my fucking closet
so a lot of people were like girl you're
just like throwing shade and my girl I'm
obsessed I went to the Christian
Louboutin store and France I've had
custom-made shoes buy them at the beauty
department girl I don't know what's
going on hopefully today we're gonna
have a better experience and yes we are
trying out a metallic lip gloss it is
supposed to be high shine and it
supposed to be dramatic assist be
beautiful and of course we're going to
test them out now there are only three
shades and there are all different
colors so we're going to swatch them
today we're going to try them all out on
my mouth we're going to do everything
that I normally do in a first
impressions but besides that you guys
life has been so crazy today I actually
filmed with Shane Dawson for his Shane
and Friends podcast oh my god
I live for him who wants to take Shane
on my channel let me know that was so
much fun
so that would be out soon girl I spilled
so much gene he like pulled out of me
like Oprah I was like fuck man she said
that all right besides that if you want
to see me test all these crazy lip
glosses then keep on watching alright so
for $85 you guys let me show you what
you get it comes in a gorgeous box like
this of course with the logo on the
front and if you see on the side it says
the name of the colors alright so let's
open her up whoo and this is what it
looks like now I tested out the normal
regular lip glosses months ago on my
channel now this of course is the
metallic version that just staring at it
you can see it looks metallic in the
bottle
now it comes in this beautiful this
becomes her packaging and it has a
little like kind of string yarn type of
thing
and you pull it out and it comes with a
little tag on it just says the same
brand info on the little card a lot of
people last time said this looks like a
weapon a lot of you said of butt plug
y'all are sick you are sick so it has
this beautiful top on it with the spiked
ring around it no and not a cock ring
and let's open her up oh my lord
sounded like Nathan coming out of me
okay so the doe foot is a pointed a
little moment like that which is a
standard flocking now let's do the smell
test okay it does have the same like
floral smell as being normal one that
doesn't seem as intense maybe I'm a
little stuff you guys I've been on three
airplanes in a week and my allergies are
crazy
but um yeah so it's like rosy but I feel
like the normal ones were like way more
intense you guys know if you watch that
video girl so basically let's just keep
it real here it says a lip formula with
brilliant intense color and a glassy
finish to emphasize lip color I'm
assuming it means a normal lipstick or
my we'll call my original lip color cool
so I will test it on myself of course
without any product and then maybe the
last color I'll put a lipstick on and
see what it looks like over because it
does say it's supposed to emphasize lip
color now it says let's see here y'all
it says from new to bright the array of
shades are specifically formulated to
reflect light and impart brilliant
dimension at the end of the day it is
just a lip gloss of course it is not
going to you know change lives or pay my
electricity bills so let's get just
watching alright now just like last
video at these shade names you guys I am
NOT going to pretend and know how to
pronounce these or try you know I'm the
realest motherfucking bitch on this
YouTube game so we are going to put them
right below me right here and this shade
is called
that's what's called thrust of the P
girl alright so this is going to be of
course one dis of product I always like
to tell you guys how many times I dip in
a lot of people show it off camera and
I'm a little bit it take you six times
or one ho now of course the one a little
short but it feels really nice to hold
in my hand I
love the we're gonna call the applicator
alright alright so that is one stiff let
me go back in
oh one more time okay and then we're
going to go in for a third time to
finish the rest of my big old mouth all
right
the color is of course and now on quick
note I wish that this part of the
applicator was longer or flatter like I
just want a little more product on the
wand but besides that let me take a good
long hard look at this now I'm looking
in the monitor and it looks like glass
it really does it's like huh it looks
really pretty I'm like okay hold up hold
up you guys hold up here's the deal it's
really pretty it is really pretty but
okay I mean I haven't even tried the
other two yet but I'm just going to say
this right now this looks like it could
be a covergirl lip gloss could be Revlon
lip gloss it could be really any lip
gloss but yeah it's just pretty I love
the color I bet you this over like a red
or a pink lipstick would be stunning
but um okay cool I think it's only fair
that we try the other team all right
here is the second shade it looks
something like this to me it looks like
a pinky bronze with a beautiful like
gold kind of vibe going on in there and
the shade name for this one is right
there alright let's watch
so here is the shade fully on the mouth
and it is really pretty I almost like it
more than the first one just because
that glitter looks really nice and the
base color is very close to my natural
lip color but it's a little more like a
bronze hue only thing I'm not living for
is when I go sit right in there a little
gumminess I don't like embossing to do
that it's like oh yes cue alright let's
try the last one
alright now for the third shade of a lip
gloss it looks something like this
it looks like a stunning gold bronze
color now I did want to test it over a
lipstick because it says on the website
of course that it looks amazing over a
already you know established lip color
so at the color I'm wearing today
because I know you're all are going to
ask it is the creme brulee liquid
lipstick from the brand's away cosmetics
and if you guys are not aware I have my
very own first first-ever discount code
for brand and if you use code J star at
checkout you do get 15% off and a
hundred percent of the proceeds are
going to charity and if you don't know
about it you can watch my may favorites
video which I will link down below I
explained everything in there and
already you guys in less than a month we
have already raised almost twenty
thousand dollars for the LGBT Center
here in Los Angeles and for the whole
organization so you guys are fucking
amazing thank you so much for supporting
this brand and my code thus far it has
been unreal and I didn't know we need to
make that much in a year and the fact
that it's been like weeks I am like
shook so thank you guys so much
alright now let's test this lip color
over this and liquid licky
and let's see what happens
now obviously this gloss has a little
dark like tench to it which I kind of
love how it's making this nude lipstick
look let's finish the rest all right you
guys this is how the color looks I think
over a liquid lip it looks really pretty
course it does have that glass like
shiny effect they're talking about but I
mean that's kind of every lip gloss
right I mean obviously some are more
shining than others but it does look
pretty it's not like getting as gummy as
when it's by itself I will say that yeah
it doesn't really feel sticky it's a
little tacky but not like horrendous or
like your lips are stuck together and I
feel nice and now I will say this you
guys I think it's time to give my final
thought all right so let's break it down
now the very first review I did in the
normal lip glosses the smell is in my
mouth it was a very intense these do not
do that they smell way less intense than
the original formula which thank you
Jesus now I will say this of course
we're gonna I say this a lot when I do
luxury reviews you're of course paying
for the stunning packaging you're paying
for the name which is a very high-end
luxury brand their sneakers start at you
know twelve hundred dollars so when
you're making a makeup line they're not
going to price this drugstore and you
guys obviously know that at the end of
the day it's a lip gloss like I know I
said in the intro it's not going to like
you know changes the world but it wasn't
so stunning where I was like oh my god I
want to use this all the time I'm gonna
be a little shady and talk about Chanel
new formula of lip glosses they are like
mirrors on your mouth and they are like
blinding and so stunning and they have
no like texture at all these ones you do
feel a little bit of something and of
course they're the lipstick underneath
but um I was hoping for a little more I
mean it says metallic and like to me
metallic is like metallic we all know
what a metallic lip gloss or lipstick
looks like I mean they're all in the
drugstore Milani has a whole entire
metallic line on a soft Beverly Hills
has metallic lipglosses these were not
metallic in my opinion they were like
glossy with some shimmer but I think at
the end of the day lip gloss is lip
gloss and of course $85 gets you this
amazing packaging but the formula was
very basic it was basic as fuck let's
keep it hood now not saying that this is
a horrible experience or like this was
the end of the world but I don't think I
could approve it just on the basis of
light girl it's just a lip gloss opposed
to that first one I'm like I honestly
feel like you can go to Ulta find a
gloss way cheaper and maybe have even a
better glossy experience so at the end
of the day you know I love this brand
but I am NOT impressed you guys I am
hoping for the next round of products to
have better coverage and a better
formula so if anyone is watching that
works for that team if you want to
Jeffrey star to come help curate call me
all right you guys thank you is so much
for watching this video I will see you
on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
