channel hi how are ya in today's video
we are going to do another battle of the
foundations now it's been a while since
I've done a drugstore versus a luxury
battle but today I had to because I was
shopping and there is something new in
the drugstore that I had to grab but
then I got sent something that made my
hair fall out when you see a price tag
that says a hundred and twenty seven
dollars for a foundation you just kind
of stop yourself look in the mirror and
say so in today's video we are going to
be battling them both out we are going
to do check-ins throughout the day so we
can see what really happens in the next
few hours or maybe even eight or ten
hours let's be honest I might even have
sex and see if it lasts but in the
meantime we are going to sit down today
and talk about drugstore versus a luxury
so if you're someone that just wants to
pop a redbull and join me girl
have a seat because the tea is gonna be
scalding in today's video alright you
guys I am not even gonna run my mouth
today I want to talk like this but I
promise I won't
first of all shout out to all of you for
loving my first ever ASMR video last
week that was so much fun to record and
I kind of want to do a tutorial a makeup
tutorial and ASMR do you guys want that
I think you do so sound off below but
I'm gonna film one for fun I think it'd
be really relaxing and chill just get
really lit and just whisper through
everything but that will come later
besides that you guys let's dive into
this review alright y'all so in alsa a
brand that i have been really loving
lately makeup revolution they have a
brand new foundation stick now you guys
let's just let's just see what it looks
like first of all they come and I got
every color okay BAM I had to get a
bunch of colors I'm actually gonna go on
their website to count there is 18
shades to start so I think that is a lot
and the range is actually really good
it's not like seventeen shades of white
and like one darker shade it's like a
really nice mix of everything is very
inclusive so hi makeup revolution that's
how we should be doing it this product
is called the fast base stick foundation
now like I said it does come in 18
shades the packaging looks like this it
is like a slimmer aligned just nude
stick with the little rose gold logo
the trimming on it now when you open it
up it does look like this now I'm gonna
use this today for contour foundation
and maybe even highlight so the range is
beautiful this shade is f-14 I'm
actually gonna use it to contour I love
cream contours I know I don't do that a
lot on this channel but I live for it
and then for foundation we're gonna use
shade I think f3 and for i have not
matched myself with ease yet I just kind
of held it up and guessed but we're just
gonna see what happens today
now this product retails for nine
dollars is a good price and when you go
on their website it says foundation just
got faster and this is gonna quickly
perfect contour and highlight my
complexion easy to apply stick formula
melts into skin blending seamlessly to
leave a fresh and dewy finish okay so it
is dewy so if you are someone that is
really oily I don't know if you're gonna
live for this formula we will see in a
minute days since I've been trying a lot
of makeup
recently I have a pimple so I'm actually
not mad about it because you can
actually see the coverage of this
foundation when I apply and also I tried
to get rid of this blackhead it came out
but look at that more marks girl what's
going on we're just gonna cover up all
of my anxiety and all my blemishes today
so besides that how do we even apply
this foundation we're just gonna use our
damp Beauty sponge maybe a brush I don't
think so I always love applying it with
this and we're going to do that today on
the right side of my face so hi
drugstore is going here now for this
side of the face next foundation retails
for a hundred and twenty seven dollars
now that's not the most expensive
foundation I've tried on this channel I
did review the world's most expensive
foundation I think I was like around 250
girl I can't I know can't relate but if
you want to see that it's in my channel
somewhere search for it you will be
shook but I have no idea what's about to
happen today but I do want to brief you
that lemare actually makes one of my
favorite foundations of all time the
soft fluids give her a little shake so
it looks pretty
now this foundation is around I think
110 dollars so I know 100 just 27 it's
not that shocking I'm sure a lot of you
were like girl spare us this is amazing
it's one of my favorites all-time and I
know it's bougie as but today they
made something even more bougie now the
weird thing about this is this is not
available in America
so if you end up liking it or if I end
up loving it and you want to try it I
don't know we'll have to talk about it
and address it but lemare actually did
send me these in PR these are two shades
we have pink porcelain and warm ivory oh
boy let's hope and pray that these
actually match me now they do come in a
box like this lemare always has bougie
amazing packaging so let's open it up
for the first time and see what the hell
is in here now on the back all the
ingredients all the like instructions or
what it says are all in different
languages
there's no English formula was made and
perfected in Korea it's supposed to be
amazing now it is a cushion foundation
it's called the luminous lifting cushion
foundation with SPF 20 thank God now
this is only available in Korea and
Australia at the moment when I was
looking up the info I'm like girl why
can't you get this in America not today
great when you open it it looks like
this oh it's like a obviously a cushion
compact duh what else did I think it was
gonna be there's anything else in this
box we got to open this this is a
trapdoor Oh there definitely is more oh
I think the foundation that you put in
is actually here so it does come with
this or maybe it's a refill I don't know
you guys we'll find out together and
there's also a little instruction manual
besides that just a little carton
nothing else alright first of all let's
open up the compact so it does have a
little cellophane moment so there's no
fingerprints it's very luxurious love it
it doesn't feel the heaviest but it does
feel nice and when you look at it it
just say the shade name at the back and
that's it just as the name
this has 0.42 ounces now normal
foundation bottles have a full fluid
ounce this one has a little less but it
is a cushion and it is different so we
shall see oh alright so you open it up
just like that and there is the little
sponge on the website it says the sponge
you actually should use it to apply
which you guys know I'm not about using
the stuff that comes with it but we will
attempt it if it says we're supposed to
now you open it up like this okay this
has to be a refill you guys I swear to
god it has to be right yeah there's the
shade name okay so it does come with two
so you're I think you're getting two
foundations unless I'm wrong huh oh my
god yeah there it is it's literally like
ready to
go oh my god smells really fresh like
skincare bujji fresh and I love that
we're gonna have to open up the other
one just to see what the shade looks
like and then let's get to applying so I
just opened up the other shade warm
ivory number 13 and it definitely looks
like it's more up my alley not as fair
so I'm gonna try it you guys we're gonna
give it a whirl in a minute
it's too luxury first then if the
drugstore ones bad or amazing we'll have
something really funny to compare it to
this side is going to be for luxury let
me scoot in you're supposed to apply
this with the sponge so we're of course
we're gonna prep our skin like I
normally would so let's get out our of
course notorious Bobbie Brown a vitamin
enriched face base I've gotten so many
Beauty people and makeup artists onto
this it is one of the best just skin
nourishing primers I've ever used it's
not blurring it's not pore filling but I
feel like if you just push it into your
skin with the Beauty Blender it kind of
does fill your pores for you and you
don't need anything else oh let's just
dive into this y'all we're gonna use
their little cushion that comes with the
foundation first of all when a brand has
to make a whole entire like shebang now
you guys know my lip for the mirror so
let's really read this here okay so
another thing about this brand they're
gonna tell you about the journey all the
ingredients what's happening in here
basically is gonna give me a renewing
moisture and legendary skincare benefits
you better work this is fresh it's
lightweight formula it's gonna blend
right into my skin has skincare benefits
it is perfectly portable it brings a
lifted luminosity to the skin and that
creates a look of healthy and an even
complexion anytime anywhere alright
let's just apply this now normally when
brands come like with this type of
I'm like girl it's $127 this feels like
it's I don't know from the 99-cent store
so let's do it y'all let's see what's
about to happen so I'm gonna show you
we're gonna zoom in here we're just
going to show you what it looks like
this is the cushion when you touch it
with the clean sponge lightly let's see
oh it's there honey it is there all
right now let's just Pat it in
I'm scared
whoa if you've been watching this
channel for a long time you know that
miss thing right here doesn't really do
cushion foundations I haven't really
reviewed that many all right so we are
padding this into the skin my gut is
like oh my god just grab a Beauty
Blender and it would be so much quicker
but we're gonna play by the rules oh I
do have gloss on and I discovered it
whoops see it is hard to get in these
cracks so I might pull out the Beauty
Blender in a second all right the Spiner
worked amazing it pressed it into my
skin beautifully but to get just around
my crevices I am gonna use a little
Beauty Blender here and it may share it
out we will find out in a second we'll
get right in that nose crack there we go
sponge was not getting the crevices but
honey Wow
little shook not gonna lie I really
don't do cushion foundations I don't
wear them at all so I didn't know what
to expect I was like girl come on I mean
you gotta stop but overall first
impressions my skin looks healthy it's a
very luminous it's glowy I love the
finish obviously I'm gonna do concealer
a setting powder and like set my face
and all that but like overall I'm like
it's been on for a minute so I'm just
gonna take a clean hand and feel okay
barely like tacky but not crazy I've had
foundations before word thing and it's a
little scary but this is shockingly like
wow so far so good
alright well you guys are gonna see how
it looks as it starts to settle into the
skin because we're about to apply the
drugs strong foundation highly requested
so I'm glad you guys told me to get this
there concealer of course I've mentioned
it and used it a lot on this channel
it's like gonna be empty soon I love
this this is like seven dollars and it's
like better than shape tape did I just
say that foundation I don't know what
colors are gonna match me we're just
gonna open up a few and see what the
hell is gonna happen here let's see f
two three and four
let's just give it a whirl okay this is
f - I'm just gonna swatch this on my
face really quickly oh wow that looks a
little pale let's go to f3 oh wow girl
mom you don't look that bad y'all f f2
is a no-go honey and then just for shits
and giggles let's try F for here
Oh No okay I think we're gonna go with
let's try it three all right let me wipe
this and remoisturize right back let's
just try f3 y'all and see what happens
so we may have a little different shades
going on over here
alright so first of all we got to see if
this pimple on this little scar are
gonna be covered so BAM we'll see how
that blends out oh wow it's thick so I
might not even need this much so we'll
find out in a second
bye-bye pimple on the forehead go to
hell all right let's see how this looks
I have no idea what's about to happen is
it gonna oxidize is it gonna stay the
same
oh this is looking really luminous and
pretty so far I'm blending out looking
in the monitor now I like to put some
right on the brow because they do of
course shave them but the pores can show
through sometimes so I like to really
push in there and get them all I'm like
why am i shocked at how this looks right
now like bitch okay
now usually during a battle we know what
it is we know the T already when we cuz
we could start talking now of course the
big difference let's talk about it right
now
this foundation like it said was more
dewy so if you are a combination or oily
I'm not sure if you're gonna want this
look of course this is just with my base
and the foundation blended and there's
nothing else on here yet so let's just
do a side-by-side comparison and now of
course this is the lemare luxury side of
course the shade is slightly darker
which I don't mind we can fix it once we
start blending everything like concealer
and contour but this side it still has a
little luminosity to the skin but it's
more like a demi matte whereas this side
as you turn the face is a lot more shiny
like of course it's split down the
middle so it's a little more like oh
then over here it's like now the only
thing I notice is that it didn't
completely cover my pimple right here
which of course you can go in let's just
do a little more I mean that's what
we're here for right bam bam bam we're
just gonna add that right on top it's
like hi we need you to be covered honey
so we'll just take our Beauty Blender
again and just press over that lightly
the redness is gone now of course I
could have done a color corrector under
it which I don't really do I'm like
bitch just give me the full coverage and
keep it moving
only thing I'm noticing as I'm talking
is that this side has a little bit more
issues with like coming into your smile
lines or maybe my pores are showing a
tiny bit more than this side but of
course you can use a different primer or
troubleshoot that when you start to buff
and blend with powders in a second all
right I mean we're halfway in the video
what do you guys think so far do you
like the dewy side do we like the mists
drugstore or are we feeling miss luxury
I am Not sure but what I quickly want to
do is put on some concealer and contour
and then
we'll do check-ins throughout the day so
let's get started it's only fitting that
I use the concealed and defined makeup
revolution concealer with their
foundation of course let's see if the
formulas mix they may not love each
other the shade is this for everyone
asking c1 all right we're just gonna do
of course the drugstore side how I'm
gonna do the chin or just kind of do a
little okay we're gonna have to do this
over here this is hilarious now normally
I would do a lighter concealer a little
bit but I don't mind this one so let's
just blend her out same beauty blender
for everything cuz why not wow I mean
that blended a really nicely into the
skin gave me maybe a little more
coverage that I was looking for and
first impressions these I'm really well
together so far this is looking really
snatched alright now for the luxury side
we're gonna use I have so many
concealers we have Laura Mercier
okay let's use Miss k'kaw I didn't do a
review on this because everyone else on
YouTube it knows that girl but the
formulas cute I like it now this
probably is gonna be a little lighter oh
yes but it's a little more sheer than
you makeup revolution so we'll see um
and of course you guys same blender
all right this site is definitely
looking a little brighter only because
the makeup revolution concealer was not
as light as this one so I'm just gonna
add a drop over here so I don't look too
mismatched I'm just gonna do a little
boom boom
but you guys both concealers are looking
great over these foundations I'm a
little I'm a little shocked so now we're
gonna go in with shade f-14 now since
these are very pigmented I'm not gonna
go crazy we're just gonna do a little
bit and see how it looks we're just
gonna start right here and just do a and
that's it BAM and let's do a little show
we do the nose yet do we need to do the
forehead we will see in a second my hair
is in the way
now you can blend this out with a Beauty
Blender you can blend this out with this
synthetic brush lipstick NIC always uses
this on me so let me let's just pretend
that she's here in spirit and just blend
this in now of course if you guys are
like oh my god bitch that looks insane
that's when you go with your Beauty
Blender and you just sheer it out into
your skin so now we're just gonna buff
and blend this right into your cheek
bones yes now of course I'm sure the
color at first was a little like oh my
god Geoffrey that's a little too dark
for you no it's actually not it blends
in really nicely and with the foundation
and concealer this is looking really
cute all right you guys we are boland it
actually took this and I put it over
here on the forehead on the jaw bitch
she's looking contoured I'm gonna do a
little bit there now I am going to of
course use some setting powder and some
foundation powder all over the skin and
then I will be right back and then we
will give some thoughts it's only fair
that I set my bronzer in contour with
the lemare bronzer some high-end
 on this channel y'all no wait
it's looking cute you know I do want to
say one thing I think I put too much of
the other shade over here this side I
didn't do it as much and I think I like
it better so I'm just kind of putting
some powder over it but so far pretty
good now let's zoom in a little bit and
let's talk about how the foundation is
sitting it's been about 20 minutes now
all right let's talk about the makeup
revolution side now as I was applying
the powder and blending it out the
coverage came off a little bit on my
blemish like look at you can see through
it again
so not the fullest coverage you didn't
say it was supposed to be so I'm not mad
at it
definitely go in with something a little
heavier if I was gonna leave the house
which I do have to do that later the
foundation looks great the concealer
definitely held amazing so far it just
looks really pretty like I'm kind of
shook about it I'm like okay hmm let's
move on over to the cushion lemare side
I really like how this looks like I just
feel like in this area it just looks a
lot more like Oh like I don't know just
it's luxurious it looks good so far so
good over here as well everything
blended out flawlessly so all right you
guys you know the drill I am going to
finish the rest of my face I'm gonna go
about my day but I'm gonna grab my vlog
camera and do some check-ins throughout
the days I don't know what I'm doing
today there's a lot going on here I'm
just like we're going somewhere so we
will check in throughout the day and
give our final thoughts of course at the
end all right you guys it has been about
only 4550 minutes since I'm about to do
my full glam but I wanted to come
outside let the dogs out for a minute oh
hey oh yeah good foundation review oh
really misses you
okay so we're doing a foundation battle
so literally like straight down yeah go
back behind the camera take a long look
at me for a second so one side has $127
foundation one side has a nine dollar
foundation I'm not gonna tell you which
one but what do you do you notice
anything different it can even tell the
difference and people can't even they're
like it looks the same yeah well I mean
I feel like I can see more creasing on
the left side over here okay bit more I
feel like it's falling over there cracks
a little more okay and what about this
side I mean this definitely looks a
little bit more matte seems like over
there look more like pretty like skin or
like what do you think I mean I think it
looks good I mean it looks a little
drier on the right side too does it a
little gum this side yeah Matt oh you're
right my left yeah I know it's okay the
viewer is like huh I know so you're
sitting a little more dry on this side
though mhm okay that's so funny okay
this is one tell what it is yeah this is
the Dewey nine dollar one so it's more
hydrating makes like this is supposed to
still be luminous but I
setting powder and everything over it
but this is the mayor oh so that's the
expensive stuff yeah they definitely
look different
okay good to know all right well you
know men don't lie well unless you're
Tristan that's horrible
okay shots of Chloe girl stay strong
okay so I am gonna go finish my makeup
and let's see how it looks throughout
the day so I just ran errands it's been
about three hours a little different
don't I throwing a wig and I filmed an
entire whole other video that's already
on my channel but let's look in the
direct sunlight and see what the hell is
happening with my face so drugstore is
over here luxury lemare over here now
anything that I am noticing oh okay not
gonna lie Nate was very correct this
site is very like flat and over here you
can definitely see my smile lines a
little more than this side and sometimes
foundations cuz they can't even like
accentuate things that you didn't know
you had and sometimes it happens here
from me or do I need a facelift when he
Juvederm oh just kidding
nothing crazy is happening - the little
fine lines and this wig hair in my
 eyes all right so far so good
now I'm about to go on a little dip date
and we'll check it in a little bit all
right you guys it is 9:30 8:00 p.m. you
sell bread my eyes are I got contacts
and lashes on
I've been chillin I just ate in and out
if you've never had any now it is the
best fast food in California the
foundation let's talk about it guys okay
so it's been on for hours and hours and
overall I mean the lemare site looks
beautiful there's like no cracking it's
still smooth you can kind of see my
pores a little bit but girl it's been a
minute since this has been on and I
think it looks beautiful now moving on
over here from the makeup revolution
side it looks a little more like
luminous than this one but I like it
it's not like a negative there is some
cracking here here what do you think
Nate what do you think definitely have
to agree with what you're saying if you
were to pick a winner which one would it
be
beside well your left side
oh ho I was like you like the lemare
side
yes yeah it does look really really
pretty I will say this that this one for
a nine dollar price point is amazing of
course we talked about it does look dewy
so if you don't like that finish you can
of course matte it down with a powder
but mmm for nine dollars I bought the
cupboard is really good you can still
see my pimple right here a tiny tiny bit
but overall like pretty good you guys I
will say though there where is it where
is it the LA mayor let's say the
official name the LA mayor luminous
lifting cushion foundation is the winner
and it's jeffree star approved I really
like this formula how many times am I
gonna say really really really really
really okay but this formula is
beautiful it's gorgeous I didn't know I
would ever fall in love with a cushion
foundation and I am a fan so I want to
definitely use this all over my entire
face in the next video and then we can
really put it to the test for like just
how stunning it is but overall for this
one 9 dollars bitch come on like it's
nine dollars it's great I love it
look at me 10 hours later let's
blend alright you guys I am starving oh
no that was not that was not a good idea
sorry makeup revolution I live for you I
can't wait to see what they come out
with next they are killing it lately in
that concealer I'm sorry
bitch but lawless alright I need to go
to bed cheers I love you guys and I'll
see you on the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
