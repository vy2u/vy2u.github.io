highlight your face what's up everybody
welcome back to my channel today we're
basically going to be diving into a
battle of the highlighters we're going
to test out the brand new Maybelline
master chrome highlighter versus a
luxury brand that is a forty two dollars
for a highlighter Lord Jesus so today I
thought you know what there are so many
highlighters that have hit this summer
Maybelline has definitely come out with
a lot of products as well so I'm like
you know what let's try out both they're
both gold they both look cute they both
look allegedly blinding we'll have to
see in a second so if you guys are into
blinding highlighters or you want to see
if a luxury brand can finally be a
drugstore brand on my channel then keep
on watching look so I got this
highlighter in the mail today okay I
want to talk about the new Maybelline
master chrome metallic highlighter okay
so I did a little finger swatch on
snapchat and I was a little like okay
well shook so I kind of already know
that this is good I'm just going to put
it out there for you guys I know a lot
of you have seen these on other people's
channels you have them yourself this
highlighter is pretty cool this is
literally only $9.99 which is very good
for a highlighter so today we are going
to be battling it against the Charlotte
Tilbury bar of gold now I'm going to
just say this right here right off the
bat we're going to try this one first
but here is the kicker when I saw this
online okay let me just show you what I
saw on my phone when I saw this online I
thought oh my god this is like a brick
of gold it's going to be big like in my
head I'm going to be so real with you
guys nothing new but I thought it was
going to be like this size like a brick
that you open it's a big pan and it just
looks stunning this is tiny I'm just
going to put this up there
this product is $42 like what the fuck
Charlotte what's your tea girl because
this is let me just let me just say it's
a little over price I'm like girl so
let's open her up now the design the the
way it's put in there at the idea of
like a gold brick is genius I think it's
great I love the stamping I think it
looks really cool I
just wish it was bigger and for $42 this
little dinky cardboard you guys this is
cardboard it's not even plastic it's not
glass I mean there's no glass
highlighter was really but at least
plastic Maybelline is like plastic and
hard this one you guys literally like
this is cardboard $42 for some cardboard
and not that much products um I was a
little angry I'll be honest when I saw
this I was like when looking at how much
product is in both of these the
Charlotte Tilbury barbed gold has 0.15
ounces the Maybelline highlighter has
zero point of 24 ounces in there so
that's I mean almost I mean that's a lot
more clearly but of course we are going
to try out the formula that's what we're
here to see does it blind as a glow is
it amazing or not I think we should try
this one out first now on the website
you guys it says that this is a
delicately fine
gilded formula that will give you a
instant glamour of a Bond girl okay
luxurious pure gold pearls illuminate
the skin and soft focus any
imperfections for a lit from within glow
so this is literally telling you guys
that it's going to give me a soft focus
appearance so you know we all know that
sometimes we'll use highlighter than our
pores will look really intense I guess
this is going to minimize that and then
also says that you can create a radiant
glossy complexion in just five gentle
strokes y'all know what I'm thinking
right now across the cheekbones temples
nose Cupid's bow and decolletage the
light reflecting highlighter Slim's and
sculpts as it transforms this is a big
spiel for a tiny little highlighter I'm
like what are they going to do pay my
taxes and put gas in my car all right
last but not least it is ideal for
lifting dull skin hiding imperfections
and adding that red carpet-ready
finish to your look hiding imperfections
I don't know about that okay well that's
a lot of claims for a highlighter so I'm
going to apply them with morphe little
packer highlighting brushes this is what
I personally use every day so we got the
M 510
and then we're going to use the Y 14 on
the other side so for the drug store 1
we will use this for Charlotte Tilbury
we will use this so I just go in here
and there's no obviously instructions of
how to apply it's like you dip you put
it on and let's see if it works let's
figure out how the kickback is I'm going
to take my cling brush and just go like
this okay I see little brush little
marks from it being in there so I'm just
going to go back and forth and coat the
brush cool I think that should be enough
let's see what this looks like so for
everyone out there watching we will do
the luxury on the right side and then be
maybelline on the other side here goes
nothing ok I mean that's shockingly a
more pigmented than I definitely thought
ok but let me move it let me go in with
one more little layer I want to go up
here and I'm going to go up all the way
into the hairline and then I'm going to
do the temples on the side ok so I don't
know about hiding imperfections now I do
have this tiny little indent in my in my
skin here from childhood but also you
guys my pores which you can definitely
see once the highlight hit it it didn't
really hide imperfections but let's keep
it real there's no denying that it does
have pigment and as I move my face it
looks pretty it does it looks kind of
soft and like look as you see I'm moving
my face it does give you that kind of
like wet highlighting look which I
personally do love I love when the skin
looks a little like damp and golden what
I like to do and I'll do it on both
sides I'll just take like a brush and
we'll just go in there I'm gonna put
that right below the brow bone oh yeah I
mean as you see you guys definitely has
pigment and it looks really pretty
alright you guys so this actually looks
really really pretty so I want to try
the Maybelline metallic highlighter now
so let's go on their website and see
what the hell this is allegedly going to
do to me alright so this says that it's
going to heat up my look with a warm
metallic sheen featuring reflective
pigments for an eye-catching chrome
effect so this also says it's going to
deliver a look of a melted metallic
highlight in an easy to apply
highlighting powder how do you apply it
step 1 apply with brush or
tips step to sweep on to targeted areas
such as cheekbones brow bones bridge of
the nose and then it says step 3 blend
for a seamless metallic glow that's
pretty standard I like that version a
little more than the other one with its
10 statement I'm going to go in with
this clean working brush only complaint
I have about drugstore products would
like to have this little sticker here
and it's really annoying like I have to
get like a little exacto knife or
scissors and like slice it so it was a
little bit annoying to get open when you
have long nails but anyway it besides
that let's see if it works
let's swirl it all around ooh so when
you hit oh hi definitely see it's on the
brush when you dig in here it does leave
a little imprint and it kind of like
changes the pattern so you can see she's
been a little bit used right in there
shake off the excess let's see how this
look bitch oh my god I like it barely
dipped in there and I'm like holy shit
girl get some fucking sunglasses bitch
okay so I use this once on actually not
even myself on a friend the other day
because she was like I don't have any
highlight I want to wear some so I put
this on her and I was like okay I don't
really like pay attention to it but on
my own skin right now I'm like whoa that
looks really pretty okay so let me take
the same brush and do a little brow bone
highlighting that looks really pretty
girl whoa okay now let's take this and
go in a little bit here and let's just
do right here shun all right now this
did say to put a little bit on the nose
they keep it the bow so let's just do
right here a little bit okay you know
what's crazy now that these are both on
my face let's just do a little head turn
for a minute so of course this is the
alleged Cherie side the bar of gold and
this side is the Maybelline so let's do
a little head turn and see what is going
on okay so this is kind of crazy but I'm
looking in the monitor and I almost feel
like this is a dupe like literally it
looks really similar but I'm not going
to lie why do I feel like the Maybelline
one soften my pores even more than the
other one like this one's cute but I can
definitely see that area and then you go
over here and it looks more minimized
I'm like hmmm alright so I'm going to go
back in with this one and just try out a
few more areas of my face let's just do
the cube as well while we're at it that
is cute it looks like I just drink some
gold milk
all right besides that area we can
always do a little bit on the chin now
let's just take this and do this side of
my collarbones mm-hmm looks cute yeah
the tones of these are really similar
like this one is a little more like gold
gold but this is really close it's like
huh do we get a dew point our hands or
what I'm just going to take my clean
finger if you guys and actually go in
with this okay and then I'm going to go
into this oh my god is still so soft
touch oh wow okay maybe it's my
foundation but now that they're all my
fingers they do not look identical at
all as you can see this is the charlotte
tilbury one it is definitely more of a
pale yellow gold and then this one is
straight-up like gold so you can see the
difference on here on my face I don't
see that big of a difference but I will
say that the Maybelline one to me is
more
blinding it has more coverage it's
definitely thicker I'm just going to put
this on my hand so Charlotte Tilbury one
BAM
still really pretty I mean here is the
Maybelline one BAM so there is the
side-by-side comparison Wow my face it
really looks more similar maybe it's my
bronzer in the contour anyway I think
I'm ready to give my final thoughts
alright you guys so I'm going to give
you my pros and cons and to me the
Maybelline master chrome highlighter
definitely won and why do I say that
first of all it's 999 you can you see
the state girl we're going to cheat now
for $42 this has a lot of cons to me now
the formula it did work I do want to put
it out there you guys saw it first hand
this is the bar of gold I think it's
pretty I love the tone of the gold and
the formula is beautiful I did not do as
much as it said it was going to do my
girl fuckin highlighter but at the end
of the day I think the drugstore one is
definitely more triumphant and it looks
stunning now here's the Realty for $42 I
just don't think that there's enough
product in here and the fact that it is
like kind of cheap cardboard there's no
mirror it is literally miniature like
can we hold them up next to each other
I'm my girl what the Hale I mean I don't
know now I do want to note that both
formulas did work I definitely recommend
the Maybelline one more I think it's
more blinding it was more creamy add
more coverage Maybelline you have a hit
because this is a really stunning so if
you guys are in the drugstore and you
can grab this grab it it's crazy when I
started my channel you guys like I was
like only luxury and I'm still a luxury
brand whore but the drugstore are like
really coming for just everybody and I'm
a little shook by it I'm a shaky aside
about you guys I am just living in the
moment with life and this highlighter is
everything like I don't know I'm just
like obsessed a bit I'm like oh my god
this looks so pretty
hmm yes it's like it's like a good
setting powder actually like if you're
just someone that loves the glow this is
setting powder for your life I'm
obsessed aren't you guys thank you so
much for watching today's video if you
are a highlighter addict like me
I put up your right hand and say Amen
sister thank you guys so much for
watching this review and as always I'll
see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
