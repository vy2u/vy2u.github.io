channel now for today's look I'm gonna
be diving into the new honest ostia
beverly hills collection
y'all know I've been using their
for a long time I may be keeping my
brows a Senesh for years they just put
out their fall collection and hey am I
already in love so a few days ago I did
my September favorites and I used the
master palette by Mario from honest
Topsy at Beverly Hills and I created
this crazy really dramatic smokey eye
and everyone was like okay you better
recruit that look movie so of course I
decided to change it up slightly give it
a little more extra drama now besides
the Mario palette they also have the
ultimate glow kit which looks something
like this and I used a few highlighters
for my looks today now you know these
cheeks are always by lining now since
fall season is upon us I promise you all
that my website would be a fully restock
soon so I just want to give a quick
little shout out to jeffree star
cosmetics calm there are a lot of liquid
lips that have just returned and there's
more coming this weekend my skin Frost's
are back and rolling out baby and
blinding worldwide so hop on that
website if you've been missing out or
have been wanting something so besides
that you guys I want to give you a
little update on daddy my new Pomerania
next week I'll be doing a pet tag and he
just wakes you guys see more footage of
him playing it is the cutest thing in
the world and I know I say the Oh word a
lot but I'm obsessed with him so if you
guys want to see how I created all this
craziness to keep on watching to get
started on this look we need of course a
face primer you can use any primer that
you want I'm still obsessed with the new
Sicily primer I know the price point is
a little while but the way this made my
foundation look all last week I was a
little
sure not gonna lie so fingers are nice
and wet I'm just gonna massage this and
into the skin
oh the fragrance of this smells so good
for foundation we're going to be using
the hourglass vanish stick now this has
so much pigment last time I use it on
camera I use a lot so for today I'm
going to be going in with shade ivory
and then for under the eyes we're gonna
go really light with shade belong what
in our kidneys components are you guys
know I love our glass with this
foundation if you're scared of pigment
you're gonna want to run away from these
but this literally covers every nook and
cranny baby so time to blend
now this foundation is so pigmented I
actually used the lightest shade to
highlight under the eyes a little bit of
the forehead and cancel the redness and
any discoloration I had on my eyelids so
now we are all even and it's definitely
time for some powder foundation now
usually I do concealer this foundation
is so thick you actually don't need any
thank God but you all know I can't live
without my Mac Shivering white Studio
Fix so I'm gonna take a little bit of
this and a little bit of brush and we're
just gonna really intensify the under
eyes so we are like woah come on Betty
White you better work now I'm
just gonna highlight a few areas that I
didn't put that really light foundation
on including the chin of course and then
a little bit on them smile lines hi and
then of course we got to finish off the
forehead all right now with that more
feet III brush I'm going to be dipping
into my Giorgio Armani luminous silk
powder compact and we're just going to
basically set the face with more
foundation and just kind of go around
all the areas that I didn't highlight
and make sure it is set
face is set now I'm quickly going to pop
on some brows off-camera and if you want
to see how I do my brows you can scroll
way down to my channel and find the
official face routine and all that info
will be in there so I'll be right back
all right now let's play with the master
palette by Mario from Anastacio Beverly
Hills now this palette she's a versatile
I use this in my September favorites to
create that crazy eye look and people
were like oh and we love that I can you
please recreate it so I'm going to do a
variation of that look using this
palette today now this one you can
literally create I think about ten looks
from this from the darks and the frost
shades to the warm tones like it's just
a really amazing palette so I've been
playing with it for the last few days
mmm as y'all can zoom in and see
definitely would feel of these two a lot
so for the crease color I'm going to be
using shade Isabel it is a warm toned
perfect transition shade I'm gonna be
just grabbing a little two to four
blending brush from Mac and we're just
gonna pop this in a little right above
our crease now my eyelids are basically
primed from all that foundation and
powder so we're not going to really
prime it but if you feel like you need
to prime then baby prime up so since
we're going to do a little shadow wing
we are just going to make this
transition color go a little outside the
box if you will
all right now to really intensify and
get a good base down for the smoky eye
I'm gonna be going in with the cream
color shadow from Tom Ford and this is
shade caviar it is a really pretty like
gunmetal black gray and come on girl
come out to play it looks a little
something like this now I'm gonna be
going in with the Chanel eyeshadow
Wallenda brush and I'm just gonna swirl
in a little bit now this is like kind of
very creamy and it goes on really
pigmented those so like just a little
hair well y'all see that pigment this
 is like whoa so I'm just gonna take
this and just put it up right there so
I'm just gonna stop right in there and
just tuck it in and we are going to be
putting a lot of shadows over this but
this is just a really good base to make
sure the eye is somebuggy and
then because this brush really doesn't
get into the tiny corners I'm just going
to take a little Mac 239 and just barely
get some on the brush and then we're
just going to take it and tuck it into
the corner so it fits in there perfectly
and that's that it doesn't have to be
perfect because remember we are gonna be
putting shadows over it and really
blending it out so there we have it I'm
done with the Tom Ford caviar cream
shadow it looks a little something like
this
now I'm going to do a little baking
under my eyes with the Laura Mercier
translucent right before I do this
extreme smokey eye cuz I'm going to be
blending in a lot of color so I'm just
gonna take my damp Beauty Blender and of
course we're just gonna pack powder
under the eyes when I say pack we're
gonna use a lot and notice how I usually
contour and do my highlighting before
eye shadow just because I love to get to
the desert first but for the first time
in a long time I'm gonna do that after
obviously this is not gonna look cute
until I brush it all away but for now
under eyes are baking and now let's get
to the eye shadow all right now we're
first gonna go in with shade Claudia it
is like a cool gunmetal grey black with
a Frost type formula and we're just
gonna take this and blend up and out now
we're gonna make this really really
dramatic so this powder is actually
gonna help us we're just gonna go in and
just kind of flick up with the brush and
kind of create a little wing type of
look but without eyeliner we're just
going to use the shadows today now I'm
gonna take this a little more feet
detailer brush and go back into Claudia
wait a minute girl for watching this I
didn't mean it like that
now I'm just gonna take this little
brush and flick out so it creates that
really bitchy wing look that I love and
then we're gonna go back in with this
guy and I'm just gonna barely tap Isabel
BAM and then we're just gonna blend over
what we already did and just kind of
merge them and let them have a baby
alright so we should look a little
something like this now we're gonna
actually take the shade Bronx and we're
gonna go with that same Chanel brush
from earlier and we're just gonna get
our brush coated in this now this is
like a such a pretty emerald fall green
and we're gonna definitely smoke out our
lashline with this but for this part I
just want to press it in the middle of
the lid and just kind of give it a
little extra dimension and some color oh
look at how that looks over the black
like mmm mmm yummy real quickly I'm just
gonna be dipping into my favorite white
eyeshadow from busy art this is from the
editorial palette and I'm just quickly
going to run this over right below my
brow and just kind of blend out and of
course this is extreme smokey we're
going up and away my eyes are gonna look
crazy big and we're just gonna blend
this out all right now the top is really
pretty much done of course you can add
in glitter if you want anything crazy
but I think we're ready to get to the
under eyes so to start this off I am
going to take my Mac smolder eye pencil
my favorite black that I've been using
since I was a teenager and we're just
going to put this in the waterline a
real quick
now this does not have to be perfect
because we're about to go in and really
shade out the ender eye and smoke a Phi
that HOH so you can just dab this in
here really quick now we're going to go
in with their little pointy tomforde
eyeshadow brush and we're going to dip
into Broncs again now this is a very
pigmented I've barely touched it it's
like high and we're just going to take
this and really just smoke out the under
eye so we're going to use that black
eyeliner and go over it with a shadow
and then drag it across the full
under-eye inky now it's time to get rid
of all that fallout because I went in on
that smoky eye so the under eyes are
Senesh now I'm just going to take a
little brush and say a silent prayer and
be really careful I'm just gonna flick
up in a way
and voila were snatched now I think it's
definitely time for some lashes for
mascara of course I'm going in as my
trusty benefit or roller lash we're just
gonna Co our lashes from top to bottom
and get them all ready for them falsies
now for lashes I'm gonna be going in
with the lower lashes in style fluff and
wispy now these are really bold and
dramatic just how I like them so I'm
just going to quickly pop them on
off-camera and I'll be right back for
contour today we're going to be going in
with the Tom Ford flesh blush if you
will now a lot of people are like well
if it's blush aren't you just putting on
blush but the way I use this is really
like contour and we're just going to
follow the chisel nosov this face and
just go in like this is our contour
color and this Seurat Beauty blush brush
I've been using this for contour a lot
lately and it just really gets it in
there and looks really airbrushed so I'm
such a fan of this brush you're gonna
get up in that hairline and go all the
way back now when you lay that color
down you're going to pull out that brush
you used earlier to set the face and
we're just gonna dust around the contour
and make it really sharp and then I'll
go in and add a little more now to warm
up the rest of the face we're is gonna
be going in with that Chanel bronzer it
is almost like a creamy I guess is like
a cream formula I love it I just take
the little same brush from Chanel that
it's supposed to be for I just swore lit
around and then we're just gonna go in
on this hairline because I'm gonna wear
a wig later and really make this makeup
pop with some blonde hair so we're just
gonna dust this around the hairline and
really just give me a little cloud for
highlighting we're gonna go into the new
ultimate glow kit from honest hacia
beverly hills and she looks a little
like this girl these colors though what
all right so I think for a little inner
corner highlight I'm gonna be dipping
into shade of snow so I'm just gonna add
this right and
here okay I didn't even have to wet the
brush with fix+ or anything I see you
we're just gonna tuck that right in
there I love it
a little goes a long way and that's what
I like now for the cheeks we're gonna be
dipping into white sand with a little
morphe 310 brush and of course we're not
just gonna use one highlight today we're
definitely going to be using two but
first starters we're just gonna get this
cheekbone rolling and I'm gonna place
this directly above that coral contour
now I think the Glo kits before this I
think have way more kind of like sparkle
or like intense glow so this is a really
pretty palette if you want that glow
from within it's still metallic and the
cheekbones look sickening but I
definitely think the moonchild one is a
little more pigmented but this one I'm
like mmm my cheeks are looking a really
cute I think to layer I'm gonna do some
of the colors snow on top and let's dip
into snow and layer and we're just gonna
put that right on top ooh these look
really pretty together now we're gonna
go back in with snow and just do a
little under the brow highlight in the
middle give our face some attention all
right now I'm gonna be going in with it
morphe 5:10 we're just gonna hit that
snow color one more time and do a little
on the Cupid's bow and then of course a
little on the nose notice how I really
didn't contour my nose today I'm
actually just gonna leave it alone let
it breathe uh eyes are so dramatic my
nose is like please don't touch me today
so besides that guys we just need some
lips so what am I gonna use today for
lips we're going to be using my lip
ammunition and shade celebrity skin I
think any nude with a crazy dark smoky
eye just looks classic so I'm gonna be
going with this little dark nude color
the lip is done I don't think it needs
any gloss I was about to add some but
I'm like you know what I think we're
good now last but not least where the
hell is my same spray now I'm gonna be
using my Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray give her a little shake and let's
get this face snatched and drenched
alright and I think this look is
complete alright guys this is the final
look
with the Anastacio Beverly Hills I'm
Mario and master palette I am feeling
this dark smoky jarama
and I mean it's fall season I think I
mean you know I'd wear this in the
summer don't get a bitch twisted but I
think that this look is perfect for any
event if you just want to roll around in
bed and have a slumber party if you want
to be on your knees I don't give a
girl but this is a multi Universal
