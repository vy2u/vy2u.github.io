what's up everyone welcome to my channel
if you're new hi how are you my name is
Jeffrey I'm just a sweet country
Christian gal with a dream and here we
are and I just can't believe that I get
to make up everyday okay but for real hi
guys I missed you so I've had a really
crazy month there has been so much going
on besides traveling a lot I recently
got in that crazy car accident thank God
for Geico full coverage because I was
able to get the full entire cost of my
car it was a total loss and it was all
paid for thank you Jesus so you know I
just can't believe that I'm even here
and I'm even able to you know have a
brand and have a successful business so
I'm like you know what I literally you
know not to be morbid but I could have
died a few weeks ago so I was like
having a realization like you know what
if I can you know buy things that I've
always dreamed of buying why am I being
apprehensive about it I literally have
one life and it's so short on this earth
I was like you know what I'm buying
something I've wanted since I was 12 so
after I got my settlement check I walked
into that Lamborghini dealership and I
said hi my name is Miss Star and I would
like one so I can't believe it you guys
but I bought a Lamborghini Huracan it is
the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen
no my hobbies and things that I love or
make up cars and caulk so I just want to
say one thing you know it's not about
materialistic items it's about your
goals that you set for yourself and one
of my goals was to have a Lambo and have
a business and you know it's not about
the cars and the jewelry and all that
bullshit because when you're on your
deathbed that shit is not gonna matter
but it was a moment for me because I I
never would have dreamed of having that
ever in my driveway so you know it's
crazy but I just want to say that anyone
can do it look at me I am just one guy
in makeup that started out with just
hopes and dreams and I did not fit it in
high school
no one really believed in me and if I
can do it you definitely can so not to
sound like a motivational speaker but
honestly go after your dream stop living
for everyone else I see so many people
that just stop what they're doing
because
the people are judging them or they
think that they're not going to fit in
stop it
do you so besides that I had a little
like mo man like I got home everything
was amazing I was sharing my story with
everybody online and then that night
some crazy bitches decided to all gang
up and flag my Instagram brand account
not my personal but they flagged my
cosmedix Instagram I'm like who has time
for that
so basically algorithm if you don't know
what that means it's like the system of
Instagram so if a bunch of people are
attacking you and saying you're doing
something or flagging you Instagram will
deactivate you to review you now I don't
know why they don't have a special wing
for this yet but all weekend my page was
gone so a lot of people were like did
you block me and I'm like girl so thank
God for Instagram reaching out to me and
Monday morning wallah we are back the
page is all good but I'm just like do
people really have that much time on our
hands like you're worried about my page
I'm like girl go outside and get some
like a deep gulp of air and just go do
you so if anyone else deals with any
negativity whether it's at work or at
school or anywhere else it's like you
know I get asked that a lot how do you
deal with negativity you just have to
let it roll off your back I'm like you
will not stop me I am so motivated and
actually after that happened I'm like
I'm more motivated than ever to just
Salette so I'm excited to be back you
guys so what are we doing today we are
using the new Anastacio Beverly Hills
modern renaissance eyeshadow palette
we're going to dip into this today I'm
going to show you all the colors and I
created this gorgeous burgundy smoky
dark eye lashes up to heaven and you
know I'm just feeling blonde lately I am
loving this blonde hair and of course
had to top it off with a new little
jeffree star liquid lip so if you want
to see how I created this then keep on
watching
when I did my chilling a Dalek
foundation review when I was searching
for all those foundations and you know
that one was the most expensive and I
was like Jesus boy I also found one
baile Mayer which this brand is one of
my favorite skincare brands ever and I
think know they had a foundation and I
was like okay so I've used this a few
times and I've mixed it with my giorgio
armani luminous silk foundation which is
my number one
go to beside the air flash from Dior so
I decided to swap out do or in trial a
mayor and now this one is a little
darker so when I mixed it it kind of
gives me a nice little like summer glow
almost like a little fake tan so both of
these advise that you need to shake well
before you so let's get to shaking now
I'm just gonna take from the back of my
hand and one two three BAM and then
we're going to take this guy and we're
just going to do one pump of that okay
now before it slides off my hand and
down my crotch let's just take a you
know you can take a little mixing brush
or anything you want I'm going to be
really hood and just use a bobby pin so
there you go that is mixed and then
we're gonna use our beauty blender BAM
and we're going to bounce this all over
our face all right we are buffed and
blended to perfection so let's grab some
concealer so just grab any concealer
that's really light I love to be really
fair under the eyes that just you know
really brightens and opens you up so I'm
gonna try this Chanel concealer today
this is the corrector perfection
concealer number ten now I'm just going
to take this and do like an upside down
triangle motion now I usually like
concealer a little lighter than this but
we're going to give this a whirl today
since I don't think this is light enough
I'm going to take my urban decay
concealer and actually just add in a
little bit in there as well there we go
that's the lightness that I am used to
now that we're concealed to perfection
let's take some powder foundation it can
be anyone that you guys love I've been
using Mac Studio Fix since the dawn of
time I've also kind of transitioned over
to the Giorgio Armani luminous silk
compact this is such a good formula so
I'm just going to take a little more
feet III brush and coat my entire face
with this all right now I'm going to
take my Mac shivering white Studio Fix
and highlight these damn under eyes
now this is kind of like my under eye
setting powder but if you of course want
to go back and with something else you
can but I'm ready to get to contouring
guys no Kat Von D should light contour
palette best formula right now in the
market I'm just gonna dip into the shade
and what kind of cheekbones do I want
today I think I'm just gonna do
something really kind of soft and subtle
my cheekbones are already so defined
some days I just really cut them so hard
like when I walk by people at the
grocery store they start bleeding on the
floor but I think today I'm just gonna
give everyone just a little subtlety so
you know we don't we don't scare
everyone and then we're just gonna go
back in with that first brush and just
kind of diffuse it a little bit now
we're gonna go back in with this color
and we're gonna do a little or a lot on
that forehead so I'm just gonna go in
and really contour this forehead honey
like we're not gonna play around today
no I do like to go back and forth so I
will definitely hit into this lightest
color and just kind of go over it make
sure it's not too lean Oh blotchy or
weird and then we're gonna hit that chin
a little bit and carve out this jawline
and now for highlighting I'm going to be
using the new honest hacia glow kit now
this palette is called Sun dip
they have three palettes now and this
one is brand new hot off the press it's
gorgeous first of all these pan sizes or
everything look at my hand on my hi pan
so I'm gonna dip into moonstone right
now and then I might dab a little bit of
summer on top now I'm just gonna merge
this right where my contour and lighter
highlight we're meeting and they're just
gonna have a baby alright now let's do
our Cupid's bow
uh-huh-huh-huh come on moonstone I'm
even gonna take a little bit on my chin
and just shock you all and just do a
little moment right there now I'm
actually gonna leave my nose alone today
I know that's gonna surprise you all but
I'm gonna really focus on the eyes she's
lips for this video so we're gonna leave
my nose untouched there's no contour and
there's no highlight I know you all are
probably like what the hell we're gonna
have a blank nose today now that we are
highlighted let's draw on some brows
real quick off-camera and I'll be right
back I am so excited to dip into the
modern renaissance palette I wish you
guys could feel this if you don't own
this it feels like felt velvet like oh
the texture of this palette is gorgeous
but what's more pretty the colors are so
gorgeous look at this palette you guys
yes today I'm kind of feeling really
kind of dark sultry like pinky purple
under and then on the lid I don't know
what we're gonna do yet we're just gonna
wing it and see what happens
no I just want to make a disclaimer
because I always print out shade names
wrong you guys read me you guys read me
too filth
when I did my Jacqueline champagne
review I said cogman into the cognac and
every comment was like I don't even
drink alcohol so I apologize now this
palette and all the names were inspired
by the art of painting so if I don't
pronounce some of these correctly nor
vina please slap me when you see me next
and um let's dive in so I think right
off the bat I see Primavera it's so
pretty I'm like mmm you guys see that
I'm just gonna swatch with my finger
really quickly oh my god it feels like
butter look at that I'm like oh my
now usually I'd like to do a transition
color first I'm just going to go write
it with this light one and we're just
gonna go all in the lid with this guy
because mmm it is pretty anything
shining you guys I'm like a bird I just
gravitate to it I open this palette and
I was like you know the thing I love
about the honest hacia formula is these
shadows blend really quickly really easy
and they show just right off the bat you
don't have to put in any extra work
which think dot because that's how every
makeup brand should be now real car is
this gorgeous like apricot orange e
transition color and I'm just like oh
yes get on my lids so I'm just gonna
take this and we're just gonna put that
right in there oh these two together our
light already besties I'm like look at
that yes honey now normally I take it
all the way in I'm actually gonna let
that not happen today and change it up a
bit and just kind of stop it there now
we're going to take a little Mac
blending brush we're going to dip into
burnt orange and we are going to blend
this shade out and I'm just going to add
that right on top all right now to blend
out the transition color we're going to
be using tempera and I'm just gonna
blend and buff out what's going on here
now you know what's crazy you guys I
always were really light contact lenses
so today I'm using these new Desio
called cherry coffee and I am loving it
it's weird though I'm not used to seeing
myself with dark eyes so it's definitely
tripping me out right now alright so
we're just gonna buff and blend that out
now we're going to be using a little Mac
to 1-7 I'm gonna be dipping into Cypress
number and it is like this beautiful
dark chocolate brown I'm just gonna coat
my entire brush now I'm gonna be taking
this and really buffing it even down to
the lash line and we're just gonna
really darken that eye now notice how
I'm stopping it right there I'm not
bringing it down again
and I'm just gonna go back and forth
back and forth and buff and then I'm
gonna bring it all the way down to the
lash line now I'm gonna take my blending
brush and go back into burnt orange and
just buff over all that and make it look
really nice now I'm taking a little
bobby brown eye shadow brush I'm going
back in with Cypress umber and I'm just
gonna really darken and smoke out this
lash line and bring that brown all the
way into here and I'm just gonna really
darken that crease and then we'll take
our blending brush and I'm going to dip
into red ochre and I'm just gonna blend
that Brown out a little bit now I'm
going to take tempera one more time and
we're just going to use that light shade
to add some highlight and really get
these smoky eyes flawless
now it's time to smoke out the lower
lash line now a love letter and Venetian
red are so pretty usually I would never
put this under my eye but I think it's
time so we're going to take this little
guy and we're just gonna start by
pressing the pencil brush right on that
highlight and then dragging away
and voila now to make that inner corner
really pop I'm going to be wetting my
brush and I'm just going to use a little
more feet 4-3-3 brush and I was going to
grab some mac fix+ and we're going to
spray the brush until it's soaking wet
but I'm gonna go back in with Primavera
so I'm just going to take it in my inner
corner and just put it right over that
burgundy color oh wow
for the waterline we definitely need a
nude or a white liner I think I'm gonna
do nude again
I've just been such a fan of this and
when I really like something I got to do
it over and over so this is honey dude
liner from colour-pop and I'm just going
to pop this in the waterline and make my
eyes come to life now I mean I think I
mean I kind of want to put more glitter
and everything on my lids like always
but I think I'm just gonna blend it out
and keeps keep it really dark because
I'm loving how dark it is on my upper on
these upper upper moment now we're gonna
coat my lashes with roller lash from
Benefit and then we're gonna put on some
falsies
For Lashes today we're gonna be using
flutter lashes style and Natasha look
how gorgeous and big these are we
lowered now I'm just going to be using a
little latex-free Escudo lash glue and
let's get these babies on
all right lashes are done now these are
so big they're about to slap my eyebrows
and I'm kind of obsessed with it usually
I would do liner but today I'm just
gonna be liner free and I am I'm loving
it so I think it's time to put on some
lips I'm gonna be going in with Mac's
spice liner this is a classic I'm just
going to outline my lips in this and
then we're going to be going over it
with my own liquid lipstick shade
mannequin
all right we are gonna go back in with
the liner once the liquid lip has dried
give us a little shake and a little one
- ah all right now mannequin is it's
like a darker version of I'm nude it is
so pretty oh I like hello now this part
does not have to be perfect because
we're going to take that liner and we're
gonna ombre it up and blend it out once
this fully dries but every liquid left
all this wave my hand in front of my
face hook dries quicker and then it will
take that pencil one more time and we're
just going to kind of go over the lines
redefine it and then you're going to
kind of turn the pencil so it's more on
the softer side and you're just gonna
buff up so it blends effortlessly I am
loving this look I think it's definitely
time for some setting spray so I'm just
going to go with my makeup forever mist
and fix and just douse my face and then
we'll uh be finished oh Lord
alright let me slap on some hair and
let's get finished all right you guys
this is the final look had to add a
little hair and put on some clothes for
