welcome back to my channel
oh my god today I'm sitting here
sweating with anticipation I am so
excited to finally reveal the jeffree
star cosmetics androgyny eyeshadow
palette oh this palette has been in the
works for about I think it's been almost
nine months now and I really wanted to
even improve the formula for my first
palette now beauty killer was such a big
moment for me it was my first eyeshadow
palette ever I am so proud of this
palette I could not believe how well
it's sold out sure you guys came so hard
for this palette and showed it so much
love and you know a little Derrick Rose
like you know what this is my brand I'm
only going to do stuff and make colors
that I want that I want to wear but I
also know that you guys are going to
wear that the end of the day I have to
love it so you know when I first did
this palette I was like girl I'm
throwing the hot pink the blue the gold
everything and this was just going to be
it so after the beauty color palette
came out and I got so much love I
definitely was jumping into the lab and
I started to create the androgyny
palette now I wanted to improve the
formula and not that the first one
wasn't great I stand by I think it is so
pigmented but I think with anything as
any brand you can always improve for the
next round so I gave myself a while to
go through everyone's feedback me and
customer service at my warehouse had a
huge meeting about it and I was like
okay I'm going to go in the lab and I'm
even going to make this better more
pigmented more soft more buttery triple
milled like I'm not playing around
everybody so when I was creating this
palette I wanted to do my version of a
neutral palette so you will see a lot of
neutral colors a lot of cool tones a lot
of warm tone but you're also going to
see a little bit more you know funkiness
but my version so this palette is very
earthy it's sexy it's gorgeous there are
so many looks that you can get from a
solid so without further ado here is the
palette yay so as you guys are first
taking a look at it let's go
through all of it together now you see
the top row is very I guess what we'll
call neutral now there are two formulas
in this palette there are metallics and
of course there are the super mattes and
what I mean by super matte is like it is
really really rich with pigment like
we're talking in same amount of coverage
now these pen sizes are really big for
an eyeshadow palette and I you know I
like everything really jumbo and very
out-there to me it's not about making
the consumer or the customer buy one
right away because you already hit pan
you know three weeks later to me this is
about art it is about creating something
so fun and unique that you guys are
going to be able to appreciate for a
long time so not to say anything in any
type of way but just to give you a
comparison because I can asses all the
time
here is a Mac eye shadow and here is my
pan size next to it so just so you guys
can get like a comparison of you know
how big the sizes are so the retail
price for this will be $45 just like my
previous palette and as you see the
design is all pink what we call in the
makeup industry leatherette so this is
not real leather this is a faux leather
type of material and I want to be
aspects of like a lizard or like a
reptile so as you will see on the zoom
in it is like a shimmery bubblegum hot
pink with a little bit of sparkle in
there of course we have the gold
stamping in the frame and then when you
open up in the palette you have a very
nice mirror courtesy with my finger
prints kids use me but the mirror is
very nice and one of them by that is
like some palettes like for some reason
the mirror is like someone's a little
warped or it's kind of like I don't know
even you can talk at home you know what
I'm talking about the mirror just
doesn't like you can't get ready in it
but these ones are very there's not
quality baby other information I think
that you guys should all know about this
palette is that it is 100% vegan so what
that means is that the entire palette
was made with gradients that are not
derived from animals and of course is my
entire brand it is all cruelty free now
the moment that everyone has been asking
and waiting for is this palette will be
launching on March 4th 10 a.m.
Standard Time so if you need to know
your time zone bitch better google it
but yeah guys
March 4th I am really really excited
when you finally are able to put
something out that you spent months and
months working on it is so nerve-racking
anxiety-ridden and i just amazing all at
the same time it's like very like oh my
gosh alright so and now we're about to
dive into the palette I'm going to
swatch all the colors for you and just
talk about why I named them why I did a
lot of people are like well what is
androgyny mean now Indrani I think is
the definition of Jeffrey star since I
was a little eighth grader playing with
my mother's makeup I have always been
called androgynous so basically what
that means is it is a combination of
masculine and feminine characteristic so
it's like gender ambiguity can be found
in makeup fashion sexual identity gender
identity anything so besides being my
number one lipstick in my line that is
why I named the palette this way so you
know I think if you are really looking
at the colors and playing with it you
will definitely just be able to get that
kind of vibe alright so I'm going to
just start right at the top of left
so the first shade is called frosting it
is a let me just watch it real quick
because Lord oh it is so creamy so there
is frosting it is a beautiful gold tone
pale metallic it is so stunning and this
color I have right here in my inner
corner that is tucked in right there and
right there it is really blinding I am
especially a desert addict you guys I
used to eat tubs of pills very like hot
pink
funfetti icing and I would get really
stoned and eat that like a whole jar and
over a few days I know really healthy
right don't try that at home so that is
why that one is called frosting the
shade next to it is called safe word and
that is a let me swatch that for you
guys
Oh creamy that is a cool toned really
light brown it is perfect for putting in
the crates for any cool toned look and
guess what I did today guys let's take a
look at my cheeks I also contoured a
little bit of my cheekbones with
safeword so if you are more on the fair
side this is actually a really good
contour color now the space board is
just playing on top of you know a little
desire some fun things if you don't
really know what a safe board means just
Google later and you'll find out all
right now moving on to the third shade
it is called charm let me swatch her BAM
and charm is a beautiful warm toned
transition shade this is this is right
in my crease today I just feel like the
shade now I've been testing this on my
friends for a few months now and charm
is the perfect transition color for any
skin tone it is just flawless it really
takes that smoky eye to the next level
now this shade is called charm because
one of my favorite movies is called the
cross if you've never seen that movie
girl
it is very witchy and cute now the
fourth one over is called a deja vu it
is a beautiful frosted metallic brown
with glitter in it oh my lord these four
together they look really pretty
yes now deja vu is really perfect for
that
stunning bronzy smokey eye you can put
it all over the lid and you guys can
obviously put anywhere you want but I
love putting deja vu all over the lid
and then just a lash and a little bit of
the liner it's like easy go to brown
shades all right now moving on to the
fifth shade in the top row this trick is
called a dominatrix which if you guys
have that liquid lipstick that I made
that is exactly why it's called that it
literally is the identical shade of
dominatrix liquid lips so let's watch
this my thumb's only clean finger I got
so let's swatch that there is one swipe
oh good morning alright now the bottom
left one is called androgyny of course
which is almost identical to my liquid
lipstick color I was like okay I imagine
this in a shadow form it would be the
dopest plum mauve like hybrid so
androgyny there's a little one swipe
coverage girl like the shade so this one
today I put on my lash line and in my
crease if I look up right there and then
I mix it with this shade called a fetish
which is right next to it now fetish is
a deep dark red
with a little bit of like metallic in it
you guys will see that in a second it is
very like it has a little sparkle in it
but once the phone the I really doesn't
show Sparkle now fetish is on my entire
bottom lash line and all mixed in with
charm right here and all over the lid
moving on the third one is called
military it is a matte military green
now I don't have a lot of greens in my
collection and my whole entire makeup
collection no greens are kind of hard
they're not hard to come by like they
don't exist but I was really hard for me
to find in army green when I was
creating this palette last year and I
created my version of what I think army
and military basically looks like and
that's her all right now the shade next
to it is a gorgeous like hunter dark
Jewish green it is called poison and oh
my god yes now poison is just stunning I
love a smoky eye I feel like everyone
does black and gray smoky eyes I'm more
into blues greens yellows so when I was
creating this one I just wanted
something that was like really dark but
still had some you know a little
different different energy to it now the
last shade in the palette you bottom
right is called it's to wallow it is a
hot dark blue and my thumb is like are
you ready for this it is this one is
really like oh now swallow is so good
for the perfect dark dramatic smoky eye
this all over the lid and just
everywhere mmm now I use Nathan's arm
because you guys don't have a way to
make tattoos try to swatch some of these
so we have the top row of eyeshadows
here and then we have B of bottom five
right here so voila
now I'm definitely going to be creating
a lot of looks of course with this
