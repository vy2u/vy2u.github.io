you're soulless Lynch I try to have it a
little it's not like it sounds kind of
red on my forehead it is it's definitely
in mine looks like when you sleep where
with your bedsheets and I get it in
different that's what happened to my
nose at the ladies yeah it's a little
bit not a scar people know it's a little
imprint do we do our final song final
thoughts
I'm you have a few different maybe
something in immediate effects because I
don't see an immediate effect on me okay
I can just feel a little more plump okay
that's good a little bit I mean there
was a lot of claims on this block you
guys we didn't really read everything it
says that the skin is rapidly plumped
with a maximum hydration to instantly
restore a youthful complexion got it
will Julie look more restored and more
useful
Misha expanded my face before this huh
I definitely feel a little moisturize I
do like a little more my face best part
is got out Meleager izing actual
moisturizing I feel moisturize yeah I
still adore my shirt I feel it more
plump on the face buzz and that it's not
like what I do is again probably not for
15 minutes not yeah I didn't know I
didn't like really love how wet it was
it was like a literally a didn't even on
says you can reuse it I don't like
reading my lips no I'm weird like I'm
not going to wash that under the sink
put it back down in but you can't no
cannot wait can it's a cool idea but
we're all different
yeah I was I'm not really into that
saying um this is not the worst mask
I've ever worn up same as you do feel
like there's an actual plumping effect I
just don't think it's something nothing
is really to me personally I something
goes really worth it
okay that's bigger yeah um I don't
really love it I mean I don't know is
this Jeffrey start and Manning approves
I'm summoning proved actually Oh bye
everyone
there are so many crazy masks and
skincare all over the internet so we're
just kind of taking our favorite one
we're just trying out the year we have
there's a long year ahead of us mmm and
this was fun it looked cool is it
looking for definitely an eye-opener
when we walked downstairs and hey Zac -
like we're like hi plugging in with a
butcher knife at the gemstar booth I
don't think this can be dresser approved
because I didn't really see that much of
a difference and maybe you have to use
it a few more times but you know how can
you really know right away that's ever
going to slow down visible translation I
feel hydrated but I could ever say on
moisture which is it seems like it's so
much easier to just on a moisturizer
quickly in what 20 seconds then this
upon this mask yeah 15 minute is I don't
think I'm not even dripping on you like
fucking stain to my shirt like John
alright this is the fun little journey
it was so much honesty agile as
and one that unique it was fun yeah it
was fun to do it with a friend yes if
