I'm trying to choke me I just took my
nails and I was like all right here we

all over the full face okay you're
setting everything because Jeffrey
tonight is about to go out we all just
go out often but she's about to go out
to the death Josh do the splits do also
glory holes of WeHo I absolutely haven't
been there in 10 years and you need this
makeup to stay on so we are boldly
setting it and forgetting about it no
Wendy discover
airspun um I think just do tutorials and
stuff
I am classic oh yeah I started watching
like making sure I was back in like
seventh grade yeah so this was like back
when it was like watching they called
like peachy lewd and yeah before it was
like really saturated and massive that's
cool I remember back in the day like
Michelle Phan and Kenny Johnson you know
like 25 million views on a tutorial
bitches ain't doing that these days I'll
tell you that now so those are YouTube
legend
absolutely and we are just going to go
in with this random brush do the old Tom
Ford I love that just you think it's a
good random hey you know what Jase can't
you can't teach taste just just a way
she's feeling all this that's because
you look like the ghost of Chrissie
Hynde power
and we needed to get you looking like an
Aquarian goddess ready for the one way
amen all right oh I love that palette
yes this one has been very well loved
and we're just gonna go in here but this
is a little bit BH and just give her a
little extra contour as if these chicks
needed it we gonna go in a lady at the
supermarket they're fake the other day I
was like huh that's what we're talking
about maybe was that question really ha
ha ha ha and like a good drag queen
we're just going around the perimeter a
full perimeter continuing let me be your
assistant again oh my gosh thank you I'm
just gonna go in and slim the chin down
and the jaw slim it down with the same
powder I like how your cool tone too
because I used to hit a hand on this
shade all the time yeah I'm like well
let me just fill the entire thing out
with not just then I was like why don't
I just carry around one of those and
give it later
good oh we're good okay I don't need the
face is coming is it is it bad if I
don't even want to go in with powder on
the nose no I feel like just like keep
her light she's looking good I love that
so what would you do next I think I
would just go in and start on the eyes
okay
BAM now do you do brows first your eye I
do I oh cool okay Wow because I feel
like set where are the creases in the
middle and now yeah I love the work up
down yeah mm-hmm okay BAM no I want to
give you a really summery just fun like
not even Beach this is like beach on
Mars yeah we join acid
yeah and we are gonna dip into the new
thirsty palette yeah blood sugar and
drogyny we have a lot of on this
table so I'm probably gonna use 95% okay
and just to make sure we don't get any
followed anywhere or I know you said
these don't have any fall I will some of
them do blood sugar does I mean you know
normal eyeshadows do but the new thirsty
palette does have a new formula I've
really perfected where it's minimal
fallout but it's a lot of makeup so I'm
gonna make sure there's no ball be the
last one to judge yeah no but we want to
make sure we weren't in everything yeah
and protects from any potential dangers
yes absolutely
you're just going in with Ben anxiety
when it's hotter it'll she said she
picked it up oh yeah it's good and we
are just going to throw that under the
eyes yes cuz this will brighten
everything and then once we are
with the makeup application we will
swipe this all away and have a good time
oh wow
swipe me swipe left or right which is
the good one I have no idea I've never
used that those apps well I'm gonna
swipe the other way dude do dating apps

like not not your I've got I've got so
many other things going on I'm into this
random people asking me for the
meet-and-greet while I'm trying to have
a good time yeah
all right so aquaria wants to dip into
some yellow and I said well hi bitch I
have a new palette it's thirsty and it
has an amazing yellow shade in here
called quench so we are just going to
throw this all under the eye I've been
really into yellow in weird places yeah
so under the eye is very fun I love like
a yellow cheek moment and I'm just like
letting that blend up because that's
what I'm doing right now for the Neko
Panda launch your makeup was so sick oh
my obviously did you know that sometimes
mac artists like to do people's makeup
for the advance you're like no honey

know as a drag queen you'll like baby
say yes to it one once but it's like and
then you'll be like oh god and even the
artist slobbery it'll be like this is

supply of piss yellow on the bottom I
love this play but it's like a good
yellow it's a good yeah now we're gonna
go in with pink in the inner corners
okay now we've got several Pink's here

gonna intensify this pink area well I've
had seven I know is I'm tense
all right now you said you gonna do some
little blue on me right yes ma'am all
right so we're gonna dip and just
submerge my fleshy palate I thought she
should have called it aquarium but I
mean I should have you completely
submerged hmm yeah so I wanted to start
with a bright little electric blue keep
it matte and then you like a business
Carter's yeah I like I like doing that
with like a sharp angle no I look that's
like old school I used to take a Mac
postcard Oh cute
do you have write down their name is K
let me look
oh this is a good moment how about a
selfie of me and Kim K oh yeah were you
talking to them I think that it's
deserving it's gonna hold that right
there and hit this with so much blue
they'll be completely submerged into
this aqua fence I keep thinking of that

just going to go and continue to deepen
the outer part of the eye and okay wing
in with swallow which is a fun Navy
yeah the androgynous okay great keeping
it very and Roger you just let me know
where to hold it assistant star is at
your service right there
all right now we are just going to
finish up the some of the shadow portion
yes with some log shadow here I mean
we're just gonna throw a lot of black in
the outer corner because this is all
going to blend in with the liner I'm
just going to go and deepen around the
under eye okay to kind of connect those
two so we're just doing a little
connecting right now we meaning her okay
this blue is like actually pigmented
it's wild ah it caught it like is
covering the Navy so much that's so
crazy and not even in a bad way just
because it's like blending yeah but it's
like it's super uh-huh she didn't come
to play ah all right honey yes aquarias
never filmed in a studio like this she's
like give me a hit so I'm going to go in
with drug lord because I love to I know

this for the under eye wire and for the
eyelid and love that so it's a drag
queen staple is this pair to go straight
from the yeah okay I can't that's mine
go for it
like literally that exact angle right
there yeah I like pop it in my me
oh wow normally I would blend this out
with my finger just like give it a
little blend but now gonna cover it with
nails baby yeah today we are just going
to go over that with glucose from the
blood sugar palette which will be a
white as hell and we're doing you know
some dramatic liners so no need to but
no too much I really could have tried
putting shadow over a liquid lip yeah
just yeah that's a quicker and I'm
looking in the water like wow that like
did the job
cool way Wow like so big okay
got both eyes all set and the crease has
been there lately yeah I'm going to just
away a lot of that super white powder
just because we do not need it anymore
