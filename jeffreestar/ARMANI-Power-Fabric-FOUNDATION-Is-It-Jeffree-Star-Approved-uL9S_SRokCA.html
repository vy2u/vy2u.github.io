there how's it going welcome back to my
 channel today we're going
to be diving into a crazy luxurious
foundation and it's from one of my
favorite brands Armani
now let's rewind let's just rewind for a
second here because 2016 I don't know
how many times I use this foundation now
this is the tried and true Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation now this
one oh my god this one is like it's one
of those moments where when you're in an
interview and people ask you like if
you're on a desert island
what five beauty items can you not live
without girl this is one of them for
some reason the luminous silk made your
skin glowy with full coverage and it was
just like almost like plastic which is
something I'm into you so we're going to
put this down and get on to what we're
really here for so our money Beauty has
really been killing it lately I know not
everyone uses them because they are a
little more luxurious but I have been
using their setting spray for the linen
for a few videos now I really like this
one this is the Armani Prima setting
spray and then of course I think in a
bunch of videos last year I use the
luminous self compact which is the
powder foundation to that other
foundation so I get an alert the other
day on my email and it's like Armani
brand new foundation it's full coverage
and you know me I'm like well cover too
much cocoa doesn't call me so I login
and here's what we see
BAM first of all the name kind of threw
me off because it's a little weird power
fabric long wear high cover foundation
and I'm like power fabric that is such a
weird name but then I'm also hook manga
this is so weird I was like hmm now of
course since this is a full coverage
foundation I was like oh my god I got to
try this out immediately so as you all
know when you're buying shades online is
very hard to find your color when you
obviously have never tried it even the
formula before because let's say this
let me see I get asked all the time what
is your shade in the luminous silk IM
shade number or to add to make sure now
too in this brand which i have in my
hand right here
may not
- the - from the other formula I mean
this one looks a little darker you see
what I'm saying here so it's like how do
you really know so I bought three of
these because you guys know I'm not
trying to get played and have some
crazy-ass skin color so I bought three
of these today we have shades 23.5 and
then one we're obviously going to try
these all out right now see which one is
going to match me but I do want to dive
in and talk about the product
now the luminous no foundation is pricy
and let me just tell you right now
the power fabric it's just this pricey
so logging in on their website this is a
$64 foundation it says that this is
actually best applied with a blending
brush hmm now you all know I've been
using my beauty blender for just about
anything but today we're gonna have to
whip out a foundation brush two bucks
and see if this thing really works
because if the brand says it should be
with a brush well we're just gonna have
to try it with a brush now this
foundation has SPF 25 in it yes y'all
know I'm an anti-aging ho now it says
our money develop a breakthrough second
skin fluid foundation allegedly this has
the highest percentage of pigments in a
supple and elastic texture providing a
velvety luminous and techical
long-lasting result no caking okay
that's a good claim and no settling on
fine lines face perfection that looks
natural finally a girl would work
you know what's crazy as I hate one of
whatever product has SPF in it and it
says let me just read it verbatim
it says reapply every two hours who the
 has time for that you think got a
two hours later into the day on the
pause and stop in traffic and reapply my
whole game thank you I can't but hey if
you really want sunscreen to work I
guess after two hours it should don't
work any more now I'm really excited to
try this so I think I'm just going to
dive right into it I think it's only
fair though that I primed the skin
because I would never apply this
normally on my bare skin so we're going
to go in with the primer that you all
know I use a million times the grill on
pure gold irradiance of course my what a
my tried and true I grab
of course favorite little brush that I
always apply my primers with and we're
just going to go and that will leave
some gold flakes on your skin keep them
in there they dissolve and I'm down for
that
of course we had to hit the neck a
little bit and voila
BAM alright so it says to apply to the
brush so I grab this new angle the
foundation brush from Kevin akwonton one
of my favorite beauty brands now let's
get these clips let's pin this hair back
and let the space shine alright guys I
guess we are about to color match so let
me unbox a one I mean on camera and the
monitor I don't look that bad but it
looks a very stark white in person and
then number two which is my match from
the other foundation is looks like
little yellow in the bottle but it's
also deceiving because it's frosted
glass and then of course we have the
third one which is 3.5 and this looks
very summertime like hmm so I guess
there's always one way to find out I'm
going to take all three is I'm just
going to take this and puts a little bit
on my finger this is number one and then
we're going to match it down here with
this tada
oh yeah that is like really really fair
like girl I don't think so okay
number two's closed a little yellow
though and then three point five there
is no way this is going to be a match
you guys there's no way oh my god
they're all so different like I am
tripping out I honestly think three
point five is that crazy I was almost
scared you guys like it may be a little
bronzy but it really matches my skin
tone I think is the best okay I should
have done this before the primer but
it's okay because we can fix it I'm just
going to take a little makeup wipe and
wipe these off of course and now because
my extra ass is so crazy I like to take
tissue or paper towel you guys and wipe
up the residue of the makeup wipe
because obviously if you're going to put
makeup on over that this ain't
going to work
yes alright let's get this big real
world making sure it's the right color
yes 3.5 I'm just going to take some on
this brush complaining girl okay now
it's full coverage so I'm just going to
start there and
if you've been watching me for a while
you know I like to DOT it all over the
face before blending the smells just
like the luminous still it is very it
has like its own Armani smell like I
don't even know really hard to explain
it except it's most foundation a little
skin carry it has this weird undertone
of something and I kind of look for it
okay so before I do any more I think I'm
just going to blend this out and if we
want to add more it will add more let's
get to it we are done buffing and
blending when we put this down oh so
like I was holding my breath for a
minute now looking at a viewfinder
ooh you're right there it has like a
little luminosity which did exactly say
that in this little booklet it does look
a little womanís obviously I have
nothing on my face but primer and as I'm
moving you can see the skin it does have
a little bit of like a little bit shine
to it another words China is kind of
scary because if you're oiling you want
to run from that but it just gives your
skin oil so if you are oily you probably
will not like this right off the bat
because it does give you an extra glow
all right so my first impressions are
now it's not a full full coverage as I
thought like what this said hi full
coverage it definitely covered all of
the discoloration that I have in my face
in these problem areas if you've ever
seen a 4k video mine girl you know it's
real now definitely covered my
discoloration on the eyelid
got the forehead really nice it feels
good - it feels really lightweight which
i think is very important to some
foundations that are full coverage or
anything like this you can almost like
feel like your face is like our home bug
but this one's really light weight which
is nice alright we're going to go in a
little bit more with this hi there I
already put a lot in right there so
we're going to avoid that area
Bam Bam Bam okay cool let's bust this
out and see what happens
okay here's what we're this is what I'm
talking about I really like the coverage
now I just select that second layer was
maybe what I personally like so for
someone that likes your discoloration
covered and you don't need a cake face
one layer it's on it's a great I do want
to apply some makeup on and then come
back and talk about it and then you know
come back later in the day so I'll be
right back all right now on camera a lot
of times when you use something after
the foundation like let's say your
concealer and might not really go with
this formula so on camera I'm going to
apply my concealer and powder and then
we will see what the hell is going on
with the face so of course I'm gonna go
in with might arch shape tape concealer
I would use this anyway so this
foundation wants to stay in my drawer it
needs to work with this one now here's
where I'm going to go in with my Beauty
Blender and buff this out to fill oh
 I forgot to put a condom on this oh
wait we all know that didn't work all
right back to blending
all right now I got it I got to be
really honest I am loving how this
concealer looks over the foundation
because a lot of times you'll put on a
concealer over a new foundation you're
trying and the formula really doesn't
settle right or just doesn't go together
I mean some ingredients do not mix well
which I've learned in the past from
doing so many first impressions so this
concealer really looks pretty like it
was beautiful all right cool
I am going to quickly set the under eyes
of course of my favorite lemnear as the
powder I like to just go into my damn
Beauty Blender of course this is my
trick I've been telling everybody
forever if you just really want to melt
the powder into the skin use a damp
sponge now not soaking it just has to be
damp and I let that sit there for a
second before I brush it off all right
now I'm going to gently brush this
powder off
that's really nice okay cool so the last
step that I would do before I finish the
rest of my face and I go about my day is
I would take of course the Armani
luminous soap powder foundation with any
brush and I would just pack this over
all the parts I did not I like oh all
right guys I'm going to go finish up the
rest of my face and I'm great
alright you guys I just did a little
soft easy glam that I like to wear to
the office and the foundation now
obviously it took me about like 25
minutes to do this
quickly and the foundation is still
really snatched so I'm going to go run
some errands go to the office and I'll
probably back in like 6 or 7 hours and
we'll do a little I guess a check-in if
you will and see if anything moved and
what the captain amazing so see you
guys in a little bit Oh scuse me no
 everybody oh I have the hiccups
all of a sudden what in the hell are and
looking in the monitor and my skin
stayed pretty snatched in the last 7
hours my lip gloss I reapplied twice
because eating drinking that is so
normal obviously I got to say it looks
really nice like I'm talking really nice
probably one of the nicest foundations
I've used in a while I notice a big
statement but you all know I've been
dying over my lemare foundation hi it's
getting empty this is probably my new
favorite for 17 so far I know we're only
2 months in but I got to say this is a
runner up already because I mean it
really didn't move it didn't settle in
any fine lines it didn't kaikoura look
weird or crazy even after I added powder
foundation setting spray everything else
I did to myself it looks it's really
nice I'm loving here like oh ok honey I
see you alright Armani he keeps laying
my existence don't know what the
I'm gonna do about you this year alright
I'm gonna say it right here and right
now the Armani power fabric full
coverage foundation is Geoffrey star
approved whoo I really love this it is
beautiful it lasted a while so far and
in LA the weather is a little basic here
it's been raining a lot actually
thank god there's a more drought whoo
think right don't quote me on that but
um you know our weather here is very dry
it's also very warm and the foundation
did not move I'm sitting here in my
mirror and I'm looking at it and I'm
like oh my god you guys like it doesn't
look bad but usually after like six or
seven hours you all know we all need a
touch-up raise your hands if you need a
 touch-up I do all right my
hair is a mess from this life of
mine and I think it's time to see comes
- my makeup I'm taking an 8-pin I'm
always oh my god - dicks on my brain but
I'm going to click off my makeup and
then I'm going to take off Nathan and
then we're gonna see what the hell
happens so thank you guys so much for
watching this video now I know any
counter that sells this you can
definitely get a sample which I advise
always good samples never waste your
money on something in case it doesn't
work obviously I'm doing this because
this is for YouTube and it's my job but
I mean samples are it because who wants
to spend sixty four dollars on something
that maybe might work so be smart about
it and I will see you on the next one ma
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
