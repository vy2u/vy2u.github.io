channel now this is going to be a little
different than my normal favorites
videos because YouTube I guess has
implemented all these new rules where
you can't smoke drugs
you can't goddamn cuss and you
really can't do anything so I guess for
once there's gonna be no weed in this
video but quick disclaimer I don't
really give one about monetization
YouTube is not where I make my money I
do this for you guys and for my
customers because I love doing makeup
and this is my passion
but I am gonna try one thing where we do
not show any cannabis in the video
because somehow they all get flagged as
age-restricted so the money that don't
mean anything to me but when someone has
to log in and have a youtube account
like you can't just click my video
anymore if there is a restriction on
there so I'm like YouTube girl just took
a hit you just slow it down so um we're
gonna try something out and see if we
don't get age-restricted today August is
done it's a wrap so much happened like
again I'm like oh my god traveling like
I was on a lot of damn flights so my
assistant Alicia and Nathan it was both
their birthdays um last month end of
August so we all went including Manny
and a few of my business partners we all
went to Bora Bora oh my god we'll talk
about that in a little bit and I'm going
to show some footage in the middle of
this video but um besides traveling you
guys I am I'm going to say it out loud
for the first time I am preparing for a
big launch now my lip ammunition stick
lipstick formula there will be ten
shades and I am announcing this for the
first time ever they will be launching a
September 30th exclusively on my website
and on Beauty lish calm now I am really
excited to finally launch another
product this is a stick a lipstick
formula they oh they are infused with
creamsicle it literally smells like ice
cream they are heaven a
and I'm just gonna give you guys a sneak
peek this is celebrity skin in a stick
lipstick formula now there will be a lot
of new shades but I brought back some of
your favorites as a satin formula I'm
just gonna do a little hand swatch whoo
girl come on
pigment you better work these are really
creamy high pigment oh come on and that
little that tiny machine just gives a
little extra volume to your lips makes
them look a little bit uh delicious so I
am really excited about that these will
retail for $18 just like my liquid lip
and I will be doing of course a whole
entire swatch video showing all of that
first ten shades now besides that I
think me and Nathan
what were the make is on in here okay I
think me and Nathan are ready for a
fourth dog yes
I'm gonna say it I am a Pomeranian lover
I am so obsessed with my dogs I don't
think I need kids anytime soon the dogs
keep me plenty busy now that delicious
is over a year old I think it's time for
a new one and I am really excited to get
a second girl I hope diamond does not
slap me because you know there's there's
enough boys in the house it's time to
get another girl dog so if there are any
Pomeranian lovers out there or you have
your own little Pomeranian baby let me
know down below because we all need a
you know have a little dog bonding
moment all right besides the craziness
of life let's dive into my August
favorites first up is skincare now I am
such a huge fan of the glam glow brand
you guys know the peel-off masks are
everything but this guy listen after all
these plane rides all the
traveling my skin is like can I have
some hydration and you know reading hoes
to filth all the time and spilling the
tea really dries out your skin so the
glam glow thirsty mud is perfect for
just a little extra hydration the cool
thing about this is you
oh it just smells so good I wish you
could smell this the damn computer right
now so you basically just scoop some out
it is not a peel-off mask you just take
some and you put it on your entire face
and it just sits on the top of your skin
and
gradually soaks in now if you have
really dry skin of course you're a
perfect candidate for this but if you're
just you know summer it's been a long
summer if you're just someone that needs
a little extra boost this is a really
great but of course it is also really
good for if you're about to go to bed
I'll take a thin layer and I'll just put
it on and I'll land my back and you know
after sixty-nining it's the perfect fit
let's get into priming now I've been
such a huge fan of that grill on gold
primer it has real flakes of gold in it
I mean if that is an incentive I don't
know what is but um besides being really
cute and feeling expensive and just on
point with the packaging the product is
unreal it almost gives you like a little
surgical like your face kind of sucks in
for a moment once you apply it and it's
the perfect base for your makeup but I
also have pores like the rest of the
world I know no one wants to believe
that so I like to do a little mixing a
little primer cocktail if you will and
the benefit Porefessional primer if
you've never used this what have you
been doing with your whole life girl now
this one has been used this one it is
almost empty it's just really great for
literally minimizing flattening and
making your pores disappear and then
once the foundation hits they're gone
now I don't know what it is but lately I
have been so obsessed with nude lipstick
now I'm into bright colors you guys know
I could do a pink lipstick in my sleep I
want to be buried in a black lipstick
but I've been so in a nude lipsticks
lately so this one is I'm going to chew
actually almost like one to two nudes
this one is from Charlotte Tilbury this
is from the hot lips collection and the
shade is called Kim kW I love the
laser-cut lipstick print on the actual
lipstick so pretty packaging is gorgeous
and I love this because for some reason
it doesn't really get chalky or crazy
throughout the day even though this is
just a normal stick lipstick it gives
your lips kind of like this luminosity
and they really look bigger for some
reason I just can't stop wearing it so
I'll definitely be needing ten tubes
before Christmas
the second newt is from a brand called
Joey I love this package
it's very futuristic now this is what
I'm wearing on my mouth today it is a
liquid to matte lipstick
they are kiss proof and mmm hi nudes I
just love this color it's really soft
really pretty I'm looking the viewfinder
like hi I just love a nude lip and I
think for the fall I'm gonna be
definitely outlining and just keeping
the nude obsession going because I can't
stop last makeup product is hi
self-promotion this is that jeffree star
cosmetics beauty killer palette now this
guy has been out of stock for a minute
it's finally back and you can get it on
my website jeffree star cosmetics
dot-com and if you want to feel the
fantasy voila this has 10 shades very
very highly pigmented here's a little
sample of one of the shade this is
called star power girl you guys know I'm
not playing games if you're scared of
indulging in colors you don't normally
wear let me just do something for you
real quick are you still scared I hope
not umm this palette is a very versatile
if you're ready to dive into fall like I
am you can create a million looks with
this palette this retails for $45 and
this is a permanent item in my cosmetics
line and this fall I will have my second
eyeshadow palette out it is called the
androgyny pal it is very fall so it will

French Polynesia one of the best places

beautiful place I've ever been

recharge on life I think things have
been is so crazy the last three months
with life everything the business
growing everything has just been
astronomically overwhelming and um I'm
back I feel great good yeah I feel great
everything was it was like I can't
believe I spent my birthday in Bora Bora

a little private dinner on a private
island that the locals lived on pretty
cool they gave us a little fire show if
I are dancing is so cool
so some and they cooked us all like a
private like meal we were the only
people on the island so it was crazy it
