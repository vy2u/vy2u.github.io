created this little this a soft glam no
this is not exactly real this is an
extreme glam and I'd open to this
palette today so I definitely use like
let me stay here I like one told a
little bit about like six or seven
shades from this palette and I want to
create something that was a little smoky
a little grungy a little dark but also
really blinding I mean nothing new here
and I topped it off with a nude lip now
Black Friday is almost here y'all know

two years of shit is crazy so I am

lips and two highlighters and everything

alright moving on if you want to see how
to create this sexy little sultry look
thing keep on watching before I do
anything what are we gonna do we got a
prime now I'm gonna be going with my
favorite grill on gold pure radiance
primer this shit is the truth of course
the price tag is hefty nothing any of
you are shocked and surprised at all but
um listen if it works it fucking works
so I like to apply this with a synthetic
brush so use any brush that you want and
I'm just gonna paint this all over and
let it dry
and of course got a prime that Nick and
don't forget them here's now we do have
to address the elephant in the room my
motherfucking pimple and I'm sure a lot
of you were like that ain't nothing ah
mother effer now I've been trying so
many new foundations and primers and
serums my skin is like quickl back to
the fucking normal routine please so I
finally have a pimple everyone write
down the date and time and you will
celebrate okay one of my favorite brands
lemare you guys know i am la Mare whore
i love their moisturizer i love their
mist setting spray their an unreal brand
now they recently just discontinued
their previous primer and foundation
which is horrifying but then they did a
whole new revamp of their entire makeup
line and they just put up this it is
called the soft fluid I tried it the
other day before we went to an event oh
my god it was sickening but I've never
used it on camera so we're gonna give it
a whirl right now I'm just gonna use my
damp Beauty Blender oh we're just gonna
go in and I'm just going to dot it all
over okay cool let's bounce
I love this foundation I know you guys
have heard me say that a few times on
this channel because I've tried so many
this year already but who okay it looks
beautiful and it's a little more golden
and warmer than my skin tone so it just
gives me a little added extra Flair
little ah if you will all right let's
get the concealer now I'm gonna go in
with a little urban decay naked skin
concealer I know I'm cheating on my
Tarte one this one is just right you're
handy and the other one is tucked away
somewhere I don't know if anyone else
does this but when I travel I'll take
like a week or two to unpack everything
I'm just like the trips over I don't
fucking here so we are going to just
conceal heavy today just for fun and
this pimple do I want to bring lightness
to this fuck no I'm just gonna put more
powder on there and call it a day this
is like an arrow pointing down at my
nose like now of course once again let's
bounce
now it's time for a little studio fix by
Mac this is the Shivering white color
and I'm going to use my Beauty Blender
again I love to just go in there while
this is wet and we're just going to go
over that concealer and this is kind of
like setting the eye but really bringing
it just like I don't even know what I'm
saying it's gonna pop basically was
about to happen
now for contouring we're gonna go in
with the morphe 9c palette this is a
really good palette for anyone that just
wants a variety now I love mixing so I'm
gonna go in with this guy and stuff oh
sorry my vibrator alright I am going to
go in with this guy right here with a
little Boop and I'm gonna chisel out
these cheekbones a forehead and chin now
I'm just gonna do highlight even before
brows in my eyes because I can't wait to
be blinding now today I'm going to be
going in with the mega glow highlighting
gold bar from wet and wild now if you've
never tried this one this is brand new
from them this is called the Halle gold
head which is really cute and come on
you see a little star right up there
that's cute
now this one is only 399 and it fucking
works and it's amazing which is great
because who doesn't want to blind on a
budget I'm my girl I'm gonna be using a
little more feet 510 as usual and um
let's glow all the way on the brow bone
even before this browser on there I'm
like you know what I need a blind a
Cupid's bow it's getting a little lonely
so let's give her a minute
mm-hmm
I don't really contour her a lot today
so let's give the nose its little
blinding moment I'm like alright make
this makeup look is done I'm loving this
by itself
woah but for real highlighting is done
now real quickly I'm gonna draw on some
brows off-camera and I'll be right back
and now that the brows are on and
they're a little more higher than normal
oh hi you can see my little beauty mark
hi all right we're gonna prime these
lids with a little Mac painterly I'm
just gonna go over my entire lid and up
to my brow bone
alright now I'm really excited for
today's look because I'm gonna be using
the hooded Beauty a rose gold eyeshadow
palette now I know a lot of youtubers
have you
this and there has been as so many mixed
reviews now I think from already using
this off-camera for a few looks I
understand some people's concerns about
the top row now these are textured
shadows on the box even says best
applied with your fingers now when we
have really long nails like me could be
a little more tricky but that's what the
pinkies for now I've noticed that if you
really wanted the foil shadows to be a
really highly pigmented on your lid it
is easy to just go in with your finger
and like Pat it on and it is a blinding
with a brush it could be a little bit a
little tricky so I'm just going to do
something a little cute and fun today
and I'm going to start by going in with
shade saddle wood which is this one all
the way down here I'm gonna use a little
eye shadow blending brush and we're just
gonna pop this in our crease for our
transition shade and let's blend now
with another eyeshadow blending brush
I'm going to take shade henna which is
this one or right there and we're also
going to put that in the crease and add
a little bit more drama to the lid if
you will
all right now that that is blended and
I'm going to take one of those oil
sheiks this one is called a rose gold
now it says to just use your finger
somebody's my pinky it is the skinniest
nail that I have now when you use this
with your finger like that is full
pigment so I'm just gonna take this and
ah ah ah ah okay okay now let me try to
blend that with my finger it's really
hard because my nail is in the way so
what I'm hoping is I can blend that in
with a little synthetic bristle brush
now here's the thing when you go in with
a brush kind of shows but um not as
pigmented as the finger whatsoever so
I'm just gonna try to go in and blend
that up this is my favorite formula know
if I had no nails would it be a lot
easier yes 100% now I am going to take a
little detailing brush from Mac and
we're gonna dip into shade cocoa which
is this beautiful chocolate brown and
I'm just gonna finesse a little bit into
my crease and make it even deeper and
darker and then we're going to go back
in to saddle wood now I'm going to smoke
out the lash line with bossy and then a
little bit of flamingo and let's try to
mix and see what we can come up with
we're fine I'm just gonna try this pink
shade called flamingo and let's see if
she wants to work now I'm just gonna put
this in my tear duct and blend in I know
it's a little weird placement but hey
I'm a fucking weirdo
oh right guys I am now taking bossy and
flamingos and yep I'm mixing them
together and I'm creating a little kind
of like smokey grungy dirty like
fucked-up kind of eye I mean you know
only the best kind and I'm just blending
these together and really bringing it
down so the drama is real - Zoey all
right I definitely think I need a little
bit of black in my waterline so I'm
gonna take my trusty Mac smolder eye
pencil and uh let's get in there
all right my eyes are oh they're looking
this mold oh alright I think the only
thing that this eye look needs now is um
some lashes and no surprise here I'm
going to be going in with my benefit
roller lash mascara before we put on
some falsies and just coat my entire
bottom and tops
all right now for lashes I'm going to be
going into that new bounce um in style
of Bella and let's pop these bad boys on
and see what happens
now for lips today I'm gonna first start
off with my own velour liquid lipstick
in shade mannequin now this is my
personal go-to nude from my own brand
and um I think I could just die this one
I mean this let though I think I could
definitely be buried in this one okay so
I was gonna add a little extra added
gloss I really don't think it needs it
so I want to go in with this new grill
on gold little like uh I mean she's
pretty but I'm really loving this look
matte with the really glittery lid so
you know what gloss we're gonna save
this for another video
what's last I need a little setting
spray all right now today I'm going to
be going in with the Armani basically
this is like a setting spray they call
it that refreshing makeup fix
so let's lock everything in and start
praying
oh honey to come up for some air hey
baby I'm just trying to set oh yeah can
I help you want to help me all right one
for the Holy Spirit one for my man
thanks man all right guys this look is
complete all right guys this is the
final goal am i I love it I think this
is such a fun look a smoky crazy eye is
always going to be a favorite of mine
and there's the lip though aren't you

crazy makeup debauchery and as always
