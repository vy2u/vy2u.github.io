channel hi how are ya
today we're gonna do a little battle of
the mascaras if you will no this is not
the game of Thrones but this is a little
game of beauty and today we're going to
put one of my favorite if not favorite
ever mascaras on the planet versus a new
one that just hit the market
we're gonna see which one reigns supreme
so today I am of course talking about
the iconic roller lash from Benefit
Cosmetics yes I know this sounds like a
shameless plug but I was the face of
this mascara last summer this has been
on my channel since I started it two
years ago and it is a staple in my
collection so we all know I have used
this on my channel a million times I
can't even imagine counting all the
tutorials that this has made a little
appearance so what are we going to put
up against the roller lash today well
we're just first of all let's just bring
this into frame excuse me everybody I'm
backing up alright so this came to my
door in PR the other day and I'm out
died okay yes this is a huge picture of
my face in an astronaut suit and here is
the introduction to the Benefit
Cosmetics of bad gal bang 36-hour full
blast volumizing mascara and then it
comes with this crazy thing right here
which when you open it up yes it's
actually pink I'm living and breathing
and dying I'm actually gonna turn off
one of these lights you can see how
really pink this is cuz I'm kind of
living for it oh look at that and PS
look at my highlight yes
sarcophagus she better work lights on
alright so here's how it came I'm just
gonna pop this mascara out because oh
that was heavy
alright oh okay I'm not to give a first
impressions on this because it feels
nice and it came with a little travel
mini which i think is so adorable
so here is what the bad gal bang mascara
looks like it has studs on the packaging
of course and it feels matte soft touch
so it feels really nice very heavy and
sturdy just how I like my men so we're
going to open this up and let's see what
kind of wand
is on it oh okay first of all you guys
see how it Wiggles it bends very easy so
the bristles you see are very thin let
me put my hand here in case you guys
need an extra little zoom in so the
bristles appear to be very short and
spiky they are allegedly going to do
some magic to these lashes so let's
refresh our memory on the roller lash
and let's see what the hell bad guy was
supposed to do all right before we dive
into this first impressions I want to
quickly say thank you guys so much for
such an incredible opening day of sales
for the blood sugar palate and the love
sick collection like girl you had me
crying on synapse at like a little baby
it was such a surreal moment just to see
I'm like speechless again just to see
the overwhelming support for the palette
and it was an unreal magical moment so
thank you guys so much for that you guys
have broke all my records in sales today
and I'm just like oh 2018 we are
starting off right let's get into the
Hunger Games all right so just for a
little refresher here is what the
benefit roller lash mascara looks like
this product has 0.30 bounces which is
eight point five grams this one comes in
two colors of course it is a V black and
the name is brown I love both this is
such a favorite of mine and it was such
a crazy and surreal moment to be able to
be the face of it last summer in Sephora
which was just it was a cool goal of
mine that I always wanted to accomplish
and yeah you guys really supported this
they sold a thousands and thousands of
mascaras and yeah I was really proud of
that moment so thanks to you guys for
making it such a hit alright so besides
that you guys remember this mascara it
lifts and curls it has a very volumizing
feel to it I love this today we're gonna
place the roller lash on the left side
on this eye and then we are going to and
then only right eye we're gonna try the
bad gal paying so let's see what this
mascara is supposed to do now let's get
my FAQ sheet so this is allegedly a
36-hour
full blast of volumizing mascara that
creates massive volume without weighing
down
lashes okay I like the sound of that
this says this is a gravity-defying
formula
it contains aero particles which are one
of the lightest known materials derived
from space technology oh this innovative
intense pitch black mascara layers
easily for bigger impact it's
custom-built slim packed brush is
designed for reach from root to tip and
corn in the corner of both from your
upper and lower lashes for big volume
with 360 degree reach I'm like girl just
gonna like blow me too I'm excited okay
so it's smudge proof its water-resistant
its volumizing and it also has the pro
vitamin b5 to support natural lash
thickness and strength
all right so allegedly this is gonna be
amazing that's basically what this says
so yeah I think let's try the products
and let's see if this is gonna be a new
favor I'm scared you guys I have loved
this for so long but do we have a new
contender we're about to find out
first of all you guys we have a moment
of silence for this jacket like bitch
look at that Gucci you did that Hey
all right you guys let me move my hair
out of the way and now we are going to
do a little zoom in and here is a fresh
roller lash now I may have some glue
residue in my lashes I have been filming
a lot this week so excuse me if my
lashes look a little oh little janky a
little scary
alright so let's take the Rose eyelash
and give it a whirl
now I'm gonna dip in one more time for
the bottom so they are very pitch black
like my soul
all right there is the roller lash
mascara I'm sorry you guys this is a
good-ass mascara I'm looking in the
monitor like mmm just so natural and
pretty alright whoa let's get to the
other side scooting over this way
hi oh wow mommy needs some mascara
all right so let's give this a whirl I
am excited to try this oh oh there is
the wand I'm gonna do a little
comparison so you guys can see the
difference of these two and here they
are very different in size and shape so
let's give this a whirl okay hold on now
holy okay now let's do some bottoms
I'm gonna dip it in because there's so
much product on the brush you really
need like one dip all right here is the
bad gal bang mascara on now girl
first impressions a let's dive into it
right now well let's give you guys a
little zoom in so here is the roller
lash side right here and then here is
the bad gal bang side over here
all right so let me look in the mirror
oh wow okay so definitely right away the
bad gal is more dramatic girl there is a
drama on my lashes they are thick they
look fake there's a lot more product on
the lash than this side only a little
more thicker and more together like the
roller lash looks more separated soft
and pretty whereas this one is like
Hello
we are going somewhere important and you
better look me in my eyes
alright so the bottom lashes look a lot
thicker and this side looks a little
more soft and gentle and this one is
like full-on hello there do you need to
get swallowed I don't know which one I
like more I'm sitting here like I'm
speechless for a second roller lash is
just like so iconic it's so pretty this
one is definitely more like Vavoom it's
like dramatic the lashes appear even
more darker like this one is black but
this one is like that cold jet black
which I know a lot of us love now let me
just touch this look at them long lashes
it definitely gave me a lot of length
and there's really nothing on my finger
like a little tiny black so it is taking
a second to dry it's a little more like
more wet consistency and it's said that
it was gonna be weightless but this one
actually feels a tiny bit heavier than
the roller lash now I'm sure a lot of
you just pop on false lashes anyway but
if you're someone that just wants to
wear a mascara on the go this one might
be a little bit more comfortable but
this one isn't like annoying me or
bothering me it just feels a little bit
more heavy if you guys know what I mean
I'm gonna gonna let this fully dry and
let's see how we're feeling alright you
guys so I am so shook because first of
all good morning I don't know which one
I like better like I actually like both
but for two different reasons like there
really isn't a negative this one is a
lot thicker so I feel like my lashes
look a little bit more like not stuck
together but it's a little bit more like
spidery whereas this side is a lot more
like hi I'm going to a wedding
I might go to an orgy so really I don't
know I do know this let me just say this
right off the bat the Benefit Cosmetics
bad gal bang mascara is Geoffrey star
I gotta say that right off the bat it
looks stunning it is dramatic like mmm
like if you're someone that is more
simple and you just want to have like
dramatic lashes and just add a little
shimmer to your lid like this look today
very minimalistic I think this is
perfect you don't have to waste the time
of putting on false lashes dealing with
the glue the tweezer is everything if
you just want to like hi BAM we're ready
to roll
definitely it would recommend this
roller lash is always gonna be a staple
but this might be a new contender I
can't decide if I if I like him were
it's just different it's just a
different vibe and I love both vibes so
honestly today there might be a
stalemate because there really is no
winner it really depends on the effect
that you want
I think the roller lash is always gonna
be a staple for me but this is a new
contender so we will see in future
videos how we are loving this but for
now it is a stalemate because they both
won which has never happened on this
channel before so I'm having a moment of
silence okay so anyway sound off below
let me know what you guys think which
eye do you like better did you love the
bad gal or did you love the roller sound
off give me some feedback let me know
what's up and yeah thank you guys for
watching this video I am going to go
test this out and see if it's really
water-resistant and maybe go splash in
the jacuzzi until next time you guys
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you on the next one mwah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
