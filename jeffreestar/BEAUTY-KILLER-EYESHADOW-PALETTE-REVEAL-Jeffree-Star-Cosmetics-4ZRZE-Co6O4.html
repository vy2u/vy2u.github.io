most excited I have been in a really
long time I have been working on this
secret project for for a minute it's
taking me about eight to nine months to
develop this product to make it to
manufacture it and to perfect it because
you guys know I make a nothing but top
quality so I am really excited to show
you guys my first-ever eye shadow
palette you guys this is what I've been
kind of sneaking on snapchat and
Instagram this is the beauty killer
eyeshadow palette there are three
different finishes in this palette so
I'm going to show you guys everything
today we're gonna go through every
single shade we're gonna talk about
where the inspiration came from I'm
going to show you guys swatches of
everything and we're gonna get to play
with this together so if you guys want
to see what's inside of this palette and
keep on watching all right now before we
open this and get to playing I just want
to let you guys know the inspiration
buying this palette I get asked a lot
like is the name beauty killer from my
music days and a hundred percent my
first album that I ever put out this is
like 2009 who lowered I put out my first
debut album called beauty killer and it
has been something I've used in my brand
a lot when I had t-shirts in Hot Topic
and every mall like five years ago
everything I beauty killer on it so I'm
like it's only fitting my first ever
palette it's gonna be called UT killer
so that is where that inspiration comes
from now let's get inside of this
alright so let's just cut to the chase
I'm gonna show you guys every color boom
you ready you ready all right you guys
here is all ten shades I plug Vanna
White since I started doing makeup I've
always done really dramatic eyes way
back in the myspace days and when I was
a little kid and I was just dabbling
into makeup in 12 years old I always
went big so I definitely wanted to
create a palette that was very Jeffrey
star right off the bat you know this is
my palette
added in every color that I thought of
when I thought of myself and I was
looking back they're all my old looks
too all my current looks and I'm giving
you a variety there's a lot to play with
I think obviously you guys see right off
the bat that the J star logo is stamped
into all the pans which I thought looked
sick anning and it's very gold very pink
just like the liquid lip now the pan
sizes I know it's hard to tell if you're
at home and you don't have this yet the
pan sizes are extra big so I'm just
going to show you guys a little MAC
eyeshadow comparison so you get a lot
for your money this palette will retail
for $45 this is a lot of product it is a
good price point I'm always like iffy
about price points because I want
everybody to be able to afford it and I
know a lot of high-end makeup is way too
overpriced so I am giving you high
quality for a good price let's get just
watching so a few key facts I want you
guys to know about this is 100% vegan
100% cruelty free everything is finely
milled so when you touch these they are
like a butter and they blend really
really nicely now obviously if I made
some chalky like we all joke
about hopefully all we come to my house
and beat the out of me so I'm gonna
go from left to right and we're just
going to talk about all the colors
this palette is very versatile you can
get a million look so I'm gonna put this
flat on the table and I'm going to show
you guys kind of like a little hand
thing that I do to see how many looks
you can really get out of this palette
it has a lot of options so as you can
see when I take my hand over it there is
four colors there I mean girl you could
you could do a lot with that I think
right and then you move her hands over a
little one more time and then I woke a
mm-hmm we're getting into a little a
little a little eveningwear and then
you're gonna move over and you're like
oh damn bitch
might wear that to my wedding yes and
then last but not least I mean hi those
are classic colors that my grandma or my
little cousins gonna wear to them to my
funeral yes ma'am
in the beauty killer palette there are
three formulas there is a beautiful
buttery matte shade so the first shadow
starpower that gorgeous hot hot Barbie
pink that is a matte and then we have
frost which are like these and then we
have the glitters which is on this end
and on this end first shade is called
star power which is of course after my
last name and you know it's a little
Nintendo throwback now this color
oof I mean hi I coated my entire under
eyes with this shade today it is a
statement piece so I'm just gonna swatch
this little guy oh I hate ruining the
J's in the pan and you guys like gives
me severe anxiety but we are going to
just do a little one two three it's neon
that's all there is to it so if you are
afraid of bright colors I want you to
pop this in your crease and
try it out because I promise you it's
going to change your life all of these
eyeshadows are vegan which is cool
because a lot of brands have neon
eyeshadows but a lot of the times
they're deemed not eye safe because
there are certain types of dyes that
will really stain your lids and not come
off for a few days so mine is a hundred
percent I save so as you see I put white
liner and then I put the pink in the
waterline and below and hi I'm not blind
so everything is 100% I safe now the
second shade is a beautiful frosty baby
pink this shade is called princess and
she is really frosty you could actually
use it as a highlight pop it in your
inner corner put on your entire lid I
named the shade after watching toddlers
in tiaras and I was like damn all those
pretty crowns like okay Oh princess get
it girl so that is where that name came
from and I think it is just oh I mean I
really just want to rub it all over my
cheeks right now the third shade is this
really soft like it has iridescent to it
so I'm gonna swatch it for you guys it's
called violence I'm just going to show
you what this looks like
right off the bat so you guys can really
see it is like a crushed berry dream and
has like a little bluey purple
iridescent so it does have like a frosty
shimmer now I named this color violence
after my first EP if you guys have never
heard of my music look it up on iTunes
or you can watch my old videos on my
channel it's pretty fun this deal will
throwback
so the second EP I ever came out with
was called cupcakes taste like violence
it was a hot topic hit honey and that
was 2008 oh my but I was an infant so
this is a little throwback shade for my
old music now the fourth shade which hi
this is on my lids today is called rich
bitch I mean I it's a beautiful metallic
gold like whoo this color is like you
are dipped in 24 carat realness it is so
gorgeous like on the lid let me let me
know let me show you a little mm let me
just do the look down I love it like
once I popped on my lid all of a sudden
like gained an extra like bit of
confidence and I was like session around
my house like mmhmm what what dogs you
don't know me now the fifth shade on the
top is listen it is gonna be your
favorite transition color this looks
perfect on any skin tone pop that in the
lid and go high this color was inspired
by the movie jawbreaker it stars Rose
McGowan who plays someone named Courtney
hello Courtney and she kills someone so
if you've never seen that movie bitch
you've got to watch it after this it is
let me swatch this I'm running out of
fingers I'm gonna use my thumb
and it is creamy my matte formula is you
guys oh they are like so this is a
perfect little terracotta warm perfect
transition color I'm wearing it today
rot in there I think it's gonna be my
favorite so this might be the one I hit
pan on first don't maybe the pink I
don't know so I just cleaned off my
fingers we can do the bottom five as you
can see there is no stay
means they come off really good let's
get right to it the bottom left as you
can see is a beautiful glittery teal
this shade is called expensive you see
there's a there's a lot of glitter in
there this is one of the two glitter
shades in a palette now I named the
shape because I was looking at I was
like gee no mischief looks expensive and
I was really stoked on how dope this
color came out so this one is you got
don't be afraid to try this color I mean
put some teal in the crease do a little
on the waterline maybe a little bit on
the lid teal is scary for a lot of
people they get intimidated by it but
try it out try something new the next
shade is called confession this is like
a rusty soft burgundy red it is oh I
mean come on I just love that grungy
smoky eye shadow type of look I mean
I've been wearing smoky big eyes for a
long time so this is definitely inspired
by some of my old makeup looks as well
as that pink if you're an old school fan
you know what I'm talking about a little
plastic surgery slumber party holler
confession is really good for not
transition color but right below it like
tuck that rest in there oof it looks so
pretty for another good trick I love to
do with this one is put on black
eyeliner in my waterline and then take
like a little fine pencil brush and I'll
drag confession all under my eye and it
gives it that really cool grunge alert
so I think this one actually would look
good on every skin tone alright the
third should on the bottom is called
vanity now I have been using this word
since I was like 13 years old I actually
have it tattooed on my wrist this was
like yeah this is like a 12 year old
tattoo and then a few years later right
before beauty killer the album came out
I got vanity tattooed on my face now
that is a lot of foundation over it is
not faded I get asked that all the time
how can we don't let your tattoo come
through honestly I don't really care
I've had it for so long I just put
makeup right over it so I named the
shade after one of my favorite word's
this shade is it's like a blackened plum
it is really cool now this is a shade
I'm wearing
in my whole entire crease as well I'm
just gonna swatch this it has this one
is like oh my I mean now that they are
all pigmented as but this one is
like hi come through so I put that all
in my crease and on my lash line and oh
I'm I'm really obsessed I'm so happy how
this one turned out now this one China
white is the perfect highlight color for
under your brow bone now if you've
watched any of my tutorials you know I
love to take a light shadow and coat my
entire lash line all the way to the brow
bone completely covered so of course I
could not make a palette without that
shade so let me swatch it for you this
one is so pretty really creamy whew
hello oh I love this one it's like it
just glides like butter mmm alright now
the last shade in the palette is a show
stopper this is called a black rainbow
this was inspired by a Marilyn Manson
lyric that is in one of his songs called
disposable teens Oh like when I saw I
like immediately thought of that song so
that's where the inspiration for that
one came and I'm gonna use my thumb and
just wash it for you guys
this is another glitter one I'm just
gonna do it once for you guys so you
guys can just really see what's
happening here you really don't need a
lot this one I don't every video like a
little goes a long way guys listen if
you are a smokey eye lover take this
color put it everywhere and smoke this
out this paired with Courtney and vanity
mm-hmm I'm gonna be filming a makeup
