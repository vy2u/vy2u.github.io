so I'm really really excited for today's
video we are going to be testing out the
brand-new Pat McGrath mat trance
lipsticks listen bitch I saw these
online the other day the sneak preview
and I was like oh my god they look
fucking bomb now Pat McGrath laughs did
send me all these lipsticks today so I
am dying to try them out now they look
something like this of course you guys
have seen the iconic Pat McGrath
sequined bags by now she has come out
with highlighters she's come out with
eyeshadows and they're all in kids she's
had lift kits with glitter and these are
the latest items that she is releasing
these are a matte stick lipstick but the
formula allegedly is more unique than
the average matte lip now they do come
in these kits and I have all three of
them today these are a limited edition
so I don't really talk about people that
have inspired me because there's not a
lot of makeup artists growing up that I
was like obsessed with but Pat is one of
those just iconic unreal amazing artists
so when Pat first released some of her
products and she was announcing a makeup
line I was so like giddy and excited
I've definitely fell in love with her
skin fetish highlighter they are
blinding and unreal so I am going to
open one of these first this is the so
there's different like versions they
each come with three lipsticks for these
kids now I do want to note that these
will be sold individually for $38 she's
a luxury brand y'all and then they will
come in these trios which are $95 and
then there is a everything kit that
includes all nine lipsticks and that
retails for two hundred and seventy five
dollars these will be available on Pat
McGrath calm and then of course she is a
brand that is known as Sephora so I'm
sure these will be on Sephora calm and
in stores so first of all let's open
these bad bitches up and see what
happens I'm just going to take some
scissors
going to go right in here now I love
this packaging it's very like medical
glamour I love the sequins actually save
them and maybe go swimming in my bathtub
with them when I'm not filming once you
open it up you guys you see the sequins
are encased with the product so we're
going to take out I'm sure that's one
lipstick would even fit a little name
right there and then of course there is
another one and then there is the third
color so let's open up one of these and
let's talk about the component the
product the way everything oh so here is
the component for the lipstick I know
you guys cannot feel this through your
screen but it's a nice weight it feels
really good especially for a luxury
brand on top it does have a little black
moment and of course the shade names are
on the bottom I love when you open it
and it has the lips still on it so I
think it's really cute you know my
bougie-ass is like for pictures and
Melilla so then of course we're going to
twist it up oh wow I mean we all know
what a matte lipstick normally looks
like this just looks extra matte I want
to say like I know it just looks
different than a normal like matte
lipstick it looks cool alright promise
just unwrapping all three of them
look at these shades like oh I don't
know if you guys can see this on the
screen but the actual lipstick looks
like a petal off of a rose they just
have a unique texture I'm like a little
shook about it basically this a lust
collection for lips is a provocative
colorful Avoca
fucking amazing product basically and
this is past cake on a matte lip this is
her brand new formula that's kind of I
don't know if it's ever been done before
so basically it says that entrancing
color that satisfies with supreme
hydration okay so it supposed to be
hydrating opulent matte opacity so it is
supposed to have a lot of coverage and
it also says that you can flaunt your
fixations Orly and it's luxurious richly
pigmented formulation that cloaks lips
and in light weight veil of rich color
I'm my girl that sounds good and then it
says like a good lover this lipstick
lays down a high impact with a strong
finish now of course I want to prep my
mouth before every lips watch a video I
ever do I always prep my lips with lip
scrub so I'm going to go in with my own
the lower lip scrub in flavor watermelon
gum if you are a lover of candy or
anything sweet
the flavor of Gumby for you so I like to
take a little bit on my finger and just
go to town
you're not substitute for a meal girl
okay so the weight of this product I do
want to mention it it is 0.14 ounces
that's pretty good for a lipstick so
that's awesome
now this shade is called obsessed and I
guess I'm just ready to get to swatching
now of course let me do my favorite
thing on earth let me sniff oh my god
this is like literally odorless oh whoa
how cool I mean you know I love flavor
not intense flavor but wow it's like
there's no there's no fragrance okay
cool alright I am ready to get to
swatching so let's see what the hell
these are going to do to my mouth oh
holy shit okay
one swipe coverage ain't lyin okay
literally I'm like scared to tell you
guys how much I'm over already obsessed
with this because I know I'm like girl
Pat if you are watching this you just
kill the lipstick game this feels so
lightweight I feel like there's
literally nothing on my mouth it went on
so easy I'm like scared to say this out
loud but this might be like the easiest
matte lip I have ever applied it's
really hydrating it feels good it
doesn't feel gummy or sticky or hard or
it is so lightweight my I like my
clothes my eyes like suppose like
nothing's on my mouth and first of all
the color the pigment you guys saw like
a one little oh okay
damn I'm like alright um I'm shocked all
right the next shade is called full
panic and it is a stunning bright pink
how does it look on my mouth let's find
out
all right here is a full panic it is
such a beautiful pink now I've kind of
strayed away from pink lipsticks because
I've been wearing them for 10 years and
needed to maybe switch it up a little
bit but this is beautiful
same exact formula now once I try like
five or six shades I'm kind of figure
out like okay is this brand consistent
or do the shades kind of change you know
sometimes the liquid lips one shades
great the dark ones are weird with this
but this feels identical to the first
one and I'm liking it so far alright the
next shade is called Elson it looks like
a true beautiful matte red it looks
something like this and let's put her on
now of course this is cool tone which I
love cool toned Reds
now this formula is very consistent with
the last two so I want to swatch a few
of the nudes and then maybe one or two
of the dark shade so let's get into it
all right I just opened up the nude set
this is called the skin show these
little three and I'm going to do a few
for you now the first one that was
really like gravitating to me you guys
it's called 19 and 95 what the hell is I
didn t 95 probably got to suck my first
deck so this color just look stunning
already I'm like let's put her on to
Matt you guys these are so easy to apply
the point at the end definitely helps
like shape your lip and it's like
literally the same formula which I love
there's no inconsistencies so far and I
am really happy okay girl work alright
the next shade we are going to try is
called flesh 3 it looks to be like a
dark kind of warm tone nude and let's
see how she looks
okay this shade is really cool it's
almost like a like red based warm
terracotta brown nude the list goes on
and on but I really like this color
stain formula last name everything girl
okay all right you guys I wanted to try
one of the dark shades from the vicious
Venom's kit now there is one shade that
was really like calling my name it's
called deep void and when I opened it I
was like oh my god is this like a black
lipstick but it's actually a really like
blackened purple plum and I'm like girl
I gotta fucking try this out the inner
goth kid in me is like alright let's see
how she looks
holy shit come on pigment okay now with
really dark colors they can be
unforgiving so I am going to go in with
a little lip brush just to perfect it so
I don't look crazy alright so I have
been touching this up with a lip brush
now the only thing I think because this
is so dark and there's a lot of pigment
to it it's kind of skipping a tiny bit
and what I mean by that is like when you
you can like on that we're going to zoom
in right now and you can see like a
little bit here a little bit in there
and a little bit here as I'm
manipulating the product it does skip a
little bit so I'm just going to take
this now that my mouth is lying and just
kind of go over problem solved it filled
in beautifully out of all of them I
think this one was the only one that I
had a little bit of like trouble putting
on and as far as the matte formula it
just have a little bit more like a shine
as you guys can see it's not like a
hundred percent matte like the other one
but it is a stunning color alright you
guys I think I can come to my final
conclusion not that any of you are going
to be shocked here but the Pat McGrath
mass transit sticks our efforts are
approved I really really love the
formula of these you guys everything
from the packaging to even the shade
names yes I love a good shade name these
are just really really good quality
lipsticks I had no idea
what I was about to get into of course
you see things online and you're like
okay great let me see it in person and
this is one of those products that was
even better than my expectations because
I really didn't know what to expect of
course there was a few other shades I
did not swatch but you guys of course
got to see the majority I hope you guys
can gather your thoughts and opinions
from what you've seen in this video but
I am really happy with this formula and
I hope she puts out more shades because
yeah girls hugged all right you guys
