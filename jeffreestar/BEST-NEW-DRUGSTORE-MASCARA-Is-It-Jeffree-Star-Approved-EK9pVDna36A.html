channel today we are going to try out a
crazy drugstore mascara that everyone
keeps tweeting me sending me screenshots
and I'm like I don't review that many
mascaras on my channel but when there's
a new hot drugstore item I want to tell
you guys about it I want to kind of give
you guys a quick little life update
Before we jump into the review life has
been really really crazy and just moving
fast I'm like wait we're in July summers
like here the years half over I'm shook
next month is Nathan's birthday
shout-out to all my Leo's out there Nate
is August 19th anyone have the same
birth is my ma'am Nate actually
surprised me with roses and breakfast in
bed today and a massage after I'm just
in love you guys and I just can't get
over it so I just want to share my
happiness okay I think there's always so
much drama going on in the beauty
community I'm like let's just pause the
breaks here talk about love and
butterflies and condoms so besides that
you guys if you are on the east coast on
September 9th and 10th I will be there
for RuPaul's Drag Con it is a huge
convention celebrating the art of drag
makeup and love my brand will be the
main sponsor ll be selling my entire
makeup collection there Elle has a booth
I'm also bringing along Manny and Laura
Lee so we're going to have a huge meet
and greet and more details to follow so
if you do want to buy tickets to drag
Cohn everything will be linked down
below oh I have something really
exciting finally you guys I am bringing
back some shades into my permanent line
I'm also reintroducing some sold out
shades that were part of a limited
edition collection last holiday so
drumroll please we got druglord
liquid lipstick coming back of course if
you want to wear white lipstick girl do
you but a lot of people love using this
for eyeliner my formula is vegan and eye
safe and also it's really great to mix
in with other liquid lips to manipulate
them change them make them lighter so
it's really a cool tool if you are a
creative motherfuckers we have
watermelon soda from last summer it's
finally back and it still smells the
same improve the formula on that and we
got crocodile tears we also have
designer blood which is one of my
favorite shades so many people were like
emailing customers
service and we're like hey can you bring
them back and then last but not least we
have liquid lip shade deceased so those
are all available on my website right
now all right
besides that you guys I'm ready to dive
into this mascara so if you want to see
if the motherfucking thing works and
keep on watching all right
so L'Oreal has put out a brand new
mascara called the voluminous lash
paradise first of all the packaging is
pink had to match my backdrop today
because you know I'm a pink whore I love
the packaging already I think it's a
really cute of course we're about to
bust this baby open
so this retails for $9.99 now I was
researching drugstore mascaras in
general and that it's pretty much a
standard price point it's between like
seven to twelve dollars and then once it
goes up from there bitch any really
drugstore so this packaging you guys
says that this is Laurie Oates first
mascara for a voluptuous volume and lush
length basically the applicator is
supposed to fulfill my lash desires so
allegedly it has a soft wavy brush with
over 200 bristles that is supposed to
hold the maximum formula for a dramatic
volumizing charge to catch every lash I
feel like we're watching a movie preview
this is so damn dramatic so provides
silky volume in one coat okay so we're
going to put that to the test right now
intense at the gays soft to the touch so
and then after it says it removes easily
with soap and water so if any of you out
there using soapy water to wash your
face or your mascara off I'm coming for
you okay so we are going to open up this
bad boy out this is in shade blackest
black I don't know if there's other
colors this is the only one that I saw
so let's open her up now everyone is
saying that drugstore mascaras have
really stepped it up and I've probably
used a lot of them you guys know I am
addicted to the benefit roller lash it
is my tried-and-true cool I also want to
note that this has 0.28 fluid ounces and
unlike is that normal I don't even know
it's a normal mascara this one says
as 0.31 fluid ounces so that's close and
then the benefit one has 0.30
so that is pretty standard so like every
three to four months I threw away my
mascara and I buy a new one for sanitary
reasons you're always touching your eye
and you know the mascara does get dry so
the wand first impression let's see who
okay so I'm just going to get the
product off of there a lot of product
did come out so it definitely is really
adhered to the bristles I don't know if
anyone else at home loves like the smell
of makeup in general like I could smell
the foundation for a minute I could hop
some mascara and I'm not recommending
that all right so of course I have a no
mascara on my eyes right now now I do
wear makeup you guys almost every single
day so sometimes my lashes will have
some residue but I did a deep cleaning
and there should be literally nothing on
them I'm also trying out a new concealer
from benefit today and I will say this
just fucking follow me you guys and now
you're going to be like what the hell is
it I mean let me grab it it is the
benefit Boeing airbrush concealer
alright so I'm going to of course do my
top lashes first so here we go that's it
one coat so I'm just going to do one
coat of course I'll probably end up
doing four or five but let's just try
one and see what happen whoa okay hold
on hold on the brush is big which I love
but notice how it did hit my bottom
lashes which obviously doesn't matter if
I'm about to go in into the bottom but
if you have really small eyes that may
be a problem but so far so good so this
is one coat you guys can see it's cute
definitely think it needs one or two
more just for my satisfaction so let's
do another coat
all right so the top one it looks pretty
so far now let's go in with the bottom
and I'm going to be careful because this
brush is rather large so I'm just going
to be really delicate oh wow that coated
them like quick now I have no eyeliner
on I have no I shadow really under here
except barely a touch okay let's let
this dry and then compare to the other
side all right you guys so I do want to
show you one side done so I'm going to
look into the zoom and you guys can see
this side of course is it's pretty good
you guys like I'm a little shocked at
how quick it was and then compared to
the other side which is blank and naked
you can see the volume do a little I
turn first impressions I am really
impressed this mascara I think that the
bottom ones almost look like they're
like false lashes I love how the
bristles separated them really finely it
didn't clump together it didn't get
weird now my top lashes are definitely a
little jacked up from putting on so many
false lashes on for the last what 100
years over six months so they're not
going to probably look as sickening as
they will on any of you who don't wear
false lashes every day but for my hair
is being ripped out and pulled all the
time it looks pretty damn good alright
so I'm going to put this on my other eye
and let's see how they look you know
look altogether
all right so looking in the maunder I
love how it's looking I just love how
it's very like bedroom eyes at the end
of the day either a mascara works or
doesn't it all depends on how you like
it on yourself but my thoughts in my
opinions I mean obviously I know this is
a little shorter review than normal but
this is a mascara and I was scared that
it was gonna flop because I had not
really like fall in love with the
drugstore mascara and I will say this
L'Oreal you do have it hit on your hands
because this lash paradise is amazing I
love how this looks my bottom lashes
might be my favorite thing I just love I
just like how it makes me feel I'm like
I'm just a little sexy all of a sudden
alright you guys I think we all know
what the answer is going to be here the
L'Oreal lash paradise mascara jeffree
star approved I think for $9.99 you
cannot be how great the wand works and I
think the product is great it was quick
drying it doesn't feel weird my lashes
still feel like lightweight they don't
feel crunchy or hard or you know y'all
know what I mean sometimes mascara it
looks like fucking low tranches and
spiders and this just looks really nice
I love how it looks if you guys want to
let me know any hot new drugstore items
