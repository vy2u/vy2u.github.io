channel today we're unveiling the blood
sugar pressed pigment eyeshadow palette
and girl I know the internet is dying to
see we open this box so let me jump
right into it today we are of course
going to show you the entire lovesick
collection from jeffree star cosmetics
which features the coveted blood sugar
palette now oh my god I've been working
on this for months and I'm so excited to
finally show you everything it is a
different color story than my previous
palettes of course beauty killer and
androgyny were very unique on their own
and they have their own moments and now
it's time for the future so 2018 here we
are my brand of course turned 3 years
old
just a few months ago and it is just so
unreal that everything just keeps
growing and you guys are loving
everything that I'm putting out so first
of all before I even unveil everything
thank you for the support and I
literally do everything for you guys so
seeing the feedback from the packaging
so far before you guys have even seen me
open everything was like crazy so thank
you for that that really just made me
even extra excited to just show
everything so this collection is all red
of course red red red girl we are in the
red season I have done pink for so long
I'm like what is next we've done chrome
we've done yellow we've done white cap
we've done black we've done hologram
we've done pink we've done everything so
I'm like girl what is next
red chrome was speaking to me I love it
it's almost just like a Valentine's Day
Terminator type of vibe of course you
guys are gonna see everything in a
minute I think it's time for me to shut
my mouth and show you guys the palette
now blood sugar of course is my third
palette and when you buy it BAM it comes
in a box like this now look I am so
excited to show you guys everything so
we're about to pop this baby open but
before I even open this I do want to say
I wanted to create something a little
different now in the makeup industry I
know a lot has already been done before
so it's like what can you do for a
palette I was very inspired by like
doctor medical boxes I'm very into the
medical field in general I love reading
books and watching documentaries on
Netflix I am just a very into that whole
thing so when I was thinking of a theme
or what to do I started to create these
shades in the lab and they were very
like we'll see in a second I know
everyone
they're very like you'll see the story
it's just different so I wanted to show
that with the box this comes in a I'm
gonna say a VCR like box if you don't
know what a VCR is they're ancient but
you pull out the palette like this so of
course you can see the clasps right away
all the info is on the back and this is
kind of like a book like moment but
everything of course is here all the
product info now let's unveil her let's
open her up she slides out like this and
of course this is a little thicker than
a normal pallet so of course you guys
know the androgyny palette is very thin
this one is big this is like a literal
box so you see the difference now this
one is heavy not like overwhelmingly
heavy but girl you know I love a
luxurious expensive feeling box or
packaging so this one definitely has
some really nice weight to it now of
course we have the clasps where you open
the packaging and are we ready for the
unveiling all right you guys here is the
debut of
the blood sugar pallet so when you first
open up the pallet you will notice that
the pan sizes are smaller than my
previous pallets now listen these
pallets
I took it there when I first launched my
brand I wanted to go really big like go
big or go home and these are massive it
takes people months and months to even
hit pan on this so I thought okay we're
gonna do 18 shades now beauty killer
androgyny had 10 I want to do more so
when I was thinking of the design I'm
like okay we're gonna make the pans
smaller but I'm gonna show you a
comparison right now compared to a Mac
Shadow these pans are still very large
so I'm going to show just a normal eye
shadow of course this is not me shading
anyone I'm just showing you a comparison
because so many people I know we're
going to ask so here is the size of a
mac eyeshadow which of course is a
little circle so you guys of course can
see the comparison these are still
really big pan sizes and because the
internet wants to know all the damn t
i'm literally going to pop one of these
shadows out that i've already been using
and show you exactly how big they are so
here is the size of the pan it goes in
deep so it's not like a really thin
where you literally get like no product
you get a nice amount of products so
that is the pan size for this of course
now I did make a component that had 18
pans with being
huge size that are in these girl it was
so bulky and massive I was like no one
wants and no one's gonna want to travel
with this or carry this around so I did
make the pen size smaller but you still
get a lot of product now of course
everyone is gonna be asking what is the
price now I did have to charge a few
more dollars in my previous pallets of
course there is eight more shades and
you are getting this amazing packaging
that is very custom so the blood-sugar
palette will retail for $52 I tried to
keep it very fair now for $52 if you
divide everything that is literally two
dollars and 80 cents per shadow girl you
know what it is so I want to be very
fair with this and I think you guys will
agree for this type of setup and how
many shades there are I think $52 is a
very fair and of course everything else
in the collection has the same price as
the previous stuff so let's dive in and
talk about the colors now there is gonna
be a million swatches all over the
internet there's gonna be a lot of
tutorials including one in a few days on
my channel so I'm not going to do a
bunch of swatches all over my body I
feel like when you're showing off eyes
shadow it's really all about how you
apply them with the brush or what you
use I think digging your finger in and
rubbing them on your arm is all right
for some Instagram moments but literally
no one is going to apply this entire
palette with their fingers that's just
not realistic so I think when people
show off their pigments or anything a
lot of the times I've even swatched a
palette from other brands where it looks
beautiful on the arm your swatching and
you're like oh my god and then you put
it on the lid and it's like crazy and
not great so I think showing finger
swatches isn't it's like we're gonna
show you all the colors of course right
now and I'm gonna like dig into some but
let's go through all of them from top
second and third row now a lot of the
shade names are medical dentistry
desserts sweet it's very like all in
that realm so the first shade is called
glucose of course it is a pure matte
white I have never created one yet and I
just love a matte matte white so you
will notice there are three formulas in
this palette of course we have the
iconic matte shades and the matte
formula that is in my previous palettes
and
there are three metallic shades right
here we have blood sugar sweetener and
candy floss and then we have a high-bred
breast pigment which is like almost
glitter foil and metallic in one next is
sugar cane it is a very soft cool tone
Brown perfect for in that crease if you
just want to do a transition shade easy
next we have cake mix which is a deeper
brown that is very nice for building and
just creating a perfect flawless smoky
eye and then next we have outch which is
a even deeper more warm tone kind of
camel brown color I love this all over
the lid next we have donor which I'm
just gonna swatch this now with my
finger it is so oh so creamy it's like
hi there it is a very blinding so I'm
just gonna do a little swatch even
though I don't like finger swatches I'm
gonna show you guys real quick just how
easy that is to apply now metallic
shades I like to taking with my finger
sometimes and Pat them on the lid and
then I'll take a brush and do extra and
just kind of go in there and soften it
and then next to complete the full brown
smokey eye moment to get that look we
have intravenous here which is a very
beautiful more dark warm tone chocolate
brown so of course if you are afraid of
neon colors this top row will be your
best friend but if you're into diving
into a little more fun the rest of the
palette will definitely intrigue you now
candy floss which if you do not know
that is what people in the UK or England
call cotton candy now when I travelled
there for the first time ten years ago I
was dying for dessert and they had this
like bag and it said candy floss and I'm
like this can't cotton candy and
everyone's like duh that's what we call
it here I love that name so I used that
for this beautiful metallic pink shade I
actually have this one I need my little
wand so I have this shade right here
today just to give that extra little pop
of color next we have this matte shade
which is almost like a it's like a soft
orange tone like it's it's different I
love it it's called Tong pop and it's
really great for in the crease very good
for a transition shade just like sugar
cane or cake mix it just has a little
bit of like a flavor to it and this
today I am wearing blended out
really very softly up here and of course
we have glucose below the eyebrow so on
the brow bone now we have sweetener next
to this this is a full-on blinding
metallic shade is very pretty it has
pink tones and it's kind of peachy it
has a little bit of like golden
undertone it is bilal as' alright next
we have a cavity of course now if you
have been following me for a long time
you know that I have had a lot of dental
work I've been haunted by my teeth
problem since I was a baby you guys I've
had like 30 cavities from a baby to an
adult I've had eight root canals I've
had my whole entire mouth restored it
has been a crazy journey okay like one
day I'm gonna do a video storytime about
that and show you guys the before and
afters it's scary and I am wearing
cavity all over here today now next we
have o+ now that is a more muted
cool-toned
gray brown I love it it's really good
for transition and also for mixing with
the bright colors if you want to dim
them down a little bit alright so root
canal is a vibrant ultra violet purple
pink hybrid it is so stunning we
actually use some of it today to mix in
here it is just a very bright color
packet on the lid put it in your crease
put it in your inner corner it's for you
baby let's go down to the third row as
you see the shade prick has a needle
stamp into it instead of the normal jst
logo I wanted to do something a little
different so I did different stamps for
these corners now this shade is called
prick so I used a needle so that color
can see it Pat it all over my lid it
looks so pretty like it's such a vibrant
color it's probably the brightest shade
in the palette
besides cavity now moving on next to it
is I had to create a matte red shade so
cherry soda is red it is straight-up
red I've always wanted to create a red
shadow I've been wearing red shadow as
probably since like literally eighth
grade like my first color ever if you've
watched some of my story times I wore a
red eye shadow in eighth grade to school
and they called my mom like girl we got
to talk and I remember stealing that
rusty red color from my mom so - the
cherry soda we also have another one
called fresh meat which is a more dark
like Mulberry burgundy shade
perfect for these mixing in like I live
for this color this one is actually
under my lid right under here em and
then blended out with cherry soda now
next to fresh meat we have blood sugar
of course I named a shade after the
palette and this is a straight up rusty
red I'm actually gonna just touch with
my finger
I hate rolling the pans so it is very
like dark rusty I love it I want to
smoke out my entire lash line with it
we'll just show you a little red right
there boom I live for red shadows and
then next to blood sugar we have
extraction which is a darker version of
fresh meat as you can see the tones are
very different this is more red and this
is like a straight-up plum burgundy
color and last but not least we have
shade coma which as you can see the
medical symbol is embossed and there and
stamped in and I put the shade today all
in here and mixed it so basically I'm
wearing a lot of these colors and I just
went and actually I didn't go in
lipstick NIC went in and we have a lot
of tutorials coming up of looks she
created for this beauty campaign and the
entire palette we're gonna recreate them
of course for my channel so that will be
coming up shortly alright you guys so as
you can see here is the entire
blood-sugar palette of course before we
even dive into the other products I want
you to pause this video I want you to
sound off down below and let me know
your immediate thoughts now that you
have finally seen it I think that this
one is very I'm gonna say the word
wearable because there are so many looks
you can create with this and I really
can't wait to see what you guys all do
with it I am just like over the moon and
on cloud nine right now
also the packaging is faux leather I
wish there was another word for that
because it sounds weird it's fake
leather it's not real so of course you
guys know my brand is vegan and cruelty
free nothing has changed here also I do
want to talk about so this is a pressed
pigment palette if you have ever used
the Urban Decay electric palette or
other stuff like that Mac has pressed
pigments basically we're gonna give you
it guys a little science lesson right
now so when you use a vegan formula
Red's pinks purples and that nature are
really hard to perfect and make amazing
so if you want smooth creamy mattes you
want the pigment to be off the chain
you've got to use red dyes because if
you are a vegan brand you cannot use
carmine now what is carmine carmine is
what a lot of brands who test on animals
or who are not cruelty-free use in their
pigments to really get rich red shades
now what does carmine you can do a quick
Google search I'm gonna tell you right
now it is basically crushed beetles that
people use in makeup to get red pigment
I wish I could make it up it's been
happening for years so carmine is
actually very common in cosmetics it's
safe but if you are not into wearing
insects on your eyes you have to use
pigments so a lot of these red dyes can
stain the eye area so on the back of the
box you will see that it says some of
the shades are not really allowed near
the immediate eye area so you know me I
am always gonna keep it 100% with you
guys you see my eyes they are covered
every color is on my lid today so
basically it is kind of a warning for
people with sensitive eyes so if you
were someone that when you wipe off your
makeup you don't want like your lids
stained pink or any like residue in
there then you might not want to put it
around your media area nothing crazy is
gonna happen you're not gonna go blind
nothing wild
it's just legally I have to put that on
there because there is red dyes in here
just like urban decay and Mac I always
want the best for you guys so that's why
I made the decision to make pressed
pigments as well as eye shadow so you
will see the shade names half the
palette are pigments and half the
palette are regular eye shadows alright
let's dive into the rest of the lipstick
collection so we have a lot more to this
collection and I just want to insert
this of course everything will be down
below if you forget anything but this
entire collection does launch February
10th at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time
that is 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time
and if you don't know your timezone do a
quick search now on February 10th
everything is coming so I'm going to
show up everything we have we of course
also have some velour liquid lips now I
really wanted to do something fun with
the packaging so I know a lot of brands
do not do this type of tech
but I wanted to really just take it
there so with the boxes I did a really
cool it's not hologram it's not
holographic it is a different technology
that I found when I visited some trade
shows in Italy in Japan and I found this
company that does this it is on Rio you
can pick different patterns and shapes
into whatever you want I first debuted
this with the Mannie mu8 collection as
you can see see this how this moves it
is literally a heart so it literally has
like this side of a heart almost like
the you know when you go has one of the
sides on the box so as it moves you can
see it go crazy and it's a very like eye
catching and I love it in this
collection you get four of a lower
liquid lip and we are going to show them
off all right now I'm actually wearing
one now with some gloss it is called
self control and of course all the
packaging is in red chrome so this shade
is a beautiful lilac purple shade and I
threw some gloss over it what is the
gloss I don't know maybe you'll find out
later this year the next shade is called
Romeo it is a gorgeous kind of like neon
coral pink hybrid cult color we're going
to just give her a little swatch right
here now this one is very bright okay it
is not for the faint of heart it is very
like it but it almost could be summer
but bitch we're in winter so you can
wear this all year long and this shade
girl I am obsessed with it
alright the next shade we have is called
problematic it is a gorgeous berry shade
that is just straight-up like hi we're
here we're not playing games we're just
gonna swatch this right here BAM I'm
gonna put some more on there you know
hand swatches are never pretty you guys
but hey this is what we're doing today
so this shade is buildable it's not
streaky but it is like a color that you
definitely can layer twice if you want
but you don't need to I'm actually gonna
swatch it self control for you guys so
you can see it matte and dry and not
with the gloss over it that is that
is a very opaque such a pretty lilac
like girl work all right and the fourth
shade from this collection is called a
restraints it is this beautiful cool
toned gray metallic now this is a little
bit of a different metallic formula I'm
working on something new so let me know
how you guys think or feel about it when
you try it
it is of course still pigmented as hell
but just a little different type of
metallic so this one is definitely
buildable if you want or you can wear it
like with one swipe coverage as always
but I just love this shade it's
different from what I've put out before
and these four together like what do you
call it ombre with four from Bree quick
reminder in case you are new all of
these will retail for $18 just like the
pink capped ones so these of course are
staying the same price moving on now
let's talk about the Leppa munition
there are three shades now two of them
you may have heard of before we'll talk
about that in a second but of course
this comes in the same beautiful crazy
box and when you open it you get a red
chrome bullet of course with this silver
tip I love how this came out I'm just
like Oh
livid die first of all let's talk about
the two existing shades now these are
not lip ammo shades these are actually
liquid lip shades that I turned into lip
mo because they are so highly requested
on my girl we're gonna do with you so
first up we have androgyny of course I
had to make a lip M oh girl this is
literally my number one most sold liquid
lip of all time so we made a matching
lip MO same creamy formula same
creamsicle scent and this goes on one
swipe coverage stays on for hours a very
creamy satin finish the second shade is
Calabasas now this was my number one
sold lipstick from last summer oh my god
you guys came so hard for this and it's
a city I live in baby I had to make the
lip ammo so of course same exact shade
as the liquid lip but of course in the
satin finish so ignore of the lines in
my hands as you guys can see it is the
same shade just different formula and I
live for this the third shade is called
sinister it is a gorgeous berry shade a
little darker than problematic a lot
darker but I live for this shade you
guys ever seen someone swatch on their
hands like this this is what I'm doing
today let's just go up my whole pinky
like girl look at that yes bitch one
swipe coverage you better work
we have not one but two JSC handheld
mirrors now of course we have the hot
red to match all the packaging and in a
deep plum brown color which I live for
also a lot of you have been asking away
the pink ones are coming back in stock
girl very so maybe a week or two after
them they're on the way production is
like they know you guys sold out of this
 so quick so of course since the
makeup bags had such an amazing response
I want to start doing more of them so I
made a holographic red one this might be
my favorite one of all time I thought
the blue and the black we're killing me
like we know I love pink right now but
the red oh I love this now if you've
never seen these before we have little
star logo emblems on them and we have
the logo right there a pocket in the
front and then there's actually a lot of
room in here for all your stuff so I
know a lot of you were like can palette
fit in there are you sure and I'm like
girl you know I got you so the beauty
killer palette can go right in there of
course you can put in the androgyny
palette if you will you can put
lipsticks in the front you can put them
inside and where's the blood sugar
palette is she coming on my next trip
girl she's coming hold on I needed two
hands for that so you can literally put
all your palettes in there and you are
ready to roll you can fit in like with
lips lipsticks compacts anything you
want and you were all set so these will
of course retail the same price as
before this is $25 and the mirrors where
you at are 20 right almost last but not
least we have three of the lower lip
scrubs and of course they come in Chrome
a red packaging as well with the same
unit carton and we have three flavors
ever since summer this product I know I
don't post about them often but you guys
slay and kill this product they have
been like just selling crazy I'm like
high like after the blue raspberry
sucker and the watermelon gum it was a
wrap so I'm like okay orange soda
everything those are actually coming
back they've been so highly requested so
we brought them back once gone again
they're coming back but for now the new
flavors are and this might be my
favorite one we have cherry soda now
literally God if you're a cherry person
you are going to be obsessed with this
one I've been diving and
into this one a lot I'm sick I'm like
mmm it's like you can taste the fizz in
your mouth it's uh it's so yummy if you
right fruit person or loved cherry
suckers candy or gum this is gonna be
your new favorite all right the second
flavor is candy necklace who wore candy
necklaces as a kid you take them you
bite them off I wanted to capture that
essence and that fragrance and it
literally is like so nostalgic when you
smell this you are going to die now if
you do not know my lip scrubs are edible
of course they are vegan they are
infused with aloe vera and a vitamin E
so they leave your mouth and skin
feeling full lawless now I did of course
different sugar colors for everything I
can't
so before you put on any lipstick
doesn't have to be mine of course you
can't use this and it will leave you
like some mood and also you can use them
for dry skin I'm not kidding if your
forehead is feeling a little alligator
girl do a scoop rub relax all right now
the third flavor is chocolate covered
strawberry probably one of my favorite
things to eat at night like girl mmm
you know what she got the munchies it is
so yummy and I did the sugar a little
baby pink now I've been using this one
and scooping it out and of course if you
do not know these are also hand made so
everything is handled with care so those
are the three flavors let me know down
below which one is your favorite so
let's just watch you barking a girl all
right you guys know last but not least
this is gonna be a little mystery okay I
know you guys are maybe gonna roll your
eyes and want to slap me upside my head
