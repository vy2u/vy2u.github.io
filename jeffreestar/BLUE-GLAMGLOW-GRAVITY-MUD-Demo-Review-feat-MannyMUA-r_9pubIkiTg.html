channel I'm sure you're wondering what
the hell are these bitches up to now I
live here I mean many Facebook Mugen
everyone thinks that we're in a
three-way relationship like sister wives
again you know what we might be okay so
today we are gonna be reviewing and
we're gonna we're gonna kind of do a
little first impressions of the new glam
glow gravity mud limited edition Sonic
the Hedgehog blue face mask and my
tailor that's a mouthful now if you've
ever seen your many snapchat you have
seen us wear the purple and we love
these these are amazing this is the
original one so if you've ever seen a
blogger or makeup artist or anyone wear
the silver face mask and you're like
what is that mm-hmm it's these guys the
mask is really great for firmness and
tightening so it's literally like a
lifting mask that's what it's good for
and it's literally like you paint it on
and you peel it off so it's really easy
to use you like peel-off masks right yes
I do
Nega had never used a mask before until
he met me and now I kids like this no
definitely not no and how's your skin
since we've been together I mean it's
been a while now but it's pretty damn
good
I don't think your skin is so nice yeah
just get a black heads and I'm like okay
me and Manny are kind of breaking out a
little bit you can't really tell look at
me either like that right but that's but
I'm the one with a nice skin today
motherfucker
thanks for integrating us so the
packaging looks like this I mean first
of all I grew up with Sonic the Hedgehog
did you name oh yeah and I love the
video game the video game amazing so
when I saw this I was like hmm so we are
a huge fan of the original silver so
when we saw this one I was like blue
metallic facemask like is it first of
all look at the packaging hi sexy I was
like someone's really talking to me I'm
a girl I was 15 so we open it and it
comes with of course the this one's blue
not purple so it comes in this little
guy this packaging is amazing I love a
brand that spends time on the unicorns
and it makes it look great so you just
take out this little
plaque the guy and there is a brush in
there ooh so cool that Iguala it does
which is amazing but we're gonna be
bougie ass hoes today and when use your
own brushes because I have 50 House
pension okay BAM so the good thing about
this one is that it is good for all skin
types so if you are normal oily
combination dry we heard that these are
identical to this formula but we're just
not sure so we're gonna do this is kind
of little first impressions more of a
like a review because we love these
masks so is it different is it the same
we're gonna find out but the thing that
everything ever might be upset about is
these aren't for sale
yeah yeah they're only doing contests on
their Instagram to win them so yeah we
should all let them know that they need
to bring this permanently yes because
once it's runs out I'm gonna cry and you
want me to do a cloud with glam glow and
have it be peeing metallic just send
them an email okay way wink wink
shall we open this up Oh below so this
is so scary joke - oh you just thought
that we had over a moment I was like not
for this price point honey for these
retail for 69 bucks these are amazing
so for 69 dollars you do get a lot of
utilized you little pricey but you get a
lot for your money yes well so um I know
you can't get samples of these so just
go for it just buy it and just feel
tight bitch okay so we're gonna dive in
and we're gonna use this mask now we
only have Nate you want me to do yours
right I always paint mine on perky I'm
he does you pinger mess on so he's a
little other I'm a rocky so we're gonna
dip in and I think I'm gonna do have
silver and hot blue yes do you like it's
a difference a difference or not yeah
that's what I'm gonna do okay I'm just
gonna do straight-up blue I'm blue da da
dee da da da so this is then the silver
one come on
so it looks so white like you can't even
tell it's like the lights are reflecting
yeah literally you're gonna be like
blinded by Allah yeah I am going to use
the
right in I'm gonna dip right in Mama's
not kill okay all right good your right
side with this one
now these do take a second to put on so
Nate don't kill us
Nate nope maybe this will get rid of
that little pimple I have right there
what is that why is that here what
happened wait became a photo shoot yeah
I'm like we have a cute going on that
looks so cool I feel like like a little
skeleton I love it rank one Skeletor it
says watch or avoid any hair so if we're
wondering why the boys will not have it
on their facial hair it's cuz it could
rip that off yeah I shall I still have
some on my beard not like I don't care
mmm
so can we all talk about last night why
I saw Finding Nemo with Manny and Nate
for the first time ever first time Bart
it ever that came out when I was like
graduating high school you guys said Oh
lately now I've been dying to see dory

Nemo tell me why the first 15 minutes I
was like ready to cry I'm like oh this
is not a little happy Disney movie this
is like some real shit it's real shit
yeah I was like damn this is really like
depressing but in a good way like I
liked stolen stolen literally don't win
I'm so dark I like movies that make you
feel something so I'm all about that to
be honest so what's good come on
psychology Disney why are you playing
with my emotion it's so good I can't
make you dizzy Dori - I cannot wait so
who ever seen Dori leave us some
comments because give us some little
fishies on the bottom yeah but don't
tell my bending off I can kill you
all right me and Manny are done that was
the one you me Manny or Ben don't worry

come on profile doesn't a team have
silver and blue I thought you guys make
that up Dallas's oh my god does that was
Cowboys sorry just don't ask us right

Cowboys fan and we're just over here
waiting it with a little anger I'm
waiting for a third okay we can't crack
these man okay okay so these are
supposed to go on for let's go to peak
y'all please say to leave on for 20 to
30 minutes once completely dry peel off
from the edges rinse off excess with
warm water have
some do that twice a week claim brush
after you score Taco Bell and have
Cinnabon delights and let your face air
dry okay great so we will be back in 30
easy to follow okay are we ready
look we're like cracking where were you
look at when we smile yeah they're not
my real wrinkles I'm like we need to do
masks DMS you ready oh look at Manny
others oh my god scared to do that I'm
gonna start from this side yes yes me
huh oh yeah yes girl I feel like
mystique and x-men like fucking shooting
right now I'm looking for the joke
chrome the to come by I look so sick Wow
I think I went to all one piece don't
you dare try mines all in one piece I
gave up that dream I feel like oh yeah
oh my nose feel snatched
yes nose ah this is ha ha ha this feels
like a little foreskin I know what you
don't know that
yeah I was like they was like wait wait
wait wait to me names like this goes
like you ain't on skin hmm
ok so you're supposed to wash off any
excess right so we're gonna do that the
honor to like you have to use a lot of
this product after we forgot to mention
that like yeah you use like a hardy
mallet you can't be cheap with it
because it won't peel out correctly
exactly it need to be like hardly words
I don't know a thin around the eye area
right delicate you can see I just need
to wash it off yep saying mmhmm okay I
got a warm washcloth with water that
excess comes off great yo honestly like
same since I did half of half the silver
half the blue yeah what's your thoughts
it's literally like identical honestly
like the same effect on both sides okay
amazing I don't mean the same still
going to you the same effect are you
lifting the wrinkles are less when you
do it so my thoughts about this mask if
you've never used it and you're like
bitch give me the real T it is very
firming it makes my pores now I know
really you don't have pores I do we all
do we all do and I have problem areas in
this area so my poor when I wear a lot
of highlighters like you can see the
bitch so this looks smaller and tighter
and it just feels nice yeah are you like
oh your skin feels so nice afterwards
yes so I am I'm in love the blues cool I
love episode so sick the formula is
identical and the color is the only
thing different which we kind of guessed
that but we weren't sure you don't ever
know you never know yeah me know some
glad that we confirmed it how do you
feel I feel great my skin is uh still
smooth
come on scan oh it does feel really nice
up yeah okay you got a blue in your hair
do you want it there yeah yeah damn so
our thoughts on it honestly like I
personally love the mass I think it's
freaking fantastic
I would definitely spend chasing those
dollars on it 100% Alison a lot of the
times the masks I'll use like once or
twice and I'm like okay it was a cute
idea huh those goes in the drawer I love
these
I've gone through them but I have to
I've got the one yes I mean they have
gone through a few of these and we are
really big fans so glam glow we love you
your products are amazing they're very
innovative I love your packaging yes I'm
a fucking fan okay yeah welcome back sir
Bob to look at all of them that's a
black one the white one mm-hmm you're
both bomb yes the blue one that's like a
hydrating mask it's so nice too they
have a lot of other types of masks so if
you are not into this the see I like the
peel ones are fun yeah I do I look I
love it but once we have to go back
upstairs and wash them off all the way
it's like uh come on it's a lot there
Jeffrey Manny and Nate certified exactly

skincare video you have tits coming I

video once this one's over go watch the
full face liquid lipstick one again

quick disclaimer yeah we just have to
say we have to our video was for Hawaii
