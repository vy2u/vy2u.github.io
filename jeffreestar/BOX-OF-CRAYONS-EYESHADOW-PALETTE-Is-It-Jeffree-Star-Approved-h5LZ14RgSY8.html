what's up everybody welcome back to my
channel today we are gonna dive into the
crazy box of crayons eyes shadow palette
now I know last week it was a little
rough that Nickelodeon palette mm-hmm I
had nightmares for two days after every
morning I'd wake up screaming because
there was no pigment so today we're
gonna pray hope and cross our fingers
has some pigment now this is another
item that I found via the internet BAM
it looks like this now I'm sure a lot of
you have seen this because a lot of you
guys have tagged me tweeted me sent me
this photo it's been going viral on
Facebook so I'm like okay let me pull up
on this little palette and see what the
T is so before we dive into this review
I quickly want to let everyone know that
literally we are one day away tomorrow
the blood sugar palette and the love
sick collection is finally out into the
world and available I also have some
really exciting news besides the blood
sugar palette I also have of course new
jeffree star cosmetics accessories we
have the mirrors bags shirts but I do
want to let you guys know for everyone
wondering about the pink and the hot
pink mirrors they will also be restocked
the same time as the launch so get your
engines ready bitch alright so first of
all we haven't just the makeup so if
you're done hearing me run my mouth and
you want to see some eyeshadows and keep
on watching so I got this from their
website you can get this only on the
cran case dot-com another brand you can
see there's a big old logo right here so
at first I was like is this a Crayola
collab but it doesn't say anything like
that on there I think it is that's the
brand name it looks big like look at
this I was like oh wow when I saw the
pans on the internet I did not think
that they were gonna be this big which
is always nice when you see something
and a picture and it's always bigger in
person who doesn't love that when you
open it it comes like this it is wrapped
up very secure which I love so we're
just gonna take off the bubble wrap BAM
now this does say that they are cruelty
free on the box and this box is
recyclable recyclable is that a word
recycle Reese
okay now just for size comparison no I'm
not going down on anyone I am going to
show you a comparison of vinegar Lodi
and pallet versus this pallet so you can
see there will edge it up here this is
how big the difference is so she's
massive when you open her up bitch you
see BAM all the colors and they are big
like those pans honey I'm like oh so as
you can see I'm actually swatch two
colors on snapchat the other day I'm
sure most of you already saw that but
everything else is brand new and fresh I
have never put anything on my lids of
course I did buy this palette myself
just for the record want to put that out
there so I know that this palette is
constantly in and out of stock it's gone
viral all over the internet now as you
can see the shape names are simple they
are named after it actually says it
right here they are named after
obviously crayons in a box so you get a
large variety there's a lot of metallic
shades there is a lot of maths so I just
can't wait to play with this baby so the
quick T on this palette is that it
retails for $30 now the box of crayons
palette is a all new 18 color eyeshadow
palette and they use I with the letter I
now it says with bold and vibrant colors
that are extremely pigmented okay and
long-lasting the box of crayons palette
were hand-picked by the CEO this palette
is perfect for playing in multi colors
alright it also says that they were
named after school crayons which I'm
sure is a given by now as you can see
whoo all right so I think the only thing
there is to do here is shut my mouth and
start blending and let's see what we
could do here people so we are going to
prime my lids with the Mac painterly
paint-pot of course I've been using this
on my channel for a long time now
remember the old days when there wasn't
an eye primer girl I would just slap on
some foundation and call it a day so I
tweeted that I was going to review this
and I snapchat and a lot of you told me
to compare it to the jus vyas place
palettes and I was like are they similar
so here is a Julia's place palette I
only have two arms
open this one first these are very
iconic now all over the internet because
they have amazing pigment so this is
what this one looks like here is what
this one looks like okay bitch I mean
literally they are the same pan size but
a million brands use similar pattern
sizing there's only so much you can do
it circles and squares people ovals
rectangles so yes is there a similarity
definitely with formula who knows they
are very different brands so I'm sure
the formula has to be different which we
are about to find out right now so
besides that I don't think this palette
looks like anything else of course they
are very vibrant it looks crazy I'm
gonna pray that these have pigment or
mama is gonna come let's just dive into
this review we are primed the lids are
smashed what the hell are we gonna do I
think I'm just gonna go bold here and go
right in to yellow like high let's do
some yellow all right we have barely any
fallout I'm talking like none the brush
is a very coated look at that yellow
whew okay now of course this palette has
a massive mirror so I don't even need to
use a mirror today from anywhere else
let's just see what happens
I'm smiling cuz I'm like oh my god for
this pigment it's blending I'm going to
just create just a little moment in my
crease you guys know I love to go into
the brow bone right by my nose and just
kind of blend up and we're just going to
make this look very alien and very
airbrushed so yellow is actually looking
really pretty I'm like wow since there
are so many colors in this palette I was
thinking of doing different shades on
different eyes just for fun haven't done
that in years that was very my space
like one I read one eye blue what are we
gonna do you guys I really just want to
kind of go bold over here obviously this
palette bold but I'm talking like yellow
red orange magenta over here and then
over here maybe we do like purples and
the darks and just see well we got deep
plum with brown I'm inspired okay for an
easy transition shade though for over
here let's just go into the shade tan
right here and I do have two of the same
of a lot of brushes so you will see me
dip back and forth don't think that I'm
spraying or doing anything weird so
we're gonna go in with the same brush
and we're gonna dive in to shade tan
she's on there I think let's see how she
performs okay it's blending nice I
literally just dipped in a few times and
the shadow instead of dragging or
looking weird as I blend up it's
actually looking very airbrushed and
pretty which I love bitch this is
looking cute already okay cool so we
have two colors on they blended nice
alright so let's dive in this is the
more vr38dett just Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam
Bam Oh pink
this one is really great for just
placing in the crease and blending it's
very soft and build the ball which I
like for these rainbow looks oh girl yes
this is giving me like starburst vibes
when Nate eats all the Reds woo alright
this blended out really pretty I'm like
girl okay so I want to add some red in
I'm living breathing and dying for some
red shadow let's go in what is this this
is the morphe blending brush and now
we're just gonna go in with shade red
and let's see if shade red wants to work
alright so let's take this one we're
just gonna place this actually right in
here and I'm just doing some patting
motions and some swiping in here so I
took more on my brush and now I'm just
patting it on my lid and then I'm gonna
take it and just kind of blend up
alright so the only thing I'm noticing
with this one it's a little streaky as
you can see as I'm zooming in here so so
far this does look cute I'm not hating
it at all it's just looking a little
streaky alright so we're gonna go in
with shade red a little bit more and
this one does have a little bit more
fallout than the other ones brush is
looking a little crazy it's not fully
opaque like I'm packing it on and it
looks pretty it's just not living for
when I try to blend it up it's a little
patchy so now for over here I'm gonna
take shade Brown which is right above
tan and we're just gonna take this and
place it kind of like where this one was
where the pink kind of merges together
and let's start smoking this eye out and
then I'm gonna take that blending brush
from earlier dip into shade tan and
we're just gonna kind of buff and blend
them together and make them look
cohesive so now I'm gonna dip it to
shade black whenever I see a black
shadow in a palette I want to know girl
is it rich and beautiful or is it
patchy because black shadows can be
tricky so I'm gonna go in with a little
more fee for one one blending brush
let's dip in to black right here ooh she
has the more fallout than the other is
she kicking back alright so let me just
dive into there okay now let's see what
happens
so this black is very pigmented which I
love I'm just blending it and buffing it
in with the brown and the tan and it's
looking seamless like the shadows are
blending together it's not the best
black I've ever used but it's definitely
something that works now let's dive into
the metallic formula we see the mattes
we know that they're blending they're
cute but what about the metallics this
orange is calling my name
this gold calling my name so let's use
this little Tom Ford fresh and I will
try it dry of course and then we will
see what happens okay it's alright it's
a little sheer going one more time so as
you can see there definitely is some
payoff I thought it was gonna be a
little more blinding let me try to do
some fix+ or setting spray whatever you
will on the brush the brush is coated oh
oh okay that picked up a lot more so
let's see how this looks on the lid
definitely adding some setting spray
made that pop really cool so this is
looking like a little fire now the red
for some reason as we've blended and
time has went on it's gotten a little
muddy so I am just going to you know
it's really funny I've actually never
done this on myself I'm gonna take this
so excuse me I'm doing a little bit of
cheating I would never put this on with
my finger but it's just not holding like
the greatest coverage someone's gonna
Pat this on my lid and see what happens
oh wow okay hi but the fear is if you go
to blend it in with the brush it's a
little weird so let me take this one
more time
I'm just try to finesse it in there
it's like a bobble head on my back
alright so now we're back over here oh
she needs some work so we are going to
dip into gold bitch I have I'm also
going to try my finger let's do a pinky
and see if that goes on the lid nice
pinch my finger it looks like I just
fingered The Wizard of Oz honey she's
fucking rolling looks like a leprechaun
sucked on my toes anyone else did two
foot fetishes I'm not I swear here we go
BAM right on the lid Oh hold on I know
I'm blocking the camera hold on y'all oh
not the prettiest application because my
finger is not that cute but I'm about to
fix it we're gonna go on with this
little Tom for a blending brush a little
pencil brush if you will she actually
does blend though so we're just gonna
take this gold and just drag it a little
bit over here y'all want to see what I
used to in high school I just took it
there fuck a setting spray bitch you
know what we did in the early 2000s when
there was no setting spray where you
spit baby and look at that pig man
because she went right in there and that
looks so stunning oh my god alright I'm
actually gonna take some of this gold
cuz it looks so pretty and I'm just
gonna tuck it right in here like on
camera this is gonna photograph so
pretty
now the metallics do have a tiny bit of
Fallout I'm not mad at it cuz look at
the pig man I'm like oh and then take
your brush that you used for the black
of course with no extra product and just
kind of go over that line I know what I
do want to do is I do want to quickly
take the yellow because we are gonna
blend it in a second with another shade
and just kind of buff it under alright
now with the same brush I'm gonna take a
little bit of pink right here I was
gonna do magenta first of all I'm gonna
swatch it for you guys cuz it looks
crazy
look at that oh baby you guys know I
don't like finger swatches it's all
about how it blends with a brush or on
your lid but that um whoa whoa and then
the blue I got to do the baby blue like
I want to do a whole look of just blue
Lord okay we're gonna do one more let's
do the dark blue one
okay and needs a little more finessing
but the blue is like it's like actual
glitter in there okay baby I'm done I'm
gonna dip into shade pink with the same
brush we're gonna go a little bamm-bamm
and then I'm just gonna literally put it
right over the yellow it's really simple
just drag that right below the lash line
not fully fully where the yellow is just
a little bit now we are going to wet
this brush a little bit we all know the
metallics love a good little wedding
over here we are going to dive in to
shade white right here it is a metallic
and we're just gonna go right in there
okay now we are going to place that
right in the inner corner let's see what
happens I'm also gonna drag it down
slightly just right here so it looks
like we are oh wow oh oh okay I think
she has some payoff right now wedding
though this one it's like whoa was like
a beam of light so I'm just finessing
the yellow in there so it just softens
it a little bit more I'm actually living
for it though it's a very intense okay
you guys so now that we were having this
full sunset moment let's hop back over
on this I over here girl okay we're just
gonna be really extra I almost want to
do purple down here like I know it might
not even match but God I just would dip
into that will you guys be mad at me
let's find out all right so this may not
match now this was a little bit of like
on the shimmer to it but it appears to
maybe be mad let's dive in and see now
purple girl I know it may not be the
color of the season oh it actually is
the Pantone color of the year hmm
she's buildable okay I will get at that
yes you put a little bit more on and
it's there that purple definitely was
buildable and I'm just gonna take a
little bit of the violet shade right
here and I know it's a metallic and you
probably shouldn't use this brush but I
just like to add a little bit of like a
little bit of depth very evenly you
might barely see it I know it's there
and my eye knows it's there whoa okay
this is a very weird look none of this
is cohesive I would never wear these two
together but you know what I don't give
a fuck I just want to try out as many
colors as possible for you guys let me
scootch my booty back into frame alright
this is the weirdest I've ever looked
well know eighth grade was pretty rough
alright but I have a lot of thoughts
okay so I'm quickly gonna go do some
mascara and pop some lashes on and I
will be right back
let's give our final thoughts on the box
of crayons eyes shadow palette okay I
have something to say this palette was
cute okay bitch it was enough to rip off
my motherfucking hair because girl had
pigment a minute the ambulance is
outside okay the straitjackets
downstairs okay so wallah so we are
going to give our final thoughts on the
matte formula first most of them were
bomb the black the brown the tan the
pink the yellow lived for it of course
you guys saw the only one I had a little
problems with was the red but it's
lasting it's a little patchy but I'm not
mad at it like it didn't underperform
where I was like scared it looks great
so I think overall yes it needed a
little finessing and they could improve
the formula on this one but bitch Reds
are hard alright so moving on to
metallics now girl you guys saw this
whoa this orange and this gold BAM like
they are stunning they're blinding the
white one maybe I did a little too much
to fix plus which that's on me I'm gonna
clock myself but overall obviously this
is very blinding I just felt like it was
a little like a little harder to blend
but my brush was very wet so I think
that was my bad I definitely want to
dive into some more colors in the future
but the goal
was the star of the show for me as well
as the yellow y'all those are kind of
hard to kill for other brands so what I
have to say is for $30 you get a massive
size palette the pans are big I think
you get a lot for your money
this is also an indie brand so of course
I love supporting indie companies just
like me voila all right so is the box of
crayons palette jeffree star approved
yes god this palette is great I think it
blended out beautifully but yeah
everything down from the mirror to the
packaging I think it is very cool I love
this idea and I love that this palette
is getting so much attention online I
love a good idea all right you guys
thank you so much for watching me try
out another eyeshadow palette I will be
back shortly
aka in a few days Olivia miss you mean
it Wow bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
