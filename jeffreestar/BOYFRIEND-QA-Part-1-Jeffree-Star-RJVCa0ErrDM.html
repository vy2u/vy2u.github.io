channel ah wait a minute what's up
everyone welcome back to my channel and
today today we're gonna do a Q&amp;amp;A when we
did the boyfriend makeup tag there was a
lot of questions from a few particular
things that we talked about so we
figured let's talk about it let's do a
Q&amp;amp;A so we asked everyone on snapchat and
Twitter what questions they had for us
and we picked our favorites so let's get
started well it started with me hitting
them in the DM for one it goes down in
the DM we met on Instagram is that crazy
I mean I don't even think it's crazy
because where do people meet bars clubs
things that we don't do I'm gonna shock
everybody with a fun fact I don't drink
alcohol and I've never drank before so I
know a lot of you at home are probably
like bitch yeah right I've never drank
before I've never sipped a beer or tried
alcohol now I know that's really hard to
fathom but um not my thing
I think meeting people online has been
going on since the myspace days now I
think if people date online and never
meet that's a little weird for me yeah
definitely so him yeah yeah and I
responded because I was like zoom we
started talking online we started
texting you know on line to texting and
then texting led to phone calls and face
times and then we decided a few months
later to meet in person
basically what happened was I showed up
at the airport and he was busy with
something so I he didn't come pick me up
face to face so I didn't know about
being catfished or what was going on so
now let me explain it because I don't
want to sow in shady I had a shoe that
ran late
so understandable and he land at a time
where if you don't live in LA and you've
never been here the traffic is the worst
number one worst place in all of America
so he landed at like rush hour so I was
like fuck oh my god can you just take a
taxi to my house and I'll meet you there
so he pulled up and it felt like we had
met for years that we've known each
other for years yes it was really it was
awesome yeah it was crazy I usually my
heart would be racing I mean especially
in this situation since I've never flown
to meet anybody for one and never even
been in California so it since that's an
intimidating scenario oh yeah for sure
um and you know I don't really meet guys
online um so when he landed and came
over I opened the door and it was like
an old friend almost it was like
somebody that I've known for a really
long time and I just felt really
comfortable which is not like me like
most people are looking to Shady most
people are just crazy first of all um
and I just felt really comfortable and I
just felt like myself well the thing is
with that I mean it's not about gender
it's more so about having connection
with somebody and that's just something
that clicked with me in him so and it
was unexpected yes and I think a lot of
people are really stuck in labels and I
feel like if our society would just open
up a little bit more be a little bit
more open minded it wouldn't be such a
big deal but you know everyone's born to
think girls like pink boys like blue
take a second and think about that like
your parents are basically mapping out
your opinions for you so it's crazy
imagine if a baby was born without
knowing
anything about sexuality or gender how
would that person end up it's just
something cool to think about and I
think what's really cool about Nathan is
he doesn't need a label I know everyone
wants to label him and I think you know
we say well he's straight so while you
guys are labeling him well he's only
been with women his entire life until
meeting me and I think that that doesn't
make someone bisexual that doesn't make
someone anything I think it just makes
Nathan Nathan I just think that gender
is just irrelevant and if you love
somebody you love somebody and I really
think it's black and white
so Nathan came to California first and I
hadn't been to Michigan to visit his
family yet so when things kind of
started getting serious um you know I'm
not really into long-distance so I was
like damn I really like this fool so
every two weeks I started to fly to
Wyoming Michigan because I must have a
person that's like if I like somebody I
cannot wait minds to see that person I'm
like I now type person so when I pulled
it for the first time I was like oh my
god parents gonna hate me and they're
gonna think I'm crazy I think I love me
like I didn't know what to expect so
neither did I had no idea what was ahead
of us you know and these are you know
Midwest people like they're from
Michigan so you know me I'm like either
it's gonna go like good really good or
really bad so when I got to his house
for the first time mom and dad were
there and it was amazing like everything
was dope they made me feel so at home
and comfortable in my own skin like
there was never any weird moment they're
just normal people like they're dope and
we had a lot of fun
yeah first night we had mom and dad hit
in the blunt and they never smoked weed
yeah um and what you had yeah
I've never even smoked on my mom before
and maybe once with my dad so that was
uh he was like what they came out of the
show yeah a little bit they did it was
cool and his mom loves makeup so we got
to you know bro down and talk about
makeup um it was really cool
I never really had a thing for skincare
or had routines or anything like that so
my face is just kind of like doing its
own thing until I met this cutie okay
when I meet someone I'm like such a
fixer I'm like okay so let's start
toning moisturizing so Nathan did
nothing he like how'd you wash your face
before we met um in the shower yeah my
mom bought me some shit to use in the
shower so so now that he lives in
California he tones every morning to get
off all that dirt oil he moisturizes the
basics for most a lot of moisturizing I
am very dry skin so yes our first date
was with our first date was really cute
we went to the Santa Monica Pier and we
had dinner on the theme yes it was very
lovely I love the ocean likewise and it
was really cute we just walked on the
beach and talked like I'm all about good
conversation I don't need to be wined
and dined like I just want to hang out
with someone that's a real last person
so a men of them it was cool we spent
hours on the beach talking and walking
around I'm speak
separators call work-from-home shit we
don't it's work is home like everything
revolves around work here which is a
good thing and a bad thing because
without work we'd be homeless but you
know we're learning it's cool that now
that Nathan and I have been together for
a year it's our one-year anniversary
this month yes we're learning you know
it's all about relationships are all
about give and take and you know I
haven't had someone live with me in a
long time so it's a learning process for
me which is fun and scary at the same
time and I've always lived at home with
my parents so I've never lived with
anybody besides that yep and if you
don't know this Nathan works at my
warehouse so a ship yo lipsticks so a
lot of the times me and my assistant are
at home working or traveling and doing
meetings going to makeup labs
Nathan make sure that the warehouse is
running smoothly and that everyone's
packages are getting out so it is hard
because after a long day I'm like so how
was warehouse what happened and he's
just like oh my god I just want to chill
and relax so smoke a joint so it's it's
a lot of give-and-take with you where
we're learning each other still yeah
I'm obsessed with cops
and did you ever watch it before means
rarely we watch about five episodes a
night or I can't go to sleep yeah it's
uh that's funny we're not really like
obsessed with TV we're really more into
movies Nathan is like obsessed with
movies it's like my xscape
it's his drug yeah really is I got quite
the collection we got a huge movie
library I love movies you know I'm also
really into reading books so sometimes
I'll read a book boys watching a movie
on the couch
as long as were near each other yeah I'm
fine well obviously Nathan wears the
pants and i wear the pennies next
question ah
alright I'm let me answer this one so I
have my whole body tattooed and let me
tell you something either you think it's
a cursor it's not in my world it's a
curse so every friend best friend or
even like a bit ex-business partner that
I got their names on me two months later
so we're gonna not do that ever well I
think for me I've been doing this for a
long time I've lived my life on the
internet since I first got out of high
school so I've heard it all
listen no one can hurt my feelings I've
been called everything in the Sun so to
me it's just an annoyance that my finger
has to use an extra muscle to block
somebody that's pretty much it but I
think for him like he never experienced
thousands of people like riding him
whether it's good or bad yeah no not
really it never really crossed my mind I
focused on like uploading things and you
know just doing things that are pleasing
to my eye and that look pleasing to me
he just loved he left pictures yeah I
really do like he doesn't sit on the
couch for hours and focus on comments
and all that like the cool thing about
him is he doesn't care about this like
this doesn't define him he doesn't
become obsessed with his phone he's not
always on it it's nice like when we're
around each other we actually spend time
with each other yes yeah
the cool thing about Nate is like he's
an open book like we have the passwords
to each other's phones I think when
people hide that you're obviously hiding
something obviously if you're if your
spouse boyfriend or girlfriend can't
look on your phone and you're acting
shady you're doing something shady nice
simple pretty much amazing at this point
you know like we have we get along very
well we have the same interests and they
don't have a period next amen
checking out some snapchat questions
right now are you top bottom or verse
hahaha
when are you going to marry Nathan y'all
scandalous okay next
oh that's a deep one I think that when
someone's supposed to be in your life
they're going to be now I will get real
deep for a second and you know a lot of
the times when you are someone that is
endogenous and you know gender-fluid and
you're like you know you're in the
middle it's hard for people to want to
be like public about you like there's a
lot of dudes that are down you know
behind closed doors and they want to
keep things secret because we live in
such a closed-minded society where it's
you know dating sub dating you know a
guy I made up or a girl that looks like
a dude like it's just not fully accepted
yet which is so sad so I think a lot of
people have a hard time finding somebody
who's just like Nathan where they just
don't give a fuck they're just some of
it yeah it's not a big deal it's not
it's not an issue dad don't go alright
guys and that is the end of our Q&amp;amp;A for
now we'll do part two soon I hope you
guys enjoyed and we'll see you on the
next one till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
