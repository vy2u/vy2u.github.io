I brought Nathan back what's up
everybody it's been a minute it's been a
little little while um okay so we just
looked through all the videos that I've
done this year and we're like we haven't
done a Q&amp;amp;A in like seven months yeah it
was like 4/20 I think was the last one
so now nate is it father - of - yes I am
we talked about in our Q&amp;amp;A part - which
will be linked down below if we're gonna
have any kids and we had just gotten
delicious like white someone he's a year

are we've been dating for like over a
year and a half now yeah
it's been a long time very cool yeah we
hit our two-year anniversary in March
coming up so high besides that for the
holidays we were thinking about going to
Michigan but it's already snowing there
yeah no thanks his little brother Zach

we are all gonna pack our bags and
escape the winter and we're off to
Hawaii again yep Jake's a little brother
though Maui for his birthday yeah I can
have as a first legal drink there um and
besides that guys I think it's time to
dive to these questions I'm Chuck
damn that's a that's evil I mean I would
obviously take a highlighter put on
Nathan's cheeks so that I could stare
both
yeah who's your favorite drag queen
anything was living for all stars to
just want to put that out there yeah no
I really was it's kind of hot they were
all really good you lived for detoxes
outfit yeah they were really good
I loved uh Katya was really good yes I
want to see Katya on this channel baby
what do we had to like get ready who
else
um Alaska was genius on some of yes but
gaming genius um yeah but we actually
all get together and mani comes over and
we all watch it together yeah it's
awesome get really lit what Sears babe I
don't know that would wreck on I think
just traveling the world with someone
that any love spending time with is
honestly like a dream and lately we have
been to we went to London together yeah
we didn't it was cool I love the
architecture there yeah Rick and all had
never been before we went with one of my
UK retailers called Beauty Bay and they
carry my brand on their website shout
out to all my European customers whoa
whoa um London was so fun it was awesome
I can't wait to be back and then we just
went to New York together yeah that was
his first time there I'm like yeah I can
believe it not a big-city person
right now personally I'm good on having
a child yeah no I
I'm not have no or shy have a child
right now so which I feel like so many
people think that's weird like you have
to be born to then have a kid but um I'm
happy with traveling the world and
having dogs oh god I mean Nathan doesn't
wear makeup so I think I mean you took I
mean we can extend it to maybe like skin
care yeah yeah like what couldn't live
without face masks
he loves glam glow I do love my black
and don't get me wrong I do love the
masks but I mean what moisturizing yeah
no I couldn't live without moisturizing
my face gets so dry yeah Nathan has
really dry skin so I'm like I'm trying
to keep that shit like prepped
besides highlighting I don't think I
could live without lipstick I mean
that's it like a liquid lip let's roll
put me in the grave
hahaha this is a q1 I'm getting all like
butterflies we actually kind of said at
the same time yeah we kind of like both
like felted already like he was leaving
on like to go do something for like a
week or if you guys were trained yeah
and I was watching the dogs at home and
I like just naturally wanted to say it
but I was like kind of holding when we
hadn't said it yet
we hadn't said the three words and I was
like ready to say and I got my guy but
no one said it first and we like made it
that awkward like yeah I think we both
knew what we wanted to say yeah and then
I was like look this is how I'm really
fucking feeling how are you feeling and
it was actually just a mutual and we
were just like oh okay so I love you and
then then it happened that is a horrible
question because I can't imagine living
without you like I'm so used to you now
like I just love waking up next to
somebody I think when you been single
for a really long time you don't really
know what you're missing and then once
someone's there every morning it's like
you just wake up and you're already in a
better mood and then once there's four
dogs surrounding you as well as his
smiling face every day starts off
amazing
I'm just gonna start this one off go for
I feel like now that we've been together
for so long like word we trust each
other so much
nothing really affects us like it's
crazy how many people will try to DM us
say some crazy shit um without the other
one knowing or trying to like I don't
know people are crazy yeah they really
are like people will send us both naked
pictures on DMS all the time and try to
like be disrespectful like I think we've
seen it all by now yeah pretty much
um I think the only thing that was
getting a little tiring with so many
people making videos about our
relationship and just like making up
literally like false fabricated complete
lies stories and it's just like damn are
you really that I don't know I guess I
could never be so bored or so upset with
myself where I would have to lash out at
a stranger right and try to like hurt
them or make up a story so I think I
mean but we can't do anything about it
then going anywhere we ain't give it a
fuck about it and that's that so I'm
confident um with my man
I guess I never imagined finding someone
that just loves me for entirely me I
might have liked cheesy that sounds like
when you wake up in the morning with no
makeup to looking like this to anything
like just being fully comfortable with
somebody I only know that was out there
if I met you that's cool it makes me
feel good oh yeah um I don't know I
think and my past especially I mean we
can always dive into sexuality we all
motherfuckers love that question but
like um for there's so many new people
watching Nate has always dated girls his
entire life so you guys should
definitely watch Q&amp;amp;A part one and two
for all those questions answered but um
you know what I had never really been
into gay dudes like that's not my thing
I've always been attracted to someone
that is either straight bisexual more
like a dude I guess like I'm manly man
or like a normal as dude like I don't
not to say without someone's gonna be
offended by everything we fuckin say but
like just like a normal ass dude so when
I found Nate it like changed everything
and he broke my seven year spell of
being single
I think that's an easy question yeah
words us yeah pretty much like people
like try and make it out to be something
that's really like it's not that
complicated and everyone wants to like
you have to label somebody so prior to
me Nathan had only dated females yeah
and I think people snot everybody cuz
there's a lot of you guys out there that
totally understand it you get it if you
like someone any have a connection with
somebody that's that but there's a lot
of people that can't understand it I
don't get it no they want they want to
label you though Bay yeah go for it
do as you please at the end of the day
we love each other we found each other
and we're just us yeah we're just doing
our thing we're gonna talk about canvas
for a second because I have seen so many
comments about like just judging and be
like Nathan's always what's up and hi
it's so funny because none of you
actually knew me before I met Jeffrey
and that was two years ago yes before I
met Nathan was has been smoking weed
since 14 ayats and I just don't think
that people get like we smoke weed like
every day we right sometimes we do to
just get high get fucked up I don't get
fucked up and it's okay if you don't
understand it but don't judge a stranger
cuz that's getting really old y'all know
I don't drink
Nathan is not really into drinking I
don't know what it's like to be wasted
or blackout drunk right it's not that
fun that's yeah I don't I would never
want to I don't get what's fun about
blacking out and not remembering your
night I know a lot of people are into
that no shade all my partiers out there
that's just same for me right but um our
eyes may be red but I'm fully aware
so basically y'all asking me how do I
have time to fuck and run a successful
business how does she do it it's
definitely a balancing act like I'm
serious no oh yeah it takes a lot of you
know yes with this is I take a lot of no
that's a given
fucking bitch um it's it's it could be
difficult I mean I have a whole youtube
channel now I also have a cosmetic
business I have my own brand of course
which everyone knows that but yeah
people forget I think that I am a CEO of
a company I have you do pretty much
everything a lot a lot of people have
like social media managers it's like me
and my assistant running everything and
then of course I have a warehouse full
of over a hundred employees now who are
helping me ship my makeup all day every
day
um it's a lot of summer service cause
yeah yeah there's a lot of employees and
now I'm also of course doing youtube two
to three times a week and of course
having four dogs a man and you know I
bought a house in Calabasas we're
currently transforming it there's a lot
going on here and we're traveling
non-stop for work and pleasure both
always so it's a lot you guys it's
definitely not easy it's so tiring it's
very tiring um yeah there's a lot of
days where I'm like Nate like we all
have days where we want to give up don't
think just because you guys see a lot of
great moments on snapchat or on YouTube
that there's not a lot of hard times um
it can be very difficult
definitely shed a few tears this year
and life is a roller coaster and I've
learned a lot this year we've been
through a lot and I'm just happy that
we're both still here yeah we're both
still sane
when you're not giving up that dick I
August Lee wouldn't be with someone if I
argued a lot I don't understand couples
that argue a lot yeah there's really
like they're just not happy I can't
relate
I don't know I'm actually really happy
my relationship and we hardly ever argue
I mean if I'm overworked and exhausted
everyone gets snippy and bitchy of
course y'all know I'm the c-word right I
mean I think he's a CEO of his own
company he has a lot on his mind you
know it's just it goes hand in hand
sometimes with that kind of thing I'm a
stressed-out bitch right you know people
get stressed out I get stressed out
because he's stressed out ha ha ha but I
think like if I ever get like bitchy or
venting it's more so about a situation
it's really never not at me no I don't
really and know each other or argue that
off really ever no I know it's shocking
to most people but um right yeah I mean
I'm happy doing okay I get this question
so much I don't know why I think people
are like they have some sort of
misconception about us sometimes
now when me and Nathan first started
dating I'm gonna take the wheel real
quick there we go um I offered Nathan a
job at my warehouse a shipping makeup
and working on my customer service now a
lots changed in a year and a half and we
have invested into the cannabis industry
which I never talk about my channel of
course everyone knows we smoke weed that
ain't no secret right but um besides
having the cosmetic brand I also
co-owned a cannabis business with this
fellow right here you know I've always
been passionate about you know marijuana
and you know and of course helping
everybody that has you know issues that
marijuana can solve you know is also
plus you know it's cool it's amazing to
like help all the people and the science
behind um cannabis is crazy we've
learned so much about growing and
genetics so you know my grandma maybe
tells all her vinkle friends that
her grandson is a makeup and drug pin
kind of obvious I mean I've been
skateboarding for like ten years I
haven't really had many people to fill
me since my brother's gotten out here
though I've been trying to film a lot
more yeah it's a it's definitely been
like my one thing that I've been
passionate about for so long I've never
skateboarded before but he's actually
really great at it um you post a lot of
cool shit on Instagram of course
everything will be linked down below
Nathan doesn't use YouTube you guys he
really only has an Instagram and
snapchat my hobbies besides oral sex
include obviously makeup but I'm a huge
book lover I'm also a big collector I
collect um first edition novels I
collect handbags just anything like art
