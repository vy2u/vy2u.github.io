channel now it's been almost a month
since I've done a lip swatch review a
first impression so I'm like hi 2017
are we ready or what so I logged on to
Sephora calm here today and there was
another luxury brand that decided to
drop a liquid lipstick now this one I'm
really excited about because I love the
brand Burberry are amazing they have of
course amazing fashion so when they
launched their makeup brand I was like
oh oh another luxury brand is going to
come for the beauty industry I know a
lot of people really don't talk about
Burberry makeup I don't see it a lot on
YouTube but I've used our highlighters
in previous videos last year I'm
obsessed with them they have a really
amazing primer if you're into glowing
for the gods you just want me to check
this out and they think if they're
bronzers if I shadow palette so when I
saw this with lip you guys no liquid
left or right here I was like okay I
gotta get this stuff so first of all
let's talk about the packaging because
even though it may look a little simple
on camera it's I don't know how to
explain it like the unit carton itself
like the paper feels luxurious if you
know what I mean it doesn't select
flimsy and shitty it like feels really
nice and it feels heavy you guys know I
love an expensive heavy product now that
has to be expensive price words I just
like packaging in general these are the
Burberry liquid lips velvet it says that
it is a bold and match whipped lip cream
so you guys know I'm going to go on
their website to make sure we have all
the facts today this is the box of
course and let's just pull one of them
out here is what the packaging looks
like Lulu it has the classic Burberry
plaid pattern on the top of it and I
love the little frosted component looks
really cute of course as the logo there
everything else is plain except of
course the shade names and all the
information on the bottom of that right
now looking on their website all of
these retail for $34 each which of
course because it is a fashion designer
name it's going to be a little more
pricey
you know me I'm like you're paying for
the name of course and of course and
hopefully the formula is going to be
balm or working I have a problem here so
on the website it says that this is a
statement making matte cream lip color
with a comforting wood texture okay so I
guess that means it's really lightweight
so this is allegedly developed with an
innovative formula that merges a rich
pigment smooth application and a whipped
creamy texture for a bold velvet finish
that lasts up to eight hours okay this
is a good claim because you crazy no I
always have a problem whether what was
it was a Chanel Armani
everything says long lasting a lot of
the times but they're not and they come
off immediately
so this one is allegedly saying eight
hour wear which is awesome the color
will not dry fade or crack so with this
launch they came out with 16 shades I'm
like damn work girl so I bought nine of
them I picked six amount a nine lip
swatches but you all know my mouth is
going to fall off on the table so
besides that nude one I got all of these
guys here and I got a nice range of
colors I feel like so we're going to
test out the formula it's a lot of the
times the light ones are great and then
the dark shades you're like what in the
 happened so definitely got a bunch
to try today so everyone has the entire
fact there is also six millimeters which
is 0.2 fluid ounces that is a standard
size for a liquid lip and then a decent
amount of product which is awesome
so besides that I think let's dive into
it and see if these are jeffree star
approved and then also in between
because I always get asked like how do
you keep your mouth so smooth in between
takes I love to use a lip scrub it does
not have to be mine but I do have my own
but I make it as vegan and it also has a
vitamin E in it and aloe vera and it's
edible and it tastes good now
we're going to dive right into this and
the first shade that is like gravitating
to my brain this one is luige is called
peach now Burberry is not very creative
with their names they are very
straightforward which I don't know why
maybe because it's Burberry I don't
really care but you know if I'm like
some of these brands the names are so
 boring but I don't mind
one for some reason now you guys know I
love a virgin wand untouched so here is
what the applicator looks like let's put
my hand there so you guys can see it is
cute now let's go into the smell this is
so weird
there's literally no smell I just if
you're bothered by fragrance this is
great for you because there's literally
zero now I think let's go in and see
what the help of formula is all about
now I need some more product all the
product is off with that amount which I
always talk about picking you like four
swipes
or you know two dips one dip now it says
it's like a whipped cream velvet it is
very true to what it says because it's
not liquidy at all it's kind of like
fake foot thin and under the thumb so
jump thickens in at the same time but
it's like the texture stick but it's
applying a little thin but it's full I
mean this is full coverage baby now I'm
dipping in a fourth time
girl and workout right now alright now
let's give this a second and see how
long it takes to dry now let's just say
a few things the texture of this it's so
lightweight it's like really nothing is
on my mouth and it feels nice okay it's
not dry yet so let's give it like a
minute or two and see what happens
okay I'm like a bird I just love shiny
things I'm like I just got this new lit
glitter in the mail and I'm like hi
putting some under-eye concealer alright
guys so it's been about five minutes
since we took a little break I had a
glass of water went down on somebody and
I'm looking closely and here's the thing
is that it's full full coverage but it
doesn't dry down now I didn't say it was
supposed to and just said that it lasted
eight hours so if you like use a straw
that comes off on the straw but you know
what's crazy is even though the pigment
came off on that straw y'all see you
come over my mouth because I don't
really see it that is crazy okay so I'm
going to watch another color and wipe
this off and you guys I like to really
just use makeup wipes in between it is e
and actually use a beauty blender with a
little bit of powder to make sure there
is no residue on my lips so I will be
right back the next I'm going to be
trying is called light nude and it looks
like a light news alright let's just
pull this out oh and see what happen
this shade really reminds me of Mac's
myth if you guys have tried that out
there online you guys know this is like
almost a dupe but it's like so much
softer because it doesn't have that like
sheen that's a Mac one has but like
alright now I'm going to give this five
minutes and see if it dries down just
like the other one and we'll be right
back
it has been five minutes and same
formula as the other one which I was
hoping that was going to happen but you
never know because sometimes the light
shades are like so great enemy at middle
shades are kind of like huh I mean we
still have four more to go but this
feels so soft I wish you can reach
through the screen and touch my mouth
right now because hmm it feels very
moisturizing very alright let's get this
off and try the next one
now when I saw this red shade I about
died it looks so pretty in the bottle I
was like okay alright this trade is
called military red I love that shade
name and makes me feel like I'm having
you know a six-way in the army again
shower memories alright let's put this
on and see what happens
all right this is a military read this
one is on five-year now it was a little
harder to get your lines completely
straight I don't know if it was the
applicator maybe my mouth is a little
raw but I just had to go a little slower
on the brighter shade and obviously it's
Nealon this is a neon red so you want to
be careful take your time so you stay in
the lines and get that lipstick on but
this one is beautiful so if you are a
red lipstick lover and you're like okay
these are cute you have to try this one
whew this one is called fawn rose that
looks like a soft nude rose type of ID
which I love those type of colors so I'm
really excited about this one look at
that already mm-hmm okay I know I just
applied this but I'm already obsessed
with this color it is so pretty maybe
because it's so soft and it really looks
distressed and I'd have a moment and
definitely compliment my eye makeup are
you have on but it is really pretty oh I
don't want to take this off but all
right we got two more let's get to them
this next shade is called a dark
rosewood and it looks like a soft tone
muted type of brown nude and looks right
up my alley of shades I love and here we
go
I love these type of shades it's almost
like a chestnut eros hyper vibe I love
the undertone of this one but it
definitely looks like a color I've seen
a million times from every brand and
obviously this is all about the formula
for this one but this one's cute
definitely not my favorite from all the
ones I wash but she Kyoshi all right and
I'm excited to swatch this next one it
is a really dark and I hope it works
now there's the last one oh look at that
color it's called black cherry it looks
like a brown dark blackish red I don't
even know what it looks like it looks
like brown in the bottle but I
definitely know if it's called black
cherry huh Oh see that oh my god okay
I'm ready to put this on my mouth let's
see what's going on
whoo you guys know when we do a dark
shade you really got to make sure it
looks matched and the shades really is
pretty now that it's on you can
definitely see the red undertones of
this shape it is really dark and I'm
kind of living for it whoo all right I'm
gonna let this one dry for a second and
then I'm going to give my final move all
right guys we got through another swatch
video together now let me give my final
thoughts I think that these are
great
I am so pleasantly surprised because I
have had a bad track record with luxury
brand and their liquid lipsticks last
year add a lot of not-so-great moments
especially with the Chanel ones the
Armani ones you guys know and if you
haven't I'm going to link down all my
lip swatch videos in the description box
below so if you want to catch up on them
you definitely can but this formula is
really great the coverage is beautiful
I'm just going to say that right now
every shade had easy coverage now I
thought it was still it's still haunting
me that there was no smell to it which
is kind of awesome but also like what
the hell girl I'm gonna investigate
those ingredients when I'm done with
this video but besides that you guys
everything was really great they were
easy to apply they blended like I mean
they bled it really easy there was no
complaints on my end but I am going to
share with you one little con that I
didn't have with this is the applicator
was a little small for my liking and I
know some brands have this small other
dope foot but to me I feel like it
should have been a little more maybe a
little taller
maybe a little flatter but I feel like
just because with the formula with other
products of gloss or other liquid lips
I've seen this before
it's easy but I felt like I had to like
dunk in the tube like four to five times
which is really not normal for me as
usually like you know twice maybe three
times so that was really my only
complaint with that besides that I
thought the packaging is cute its sturdy
it feels nice and all the colors work
great I can't believe there's really
nothing negative to say about a liquid
letting us what the Burberry liquid list
velvet our jeffree star approved so if
you guys don't mind spending a little
extra money on maybe water through these
shades I would
recommend trying them out I think my
favorite that really stood up to me were
the military red and then the light nude
I'm definitely going to be bringing this
on some trips because she used to go for
a ride
thank you so much for watching another
first impressions lip swatch video we
are so early on in the year and I know a
lot more brands are going to come out

a little rumor that Urban Decay's about
the drop stuff so you know I'm going to
be watching that on my channel there's
