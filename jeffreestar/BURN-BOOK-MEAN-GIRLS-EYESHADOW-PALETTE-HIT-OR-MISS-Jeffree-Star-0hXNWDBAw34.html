channel how are ya alright so today I am
really really excited because we have
another Mean Girls moment on my channel
now I reviewed the brushes last month
from another brand called spectrum I
know you all remember this and if you
didn't remember this video where you
never saw it I'll link it down below but
today I'm really really because we are
going to dive in into the new storybook
Cosmetics Mean Girls burn book eyeshadow
palette that was the sexiest sentence
I've said in a long time so if you've
been following this channel for a while
you know that I have reviewed this brand
several times now they had the infamous
rose makeup brushes which of course
we're jeffree star approved we also
reviewed the wizardry and witchcraft
palette earlier this year on my channel
so this will be another book in their
series of palettes I love this brand
they keep killing it and it's pretty
hard to impress me time after time but
girl
they ain't slowing down and this formula
was sickening but is the burn book the
same formula is it going to work out and
is it cute enough for our hearts if you
are a mean girl fan you are definitely
going to love today's video and if
you're do someone that loves makeup keep
on watching baby but if you want to get
ready with me grab some makeup brushes
and a Red Bull and let's get started
alright so let's talk about the
packaging BAM
for fifty-five dollars which is what
this retails you get the palette inside
of this beautiful velvet pouch and when
you open it it looks like this oh and
here is the palette it comes with its
own book cover slave which I love so it
does have a lot of info on the back
everything about this brand you guys
they are first of all they are an
e-commerce brand which means they are
only sold online kind of like my brand
so if you want it you got to go on their
website now the burn book eyeshadow
palette is cruelty free there are three
formulas we have matte pearl and shimmer
I think that's what the last palette had
yeah I showed her names are to die for
this brand always takes it there with it
like to the next level and that's what I
appreciate the cool thing about this is
that you can line them up on your vanity
so it literally looks like books like I
live I die okay great now I don't let
the open her up here is what you get to
pour $55
ah now this palette is very different
than the last one I love it the colors
speak to me they're very bright and fun
but also very you know we could wear
this for the fall
now I'm someone that wears pink
eyeshadow year-round so this palette
does have 12 eyeshadows I love the names
you guys Regina George she doesn't even
go here you can't sit with us
alright this pot looks fun you can
definitely create some crazy looks with
this now that's what we're about to do
so I have already primed my eyes with
some Mac painterly paint-pot you guys
already know that's every video of
course by now so that is already primed
and ready to roll now today and serving
some little alien Barbie glam I have no
eyebrows on because who needs eyebrows
when I don't know most people I guess
sorry okay so we have no eyebrows on
today we have Nathan on my mouth which
is nothing new but you guys always ask
what lip color I'm wearing hey let's get
started now I love to lay down a light
color from lid all the way to brow a lot
of the times I'm sure if you have been
watching me for a while you know I love
a light base so we are going to take the
shade the plastics with a little Mac
synthetic brush and let's see if the
formula is good or not just looks like a
matte formula to me now I love this
brand because they I don't know why
don't I haven't tried this yet but in
the past they have perfected the matte
formula with not like crazy crazy
fallout as you see I'm hitting this over
and over and over that's not how much
follow up baby all right so let's press
this on my eye oh hello I might do this
I'm like looking in the monitor you guys
I'm not even looking in the mirror I'm
like ah yes no I do have deep set eyes
so I do like to take the lightness and
bring it even like higher which of
course if you have a different type of
eye shape you will not want to do this
by the way this palette does have a very
ginormous mirror which I should be
utilizing right now instead of looking
in the monitor
all right so far so good
if the plastics laid down very nicely it
blended beautifully so let's move on
let's take this little morphe what is
this the 441 little blending brush and
what do I want to do today these orange
some Pink's are like speaking to me God
that green needs its own tutorial I feel
like I'm like can I touch it right now
we're touching it oh you guys know I
gotta just do a little swatch right here
oh look at that bitch
okay so let's dive into so fetch first
no I'm lying we're not doing that
we're gonna do you can't sit with us
then so fetch then Wednesday we're gonna
get a really colorful up in here so
let's just hit this a few times and full
pigment on the brush already but does it
blend well let's take a peek all right
let's see here yes crease you better
work
now I'm not gonna connect it all the way
down here I'm gonna kind of leave it as
like kind of like a floating crease and
just give my lid some breathing room and
I'm just gonna take this and just kind
of go like that and then just flick out
so it just kind of goes like this very
lightly and soft all right you can't sit
with us is laid down in the crease it is
very pretty if giving me like I just
love it now I'm gonna take the Mean
Girls spectrum brush that I have been
using for under-eye powder and
everything else I'm actually gonna take
it and hit it with the plastics and I
know it's a bigger brush and you
probably like what the hell are you
doing
and I am then going to take that and
just blend out the coral ish we're gonna
call this color peachy coral and just
kind of go over it like mmm there we go
and that's gonna make it very seamless
and blended out so the next color we are
going to dive into is so fetch it is
that one right there it's like a hot
Orange it's pretty okay so we're gonna
grab so fetch on this little packer and
we're going to put that right in there
and then once again we're gonna take
that the shadow right on the end just
kind of go up this way there you go and
if you have a face tattoo be careful not
to get anything on it all right so I'm
trying to decide what I want to do with
this look oh my god first of all that
looked like almost like a dark slate
blueish gray and then on my finger it's
like holy I'm gonna put that right next
to the green which of course has faded
because I've touched some things but oh
that's silver though I'm like what are
we gonna do I did I kept this blank you
guys I don't know what I want to put in
there part of me keeps being like no
we're not doing the green we're doing
the green we have to so I might smoke
out my under eye with the green I might
plop it right here but Wednesday the
pink you guys it's like calling my name
so let's go in with a little oh come on
now I'm gonna press this like halfway on
my lid kind of like it's a liner but not
and let's see what happens here
I was brushes kind of fluffy so it's
like maybe not the best okay that is
 sheer girl I don't believe it
the other shadows can not be that good
for that to be that we're trying
it if a brush alright there we go this
is a packer brush what you're supposed
to use this for not living dying and
breathing for this color but it's still
doable it looks like it's a little bit
more like it's obviously matte it looks
good so we're share than the other one
as far as payoff I am NOT living for the
pink so we are packing and packing now
the white base could obviously affect
that who knows but let's just go right
in there BAM now I do also want to note
that this shade did have a lot more
follow than the others we can just zoom
in right there obviously I think the
pigment worked it's not the best and
Pink's are very hard to do I understand
that but girl alright I packed the pink
color on I'm loving how it's looking now
for this little weird part right here
that I left open I am gonna take the
Urban Decay heavy metal glitter and
shade grind and we are going to just pop
that on there now I like this wand and
I've been using this for literally
they've had this out for what 10 years I
want to say I like it because it puts it
on a little at a time so if you're like
hey I don't know if I'm gonna go
overboard you can definitely go very
minimal and then bump it up so it's not
like oh I put too much on okay you
guys well for the first time on this
channel ever doing a tutorial the
fan alright so the glitter nothing wrong
with the glitter I've used it before I
love them but sometimes when you put
glitter on top of bright shadows they
tend to get weird
the wand was picking up pink I put it on
the white on accident hit the fan I
 it up so I wiped off the glitter
I took the Packer brush and of course I
put Wednesday all over they're gonna
still glitter like all my lids still
kind of I went that off though and then
I took this little brush right here
which I'm gonna do again and I'm gonna
go into she doesn't even go here now
this matte does have a lot more fallout
than the others these two definitely do
more than these three actually so I'm
just gonna knock off some pigment
we are going to just put that right into
the crease and come back to life because
girl life tried it I almost had to wipe
off everything and I was like girl we
gonna do that
uh-huh we are back now the pink is a
little messy pink shadows can be messy
it did come under here like it stained a
little bit so we're gonna put a shadow
under there I'm not worried about it
we're moving on everybody pause and take
a hit with me because girl okay now we
are going to grab the Mac smolder eye
pencil nothing new here I do that a lot
on this channel and we are just going to
take this and put it right in our water
lines all right you guys so now look
I've been dying to dive into the shade
obsessed looks so pretty I'm like you
know what green pink it sometimes
it looks hideous sometimes it looks
crazy
so let's give it a whirl I'm a lot of
the times with metallics you know I love
to wet my brush with fix+
or a setting spray but we are going to
do this with a clean brush first to see
how the pigment is and then we'll move
on alright so let's do a little it was
beautiful on my finger but how is it off
oh girl oh they like really soft the
brush is like okay I don't want to get a
lot of Fallout on my face okay these are
very soft you see it on the brush is it
going to stay on let's pray here goes
nothing
a little shear with it dry I will say
that not living for it I loved how it
looked on my finger so let's use a
little we didn't have any fix+ in here
no okay we're just going in with this
morphe spray this will wet the brush for
us now let's try to go back into that
shade one more time oh there we go okay
look like rolling it around
alright so let's give it a whirl now a
lot of the times wetting the brush
obviously intensifies things with any
brand or palette so I am not mad at this
and let's drag it all the way and just
be obnoxious like hi are we Shrek are we
serving Ninja Turtles what the are
we doing girl all right the green is on
it's making a statement and then
you know what let's just take it even
further we're going to dive into this
beautiful shade and I'm gonna use this
tiny little morphe brush well we see
that you guys this really stuck to the
brush as well no this is the tiny
tiniest Packer brush ever and I'm just
gonna see how this looks I mean if we
already looked this crazy let's just
take it there someone to press this
right in the inner corner ooh
okay silver you did not need any setting
spray definitely feel like this one is a
little bit different than the green
obviously one had a lot more shimmer and
this is like straight-up pearl silver so
we're just gonna tuck that right in
there Wow all right you guys I think
this look is done I just added a little
bit of benefit roller lash mascara no
shocker there I love how this looks now
I think I'm ready to give my final
thoughts are you I have used it let's do
a little camp you guys one two three
four five six seven shades out of the 12
and definitely gonna have to do its own
blue moment later on in life with this
look but I think we're gonna give our
final thoughts so let's dive into it so
when I first saw this palette I was very
very excited I am a very huge Mean Girls
fan and I have loved the movie since it
drops so now that we are here years
later I love this whole thing I love the
palette now let's dive into the cost $55
pretty good this is a I hate the word
novelty because I don't mean it in a bad
way but is they it is a novelty item if
you are not a fan of the movie obviously
you might not get the palette but so
many people are and I think it is so
cool that this is even in existence I
think it should have happened a long
time ago so a story but thank you for
making this dream of mine happen now
let's dive into the formula all right
now the first shade loved it it was
beautiful this shade as well beautiful
transition this one amazing the pink was
a little weird for me I think because
they had the white shadow down it
I've looked a little weird who knows it
could be the primary you guys know you
have to try things out trial and error
but it did end up obviously packing on
really nicely now she doesn't even go
here blended really cute in the crease
the green one was a little weird it felt
a little chunky a little glittery but
once I sprayed the brush and put it on
there and packed it it went on really
nice without spraying it didn't really
love it it was a little kind of hard to
work with the silver on the other hand
beautiful I'm looking in here like BAM
like it's stunning so that was the only
problem that I had with that besides
that you guys it wasn't like an end-all
like this shade did not ruin the palate
for me it was just a tiny bit hard to
work with but overall definitely I think
this pilot gets a 9 out of 10 I feel
like if you have a problem with one
chaired whatever of course we do have to
try the rest of them out in a future
look but the consistency is there just
like their last palette the formula is
there I love it and I think that they
really have a hit on their hands so is
the storybook cosmetics burn book
eyeshadow palette
Jackie Starr approved its Jeffrey's are
approved hey Wayne star Trak aren't you
guys I did really enjoy this palette I
love this look it's just it's different
I kind of lived for that green though
baby so yeah thank you for watching
sorry I'm all giggly and mommy took a
few hits because when I put that
glitters down y'all and it up I
was devastated but we came back strong
just like the Dodgers all right you guys
thank you for watching this video and
I'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
