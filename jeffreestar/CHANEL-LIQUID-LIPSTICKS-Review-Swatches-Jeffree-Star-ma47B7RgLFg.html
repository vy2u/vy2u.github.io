today we're doing another lip swatch
video but this time a new liquid lip
that I've never tried before like when I
say ever I mean ever Chanel just put out
there brand new a liquid lip I'm my girl
you're a little late to the party hunty
chanel is one of my favorite brands ever
I've been using their foundation and
powders
throughout my lifetime every I always go
back to this to the damn Chanel it's
amazing they have such amazing
accessories you know I gotta have the
Chanel gloves today we got the chain
baby we got the cuff so I bought these
directly from Chanel calm and I had them
overnight to my house so each individual
lipstick is 37 dollars and I know a lot
of you were gonna be like mm I know baby
it Chanel I had to have it so of course
I have not tried these I haven't tested
them I haven't swatch them they're
literally just fresh in the box from the
UPS guys so I'm like yes I have to film
a video right now so besides being an
astronomical of $37 there are eight
shades so combined total is almost $300
and then we had to put on that $20
overnight fee for the shipping and then
listen California tax and extra 26
 dollars so grand total is a 342
girl but hey we're trying them out for
YouTube and that's all that matters so
it comes in a gorgeous box like this now
I love Chanel because they come in a
look at that sticker though it looks
like a piece of wax was dropped onto it
and uh that's how fan alright ooh
they're smaller than I initially thought
so alright so there is all eight shades
in there and this little fluffy
packaging oh my god they're they're not
miniature but they're smaller than I
thought for sure so the official name
for this product is that Rouge a lower
ink liquid lip color so they come in
this cute little box with the of course
typical Chanel gold and black packaging
now it says that there are 0.20 fluid
ounces in there which they look a little
small to have 20 but allegedly right
and let's open it in here now of course
the best thing in the world is seeing
that cute little gold Chanel symbol that
is on all their lipsticks this is very
cute it is really it's it's tiny for a
liquid lip to me um it still feels very
luxurious it feels heavy typical Chanel
very nice packaging and by typical I
mean in a very good way so now all of
these colors I'm just gonna open them up
all right now now this one is called
experiment day now a lot of us have
French names that I'm not going to be
able to pronounce kind of like my little
bit then lip lacquer swatch video I
couldn't pronounce any of those so I'm
just going to throw up the name on the
screen right here every time I swatch a
color so first of all let's see what
this even looks like so this is in the
bottle like so and this is the wand so
it's like one of those double sided flat
ones so you see that is flat on both
sides and it kind of goes up in an angle
now let's get these senses going huh
okay let me let me give it one more dip
it has that like flowery YSL lipstick to
your flower type of vibe very mild thank
you Jesus um I'm ready to sort you all
so let's see what happens I'm nervous
oh okay first wife is a little shear
let's go in for more they're a little
now obviously I've tried all the shades
but this one is a little more sheer
honestly than I expect it especially
right in here when I smile it's like hmm
not bad yet let's see what happens now
first impressions this wand actually is
a little hard to hold because the wand
part in the middle is just kind of short
so it's been a little more difficult to
apply and just for fun I'm gonna add in
one more layer on the bottom here all
right now it's still kind of glossy so I
think I'm gonna set a timer and excuse
me little lady and say how long it takes
you these to dry all right guys so it's
been five minutes and you see that kind
of gloss on there now I was reading the
website again and it says liquid
lipstick matte color let's just kiss
this lash box because it's pure white
and let's do what happens girl look it
looks more matte now that I kissed some
of the pigment off now I don't care what
brand you are if you're drugstore or all
the way up to honest hacia or even my
brand a liquid lip dries down this one
is just not drying and it kind of
coagulated in the middle here but when I
kissed it kind of removed the kind of
weirdness that was happening but yeah
it's not drying Matt it's coming off
okay I think it's only fair that we wipe
this off and continue our journey and
safety of the shades are hopefully
better this next shade is a looks like a
little warm tone kind of Mahdi nude and
what's her name
my god amaura mr this is it
 name alright let's give
this one a world
alright the smell is consistent so I'm
going to assume they all have that kind
of floral smell and let's see what
happens
all right I gotta say something the
lighter shade I think is actually it
looks pretty on the monitor so y'all
might be like don't be over critical but
like mmm it's a little more sheer than
the last one
just overall the pigment is a little
more sheer I'm not loving it it's a
little patchy on the outer edges and it
just feels like I love a lightweight lip
but like I don't hate the texture it's a
very light weight it just feels kind of
like it feels sheer if you know what I
mean like you can still have a light
weight full full coverage lip but this
one feels not I mean the color is really
pretty it is very soft so if you're one
of those girls that loves a simple soft
look before your orgy this is definitely
the one for you but um once again let's
see if she dries we'll be right back so
I'm gonna do the kiss test one more time
because if this one doesn't dry down
they obviously all don't and um here we
go shake em off even the lip color huh
look at the top it's like you've been
missing from my lip now all right guys
um let's move on to the next shade now
in between takes I remove it and I take
a little hard Beauty Blender and I just
kind of go like that so there's no
makeup residue on my mouth and let's get
to the next shade so there's a lot of
Reds all looks like almost like look at
this it's like for kind of watermelon
tea shades um so let's just try the next
one
oh this one looks a really new on and uh
let's see what happens
oh my god this one is really Cher I'm
like wait they keep getting more sheer
as the colors progress hmm oh my
god this is almost like a tension lip
balm you guys huh god they're so easy to
like put on because they just glide like
very much there if you want full color
definitely got a layer but this color is
its sheer it's cute it looks a lot more
neon on the applicator and then you put
on your mouth and it kind of like
dissipates so um let's try the next one
all right so this one that looks to be a
more deep blood-red is she is she though
hmm how come the red is more pigment
than the lighter ones usually okay
what's pretty so far
okay this shade is really pretty but it
almost feels like there's like oil
sitting on top of my lips like I don't
know and I'm like I'm trying to love
these and I just don't um yeah I didn't
kind of like a second layer and it
almost feels like too oily like the Reds
have more pigment than the other two
which is very bizarre but um no there
are a few more red on the table this one
looks like a dark very red and there's
like a hot orange so let's give this one
a world first
please tell me everyone's saying that
mmm I can't y'all I really can't all
right so this is the fifth one that i've
swatched and no tea no shade I'm really
not gonna swatch the other three they
look really similar in color I swear to
god these aren't the colors I just
watched let me hold up the five we've
already done I mean they look so similar
you guys I'm like didn't you guys change
the percent like two percent they're all
different names so there's no um you
know replicas they're all they're all
eight different shades allegedly but
these look so similar you guys um I'm
really disappointed you got I really am
I'm like mmm Chanel you have flopped on
this one for $37 I expected like one of
the best lipsticks I've ever tried i I'm
not getting that with these at all so I
thought okay am i putting it on wrong
did I maybe miss speak on it is it not a
liquid to matte so I went on their
official website and it says matte
liquid lip color and it says a
long-lasting a liquid lip with smooth
texture that glides on like a gloss and
sets with a luminous velvet like finish
how to apply define lip contours then
fill in so I watched a tutorial of a
Chanel beauty artist using these in she
used a lip liner underneath which for
$37.00 you should not have to use a lip
liner under-eye liquid to matte but hey
I don't love it I really don't love it
at all for the price point I mean even
the mmm
the packaging is boring let's keep it
real Chanel I love you but this
was definitely a miss and this is not
Jeffrey star approved sadly I don't even
want to swatch the other three the
texture is so weird it is very like oily
like it doesn't really dry down velvet
to me maybe an extra like hour I like
the morta I don't know I do gotta say
another thing that really bothered me is
the wand it's just too short in the
middle it was kind of annoying to go
around my lips just kind of felt awkward
I love a longer one if you will have
upset you guys I definitely not
impressed
but um hey Chanel makes some bomb-ass
products so of course I'll be trying out
everything they put out in the future
but sadly this this one is a pass if you
really really are a makeup fanatic maybe
buy one just to try it but go to the
counter tester for yourself of course
this is just my experience but um not
for me guys that is it for this first
impressions swatch video if there any
new products that you want me to try my
channel leave some comments below and
let me know what the hell y'all want to
see next I'll see you on the next video
bye guys mwah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
