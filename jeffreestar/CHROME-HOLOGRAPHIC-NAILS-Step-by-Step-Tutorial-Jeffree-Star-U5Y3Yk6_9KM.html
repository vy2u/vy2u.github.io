channel now today we're doing something
special I've never done in a video on my
channel so this is my nail artist tech a
magician event yes so now today you guys
we are showing you the latest trends in
nail art we're doing the coveted chrome
that you have seen everywhere and we're
also we're gonna be doing the
holographic the holographic this is the
new and hottest that everyone is
doing everyone is dying to try this and
people are like how the hell do you do
all this so we're gonna show you guys
how to do chrome and hologram all in one
video so if you want to see how we do
this fierceness then keep on watching so
obviously you have to do a base for the
chrome right yes if you wanted to you
know right now we're doing the pink so
it's gonna give you more of like a
pinkish like a combi pink yes yes so
that'll give you color so won't be like
just shirt so do you want silver like so
what would you for silver like black
black yeah cuz it's gonna reflect it's
gonna look really silver yes so we're
doing pink of course gotta get that
signature Geoffrey nail in there and
then for the hologram we're gonna do
like a purple vibe so we'll show you
guys um we're gonna show you both to dry
the gel of course we are what we call a
curating cheering cheering sorry not
curating ready to play excuse my
terminology for the left hand you guys
were doing bringing you the holographics
where we do this purple you have to
remember that it shows through lightly
so the darker the color the more it'll
show so if you want like a light purple
you can't do a light purple underneath
because you won't really see it right
okay so then after you got the color on
you have to put the this is like a top
coat but it's like a rubber a top coat
so this is what's gonna make both the
chrome and the metallic actually stick
okay no take a metalizer you know
different companies call it differently
and then I use this little rubbery tip
you can also use like a little eye
shadow yeah so that all the videos from
like they're like a few weeks ago
everyone's doing that eye shadow brushes
so now there's actually tools now
everybody well this one is like a little
silicon tape use for other things you
know but uh-huh this is just so much
easier it just apply so much smoother
right it's preference whatever you like
some people use sponges but with this I
feels like the least amount of waste you
know cuz you dry
well it's like one of the tools I use
during my pap smears so basically you're
just like blending it on there so you
just kind of like literally rubbing it
on there and they have to make sure you
get all up in a little cuticle yeah so
you can see the color and it looks janky
okay so you have to make sure you dust
off all the little excess because that's
what's gonna you know keep it looking
chrome and not like glittery yes make
sure it's like something you have to
keep it clean so make sure it's a brush
that you only use for this right now
your eyeshadow brush cuz you know unless
you want like comb and stuff on your
eyeshadow that we don't write additional
little step just to seal it is to use
like a hard gel I'm gonna use the okay
anything I took a little on the lighter
side this will just seal it and make
sure it does it peel cuz you get that a
lot of the little peeling on the corners
yes I mean you have to cure this to you
right yes was it you have to topcoat it
so just like a non wipe come on top coat
you got to seal the deal baby mm-hmm
you got to make sure you get up all the
little corners get up underneath it's
all about the detail a lot of people
forget that all right now we're gonna
cure this BAM
so you're wiping down set the wipe off
all the excess all that little glitter
that you see around yes just wipe it off
with like acetone or with like a
cleanser yeah acetone works better get
just get in there mm-hmm
all right so the chrome hand is done and
now let's get to hologram II and then
this one looks like this in the bottle
it's like a lot finer okay yeah let me
wait fine there it looks just great but
once you get it on there you see the
difference and the same thing you put
the same base yeah so base is already
done base is done everything is done
same thing you barely touch it and this
is a cool effect right here alright so
you're wiping off again right yeah same
thing these look so crazy
they're freaking amazing and then is it
the same process you got to seal it
same thing same exact process alright
guys this is the final look now we're
gonna go out in the daylight and really
really show how amazing these look but
