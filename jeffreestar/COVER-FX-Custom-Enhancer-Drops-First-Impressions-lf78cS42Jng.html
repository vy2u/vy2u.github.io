channel today we are here for another
first impressions
now this brand in Sephora called cover
FX they have a new highlighting product
now these are called the custom enhancer
drops now basically what this is is this
is a highlighter in a bottle I'm like oh
my god it's like probably the best thing
I've ever heard so when I heard that
there was something a little innovative
on the market of course I have to try it
for you guys and let you know the Realty
basically what this is is like a dropper
and it's really dope and it just causes
this liquid metal effect on your cheeks
which you can see I'm wearing one shade
on each cheek bone today I love brands
that think outside the box cover FX of
course are very well-known for their
foundation custom drops where you can
mix and match so if you want to see what
I think about this crazy highlighter and
keep on watching now in a few days I
will be on the Vans Warped Tour selling
my cosmetics brand and I will be doing
meet-and-greets Friday the 24th I'll be
in Dallas Saturday the 25th I will be in
San Antonio and Sunday June 26th I will
be in Houston Texas one of my favorite
places so if you guys want to come out
shop my brand and meet me you can't buy
tickets on the link below it is Vans
Warped Tour calm and you do have to have
a ticket for the entire event to get
inside to get to my booth every day I'll
be doing meet-and-greets for about 4
hours and it's probably 100 degrees out
there so please bring your setting
sprays for me and I will also be on 6
more dates later on in the tour
everything will be linked down below
alright let's get started so I think I'm
gonna put on some primer before I mix
these into my foundation which this is
what I've been waiting for all day I'm
like ok can we get to filming so I woke
up this morning ready to glow so because
we are at a highlighter obsessed world
I'm going to be pulling out my Becca
backlight primer this has shimmer in it
and like a beautiful glow it's probably
one of my favorite primers so we're just
gonna do a tiny bit by tiny I mean a lot
because who doesn't want to glow like a
radiation poisoning and I always love to
get my mouth too because if that isn't
glowing all day we have some severe
issues alright primer is on now let's
get to this foundation the whole point
of this video which we are about
to dive into our the new cover FX custom
enhancer drops these are like
highlighter drops so as soon as I saw
that you know my heart stopped and I
couldn't breathe I was like okay so I
bought these on Sephora comp with my own
money yes because you know no bitch is a
sponsoring or sending me anything if I
like it I like it if I hate it I hate it
and I'm always going to keep it real
with you guys so I bought these on
Sephora calm they are 42 dollars a piece
now they had a variety of colors there
are three more colors now some of them
are way too dark for me so I try to
guess and get the colors that I thought
would be good for my skin tone so I got
three of them here now this let's just
show the packaging really cute love that
unit garden I'm all about the metallic
BAM how dope is this packaging I'm like
it's like blinding me already so this
comes in like a little medical dropper
which I door love that and it just comes
out like that
what are these for I'm sure some of you
are asking let me read the box so this
says this product is paraben fragrance
gluten mineral oil and talc free that is
amazing now this product is also vegan
which is a really dope and basically it
says custom enhancer drops alive to
customize your favorite beauty products
by adding ratings or a bronze tint well
I want to add ratings to my entire
existence so I'm very excited to dip
into these now this says one drop at a
time your product is transformed to give
a subtle or dramatic enhanced finish
well thank God it's so dramatic because
I cannot wait so let's unbox these
colors the first one is called celestial
hmm and this is the lightest one this
looks like metal already and I haven't
even touched it yet so let's see what
the color looks like oh wow so I'm just
gonna put a drop on my hand which should
show up really well okay so that is just
one drop now I'm just gonna see what
happens oh oh my god it's like liquid
glass look at my finger I can't breathe
oh that literally looks like terminator
just came on my hand
and the texture like dries really
quickly it doesn't feel watery or weird
it's like already drying
I'm just going to rub this all over my
hand alright so that is the lightest one
and then we have a moon light now I
think this is like the more gold version
of celestial so let's see what it looks
like now I'm just gonna use my other
hand BAM
alright now this one oh wow yeah this is
like liquid platinum that is so look how
bright that is I'm like cool there's not
really any fragrance just like the
packaging says so that is very truthful
so on the website there are three other
shades I thought they were going to be
way too dark for me so I picked the
three lightest ones now this one's
called Sunkist
see what this looks like ah so this
looks like it has less metal to it I
think maybe this is more like the
bronzing one they were talking about I'm
just gonna put a little let's put a
little drop right there
ah I'm putting this over the metal and
it still looks more way more matte okay
so this I guess adds bronze to your look
obviously they all have a different kind
of finish the first two were like
blinding metal and this is definitely
the bronzer one okay cool I'm gonna skip
putting the bronze one into my
foundation and I'm gonna try the metal
ones because those are way more exciting
to me
so I'm going to take celestial the light
one and let's see what happens when I
mix it in with my foundation today I'm
just going to be using that Born This
Way Foundation love this one this is
shade vanilla and I'm just going to
shake this for a second so I'm just
going to use the back of my hand and
then apply it with a Beauty Blender so
we're just gonna do a few pumps of this
probably a good enough to cover my face
now we're just gonna do a little this is
one drops good enough
clearly we know we got any I at least
need to now I'm just going to take the
end of my Beauty Blender and mix this on
my hand so I'm just gonna dot this all
around this foundation is a little
darker on me which I'm doing on purpose
so please don't try to read me it's
summertime and my pale ass needs some
color and of course we're going to get
the neck all right so let me blend this
out and let's see if there's any extra
glow
oh right I am blended to perfection I
love that this actually worked like
listen my face has I know it has some
definition and some cheekbones which are
all real so please don't ever try to
clock me in the comments I know people
like damn is this is are those real I'm
like honey this isn't just my bones so
let's talk about how it feels let's talk
about how it looks now right off the bat
first of all the Born This Way
Foundation by itself if you've never
tried it is very hydrating very medium
to full coverage and it just feels great
on its own so I was going to see if this
would change the formula or alter it in
any way and it honestly hasn't which is
great because if you add in stuff cheer
foundation like even drudger Armani
right one of my favorite foundations of
all time they have something similar
that they're called fluid shears that
I've used in another video for some
reason it like activated weird with this
and it just didn't dry completely I
didn't love how it looked and it kind of
made my face feel a little like so when
you're adding something to your
foundation you never know how it's gonna
affect the formula because obviously
every foundation has different
ingredients this looks flawless and it
just has like a boost of like radiance
to it definitely seeing a little
different change in my face the coverage
it didn't affect the coverage at all I
was afraid of makeup you know shoot it
down but it didn't really affect the
formula I'm like pleasantly surprised I
was excited to try this and I'm like
okay so far this looks amazing
other places that I would want to use
the drops are on my cheeks so I think I
am going to just do some quick little
daytime makeup and then we can try the
highlighter so I just did a little you
know a little rainbow glam eye and I
just used this new mascara from YSL
which I've been a wise self bad for a
long time they have some of the best
stick lipstick formulas on the market
and what that F is is called this is the
mascara vinyl Couture and shade pink of
course now I haven't worn colored
mascara in years I used to always do
blue on my autumn lashes and I'm like oh
my god pink I saw this at Neiman's and I
was dyed so this is so cute love that
component and it is just straight up
Barbie thank you guys back into the
cover
X review we're going to go in with
celestial again and let's try a
highlight so I'm just gonna take my
Beauty Blender it is still damp now it
says that you can mix it with a
highlighter I'm going to do it right on
my damn cheek so I'm just gonna go like
this
like that's where I would put my
highlight oh wow
I don't looks cute okay and then I'm
just going to take my Beauty Blender and
we're just gonna want to bounce this
onto my skin and all pray it works
oh damn look at that shine you guys I'm
like oh oh okay let's do the other cheek
I'm gonna do it difficultly on the other
cheek just because why not let's take a
shade moonlight this is the more
champagne color and I'm just gonna dot
that on my cheeks again oh I love that
it's like making my cheeks so elevated
so elevated mmm this one is so pretty
hmm so this is like way more like silver
with aegyo a cool undertone and this one
is like hmm
Oh took my breath away that's too low
keep it slow on here I'm looking at my
monitor and I'm like huh and a little
goes a long way I'm like I don't even
see how you could use one of these in an
entire year unless that you can coat
your entire body with it
okay okay so on the cheeks this is like
easy amazing it was like bam bam one two
that was like the quickest thing I've
ever done I think I like this color more
I don't know which one which one do you
guys like more I think moonlight is so
pretty but celestial is like I don't
know I can't tell which I like more now
I think this side I don't know you guys
tell me what you think I think we need
to finish this look off with a lip of
course I think I'm gonna go in with more
pink because I can't get enough pinks
now Giorgio Armani just put out a new
little collection of lip maestro's these
are like lip paints and oh that Barbie
this Barbie one is like everything I'm
doing this one I don't care pink
Harappan guys pink lips if it's your
favorite color damn it put it on your
face oh I love that little applicator
love this little red packaging now let's
get to it huh
ah ah now I love this color it's
definitely getting kind of like streaky
at the top I don't know if this cuz the
highlighter was already on there but
just keep it real I'm like okay hmm
and he's not really supposed to dry down
I know they're supposed to be kind of
matte esque but this is more like a
gloss final results these are a hundred
percent officially jeffree star approved
I love this formula love the finish
these are everything yeah they really
are if you're like oh my god forty two
dollars too much it's okay go to Sephora
get a sample like they can definitely
give you guys sample just to try it and
if you love it and you're like okay I
really need this then go get it but I
definitely think they are worth trying
out we are in the age of being blinding
and these are I think going to be a new
staple in my look sometimes so this lip
on the other hand is like a 5 out of 10
it's like streaky kind of like a little
final touch working into a little touchy
Jewish skin mist and the makeup forever
mist and fix it's like come on glow and
setting at the same damn time
all right let's get to it oh I feel
alive again
okay and now what I usually do is I'm
gonna go enjoy the rest of my day it is
let's see here it is about 12 27 and I
am going to go get my car washed I am
going to go to the grocery store and
this full mother fucking beat and we
will see how this looks in like six to
eight hours alright see you guys a
little bit
nothing like three hours in traffic from
a destination to going home to a make
you want to die I'm Rotem I'm some lip
scrub girl now lipstick from earlier I'm
like what the fuck happened I'm gonna
take some of my own lip scrub we just
need to exfoliate really quick huh oh my
god that lip stuff like stay my lips
look at the lips crap wasn't even taking
it off huh
all right now back to the enhancer drops
now this has been off for about let's
check the time here about seven and a
half hours and I love it it really
didn't defuse it all I didn't like go
away or like diminish throughout the day
think nothing's like a tiny bit of
fading but overall I am a really big fan
of you so I can't wait to continue to
use them and hopefully they expand the
shades if there's like a baby pink metal
chrome like my nails that they want to
put out I will die for that but uh
