and welcome back to my channel that in
today's video we're what's up guys so as
you can see I have no tattoos men and
Nicole just transformed my entire life
into a very androgynous looking boy and
I've never just so you know I've never
covered all my tattoos before oh my god
hey pop your cherry really did ya come
for cherry my hymens been gone a great
we have a picnic here again and she is
back for the third installment of the
androgyny palate transformation and of
course we did use this today for this
very soft boy type of androgyny look
Nicole even went so far as to do lace
front brows are crazy when we saw we
went to Nigel's and we were like I
wanted to be different like really
realistic with the brows so we got like
movie quality lace for eyebrows and it
looks a little oh no real so if you
haven't seen one of the pictures from
the androgyny campaign we are recreating
it today so yeah like we're gonna pop it
up right here
BAM and as you guys can see I do have a
shade head which of course is the magic
of photography today we could not
recreate that hair because momma spent
too much on the hairline and shave it
but we didn't want to recreate the look
with the tattoos covered and exact
makeup that she did on set I can't
believe we're only a week away from the
palette finally coming out in a week I'm
like excited by using birth to a child
I'm like oh my god finally here it's
been cooking the oven oh yes so March
4th the interaction of house finally
your release give it guys can all get
your hands on it and I mean I don't
think I'm going to be recording this
slow because it but if you do but all
right we're about to jump into the
transformation and first we are going to
cover all of the tattoos and then jump
into the soft beauty and brows so of
course um if you want to see how we did
all this and keep on watching
alright homegirls looking a little rough
but whereabouts it will not we nicole is
about to cover all of my tattoos and I
found this new way what do you usually
use so I honestly matter to me ladies as
long as it's orange it's an orange cream
or liquid I just need a color correct
I'm used weird Chevy's live a bit in a
hurry later so it just it also doesn't
matter that is better to try this yeah
so I just found this from Lancome it is
called the Oh God tint I do live
stripper wear camouflage corrector so
for everyone at home that doesn't know
or has never covered a tattoo why do we
color crack it's all just all about
basically canceling color so if you look
at the color wheel orange is the
opposite of blue so that's what we're
going to use to color out blue and most
tattoo ink is a blueish undertone and I
have all black and gray portrait exactly
so that make it easy I know no yellow
the greens or anything crazy I'm only
over here a little bit
oh right and it never can attach to
cover before this is how it's really
done
so you notice I'm only covering the
parts that are dark blue or black with
the black no Matthew why yeah I'm not
because this obviously is a slush so I'm
not trying to color correct anything
there there's no color to correct so I'm
really only focusing on these dark parts
so that's why you'll see me leave little
little patches right so how's it working
out it's working good I like the color
yeah it's really nice it's full coverage
that will really be able to tell when I
do the next step after I powdered okay
we're with the light one okay cool so
this is full well it is suitable to
manage full coverage
oh shit what a girl have an exorcism
Arabic if anyone's wondering what's
going on down there
alright so she's feelin she still muddy
feel my name the next not for long
we're going to go into crawlin
anti-shine father you can use any
translucent powder
I wouldn't use like your mice laura
mercier or something I would just use
like a banana
yeah like something that's like cheese
that you can just we're literally just
using it to set this is just amazing
that it's very thin so it's not going to
build up a lot okay you're going to see
me just set this entire layer we're
ready that was brightening layers this
was a middle layer so first is color
correction then it's brightening and
then it's matching you so this is the
Makeup Forever HD foundation total
coverage enough this will kind of
slushie
so it's not really being on YouTube like
I love it we use it yeah I love it I
stuck all using my kit so it's number
110 grand I guess now it's our 220
because they reformulate it up so now
it's our 220 and it does have like that
still got reddish undertone to it so I
think it'll still help with the color
correcting because red and orange
they're kind of same family so it's
still going to help us in our color
correcting but brave
okay so now it's got my bright step down
this is like super white over together
coming together looking a little alien
II but now I'm going to set with powder
again and then on top of that we'll go
in with your shade cool okay so now is
my last step I'm going to go in and put
your color down I'm gonna mix the Y 225
and wide to 15 from the HD sticks it's a
little bit thicker and it means it's all
over the room and ticket all over your
face also okay yes we're getting there
so I've been tweeting while we've been
doing this and someone said open up your
snapchat CMS sure you shady hoarders
you
hey laughter oh it's looking really real
freaking me out
okay so I want to do a layer of powder
and then if we need a little bit more
coverage anywhere we can go in and like
spot treat but I don't think we're going
to need to do that but I'm grateful
named girl she's feeling hungry she's
been golden Oreos next I'm going to go
in now with a little bit of this Tom
Ford bronzer and just like contour this
body a little bit I'm going to use your
one angled brush from Mac all right okay
so we're gonna smell weird but we
honestly got foundation on me nipples so
I'm going to take it up then we're going
to fill them in with some Rose madder
liquid lips yes which we did on set we
water the androgyny beauty campaign so
every screen with your dark
let's get our shot and then to be
obviously way too dark but Rose madder
which makes it perfect
we're getting a hard oh-ah many the
stronger it is we got to the nipples yes
I mean are you living oh my god it looks
so sick painting our nipples with a
little Cosette brush right now really
remember baby nipple they're like
summer's eve my nipples are so tiny turn
on TV there's been really really no
there's like a afterthought my mom
uterus
oh we forgot like no we're laws I want a
day whoever got a nipple oh okay so now
we're going to highlight just as color
goes when you teach got it come on peach
now that's not like those lizards rise
and nipples are clearly real totally
alright remove the face and we're going
to go in with a little Sicily double
sincere
I never say was right but it's the best
primer on earth currently that I'm using
it just makes the skin so turning the
foundation we're going to do the same
ones that we've been using today all
over the body just so everything blends
in
alright we're about to do that's that
your under-eyes
so it'll lemare the powder the best
under eye and space setting powder I
think I'm tried in a long time
Lord okay so we go back in with the Tom
Ford bronzer and just bronze a little
bit we're going for like a very
minimalistic look here's like super
masks so I want to give like a realistic
but so contoured bronze so what about to
do now we're going to glue your brows on
so where you got one on and I'm using
spirit gum so I'm just gonna take a
little bit of the spirit gum
now what spiritum for everyone at home
and is like what the hell is that here
comes an adhesive you probably you could
find it at like a local Halloween store
during Halloween time but here in LA we
have it at all of our like major makeup
supply stores any drugs men Liz yeah you
can glue eyebrows down with it you can
glue prosthetics on and yo dildos and me
Nicole actually went to a place where
you get prosthetics and stuff for movies
and we have your lace front browse and
we died we died it and this was your
first time really putting them on I
haven't had a real browsers and grades
so I'm clearly and it looks sick I mean
it looks different so in the crease I'm
gonna take a little bit of safe word on

saying it is very very simple little
morphe brush this is a more feet are 38

bit of the fan brush and I'm just going
to keep it across Jeffrey's cheek them
all right now we're going to dip in a
peach cottage and you hold it at each
gotta create one highlighters never
never employ my life like that so before
we do lashes I'm going to take a little
bit of this it's called at use and a
brow gel okay oracy music like root
touch-up it's mostly used in like film
and TV so it's like not like a popular
brand but I get to mess my lips movie
makeup store or like my kit I'm going to
take a little bit of that one of the
blondest one and a taupe one I'm going
to cocktail those and we're going to use
this almost as like a mascara
all right enter lashes I'm going to use
these are dull brown demi whispies never

before you're so pretty but you have to
have light hair obviously but we
lightened here your eyelashes so it

hurt honestly giggles man now I'll go
like with a bunch of makeup on I love it
and like hunters had vaginal
rejuvenation again I'm looking in the
monitor you guys and I just can't get
over it like when we were on set
shooting this androgyny campaign and
Nicole covered my tattoos we didn't
really take it this far we did not we
just went like the Z cuz I was a suit
jacket yeah and I also didn't really get
to live in the look like we talked about
before
yeah it was like a kid we did it notice
the first well that was the very first
money I'll be like old servant to play
and then we just had to wipe it all up
yeah and quickly and we transition into
the crazy drama Monday you guys all saw
earlier this last few weeks but what do
you think was the most difficult about
this job and is living a challenge but
like this crazy journey
well succes brings always a journey Lea
always kind of a challenge because a lot
of stuff it's a lot of stuff and
especially like in all the crevices and
stuff like you have set in so many
layers and we're like the joints where
they moved so yeah that was probably
like the hardest part but I mean it
helps that we're just kind of like here
