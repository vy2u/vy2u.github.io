channel hi how are ya in today's video
we're going to dive in just something
that is going by roll all over the
Internet
girl if I get one more tweet about the
Crayola Beauty collection I'm gonna come
out this damn camera and bite you the
day we are gonna be testing out this
collection we have it all here now if
you haven't heard of this you may be
busy taking care of your kids or blowing
your husband but I will tell you this
this has never been tweeted as much
as like oh girl don't drop it this has
been sent to me all week I have this
overnighted and then you know what
happened the other day you guys when it
got here
the jet lag hit me you know I was in
Europe last week I am still 10 hours
ahead mentally so girl I'm finally able
to sit down get some energy
besides this review I have been working
hard of course on as so many brand new
collections first of all the thirsty
collection launches June 16 where she a
girl BAM of course this in my entire
summer collection launches on June 16th
at 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time alright
shameless plug
over but also the jeffree star cosmetics
concealer it's coming this year so
saddle up alright you guys so let's dive
into this review I have no idea what to
expect but if you want to see this
debauchery go down then keep on watching
alright so if you have been watching my
channel all year you may be having a
moment of like no when I first saw the
press pictures for this collection I was
like wait a minute
now in February I reviewed this bad boy
the box of crayons palette now this
eyeshadow palette went viral on its own
and so many of you requested me to
review this now I actually lived for
this palette I'll link this video
actually down below it's almost like 4
million views and so many of you lived
and breathed for this palette I know a
lot of you have bought in it and this
brand is actually really cool I love
their creativity so when I saw this I
was like hmm now obviously this brand
was inspired by Kranz first of all I
know y'all gonna read me crayon or
crayon we all come from different parts
of the world I always just say what's up
crayon and if you don't like that I'm
sorry so if you guys remember or did not
watch this video let me give you a quick
recap this brand of course was inspired
by crayons they actually owned the
trademark for this now I had to do a
little google search on everything
because I was a little confused there
has been a little conspiracy going
around the internet that because this
was such a huge seller months ago that
the brand Crayola was like hmm we need
to come in the game and kind of do our
own thing now I don't know if that's
true is it a myth is it a rumor is that
reality I have no idea you'd have to ask
the CEO of Crayola but I have to do some
quick googling searches because I was
confused of what things were so a crayon
is a pencil or stick of colored chalk or
wax used for drawing obviously we know
that but I wasn't sure if Crayola owned
the word crayon they actually don't so
when you go to search for trademarks now
you can look up anyone's trademark from
any brand and see what they own so if
you look up jeffree star cosmetics on a
trademark site you will see I own the
words androgyny Beauty killer skin frost
so if anyone else tried to use those
words for makeup or fashion I could sue
them which I have done before in one so
anyway the box of crayons palette is
trademarked by the owner of course of
this brand and the crayon case which is
the name of the brand is also a
registered trademark so they do have
their business in order now Crayola of
course itself is a registered trademark
and they have teamed up with of course
the brand ASOS is ASOS allowed to be
called a brand it's a big fashion
website that a lot of influencers buy or
get free clothes from and a lot of
people shop on there I personally have
never been on there but I broke my
virginity because I had this collection
overnighted to my house of course and I
bought a lot of these staples now when I
looked at the packaging I thought it was
kind of cute let's be honest this is
very reminiscent of my childhood I did
not grow up with iPads as a kid I grew
up with crayons markers and playing
hopscotch okay we did not have a
fortnight and I
blowing anyone yet or was I all right so
when I saw the packaging I was like okay
I'm gonna lie bitch it's cute we're
gonna go into it a little in-depth more
later but I have to smell this it's most
normal now we're gonna try it out I have
some we have a face palette so we're
gonna do contour highlight some eyes and
live that's what we're getting into
today people so to me this might be a
little overpriced okay now when I see
the packaging I'm like that's on its
underwhelming is it a Crayola staple of
course yes but it's not like it's mind
blowing this is literally a cheap box so
when I saw the price of this I was like
all right so this little guy is $24 I'm
like oh I just put Red Bull
everywhere
pause alright so these bad boys are also
I had bad luck the face palette is also
$24 and I think here is the blush one of
the blessed shades fell out okay there's
no pan in there so this is $24 oh wow
when you try to press it back in into
breaks and the mascara will retail for
about $13 so the prices aren't that
crazy but for how kind of like this
looks I mean this looks like kids makeup
does it not it should be a little
cheaper I think but I think they're
trying to put on the ASOS price tag and
I'm like honey slow it down okay so
we're gonna attempt to use this face
palette and they all look very shimmery
this looks like it's from Claire's does
it not we all take a breath of fresh air
here I'm like okay so this multitasking
palette includes ten shades a blusher
bronzer and highlighter the soft and
creamy powders create create a healthy
glow for every skin tone the talc free
formula is easy to blend and build to
help you sculpt brighten and contour it
says for adult use only even though it
looks like it's worth five year old it's
made in Italy this collection is cruelty
free vegan and they keep saying talk
free I don't mind that a lot of eye
shadows have talc and they blend this is
a Crayola official licensed product
quality guaranteed okay let's see if it
really works so we're gonna open up this
bad boy now obviously I have foundation
on concealer and
foundation powder that is it so we're
gonna take a little so we use this a
little big let's do this and we're gonna
bronze our faces now this is what we get
I think for bronzing this is very
shimmery to the touch one oh it's it
feels really soft oh wow
okay well we'll wait a minute here let
me let me swatch a few for y'all let's
see what we really think here there we
go and there we go
woah highlighters there's pigment y'all
there is mother Hey okay so we're gonna
take this Charlotte Tilbury brush we're
just gonna go right in here and let's
see
that's so weird how they chose to do it
like flat there's no names there's no
nothing it's just like a little like
kaleidoscope let's see what happens okay
I mean it showed up right away thank God
thank God
alright so we are bronzing up the
forehead the cheekbones and now a little
bit on the nose now I'm actually not mad
at this powder
I've definitely reviewed a lot worse no
is everything else can over let's see in
a second but so far so good all right
now the swatches are the highlighters
we're kind of like whoa living and
breathing for so we're gonna highlight
in a second why don't we do a little
blush okay we're gonna take this little
Seurat Beauty blush brush what am I
feeling today what am I wearing
oh wow this look a little dark for me
maybe well it's barely even though the
one that broke is a really pretty color
oh wow
there is pigment on that brush alright
that's pressing into my skin and oh wow
okay
it's there it's a little clown like let
me defuse it in a second
but maybe want a high-fashion look today
honey and Crayola what's good I could
have went a little less with that jesus
take the wheel okay now we're gonna do
the other side let's try the paint who
cares to color cheeks is like the new
thing bitch well this is a little more
softer I kind of lived for this one the
other one was really pigmented which we
all love on this channel we love a
pigment I always do this lipstick Nick
calls this veiling taking a little bit
of powder on a brush and just kind of
pushing the products together mixing the
bronzer and the blush together and just
me
I'm a family all right give me a
highlighting brush honey and we're gonna
go in with this little champagne and
rose golden moment let's do both let's
dip and dip oh wow bitch the fall out
though honey looks like Johnny Depp
snorting coke and blow like I can't ah
okay little better there we go
it looked more reflective on my hand not
gonna lie but this is cute if you're
someone that doesn't want to look like a
beacon or a lighthouse you may like this
okay it is buildable we aren't too bad
at it let's put them on the brow bone
what brow bitch what bro she has
a little bit of shine people to fall out
though I hate blowing like in videos
this much but girl who would that is
severe okay the highlighter works praise
Jesus
all right now I'm gonna dip into this
little gold shade and back and forth
we're just gonna go on the bridge of the
nose
oh okay like this poet ain't not
bad alright now let's move on to the
eyes okay now this is whatever one kept
telling me like Geoffrey you have to try
these pencils so the packaging looks
like this like a literal Crayola box and
now as a kid I loved crayons I love
drawing I loved just art in general I
was art obsessed now this is a
multitasking crayon for eyes lips and
cheeks okay with highly pigmented color
and an ultra creamy soft texture
alright so eyes lips and cheeks huh
that is interesting okay before we dive
to the eyes though I forgot we had one
more thing a Crayola Beauty has a
highlighter crayon shine a spotlight on
your skin this creamy textured and
easily blendable highlighter will give
you the ultimate radiance girl let's see
about that alright so this is what it
looks like oh wow it looks very like
something Pat McGrath did to be really
honest here okay let's see what this
looks like here very cream highlighter
and what I mean by that is like it looks
like a lot of stuff have tried this year
how does blinding as I would expect it
has a little bit of a sheen but it feels
very like
slick so I look if I put this over this
it's gonna like pull my foundation off
and we don't want that let's just do a
little right here okay there we go I'm
just gonna put on my channel might be a
little weird to everyone but hi maybe a
UFO will just land right at my chin
later so what does that even look like
honey let's take a peek here Oh what my
god
what the hell did I do you guys oh my
god okay I'm I'm insecure about this but
we're gonna zoom in on my chin it lid it
took the foundation off oh uh uh okay
now we're officially moving on to the
eyes this one where does this call this
is called the fate okay the face cran
this is shade marvelous now I have no
idea what to expect it looks like this
of course a real crayon and look like
I'm about to go coloring now I don't
know how much product is in there let's
look at the box it says zero point zero
seven ounces now okay when you turn this
let's see how much is actually in here
well okay that's a lot of product I'm
not mad at that whatsoever so let's do a
little hand test to see what the hell
we're getting ourselves into
oh wow it looks like a sheer satiny
lipstick to be really honest now it says
it's for the eyes cheeks and the mouth I
don't know what is about to happen but
let's put this on the lid and see what
happens and then we're gonna dive in to
the mermaid eye shadow palette which
looks like this it looks identical to
the face palette but of course with all
shadows and I guess the whole dick
shimmery to me there's no mattes but
we'll test if you guys will see what
what's gonna happen but first of all
let's take this let's try it on my lid
sturdy is a little bit of product that
came off right there this I don't know
about this grant I mean this is the hand
and that's the lid like how does it more
share my eye and how does it look at
that like that on my hand
I'm so confused okay I'm a little
confused you guys the eyelids are not
looking cute let me take this clean
brush
I think it's clean let's make sure yes
it is okay and let's pretend we're just
gonna like blend that out oh it still
feels like tacky like some just came off
on my finger I wonder if it dries like
okay let's move on and let's try to dive
into this guy I immediately want to go
right here and just go blue oh wow okay
so this has pygmy I don't know what's
going on here we're going to go back to
that in a second but this let's see if
it actually works on the I will just
tuck this into my crease here have a
little cotton candy fantasy we'll try
the other side in a minute but oh wow
okay okay as I start to blend out though
it is shearing out a little bit we're
just gonna take the brush and blend
upwards so we get a nice little airbrush
moment it's like the quality of this
shadow is not there like I'm hitting it
with my brush and I'm like cue work and
then as I blend it out it's just kind of
like alright
alright now I'm gonna get another brush
we're gonna apply the other eye that has
nothing on eyes there's no base and
let's go over here and let's dip into
let's do this little cyan blue color is
it gonna see I'm barely dipping in and
there's a lot of fall out not the end of
the world but and then I hit it once all
the products gone so I don't know if
it's the ingredients or what but let's
blend this out and actually just press
that on my lid
mm okay now let's go to this dark purple
shade see if we can get a little bit
more pigment over here okay so last year
I did a video testing out actual kids
makeup children's makeup and this is
very reminiscent of that like what in
the actual hell is going on with this
palette look at the streakiness this is
so weird I'm gonna tell my head back so
you guys can see what the actual hell
happened right here
okay we're gonna dip into let's try this
one you know I'm gonna try my finger
 it okay it's all my finger let's
press it on the lid okay is someone
playing a joke on me right now I
mean I feel like I'm going crazy I have
to grab something else to make sure my
lids aren't just flopping what if my
lids have no pigment today and I'm a
 idiot
okay we're gonna take the Breanna
highlighter let's just do this
hi okay am I going crazy does my skin
not want to take makeup today now this
was just sitting here I know I filmed it
that last week I still live and breathe
for these and you guys can see the huge
difference in quality of this which
isn't even a real eyeshadow but of
course Rihanna
and Priscilla oh no we're like honey
everything can be used for everything it
works great how do make sure I wasn't
going crazy because for a minute I'm
like am i hi I'm sober today what's
happening to me
okay this no all right now there's one
more I just want to make sure I'm not
going crazy lip and cheek crayon this is
only for show that's so weird
what does this one say I and this one
only says this is so bizarre I'm still
gonna just test it on my hand here oh
wow I mean you guys that is
sheer anyway what else do we have for
eyes looking at the table oh my god
mascara duh we showed this off in the
intro so there's black and blue there's
two colors we have turquoise blue and
black
alright let's dip in let's try this
until they're gonna work or it's not
that's really the only options here
people
you guys where's the box water-resistant
that gives volume and definition got it
how to make sure because I'm like not
really singing either here let's be fair
we're doing another dip got it BAM I
feel like the bottoms are a little
better than the top haha alright just to
make sure I'm not going crazy I'm gonna
pull out this little benefit for fun and
we're gonna do a little battle right
here and now people let's do it there's
a mascara dot on my skin usually mascara
dries that one water-resistant did not
dry so we're just gonna let that dry for
a second and then I'll show you guys a
good tip how to remove that so let's go
back over here Jesus today it's not my
day okay now this is how I like my
bottom mascara you can definitely see
the difference here's the Crayola side
and here's the benefit roller lash side
now whenever mascara bumps my skin I let
it dry and then I take a spoolie and you
can just kind of go like that and look
wallah it's gone yay okay yeah see the
difference with the mascara honey okay
guys we're going to move on from the eye
section and we have one more thing to
review now it is lips now I expected
this brand to have a liquid lip or a
stick lip formula I'm looking on the
website here and that does not exist but
there is a customizable lip palette now
remember these are supposed to be for
lip and cheek as well but I was
expecting like a full pigmented lipstick
thing there is a customizable lip
palette now when I saw this I was like
ah Nastasia Beverly Hills what's
happening honey this is very reminiscent
of the lip art palette not reminiscent
identical now when I opened this this
little card came out maybe business for
mixing or scooping out product I am Not
sure I am NOT gonna be mixing products
today I am just going
dive in like this and we're just gonna
see for fun if this has pigment alright
so I got me a lip brush right here now
of course all these are supposed to be
are melted down lipsticks in a pan but
oh wow actually looks like it has some
color ah oh wow
okay maybe there's a happy ending to
this feeling a little gummy see you like
kind of flaking off a little bit it
started off really good at that first
swatch and now it's turning into like
I'm putting on Halloween makeup a little
bit weird it's a very flaky like I'm not
living for the formula action I'm like I
started to get excited and then I
started to apply more uh-huh all right
you guys this is what's happening with
the lips today this is such a weird
formula what is this okay I think this
is as good as it's gonna get I think I'm
about to perform in the circus girl I
really do okay just for shits and
giggles I gotta touch this white one
this is like a mixer but I guess want to
go right here I like mm-hmm got to get
my mouth some redemption here okay
oh wow what's up all right I'm ready to
dive into my final thoughts now I was
planning on setting this face but I
don't want to keep it on all night I
don't want to keep this on much longer
alright so let's dive in I will say this
let's start with the positive there was
a few moments that I actually was like
you know what guys this is cool and that
would be the face palette now the bronze
are in the highlighter minus the
packaging flaws and the blush falling
out I over all liked it I think the
bronzer was cute at first I was like
what is about to happen but it turned
out really nice I would wear this on the
daily the highlighter is very cute it's
a little sheer for my liking but I like
the way it looks when I'm moving my skin
my skin mm-hmm
when I'm moving my face I'm like how it
looks it looks really pretty love this
love it all no I don't look at all
that's a lie but I did love this moment
I think this is probably the only
product from the collection that is cute
no everything else you guys just saw
what happened let's keep it really real
with each other this I over here until
Fenty was on the lids it was a flop a
girl this
Scranton was not cute I don't know what
kind of blush this brand was thinking
was gonna happen here not today
now the mermaid eyeshadow palette girl
what the hell I don't know if the
formula is different than the face
palette or maybe these are just really
sheer not supposed to be like on the
like high-end side I'm I mean for the
price point $24 I expected some pigment
and the packaging says for adults only
so insert joke here this was a flop for
me I'm looking the monitor like got it
this was a flop for me now moving on
this lip I feel like I'm in like I'm
playing in like old like my grandma's
makeup like it feels a little a little
play-doh we I'm not living for it at all
the idea was there it could have been
cute but flop is the Crayola beauty
collection jeffree star approved after I
applied the mascara and saw it looking
pitiful it was a no for me the entire
collection I think the idea was cute I
still can't get over this happening was
Crayola like wow this company is having
a crayon moment and now we want to have
our moment and try to enter the beauty
world it the timing in the same year is
a little off for me and it's a little
weird so I have no idea but overall the
packaging it feels kind of cheap it does
look nostalgic and kind of cute almost
like a Nickelodeon moment but then the
formula I can't do it so without further
ado I am going to go take this all off
please pray for me because this was a no
for me all right you guys thank you so
much for watching today's video
this is how I'm feeling right now
like imagine this is a really pigmented
lipstick it would be a disaster it's
like already I can't like probably wipe
it into my skin and it would be
evaporated okay I love you guys on to
the next one
mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
