kind of like a part two from my last
video I showed you guys how I got this
crazy airbrush Barbie like skin and then
I thought well we got a you know finish
the look I asked you all in my what's in
my bag video if you wanted to see the
recreated look everyone was like hi you
better do that so of course here we are
now today I'm going to be showing you
how to get this kind of like Barbie doll
ask little cut crease full glam a moment
with bitchy winged liner and a really
bright lip and of course highlight
highlight highlighted everywhere so if
you want to see how I did the full
foundation and then doing this click the
video before this one and if you want to
see how I completed the look then keep
on watching alright so before we get
started on the full makeup Oh
ready the brows first
Brow's are on now let's get started with
this look to get this smoky cut crease
little type of barbie moment that we are
trying to achieve today i am going to be
using my Kat Von D shade + light eye
palette now we're basically going to use
all shadows from this palette today I
love this it's perfect as every neutral
shade you could possibly want for a
quick little easy look nothing is quick
and easy about this look but you know
the drill so we are going to take a
little flat blending brush my trusty Mac
- 5 - as usual and we're going to be
dipping into this white color right here
now these are really pigmented so you
don't need to use a lot and I am just
going to Pat this under my entire brow
bone and we're gonna let that sit for a
minute we're almost gonna be baking
under the brows if you will now if you
notice how I'm doing these little
patting motions I'm basically pressing
the powder into my skin that is gonna be
like the best way to get that brow
highlight to never come off during the
entire day we got that Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer in shade and nigma and
this is the cool one because it's like a
neutral nude matte type of base so I'm
just going to whip it out and apply now
I like this because it's a really
neutral look so my lids have any
darkness or redness it gets canceled out
which is nice I'm gonna use the same
brush and dab that primer all over the
lid there we go
cool so now the lids are primed and I'm
gonna go back in with that white shade
again and put this on top of the primer
so it's like really going to stand out
oh yes now a key essential part of this
look is giving your lids a lot of space
so I'm going to take this and already
I'm gonna drag it all the way down so
let me turn my face a little and we're
gonna bring this all the way in there
right there and that is gonna be blank
during this entire look and then we'll
drag out the white and we'll bring it
all the way out alright now it's time to
start creating our wing
alright now let's start carving out that
okay now I'm gonna do mine a little
higher than normal because I want to
create a really big dramatic type of
like smoky wing so I'm going to be
taking this morphe 5 1 4 brush I love
this little detail err and we're going
to be dipping into this like reddish
just like a warm tone Brown as like a
red base to it I love this guy and we're
just gonna coat our entire bristles with
this so I'm gonna go a little higher
than normal and I'm gonna sketch out my
own lid which is going to be really
delicate so you don't want to go too
heavy hat and you want to be really
light with this one and I'm going to
bring that all the way and because we
want to create a really dramatic effect
today so I'll start to soften it and you
can see how I'm bringing it already down
here so you're gonna be really careful
and then I'm going to start flicking my
wrist and dragging this up a little bit
so it gives it the illusion of it art
being blended out I'm gonna follow and
go down a little bit and out almost like
a little I'm gonna drag it all the way
to my brow and that's how we start and
build out our socket now to get the
upper part really airbrushed I'm just
going to take a blending brush and I'm
gonna be using this transition color
right here and I'm going to be mixing it
back in with that Brown so we get a
really nice airbrushed effect for the
sockets I'm just going to go over what I
did a little bit and just start dragging
up so it's really nice and soft and then
you can go in with your blending brush
and I love to just dab right back in
that really white one and we're just
gonna take it under the eye and we're
just gonna drag out like so so it's
really carve and then we're actually
gonna go back and you guys and go just
on the top again so we really soften
those lines look has a lot of
back-and-forth now it's time for a black
winged liner you guys ready for that I
don't even know if I'm ready for that so
to get inspired for this
crazy liner who if you've only had like
a bag of chips in a Red Bull today and
you've just been filming and having fun
time to eat thank God for medical
marijuana let's get started alright so
for today's bitchy kunti wing liner I'm
going to be using the YSL babydoll liner
in black now I love this guy because the
Bristol on the end oh it is so thin you
see that like tiny to accentuate the
wing and fill in any missing little
spots that the liquid does not do I'm
going to be using the Tarte claypot
black liner this stuff is magic I love
this I can wear makeup for 10 hours of
my wing is still fully key and now I'm
going to shut my mouth hold my breath
and get to winging alright now that my
liner is done I am ready to finish this
look now if your liner does not look
like it's ready to apply to be a
guillotine you better go over it some
more
ching ching ching alright let's finish
this we're gonna go back to this little
blending brush and we're just gonna dip
right in there with a little bit of this
one and we're just gonna go right under
the eyes and be really soft and we're
just gonna go back and forth really
lightly and start to create that little
smokiness and you don't got to take it
all the way in because we are gonna add
some glitter in a second and then I'm
going to bring it to where the wing
starts now the bottom should be really
smoked out now we're going to really
accentuate the eyes and do some white
doll-like liner in the water length so
if you really want to look plastic and
artificial I mean hi that was my goal
since birth you are just going to get
some white liner of your choice and
we're just gonna pop that into the
waterline and I'm going to really go in
on this and even put it right
there and then we're going to drag the
liner all the way across and I'm going
back and forth several times so the
color is up in and then we're gonna take
the liner and we're just gonna bring it
down a little
hello eyes now if you don't look like an
alien sex doll you got to do some more
okay so now that the liner is done I
think I need a little bit of glitter you
guys know you don't have to do glitter
for this part actually love how this
looks but because it's Jeffrey star
we're gonna do some more glitter now
this is a brand
I love makes really dope glitter called
lit cosmetics they specialize in just
glitter and this shade is called
champagne wishes it is so pretty
it's like a champagne nude with rainbow
glitter it's really dope so I am going
to try this glitter glue from Too Faced
today I always use my violet Voss but
I'm gonna cheat on them today and I'm
gonna try this one I'm just gonna use a
little domi one from morphe this is the
g18 and I'm just gonna go BAM and call
it a day so this is just for the inner
corners to give it that little pretty
soft look but some glitter glue on the
brush and I'm just gonna brush it right
where I want the glitter no before that
dries you want to get your glitter and
you guys know I love to just pour this
on the cap so I already have some ready
to go easy access and then I'm just
gonna take the glitter on the brush and
just put it right over there now you
want to make sure they both match so I'm
just gonna do it a little bit of cleanup
and if you get you fall out or sparkle
on your face you can brush it off I
would leave it I mean any extra shine I
could ever get I'm so down for all right
so the glitter is drying on there and it
will basically be on there until you
shower tomorrow so now that the glitter
is done let's get some lashes on from
mascara today want my lashes to be
really black so I can do some big
falsies a day I'm gonna be using that
Chanel mascara this is called noir black
and let's give it a whirl
all right now four lashes today I'm
gonna be using
hooda beauties scarlet lashes these are
amazing I wore these in the Birkin bag
video and oh I love the way they just
made everything so like sensual and sexy
I don't know what a lash can do but
mm-hmm so I already had a pair of these
from that video cut and ready but I just
went downstairs and the housekeeper's
vacuumed up the lashes so I'm going to
cut and measure and repair so I'll be
right back alright guys I am really
excited because today I am using a new
lash glue I'm really excited
why because y'all know my issue with
lash glue so I am trying the S sceeto
sceeto sceeto lash glue now I saw a lot
of good reviews on this one it's
latex-free it does not smell like
Lobster feisty
let's give it a smell it's just very
like really neutral like don't really
think much about it it's not bad at all
and hi the packaging is a really cute
wait easier than that squeeze tube and
let's get our lash and let's get to
gluing now because my corners tend to
come up I'm going to add a little bit
extra over there now I am going to give
this a minute to get tacky like 30
seconds give it a little wave speed up
the process alright now what I am going
to see if these glue down just doing a
little walkthrough doing a little check
lashes are fully on a skiddo lash glue
thank you god this is a a plus review
for me I love these lashes they just
make me feel so like dainty and pretty
makes you want to like fuck all your
brother's friends in high school and
just have a whirl alright now let's get
down to the last final step the lips I'm
going to be doing a little Barbie
inspired ombre I'm going to be using the
new on the stop stab liquid lip and
shade
reowww and my own velour liquid lipstick
and shape queen supreme so let's get to
it
just going to put the hotter pink shade
on the outsides of my lip and then we're
going to put the baby pink in the center
all right now we're just gonna put queen
supreme in the center and i'm actually
going to use a little eye shadow brush
to help ombre and blend that out and an
easy little solution is to use your
middle finger and just kind of blend in
any harsh lines and then for a little
more definition I like to go in with the
hot pink color one more time on that
brush just get a little bit of product
and then you can kind of add in a little
bit more darkness alright the lips are
dry now I know I said lips was the last
thing and if you saw part 1 of this
video on how to get Barbie skin you saw
how much highlight I applied like oh
damn we put a lot on but I'm like I
can't leave this video without doing
another highlight I'm sorry so we're
gonna go back in with the nude gold
highlighter from Burberry and we're just
gonna just on a little bit more and let
everyone know hi we're here am o vicious
I do need to find a setting spray over
here and I'm going to go into my makeup
forever mist and fix spray we're gonna
keep that dewy skin and let's just give
my face of a blast ah if you don't feel
like you're taking a shower
keep on spraying alright so the look is
finished I am loving it you know how to
throw a wig on this bald ass hair and I
love the peachy coral tones with this
like warm neutral eye yes now you didn't
have to do a pink lip for this you can
do brown lip liner with the nude you can
do red any lip on us that would work for
this even blue green or yellow so
recreate this look if you want give it a
whirl it took a little bit of time a lot
of patience and a lot of marijuana
we got through it and I have a question
