did I bring enough glamour and glitz for
this week I thought I'd spice it up and
do something a little different
something that I haven't personally done
in a while I feel like sometimes I get
stuck in a rut and I do my same makeup
over and over so I'm definitely
experimenting and trying new things and
going back to some of my old habits now
this week me and Nathan have finally
moved into our new home we're settling
down the dogs are obsessed like I need
to do a dog video and let you guys know
what diva diamond and delicious do on
the daily because them hoes are crazy
now for this video I changed up my
primer and my foundation routine a
little bit now you guys know I did a
video on my main face routine but I
thought I would change it up this week
try something new it is 2016 high art
saddle up get some lip liner and I hope
you enjoy this look alright let's get
started so after meeting nikkietutorials
she raved and ranted about that Nivea
men post shave balm and since then it
has exploded all over the internet so
obviously you know I got a try if Nicki
said that's amazing now I don't know how
much to use so I'm just gonna use a
little bit at first
I've seen her uses several times and she
says just to keep on blending until like
it's tacky get a little bit on the ears
my ears it's starting to get tacky and
that was the only thing tacky about
myself is this moisturizer you guys know
I am hooked and obsessed with that Dior
air flash this is my go-to now if you
want to see how I normally do my
foundation you can go back to my face
routine video but today instead of our
money I'm going to be mixing in this
raceless perfecting foundation from Tom
Ford it's really lightweight but it just
looks so mannequin like and we're just
going to spray
and I'm just going to take this
Foundation and we'll do a few pumps on
the top of that and then I'm just gonna
dot it all around now let's blend
now don't forget those ears and yes
ma'am I do need a haircut y'all hair is
growing out of control I usually don't
do under eye concealer but I want a
really dramatic look today so I'm gonna
be going in with the Urban Decay Naked
skin concealer now I have seen
Jacqueline Hale use this a million times
and she's like why don't you try this
niche so let's try it today I am shade
fair I'm just gonna put this under my
eye and like an upside down triangle
anyone else like a smaller Foundation
and concealer or am i the only weird one
I'm like mmm yummy let's have a little
highlight on that chin have a nose
moment boom once again we're going to
take the damp Beauty Blender and we're
just going to start buffing and blending
now I like to take the back of the
Beauty Blender and do larger areas and
I'm gonna just kind of squish the Beauty
Blender together and just lightly go
down the nose now I'm going to go in
with my favorite Tom for 2:05 powder
brush and I'm going to be avoiding under
the eyes and where I'm about to put my
contour color but I am going to take my
Mac Studio Fix in shade nw20
and I'm just going to dust this all
around my face now if you're asking why
aren't that bitch just put powder over
some of the concealer the concealer is
light enough where I can still see it it
still shines through because we are not
done brightening now if I highlight I'm
going to go in with my trusty Mac
Shivering white Studio Fix this is my
favorite and I love applying it with the
damp Beauty Blender the powder literally
melts onto your skin
all right now for contour I just got the
new more feet contour kit now I have
never used these before hi these pant
sizes are amazing what we going to go in
with this guy may be this one and I'm
going to be using the morphe 5 to 7
brush and I'm just going to take this
and fall out my natural contour line oh
hello
pigment damn morphe okay the
pigmentation and quality on this palette
is sickening now if you ever want to
shear down your contour you can always
take your powder brush and go over a
hair I'm just going to go along the
sides of my face real quick carve out
that chin buff out that forehead morphe
gave me this new nose contour brush to
try the other day this is the e47 and
when i saw it i was all hmm but they go
it's perfect for the nose it blends
amazing so let's try it now knowing how
pigmented these are I am definitely
going to be sparse just dip into it once
okay and let's see what happens just
bring it in to my eyebrow bone structure
I'm also going to bring the shadow down
so it caps off my nose now I'm going to
take my Beauty Blender again and just
lightly buff this out all right now I'm
going to do my signature taupey brown
eyebrows off-camera if you want to see
how I draw them on go through my channel
and find my previous face routine video
and I'll be right back alright let's get
started on the eyes now I'm going to be
using a light shadow from brow all the
way to lid as I normally do today I'm
going to be using the tartlet palette
and I love this shade right here called
Super Mom so let's dip into that one and
I'm going to be using my trusty Mac 2 v
2 brush as always now I love to pack
this in so don't just swipe it around
your eyes like really pack in that color
now since I'm going to be doing my whole
entire lid covered in rainbow glitter I
definitely need a transition color so
I'm going to be using the melt cosmetics
Dark Matter stack and this first color I
died it's called blur and I'm just going
to be placing that in my crease and I'm
gonna be using a Mac two to four
blending brush and we're just gonna dip
into this one and I'm just going to kind
of create aura around my eye and just
really get into that crease now I don't
want it too dark so I'm just going to
lightly blend avoiding my lid area and
I'm going to bring that down just where
my contour ended before and I'm just
dragging it out past my eye now I do
want to add a little bit more depth into
that crease so I'm going to be taking
the color right below it which is called
unseen and I'm just going to do a little
bit more more towards the middle so I
have more of a depth and you know more
definition come through transition color
okay and I'm going to put it a little
bit on my lid right by the lashline but
just on the outer corner all right now
before I coat my entire lids with
glitter I do need a color to put down
before that and I'm gonna be using this
purple metal crush eyeshadow from Kat
Von D this color is called
Danzig and it's so pretty I'm going to
dip my morphe 433 eyeshadow brush in
this completely I want it to be coated
as does not have to be perfect this is
just more so so the glitter has
something to be on top of now what I
really like about these eyeshadows is if
you wet them which I'm going to take
this mac fix+
the shadows go on really crazy metallic
and I'm just gonna tuck that in my lid
now I'm noticing that there's some
fallout so to save myself from screaming
later let's apply some Chanelle loose
powder under my eyes to catch that
fallout which we will brush out later
inky this part is not out to be perfect
now if you've never baked before just
type in baking makeup and you'll find a
million things all right we're gonna
buff that out in a minute after I'm done
with my eyes and we'll make all this
blend seamlessly all right now let's go
back with the Danzig purple eye shadow
and let's blend it out now I'm going to
take this all the way in to my socket
and drag it down just a tiny hair Bowl
on it look at that shine now that the
purple is laid down I'm going to be
taking another Mac two to four and I'm
gonna dip into that purple really
lightly knock off the fallout and I'm
gonna go in and just start blending the
purple up a little bit just so it looks
a little softer or not so harsh nothing
crazy just a soft blend I do want to
keep it harsh in here so I'm not gonna
buff that out too much all right now I'm
gonna take the mac 135 brush and I'm
just going to dust off that fallout with
the loose powder I found this old
graftobian makeup liquid sparkler now
this literally is like liquid glitter it
doesn't show up opaque enough for me but
it's definitely a good base and I'm just
going to take this and paint it oh hi
sparkles over my lid now before it dries
I'm going to take a sigma e 5/7 flat
brush and I'm just gonna take some abbis
glitter and press it onto the brush I'm
just gonna press some on the lid oh wow
hi I look like a party favor and I'm
just going to tuck this in myself gay it
looks like a unicorn just threw up on my
eye okay because I'm glitter obsessed
I'm gonna bring it down a little bit on
that purple there we go
oh all right now I want my eyes to look
extra dramatic today I'm going to be
using the Mac fascinating white eye
pencil and I'm going to just put this on
my waterline before I do any more
glitter or shadows because I want my
eyes to all alright I really want more
glitter on my eyes and I'm gonna be
layering a pigment down below
I found this color pop eyeshadow it's
called Ibiza
it's like turquoise glitter would it be
going in with this Tom Ford 14 eyes
shadow brush and I'm just gonna dip in
there lightly put it under that white
color and right on that purple so they
merged together see them kissing and
making out right there
and I was taking a Beauty Blender and
I'm kind of softening the edges a little
more alright now for the center of my
lid I'm going to really coat it with
glitter I'm gonna go back in with that
graftobian glitter glam and I'm gonna
leave some of the turquoise showing so
it can have a little moment but I'm
gonna cover most of it I'm gonna go in
with this Mac 3d glitter in lavender and
go back with the same Sigma brush now
this is like a more fine version of that
thick glitter we just used and I'm just
gonna press it on oh wow
and then I'm gonna slowly start dragging
it a little down now you guys know I
love to cry glitter that is my favorite
thing to do so I'm just layering and
packing on more and more glitter and
just lightly dragging it down now of
course these two sides do not have to
match is no one cries perfectly if you
do you're a good actress ho for mascara
I'm gonna go in with my new favorite
benefit roller lash I have been hooked
on this ever since I tried it now I
always put on mascara before lashes some
people don't
I mean your real hair will never be as
dark as this black mascara no sometimes
for bottom I want them really thick and
quick I'm gonna go in with a tremble
scandal eye mascara just for the bottom
I love the way it feels and it never
gets on my
GUP or transfers so hi come to Remmel
For Lashes I wanted something really
bold and really big so I found these
flutter lashes and the style is called
kamila when I saw these I was like oh hi
now I love to take the duo glue and I
put it right on the lash line since I'm
just doing this on myself and then I'm
gonna sit for a second wave it around
one lash is down now you guys know I'm
not about to do the second one without a
little bit of assistance um Nathan will
be doing my makeup soon so pack it ready
alright let's get down to business it's
time for the second lash
now that the lashes are finally done
it's time for my favorite part of the
face highlighting this is the do your
skin new tear glowing garden's glowing
pink so I'm gonna be using a morphe
five-10 brush you guys know this is my
favorite for highlighting and right
above my contour I'm just going to buff
some of this in and I'm gonna take some
actually right under the brow bone if
you forget the Cupid's bow I'm gonna
come to that screen and slap you and
really you got to do the nose extreme on
this look because this is like cyborg
unicorn realness today I'll be using my
own below or liquid lipstick and this is
in shade weirdo I think my favorite part
about watching this is watching again
matte black
and the lips are now drying matte-black
um I know a lot of people have been
wondering when this is coming back in
stock it would be hopefully end of
February or sooner so be on the lookout
promise a lot more is coming now the
final touches are the Urban Decay all
nighter all right this completes the
look we're done all right this is the
final look I hope you like it I got a
lot of requests to do something Goffe
and glam if you're too scared to try a
black lipstick try something maybe a
little lighter maybe a dark purple but
try something a little different
get out of your normal routine and maybe
spice it up sometimes we get stuck in a
red and we tend to do the same makeup
looks for a long period of time so break
it up try something new alter this
version and hashtag jeffree star
cosmetics or snapchat me any luck that
you recreate I would love to see you
guys do something fun and I will see you
on the next one bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
