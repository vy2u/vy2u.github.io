channel I'm sure most of you have
already heard the really sad news that
David Bowie has recently passed away I
wanted to do this look because David
Bowie paved the way for men in makeup he
created this character called Ziggy
Stardust in the 70s when guys were not
wearing makeup
androgyny was not on anyone's radar and
he brought it to the forefront and he
paved the way for people like me he was
one of the first males to ever wear a
full mask of makeup with no given
he did not care what anyone thought back
then he was fearless he is an icon and
he's an inspiration to so many people
like me so I wanted to dedicate this
look to him and I wanted to recreate one
of his most famous makeup looks ever and
for all the David Bowie fans out there I
hope I did him justice um and thank you
guys so much so enjoy watching all right
let's get started so after doing a lot
of research on David Bowie in the 70s I
found out that he did not wear
foundation
he had amazing really pale skin and
would wear moisturizers and you're a
decid stuff but he would never wear a
full mask like I do um so I'm gonna
tailor this look slightly more towards
what I wear but do his full looks so I'm
gonna be wearing foundation today I'm
gonna be priming my skin with a Becca
backlight priming filter I love this
stuff you can wear it by itself if you
want to this is going to give us that
luminescent feel under our foundation
okay now since Bowie was a little paler
than me I'm gonna mix two foundations
I'm going to be using both of the at
blending foundations one in shade 42
light and one in shade 46 light so I'm
going to mix and match these and of
course today we are going to be using
our Beauty Blender that has already been
pre ruined I'd be doing the outsides of
my face darker and the insides
or so let me start buffing this in now
I'm going to take a darker shade and
start blending that out now I'm going to
be taking two shades at Studio Fix I'm
gonna go back to my normal color which
is nw20 and then I'm going to dip into
the Shivering white Studio Fix so I'm
going to be using both of these to do
now for the center of my face I'm going
to be using the morphe metal g8 brush I
love the metal collection and I'm just
going to take this and put this in like
this center of my face and under-eye and
then with the same brush I'm going to
dip into my real skin tone here and just
lightly go around my face now I'm going
to set my eyes with that Chanel loose
powder and I'm in shade Claire so to
avoid creasing we are going to just buff
this under and then I'm going to set the
middle face alright now in the Ziggy
Stardust era Bowie contoured his cheeks
like Willy severe which I am such a fan
of so I'm going to be taking my Kat Von
D shade light contour palette and the
morphe bling that contour brush and we
are going to be dipping into this guy
today usually I am the shade as you can
tell she's been used up but we're gonna
go in with this shade today and we're
gonna carve out some cheekbones now he
did his contour a little lower and how I
do mine so let me tailor my routine to
his so I'm not looking like Geoffrey I
want to look like Bowie now he did a
really severe so I'm gonna really add in
a lot of color the cool thing about this
look there was no eyebrows I think he
shaved his eyebrows back then which was
really daring they are sharp today I'm
gonna do a little contour
Thanks now for that signature amazing
airbrushed red Ziggy Stardust iconic
makeup I am going to be using the
sugarpill Pro palette now this has a red
in it that is like everything you do the
road over there so we're going to be
jumping into that today and I'm also
going to be using this color pop
eyeshadow the shade is called erotic it
has a little bit of shimmer to it which
I love so I'm going to layer that on top
and for a little bit of dimension and
depth in my eye area I'm going to be
using that Kat Von D metal crush
eyeshadow in raw power get started I'm
going to be buffing out this red here
and then going in with my eyes so I'm
going to incres morphe brush and dip
into the red sugarpill eyeshadow and I'm
just going to kind of start drawing out
where I want that placement the beauty
about no brows is we can just go right
over the skin and he did it above the
brow and you would drag it all the way
to the hairline now I'm going to start
bringing the red down a little bit and
merge it with that contour color now it
is okay to have a little sheer burst and
we're just going to keep building and
building so it's very opaque
alright now to add a little bit more
depth I'm going to be using the Smith's
cosmetics brush with the color pop
erotic shade now this is like a cool
reddish orange e glitter amazingness
type of color so I'm going to really
pack that brush on gonna go over some of
this with this and then I like to stop
in with a Beauty Blender and now I'm
going to be taking the sugarpill
cosmetics eyeshadow brush and I'm going
to be using their red eyeshadow again
I'm just going to take it and cover my
lid now I'm going to bring this red
shadow all the way into my inner corner
and merge it with the red on top so it
all flows together and now I'm taking
the color pop shadow one more time and
putting it over the matte shadow alright
now we're going to take that thread and
wrap it around underneath the eyes so
I'm going to be using a sigma v 5 7 I
shadow brush and I'm just going to apply
the red right under my entire eye and
then once again we're going to take the
color pop shadow and apply it over the
red on the bottom and then take a
blending brush and pop this out and just
keep buffing Bob and blender all but
ablated how about that red is officially
on I'll be taking this burgundy color
from Kat Von D and just adding a little
bit of depth so with the same brush I'm
just going to dip in here yes
people have makeup can of depth surprise
alright now that the red is officially
laid down I'm gonna go back in with my
contour and just add a little bit more
after seeing so many amazing pictures of
Boeing on tour I'm like okay like you
really love to contour hi doesn't
yes cheekbones come through okay now you
cannot finish the eyelid without his
signature black lighter which I am
obsessed with so I'm just going to take
my Mac smolder eye pencil and start
adding in some black in the waterline
you guys know the drill we're just going
to take this Beauty Blender and slowly
bring the lid down and I was quickly
running this through the waterline ma'am
alright now that I have my liner down
let me add some more I'm going to be
taking this YSL babydoll liquid liner in
black and we're just going to add some
inner corner and we're just gonna make
this look sharp there amazing and he
didn't really blend the black under so I
am just going to make a little harsher
than I would normally do it but I love
this it's like this is the effect we're
going for and now I'm going to drag it
so lightly out oh but we never wore
lashes so let me put on some mascara and
see how I how I love good so I'm just
gonna be going in with this benefit
roller lash mascara and I'm doing my top
and bottom lashes
alright mascara is done I definitely
want to stay true to his look so I don't
think it lashes are really necessary for
this look I'm going to be adding a tiny
bit of highlight right on this red here
I'm going to be using one of my new
highlighters so I'm sure you guys are
gonna slap me across the face
I can not reveal everything right now
but this is a white gold type color and
I'm just gonna put this a little bit on
the cheeks for a dimension again alright
now before we get to that iconic gold
orbital circle that he is so well-known
for I'm actually gonna do the lips first
and I was looking through a makeup
drawer and I was like what do I have
that is like the like metal like gold
metal and I'm like oh my god duh I
that Pat McGrath gold pigment that she
put out a few months ago and I have been
waiting for the perfect opportunity to
really bust out a gold lip I am just
gonna put some pigment on a mixing
platter and just dip in it see what
happens this gold is so intense my
camera might break this is the Bowie
look this is iconic so now we have the
circle left and there's a million ways
you can do the circle a lot of pictures
I saw it was like a dark brown kind of
airbrush II looking circle with the gold
in the middle so I'm just going to take
this OCC color pencil in shade penny
Royale and I'm just going to draw like
an outline of the circle and then we're
going to start upping it in using some
eye shadows and then we'll pressing some
gold so I'm just going to kind of
visually start carving in this oh and
let's pray it works
now I'm going to be adding a lot of bold
pigment to the center and I'm gonna be
using fest Smith cosmetics 122 on the
one to two brush I love this one has
nice thick bristles to get in that
pigment now his circle was a little bit
less long but I am tailoring to my
forehead so remember that y'all bitches
are gonna try to read me on the circle
alright now that the goal is done I am
going to go with the Smith cosmetics to
5/3 and I'm gonna pull out that Kat Von
D shade + light eye shadow palette and
I'm just going to dip into a jaw of the
black and then a little bit of this
second brown color and I'm just gonna
define my circle color a little bit more
than it already was you know I can't
live without the Urban Decay all nighter
so let's set this face for a second
for 20 seconds mochi now before I
complete this look I'm just going to go
back hit with some red eye shadow and
just create a little red accent here and
there almost like we're doing reverse
red contour all right this is the final
makeup look now this would not be
complete without a different jacket and
the signature David Bowie red hair so
I'll be right back
alright this is the final look you guys
know how to throw on this iconic red
hair I am obsessed with it you cannot be
David Bowie without the hair so we are
done I hope you guys enjoyed watching
this I hope I did him justice leave me
