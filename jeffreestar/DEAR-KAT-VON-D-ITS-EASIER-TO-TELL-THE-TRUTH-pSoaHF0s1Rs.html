really hard one for me to make I have
sat here for we're on day two now since
Kat posted her video about me and at
first it was really shocking to see
someone that I've known for ten years do
something so aggressive it really
saddened me because there were so many
things that were not true in the video
and obviously I have my subscribers
followers and customers and so does she
so obviously people are going to pick
sides but things have gotten past the
point of just internet drama or things
have gotten way past just things getting
a little ugly we're now at the point you
guys where two days later I get a call
from three of my family members and
people from the internet after watching
her video have found their numbers
they're calling my family screaming
death threats on the phone and leaving
really just nasty vile messages and
that's really scary and it's also sad
that strangers on the internet who have
never met her and have never met me are
being so aggressive now obviously is my
past perfect who
no one's is I've definitely apologized
for all my mistakes if you don't follow
me on Twitter or snapchat or Instagram
you can find everything that you're
worried about or if you've ever had a
concern about me the last few months has
been raising I've seen about a hundred
videos using my name and it's just
gotten into this big circus so now we're
here I would like to give my side of the
story and my official statement on all
of this stuff I think it has gotten so
extreme cat I can't believe that you
would post something knowingly and
calculating it where you knew the
response it was going to get you are not
some random friend of mine you are a
celebrity you have paparazzi after you
you are a big name that's you can't deny
that and for you to use such a huge
platform just say things that are not
true and to get the response you knew
you're going to get is so disheartening
and so vicious
you enter video and start it by saying
it's not a bashing video I don't want my
followers or fans to attack but you knew
exactly what was going to happen so
everyone that's attacking me and being
aggressive and choosing sides without
ever hearing me speak that's fine that's
on you but to come on every social media
platform and attack my friends and my
boyfriend and my cousins and my mother
is so upsetting and I never knew you
would take something this far so I am
going to go down the points of
everything that she said in her video
and all the stuff that people have been
attacking me with and I'm just going to
lay it all on the table I think the big
elephant in the room is this mysterious
text message that I sent her which she
said she was going to show screenshots
on Twitter she never did so I am going
to show our text conversation on camera
because I just think it's fair and I
really think that that's a huge chunk of
a story that is missing so I definitely
want to show you guys these text
messages they are very important to this
back story so about around December of
last year we had kind of started to slow
down on talking I started to get really
busy with life and everything I've had
so many big changes ever since I
launched my friend and I think that is
very important to note so as you can see
middle of December we hadn't really
talked before then but she reached out
to me because she was doing some YouTube
compilation for her channel about people
who were like scared of clowns or
something like that so she rides me and
says can she have a picture of the clown
tattoo I have so of course I send one
and I send another picture it's fine
great and then you see me in January
reaching out about furniture I had just
moved into my new house and her
furniture at her house is unreal I did
not know it was custom-made at the time
so as you see I'm like okay asking for
advice you see my pink chair so you see
was talking about furniture scrolling
scrolling and then silence it's the end
of February and she asked if I'm doing a
collab with someone which I am going to
blur out because that's just for privacy
reasons so she asked if I'm doing a
collab with this person
and I said no take it to end of February
I asked hey can i film me getting a
tattoo for my channel after I asked her
to film she goes silent I do not hear or
speak to her until a few days ago so a
lot of people on Twitter were missing
construing what I said I said that I
really hadn't seen her face-to-face in
almost a year last time I saw her was in
September as you can see on her
Instagram if it's still up and it's
probably on mine where we instagrammed a
picture together and she says best
friends forever so fast-forward to we
are ending July right now I get a text
on Friday and as you can see all as it
says is hey Geoffrey I just got off the
phone with BJ bets please explain to me
why you haven't paid him for the artwork
that he provided for you so you guys got
to imagine where I'm coming from
my friend has gotten very distant my
clothes
one of my best friends has just really
gone silent on me and I'm just sitting
here like
there was never any fight there was
never any crazy moment there was never
anything so I sat back and I got really
angry 100% I was like is this for real
like this is so bizarre instead of
calling me or starting the conversation
anyway it's just
and I'm like well in my head I'm sitting
there going you're not his manager
you're not his lawyer you're not his
business partner you do work with him
slightly on some designs I guess but I
don't understand why it was her place to
say anything she actually had no idea
what had already happened and what was
transpiring so quick little backstory BJ
does some art work for cat now I know
cat has always said she does oliver
artwork for all burping but bj has done
lettering for some of her palettes so
when I was developing my line I reached
out and said hey do you know anyone who
could help me with artwork I asked her
if she wanted to do something and she
declined which I totally understand and
she put me in contact with this man so I
had reached out to him
and I said hey I'm gonna cats brands I
want to do some stuff lalala now my
brand was non-existent at this point it
was an idea and I had started working on
my liquid lip formula and that was it I
did not have a company yet I did not
have a website I had zero products so I
asked her if she knew any artists and
she put me in touch with BJ Betts now he
started an idea for me now at this time
I think it's very important to know I
took my life savings from when I quit
music and I also find a defensive cat
that you would say I was doing nothing
at the time I had a very successful
clothing line my online presence was
growing and growing and I was setting
myself up to launch a brand so I think
that was very unfair to say but I do
think it is important to know that I
invested my life savings every dime I
had into my first three shades now
something she also did not mention is
that initially she was going to be the
investor behind my brand and what I mean
by investing is loaning me certain
amount of money so I could start my
company and then I'd pay her back
immediately and that was that she agreed
to it I have emails
we went back and forth she gave me a lot
of amazing advice and I was really
excited so we're in the lab I'm making
stuff and
she kind of go silent and I'm like hey
you know like what's going on
and I never heard back about the
investment which I thought was so
strange because we're talking you know
years and years of friendship she said
she was down and then she went silent so
back to the logo now so many people are
harassing me and sending me the most
nastiest messages about this logo
incident you heard one side of the story
now let's talk about the truth so the
last text message I sent is very
important I'm in her video she states I
told her to fuck off or go fuck herself
I never said that cat why would you make
that up the real message which i think
is a little scary and it's going to
upset some people is this let me read it
to you I said first off
he meaning Vijay never did artwork for
me
and we passed on using him what I mean
by this is that he did start an idea but
he did not design my entire packaging so
at the time Vijay wanted to well I
wanted him to design my whole packaging
for my liquid lip and Vijay started
drawing a logo he asked do I want him to
design my entire packaging and I said
hey let's start with the logo and see
what happens so that screenshot that kat
held up is like about 20 logos that he
had quickly sketched up at the time I
was stoked on getting something done but
I was also a little fearful because at
that moment I had invested my entire
like every last dime I had on my brand
so I'm sitting there like oh my god this
guy is like an amazing tattoo he's a
respectable artist he's worked with her
and done so many things so I'm like oh
my god so long story short I didn't have
a manager at the time I had just fired
my entire team from music a year later
here we are
I had no manager no lawyer no business
advisor to help me so I'm just this
person that really doesn't have a lot of
money left I'm trying to start my brand
and Point Blank I couldn't afford it so
when I found out what he charged I was
like oh my god like I can't afford that
moment like I'm so sorry I'm gonna have
to step away and I went to someone that
had already been previously designing my
entire clothing line in the beanies and
my brand was called beauty forever now
that I have a makeup line I closed it
but all of those designs and everything
are still on line and I just want to
note that my merch in hot topic back in
like 2007 to 2009 I had a star logo on
everything with the J in it and you can
google that the receipts are all there
so fast forward to now I stepped away
I could definitely not afford VJ at the
time I just didn't know what I was doing
back then I definitely learned my lesson
if anyone out there is doing business
with someone make sure you have a
contract or a little agreement or
something before you start working on
ideas because this is how things turned
so ugly so here we are my graphic guy
did the logo for me now it is a basic
star off Google I'm not Tooting my own
horn it's a star my name is Geoffrey
Starr I got my name legally changed
ten years ago I put stars on everything
I have since the dawn of time so this
logo my graphic I was like well let me
do something and I said that I was very
inspired by the classic designers like
gucci and louie and chanel so he did a
mere jay put it in there
does it look similar a hundred percent
it does but did I steal the logo a
hundred percent I did not so I never
stole a logo and BJ never said I stole
the logo actually from talking to him
this week I found out that he had no
idea cat was going to go public and show
his design and mention his name I know
that he's a private person and he has a
family
so for her to put that on blast without
previously asking him I find very
appropriate and I just feel sorry that
he's now being dragged into this what
cat did which she shouldn't have done is
spoke for somebody that never asked them
to and she also didn't know that my
current manager and lawyer were already
talking to his manager and lawyer and
we're working something out because long
story short now that my Brent is
successful I wanted to take care of
somebody who was work for hire and that
had helped me in the beginning and
inspired something so long story short
Vijay has been paid
he has been fully paid out there is no
debt there's no pay your bills all that
crazy bullying and just psychotic
behavior that I've seen is just so
insane
I don't understand why people are coming
so hard when they don't know the real
story so Vijay is paid you can go on his
twitter and read it
there is no beef there's no bad blood
and we might work on something in the
future for a pallet for next year I
write catback and I say first off he
never did artwork for me and we passed
on using him the fact that you even have
the nerve to text me after you are
telling the owner of Too Faced cosmetics
that I tried stealing ideas from you
from our lab is truly disgusting and
disturbing you and I do not know each
other anymore
and the
please worry about yourself
stay the fuck out of my business
that was the final thing I've ever said
to her so her saying I said go fuck
yourself or fuck this I never said that
I don't know why you're telling people
that I don't know why you lied but the
proof is right here I never said that to
you cat here's where the story gets a
little ugly two weeks prior to this
conversation I was at an event hosted by
Too Faced cosmetics that is a huge
makeup brand that I've been a huge fan
of since I started wearing makeup at the
age of 12 they were one of the first
brands I discovered in Sephora I think
the owner is amazing I think they are so
talented and their products are
top-notch so someone very high up and
two-faced I am NOT going to name that
person at a privacy and respect but this
person told me at the event some strange
things she said hey we're doing a collab
with Kat right now our photo shoot was
at 10:00 a.m. she didn't even show up
until - she's very difficult to work
with and we're just kind of at a loss
for words and I was like that doesn't
sound like the friend that I know that
definitely does not sound like Kat but I
have not seen her in months and months I
have no idea what's going on in her head
I don't know what she's going through
lately so she also tells me
the worst thing I've ever heard
cat told the owner to face jeering that
I tried to steal an idea from her from
the lab that we both use
I was like
I felt like someone had slapped me
across my face someone that I had known
for so long
betraying me and lying about me and
she's never really done something like
that before or that I'm aware so this
person told me this I was devastated and
I wanted to you know get all upset and
text her right away but I said no let me
file this away let me take a deep breath
you haven't spoken in months and I'm
just going to file it away and keep
quiet
so you guys have to understand when she
texted me out of nowhere talking about
something that she knew nothing about I
was like like I was on one I was like is
she for real like this can't be what's
happening and I was so saddened someone
that I'd cared so much for to betray me
like that was just awful so after seeing
that my emotions were very messed up and
I did block her number 100% cat
I have never judged your character
online I have never said one bad thing
about you and I don't plan to now I am
just really hurt that you're telling
people that I stole from you and then I
stole from the
I think that is really the main issue
here so I'm going to touch on some key
points right now about all the stuff
that she said about me in the video
about the makeup lab about her ego of
how she thinks that she I guess created
me and I think that is very very
important because i sat there after I
watched that and I was like
who is so bigoted testicle that they're
gonna say that they basically created
somebody when I met her you guys I was
very huge on the website myspace I had
millions of followers I was touring the
world doing music so for somebody to act
like they invented me I find that so
offensive
so cat you told everybody that you
basically introduced me to the lab and
your approval is why I got through the
door what cat did was when I asked her
about a lab she gave me a sample of one
of her products that was in a little
vial and said the labs name on she said
this lab makes a few formulas for me
google them see if you can get it
meeting so she did not call for me she
did not walk me in the building I called
myself I googled the number I got in
contact with the owner and the creative
director and her name is Judy shoutout
to Judy I love you and the rest was
history
so we first started off by creating my
liquid lip and they gave me the most
amazing formula everything was a go and
even though cat was not investing into
the brand I found a mutual friend from
someone that helped me start everything
so I think it's important to know
because most people have never been
inside of to make a factory they don't
know what goes on in there when I'm in
there you do not see what anyone else is
doing I know my lab makes a lot of huge
brands that are in Sephora but when I'm
on the floor and my stuff's running and
I have meetings there everything is off
the floor you do not see what other
people are making
I didn't steal from you I've never seen
your stuff being made there so four reps
actually go for her when they are
working on a lot of stuff now I think
it's very important to know that I am an
independent brand I am NOT owned by
anybody this is all a hundred percent
Jeffrey there's no chain behind me
there's no big machine now when she
signed her makeup deal she signed with
the company called kendo now they are a
company that does Marc Jacob Beauty bite
Beauty formula X and also her brand
now that is exclusive to Sephora so when
I get lab samples and I'm creating
colors and eyeshadows and stuff I get a
sent right to my doorstep for her she
has to fly to San Fran and go to
sephora's headquarters to see all of her
samples so mine is very grassroots and
homegrown and I get things done a lot
quicker I can put stuff out very fast
obviously when you are a brand that is
in a mall or in a giant chain things are
a lot harder and you have to go down
different steps so I never stole the
formula I never stole an idea I never
stole the name it's all just my brain is
still I can't fathom it
so I find it offensive that she said I
was trying to steal the vegan big bucks
from my understanding from knowing you
for so long cat you were never being in
until about a year ago
I think it's offensive that you are
somebody who believes in that and you
have started to change your entire line
of vegan well I started my brand with
all of my products vegan and not because
I personally a.m. it's because my
following contains a lot of people
better vegan and I did not want to not
include them in being able to buy my
products I also think it's safer for the
eyes and lips to have a little better
ingredients and I think that overall it
was just a simple decision I'm not
trying to do anything else besides just
cater to everybody
another thing that was very disturbing
she said that I might go on a tweeker
snapchat rant which I'm like are you
really going to insinuate that to your
large following of millions of people I
think it's very disappointing because as
I've mentioned other videos I've never
even drank alcohol before I've smoked
weed every day
I have a medical cart it's legal I love
marijuana it takes away my anxiety I
have never done coke meth crack I've
never done a hardcore drug she is a
previous hardcore drug user
she is not sober which i think is
amazing because alcohol and drugs can
really ruin people and I commend her for
being strong enough to take that away
and for being a better person so for her
to flip it on me and say those comments
really cut deep and that really hurt me
think of somebody like her who has been
smoking cigarettes every day for 10
years to try to throw medical marijuana
which actually helps a lot of people is
truly unfair
in the whole time of having a brand for
two years now I think she's worn my
lipstick once in a picture she always
told me that Sephora legally has her
bound where she's not allowed to use any
other brand that is not in Sephora so
has she always been a supportive friend
a hundred percent I will never take that
away but has she supported my brand not
really in the beginning when she said
there was no bullying or bashing that's
what the entire video was with little
implements Kat has been on a TV show you
guys for years she's done media training
she knows how to get a message across by
implementing certain things I'm gonna
watch the video I was so horrified by
all these things because as I recall yes
I may show off a car - I love designer
handbags I've been collecting bags even
when I was broke I would put half a tank
of gas and buy a Louie bag and that's
how I live my life who is to judge how
you spend your money and how I spend my
money it's really no one's concern I'm
not understanding why she's trying to
make it seem like it's a bad thing that
I have nice things when she has had a
Bentley a Tesla a closet full of a
million dollars of clothes that she is
instagrammed and also showing off for
the last five years online so I think
that is very hypocritical and I've never
judged how you spend your money Kat
please don't judge my a lot of people
that are attacking or voicing their
opinion on social media haven't
mentioned a really key part that the BJ
vets has
not set anything on social media until
today he has stayed silent so if he did
my whole entire logo and all my
packaging why did somebody speak up two
years later don't you guys think I would
be sued or there would be a lawsuit
everything that is legal is public
record and you can google it and read it
and read online so why do you think it's
all being sparked right now I think it
goes a lot deeper than just a logo I
think there's a lot of malicious
underlining intents and I think that's
what hurts and breaks my heart the most
so let's just say it one more time
Vijay has been paid if you guys want to
still attack me and say crazy shit
that's fine I can take it I'm a big girl
and I know the truth I just wanted to
get my side of the story out there it
was really hard for me to even process
what was happening and right now I'm on
a tour bus I'm on the Vans Warped Tour
the Wi-Fi we're in like a middle of a
field everyday so after this I'm going
to quickly edit it and go to hotel and
use their Wi-Fi so if you're wondering
what took so long I'm allowed to collect
my thoughts and emotion
and I just want to say even though all
of this has gone on in the public cat we
have been friends for so long I still
have love for you I'm not sure what
you're going through personally but I
wish you the best and case closed and I
am going to disable the comments on this
video for the first time ever on my
channel I think the back and forth
fighting with strangers is so
unnecessary these are my thoughts and my
side of the story and my journey and
what I've been through with this person
so I leave you guys all with a lot of
love I never envisioned having a
friendship break up with someone so
public I'm sorry that you guys had to
waste your time watching this and I just
wanted to get out my side of story so I
love you guys so much and I wish you all
a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
