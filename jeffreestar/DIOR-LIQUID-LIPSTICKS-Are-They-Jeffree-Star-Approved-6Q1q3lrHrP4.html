channel today I am really excited
because I am doing a first impression
slash swatch review on the brand new
Dior Rouge liquid lipsticks oh my god
now if you've been following my channel
for a while you know that the Dior air
flash is literally one of my favorite
foundations ever I think I literally
mentioned it in the video before this in
my July favorites I was like when I
discovered this like 5 years ago I don't
know what happened with my life changed
that's what happened I don't even know
why I'm mentioning that I just thought
you guys should know that you're fucking
sick
but sometimes brands have misses
sometimes they have his and you know me
we're going to keep it really gangster
today as usual and see if this product
is Geoffrey start or proof or not I am
very critical when it comes to liquid
lips I have to literally tried drugstore
all the way to the most expensive liquid
lip on the planet on this channel and
you never know what you're going to get
sometimes the luxury brands come at you
and you want to scream and cry but I am
excited to give you guys the first sneak
peek of this product now I did reach out
to the or on sa girl do you mind if I
swatch of those on my channel and give
them a whirl and they were like some
brands I'm going to keep it real with
you guys as always some brands have told
me no I'm sorry I'm like ok cool well
when it comes out I'm going to buy it
and review it anyway you can't stop me
but I have had brands tell me if you are
iffy about the product or you don't like
it can you just not talk about it and
I'm like no that's not how I work so I
really appreciate your sending me this
collection of liquid lips I am really
excited to talk about them and swatch
them that I have been saving this for a
few days I haven't even swatch them on
my hands or tried anything yet so I'm
sitting you're like ok
let's dive into it so if you want to see
me swatch the nudie or liquid lipsticks
thank you for watching
so they come in a gorgeous blue unit car
in a very classic Dior we all have seen
this before on my channel now of course
the shade labels are on top now there is
three formulas there is a rock matte
which is I guess fully matte
long-lasting then there is an electric
metal formula and then there is a pop
satin which i think is more like a satin
type
lipstick of course we are going to log
in and see exactly what it's supposed to
happen here
so the packaging looks like this and
this component is really classic it
looks very classy to your course with a
little imprint you can see the color
through the window which I love so all
of them have that I'm going to test out
a few of the formulas today I'm really
excited for the metals because oh my god
girl
we're simply no logical because this is
a hologram it's almost like a lip topper
you can wear it by itself or you can put
it over other lipsticks to give it like
a feel so this one I am really excited
about on the website eat say is that
this one is a multi-dimensional cyber
silver that can be worn alone or used as
a topcoat and I'm like oh girl I'm
excited for this one I know a lot of
brands really don't do black lipstick or
kind of crazy colors but not new a girl
we have a matte black lipstick which a
lot of brands do not make this color or
it's kind of hard to perfect it a lot of
the time in blacks or greys or really
chalky and weird so we don't test this
formula out today baby alright so I
think I'm just going to dive into the
matte colors now here's the T on this
one I'm going to read you what this
formula is supposed to do now there is
29 colors you know my mouth cannot take
29 mm well that's in a whole nother
video but 29 lip swatches is insane so
I'm going to do about 10 for you today
and test out the different formula that
we're going to see what the hell is
going on so the formula is supposed to
be a very lightweight formula so it's
kind of supposed to be kind of like a
lipstick that you really don't feel now
it is it says laced with featherweight
pigments that produce intense vibrant
color that lasts up to 12 hours oh my
god well that is a long time so of
course this is a long-lasting formula so
this is yours first a liquid lipstick
that they've ever produced and now
there's a lot of shades here so it says
all the way from creamy beige to classic
Dior red and it also is a full-throttle
black in three distinct textures which
of course I already said so I mean let's
stop running my mouth and let's get to
swatching alright so the classic and
$9.99 Dior Rouge is a
classic red it is a very on the orange
based side and I'm like you know what
let's just go for the brightest color
first I'm going to see what the hell
happened
besides that you guys I did want to
mention a few things about this product
it has 0.20 fluid ounces which is six ml
for everyone out there that likes the
computer so this is a Chanel lip gloss
this has 0.19 so it actually has a
little bit more so this is a good amount
of product now of course the price point
is $35 for all of them individually
which that's a Dewar price point that is
not bad but if it doesn't work one I'll
see now it does have kind of a curved
dough foot if you can zoom in right
there and it looks like it should be
easy to apply on the mouth with that
slant so oh okay
usually with like bright red or any
oranges I like to use a liner or I have
to be very careful but for some reason
that's glided on super easy I'm a little
shocked let's finish them out this color
though I'm like girl I love a red so it
has been about two minutes I wanted to
see if it was going to completely dry
down or what kind of effect we're going
to give first impressions though I
really love the doe foot I know a lot of
you are like girl it's just a flat wand
I want to show you something that it
actually has a little divot inside I'm
gonna try to zoom in as much as I can
and try to help the students against the
backdrop you see that divot that goes in
there it holds product way more than I
think a normal dope foot and it released
gave a precise application obviously I
didn't use a lip liner I just went in
and it was easy to just kind of paint on
which is nice because a lot of times
some wands I got to use a lip liner and
give extra work and it's annoying
now let's feel it okay now there is a
tiny bit of transfer so I know you
should probably wait a little bit longer
for a full dry down so we will do that
with another color but doesn't feel
sticky I know it did say the source is
so lightweight it does thank God let's
watch the next color I get asked a lot
in between takes how do I remove the
makeup I honestly just take a makeup
wipe and I take my nail you guys and I
go like this really sharp
just go around and I wipe it all off and
then if my mouth is ever feeling raw or
ab dry skin I go in with a lip scrub
most y'all know I make a lip scrub but
this one is in flavor orange soda
girl mmm you just put a little on an
exfoliate your mouth all right let's get
just watching let's just go in for the
kill and do the matte black color
because that's really what I've been
dying to try this is literally probably
darker than my soul oh my god my teeth
look so white I give this lipstick okay
so black lipsticks are hard to make and
I got to give it up for because this is
full coverage oh those are really good
too and I just love it all right anyone
else ready for Halloween all right now
next up I actually want to try the
hologram lipstick this is one of the
metallics it is supposed to be
multi-dimensional and of course it can
be used as a top coat I definitely want
to try that so I'm going to take the
wall and it looks something like this
this color is literally just called
hologram and it looks really sparkly and
cute in the bottle I'm also going to
take a lip brush because I don't want
this to get black transfer on it and I'm
just going to take a bunch out BAM let's
see how it looks on top of the black all
right here is a hologram I'm only gonna
do the bottom lip as you can see the
contrast it looks really pretty it's
very like intergalactic it almost looks
like brush metal on my mouth now I do
want to swatch it really quickly just on
my hand so you guys can see what it
would look like on normal skin and not
black lipstick of course so I'm just
going to do a little whoo okay I love it
I think this alone would be really cute
as a lot of reflective properties and
there is a glitter in there so can't
wait to use this in the future the next
shader I'm going to swatch it's called a
vibrant metal it looks so pretty in here
look at that reflection but how's it
going to look on my mouth
Oh oh my god oh come on Pigman all right
here is this shade is so watched I'm
like oh my god it's just so pretty I
love a good metallic liquid lip and I'm
just going to let this dry for a second
I want to see if it feels khaki or any
different than the other ones but so far
it feels really lightweight especially
it's like a metallic sometimes I can
feel a little gritty or weird but this
one is drying nicely and I love how
we're selective it is if you're someone
that wants a little more of a subtle
look you may not want the metals but
this is sickening
all right now this shade is called crush
it is a matte and it looks like a Barbie
pink so of course I gravitated towards
it and we're going to give her a whirl
okay this color makes me feel happy it
is really pretty it is that classic
like Barbie pink and I'm living for I'm
like okay videos then I'm going to go
now okay let's do a nude you guys this
one is called chic it is the one of the
matte formulas and it looks really
pretty in here
but how it's going to look on my whore
mouth so this color is such an everyday
easy nude to wear if you do not like
crazy dark colors or brights definitely
get to the nude family this one is
stunning like there's no ifs ands or
buts about it alright my mouth is
feeling raw this color scandalous whoo
okay now this looks like to be a bronze
metallic and it looks stunning in the
bottle and like okay girls I complain me
let's see how she looks
so this one is a tiny bit more I guess a
little trickier than the other ones
maybe it is the shade and the metallic
so I'm just adding on a little bit of a
second layer and then it's like fully
fully opaque so this is like the only
shade so far that I've had to do two
coats on it
I don't really gravitate to metallic
Browns with this color it's definitely
unique and almost has like a little
burgundy undertone to it and here is a
scandalous swatch all right now last but
not least I want to swatch one of these
satin shades for you and this one looks
like a gorgeous type of like watermelon
cherry and this one is called a
Versailles let's see what these satin
formula a feels like by the way you guys
my mouth is raw it's like but um the
show must continue all right so I'm not
sure if the satin formula is supposed to
dry down completely or if it's just like
a satin liquid lip and it kind of comes
off so I'm going to give it a little two
minutes here and I will be right back
all right so it's been about three to
four minutes let's do a little finger
test okay definitely came off a lot more
than the matte one so maybe this one is
not completely dried down and it's not a
good tiny bit of a shine to it just say
satin so I'm going to assume that it
doesn't completely dry down but I just
want to make sure on the Box it's really
it doesn't say it but okay anyway I
think that I have tried all three
formulas and did enough shades to come
to my
I'm sure you can already guess from just
my thoughts throughout the video but the
Dior Rouge and liquid lipsticks are they
are jeffree star approved I am really
really happy that you're killed it with
this formula they have been on a roll
lately from their highlighters to their
foundation everything I know you guys
just thought the Dior forever in my July
favorite girl I just got a text message
man you want to be a nude photo in the
liquid lipsticks were really great the
formula was pretty much consistent of
course except the dark brown at the end
needed two layers everything else so
amazing the formula was on point and of
course I forgot to do my infamous smell
test in the beginning but I do want to
let you guys know that these if you've
ever smelled the jort lipstick whether
it's a stick lipstick or gloss it has a
classic like it's floral but with a
touch a little bit of something in there
a little Dew or magic and it's just very
fresh it's nice its pleasant it's not
overwhelming like some brand girl
it's very nice so overall I'm really
happy with this product thank God I was
scared because you know that's you know
liquid lipsticks you never know but this
brand killed it and I think these are
going to come out in the month of August
I think it's this week they're going to
be on sephora.com or in stores I think
if your location carries you're alright
