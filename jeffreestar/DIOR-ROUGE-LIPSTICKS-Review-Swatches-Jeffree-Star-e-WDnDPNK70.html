channel now today we're going to be
trying out some $35 Dior Rouge lipsticks
now they just redid their entire
packaging that used to be in a matte
kind of component and now they're in
this metallic gorgeous kind of shiny
looking lipstick bullet montage now I
loved your if you guys have been
following me for a while or watching me
y'all know they make the best foundation
on the market for me personally the Dior
air flesh is everything so they just
released about oh my god there's so many
shades you guys I'm gonna say like 30
shades on Sephora calm and on their
permanent line so of course I saw some
of the colors and I was like oh I'm just
gonna show you guys right now because
why not these are crazy look at that
gray I'm like oh do you're making
colored lipsticks now I have to try them
because hi you know yeah nothing at
Magnum you guys know I love a good
lipstick so the science is crazy grey
one you guys they have like look at oh
look at this
hi the color of my soul matte black whoa
so gorgeous and then they had to shock
me with this crazy like hot purple now
Purple's are hard to make so I'm excited
to try this now I've never put any of
these on my lips yet as you can see they
are untouched so I'm going to try them
for the first time on a camera today now
they come in a little blue unit carton
like this and there is 0.12 ounces of
product which is actually the same as my
lip ammo so very good amount of product
now this is a Couture color lipstick and
reading on the website it says that this
collection is a satin 2 matte lip strip
with highly pigmented finishes with
lasting comfort so of course we've all
heard a million claims before but does
it work
we're about to find out in a minute it
also says that you get 16 hours of
comfort and elegant lip color without
streaking or drying out the lips so the
last color that I put on I am
then go bowling with all my friends
later yes I go bowling you guys even
with five-inch diamond nails and I kill
it no but I love bowling I know a lot of
you republic when is this pitched you
want his free time I Bowl I read Stephen
King books I'm on my knees and I'm
constantly filming but I am going to try
and see how this wears throughout the
whole night and of course I will leave
my final final thought in the
description box down below but I think
it's time to dive into these and see
what the fuck happens alright so the
first shade I'm going to try this
gorgeous soft gray color is called
Montaigne and it is named after a French
philosopher yes I had to look it up
because I always watch the pronunciation
of everything and everyone always reads
me to Phil so I googled it thank you now
this is a really light in color skews my
crazy backdrop and I'm excited to try it
so let's dive into this grey lipstick
and see if she's worth it
oh okay she has some payoff thank God
alright I'm pleasantly surprised now I
do want to mention one thing they're
kind of strong on the floor outside so
if you don't like flowers bitch you're
not gonna like this one but I must say
you guys these are fully opaque very
pigmented now this does look like a
mortuary petition just kind of popped on
some you know dead look on my skin but I
think this color is very high-fashion
very unique I don't really see many
brands do gray lipsticks so let's try
the next one
now this next shade is a gorgeous hot
neon to have a purple it is called
superstitious love that shade name and
I'm excited because purple lipsticks are
hard to make like I said earlier and the
pigments on most brands don't really
ever show up like fully opaque you got
to like go back 20 times until your
mouth hurts so let's see what happens
Oh
all right so definitely not my favorite
purple I think the color is gorgeous it
is a little streaky on the bottom and
the color the color crap is beautiful
but I think it's a little patchy in
spots and it's not my favorite favorite
purple but it's nice I wish it was a
little more cool tone you can definitely
see the red tones in there and it's very
warm
but um yeah it's it's nice cars
it's fucking nice now this next shade is
called classic and it's a rose brownish
terra cotta type of color it is very
pretty on the stick but how is it gonna
look on my mouth let's find out oh I
love this already
now the pigment is very soft it glides
on really easy this color already
reminds me of Kristen from Kylie
cosmetics the liquid lip very similar
whoo now pigment wise this one was
amazing it went on perfectly easy no
patchiness I love this color and mmm I
wish you guys could feel my lips they
feel really soft it's not chunky it's
not this one's not streaky at all it's
not weird it's just really soft I am I'm
liking this formula I want to try the
matte black one so bad so let's do that
one next all right now this next shade
it's blacker than my soul it is a
literally just a matte black lipstick
which you're really hasn't done before
they've done a black lip gloss which was
cute didn't really translate that well
it was not opaque at all so I have high
hopes for this one because that last
color was everything now with black
lipstick I usually would line my lips
with eyeliner it is an easy old-school
trick but I'm just gonna see how this
looks by itself hmm oh my god it's a
navy blue haha
that's so cool it literally looks a
pitch black and I'm pleasantly surprised
that literally is Navy okay I need like
the shading I'm so fucking dumb
visionary
I am pleasantly surprised with this dark
Naevia lipstick I'm looking the monitor
and I'm feeling it it's really nice it's
not streaky so when you smile there's no
weird cracks or crumbles or mmm and it
feels really lightweight
oh right Dior you better fucking come
through with that surprise all right
guys now since there are 30 shades in
this line or more I'm just gonna try a
few more and give you my final thoughts
so let's dive into another shade all
right this next shade is called delicate
kind of like my whole after a train and
I'm really excited to try it on
speaking of gangbangs my color is that
Oh baby I'm on your red lip girl but
nathan is wearing one of my wigs it came
up for air but no what'd you guys think
of these colors I'm kind of obsessed
this blue one illidan looks sick
like you need it I'm like it reminds me
a lot of something that's inside my
pants this is amazing
oh he means his Titanic we don't have
that all right we're gonna finish this
lip swatch debauchery and then maybe
have a threesome all Nathan film so um
let's get started
ah oh excuse me
all right so this color is very soft
very pretty it's a little
macaroni-and-cheese nude I love it
now definitely not my favorite for the
bunch but it's cute it's very everyday
neutral so if you're that girl that just
likes to run the target and throw on
some nude lips and some mascara this is
definitely the one for you or if you
just you know won't have an orgy I think
in my Fit now last but not least I'm
gonna be trying this Gothic purple shade
it is called a poison I love that name
and I'm excited I just love dark matte
lipsticks so let's put the final one to
the test and give her a little spin so
as you can see hopefully it is a little
more tricky than the other ones it's
just kind of giving me a little bit of
trouble so I'm going over back and forth
and I think too bad yet
so poison is my least favorite from all
the ones I've tried it is a little
streaky in here and here kind of like
not clumpy it just kind of like the
color distributed more on the outer
layers of my lips and it kind of got
weird in the middle but overall it's
good I think if you use a lip liner
underneath you would definitely be fine
but all right let's give my final dots
so after trying six of the Dior Rouge
lipsticks I have to say that they are
definitely Geoffrey approved I know the
irony of me complaining about this one
it's the last one I tried I think this
one is the only one where I wasn't
really in love with it but all the other
shades were gorgeous I think you know
for the price point $34 is a little bit
excessive for a lipstick but this brand
is Geor so you are definitely paying for
the name and I think that some of the
colors are unique and not every brand
has those type of stick lipstick colors
so if you want to invest into something
weird definitely would try out one or
two of them but they are definitely of
course like everything they're not a
necessity but you know if you live and
breathe makeup I think that one or two
of these is definitely fun to try out
but um I know you guys tell me what your
favorite color was on me in the comments
down below and final thoughts are I'm a
fan
now of course I did whine about this one
but I'm looking at my desk and there's a
lot of good shade so I can't wait to
wear more of these for fall and take
them for a spin tonight of course I will
leave my final thoughts in the
description box and I'm ready to hit
that bowling alley in my panties so I
just want to thank my mouth for taking
all the abuse for another round of
swatches and of course if there's any
lip products or any crazy collections
that you guys see that
I am heard of yet let a bitch fucking
know but as always god bless you and
I'll see you on the next one hi
wait I just called myself down that's
not cool it was inspired by Gabriel
Zamora's tight client this scholar is a
warm soft nude like Nikita's pussy oh my
god
warm up calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
