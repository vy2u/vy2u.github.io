channel today bitch we are doing
something that has never been done
before here on YouTube you know I'm
someone that's a little bit crazy I
think you all know that by now but I
have done things on YouTube that has
never been done before we have done get
Reddy's in private jets in the air we
have done Rolls Royces where we've done
our full face in the back of a
half-a-million-dollar car but today we
are taking it to the next level and we
are going to do a get ready doing a full
face of makeup in auto pilot in my Tesla
Model X if you've never seen a Tesla in
person before let me just give you the
quick rundown this vehicle has auto
pilot and what does that mean it means
that when you are on the freeway you can
literally take your feet off the gas off
the accelerator you can take your feet
off the brake you can take your hands
off of the wheel and you can just live
your life now of course legally we do
need to pay attention to the road which
of course we are going to be very safe
today but I'm gonna put a few GoPros and
cameras in my Tesla today and we're
gonna do a full mask using new products
and some of my current favorites so what
is gonna happen today I have no idea I
do want to give you a quick little few
tidbits about this I am literally gonna
pull it up like I'm doing a review on a
pallet that this vehicle has eight
surrounding cameras providing 360
degrees of visibility around the car at
up to 250 meters of range there are 12
ultrasonic sensors that complement this
vision allowing for detection on both
hard and soft objects at nearly twice
the distance of the prior system so I
know we've seen a few crazy stories on
the news about people not paying
attention and something horrific happens
but I do want to let you know and you
will see it in the car when it wants you
to hold on to the wheel or pay attention
it will alert you so if you're someone
that didn't pay attention to that and
something horrible happened can't relate
so I know a lot of you are gonna be like
girl settle down but yes we're gonna be
buckled in and let's paint this face and
see what the hell happened so before
that you guys I'm going to show you a
few little scenes of us picking up the
car now this was black of course I had a
transform pink so let's start this video
and see what the fuck happens good
morning we are about to go pick up the
Barbie Tesla
sticker city finished wrapping the
entire car and listen I am so excited
because you know pink is my favorite
color I always have been cars and I've
kind of been missing you lately my fleet
has just been all over the place or
yellow black red I'm like let's get back
to being pink so let's go pick it up it
all right you guys so we are here at
sticker City the car is already out
front I saw as we were exiting the
fucking freeway so let's go check it out
Barbie go long
and there
it looks so fucking bad-ass like Barbie
have a ten seat go home
the bitches back I can't wait to take
this on the freeway and do autopilot and
just wave alright you guys and let's get
on the freeway BAM and let's go see what
everyone else thinks see you on the
other side
all right car let's get ready all right
we are in the wheel we are buckled in I
always drive with sunglasses on but
today we're actually getting ready so we
are not going to keep them on so BAM now
it is a Saturday it's the weekend so
there could be horrendous traffic or
there could be none you never know what
you're gonna get in California or Los
Angeles I should say
so today I'm gonna have my makeup
brushes on top of here we're just gonna
open them up they're gonna get some
little sunbathing today and I've put
makeup everywhere we have the whole
center console full and yeah we're just
gonna get glam and if you've never been
in a Tesla before this is airplane glass
and it goes all the way up to here so
we're going on the freeway let's see it
says 25 minutes to the 405 that bad
already seeing brake lights okay so
we're gonna start this tutorial oh
there's my car in black yes hunty
alright you guys so we can literally go
on autopilot now if we wanted to let's
just see for a few minutes our full
surroundings and there seems to be some
traffic up there and already people
breaking all right you guys so there is
this big old line here might be on my
face for some of the video but you guys
know when there's shadows in cars
alright so literally we could do
autopilot right now and start this face
because girl I just looked in the mirror
let's not look like the Blair Witch
right now so to do autopilot all you got
to do is literally it's this lever under
the steering wheel on the left so all
you got to do is go one two okay and you
are literally in autopilot and the car
takes over
all right we are in autopilot let's turn
the radio off now it said please keep
hands on wheel for a brief second and
then literally you can let go the cars
in full control the max speed that I'm
allowing it to go is whoa 65 miles an
hour
so if traffic stops and people start
going 75 or more my car will only go to
65 is this fucking weird yes 100% you
know I've been driving since I was 16
years old and when you don't have your
hand on the wheel it is so bizarre
because you're trained forever to
obviously pay attention hopefully if
you're a good driver
the Tesla does brake for you obviously
it does everything and it breaks a
little harder than I brake so there may
be some jerking all right bitch let's
look in the mirror lowered my skin are
they too dry I don't feel cheap
alligator II maybe a little hair clip to
put this hair back first we are going to
moisturize miss Jace and I'm gonna go in
with my trusty tried-and-true a Bobby
Brown vitamin-enriched face space one of
my favorites and girl we need to prime
and prep the skin
oh hey neighbor oh she's cute girl
there's some beautiful people on the
road honey you ever want to just pull
over and sleep with someone and then
drive to work because that's what kind
of vibes I'm in all right we are
moisturized now today I actually have a
brand new foundation I've been dying to
try it is the new Marc Jacobs Beauty
shameless youthful look 24-hour
foundation that's a mouthful now it also
has SPF 25 and yeah let's try it I'm
gonna use shades are 250 and 300 into a
little mixing today though yeah let's
give it a whirl just gonna throw some
boxes back there I don't know how full
coverage this is though I don't want to
but too much but I'm already using a lot
now I've gotten ready in the rolls-royce
on the back of a car well Nate was
driving this is a whole new level of
extra because I've never just put
foundation on Oh oh my god look at the
glass we're going off a bottle pilot
holy shit holy shit oh my god there's
people over there shit that fell out of
there oh my god okay guys back in
autopilot that was so scary people were
breaking oh shit the cars breaking
really hard right now it was scary back
in traffic guys we were going like whoa
whoa we were going like 65 for a minute
now we're back to zero that sums up LA
all right so before this dries cuz I
have no idea how quickly this foundation
dries let's buff and blend before it's
too late all right so let's conceal what
kind of concealers do we have today
honey let's go in with the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD invisible cover conceal

little bit of our Maybelline master

of fizzling today we need to chisel out
this face oh you know what we forgot a
step you guys what is wrong with me we

foundation because hi we run the direct
Sun right now and I'm feeling really
really insecure damn this foundation

to put a little bit of this Mac glitter
in my waterline okay hi how are you

love you baby
mwah we're gonna do a little bit of
glitter I wish I had to make it to give
her the other day that was actually in
my car and this girl told me to roll
down my window so she could say hi and
she's like I love your channel and I had
a few liquid lips from my office that
were brand new from the left stick
collection and I threw them in her
window bitch was like so this glitter is
deadly because it could spill so I'm
gonna lick the brush again I know you
all home or like we're licking the brush
we are bucket you guys all right so I'm
gonna take this and just put it right in
my inner corner

middle of my lid as well Wow it's
stunning

that have like been in a normal car and
they're doing their makeup which is
never a good idea I know some of you
were like is this I've seen stories on
the news where people have had the whole
mascara wand stabbed in their eyes

finish off the eyes I actually just got
this in the mail right before we were
about to jump in the car and this is the

lot usually it's for like the end of a
shoot when you want to capture a really
cool wet look I just want wet lids

gonna take a little I was literally
clear almost looks like brow gel but
it's literally gloss for your eye so
