channel finally we're getting a new
makeup tutorial I have been so busy I
just moved into a new warehouse so
jeffree star cosmetics is gonna be
shipping faster than ever before
thank God I've been having growing pains
you guys it's been really crazy and I
have been filming with many anyway all
week he's been sleeping over at my house
so we just been collab been hanging now
and we've just been bonding it's really
cool that another guy makeup is so down
to earth it's really hard to find people
that are not like catty and jealous and
crazy so this weekend mani is putting up
a video on his channel where we do a
 up challenge so get ready for
that and I hope you guys enjoy this look
enjoy it enjoy it eat it up yes God and
also let me just say a little disclaimer
you're probably like bitch why the
are you blonde
I am trying out like a million wigs I
had my hair surgery it's healing amazing
if you guys do not know what that
surgery is about look at my Instagram I
talk about it and give you a whole spiel
but long story short I got a whole new
hair line and it takes months for the
hair to grow obviously full and long
again so I'm gonna be switching on my
hair color in every video so hope you
enjoy this blonde bombshell moment and
keep watching let's get started so as
you can see I've already done my
foundation and contour and powder
highlight so if you want to see how I do
that go back to my channel and find the
official jeffree star face routine video
alright now to get this crazy neon
smokiness I am going to use the lightest
shade from the Kat Von D shade + light
eye palette I'm going to be using this
guy today and I'm just going to take my
Mac - 5 - as always my go-to and we're
gonna take that white color coat the
entire bristles and then you guys know
what I love
to do take that highlight right under
the brow and just start blending down
now I know a lot of you love to prime I
do prime the lid sometimes but since
I've been doing makeup
I always just take a light color and I
bring it all the way down so this is
kind of like my primer love to take the
shadow and bring it all the way past the
brow so all the way there once it hits
my face tattoo I know I'm good
ooh hi all right now let's start putting
some neon colors on I'm gonna go to one
of my go-to favorites is that Urban
Decay electric palette I love this one
now it says that a few of the shades or
not I save and a lot of you were
probably like really read the unit
carton on this it says that some of the
shades are not isafe meaning that
there's some dyes that they used in
their formula that may stain the lid so
I personally do not care I know my
eyelids are not gonna fall off um and I
don't mind looking like I had pinkeye
for a few days because then I just put
foundation right over it so I'm gonna
make a little cut crease type of moment
with my eyes and I'm going to be using
the OCC cosmetics color pencil in shade
anime this is what I used for my pink
brows and a few of my last videos so
with this I'm actually gonna sketch out
my lid of where I'm gonna now draw it on
so this is like an old-school trick I
used to do back in the day so I'm
basically just sketching out where I'm
gonna draw and I like to bring the
pencil all the way down in my waterline
and bring it a little outside the line
now this is obviously not supposed to
look perfect this is like a little
sketch that we're gonna put a shadow on
top of so don't think like damn did you
look a messy so that's my little sketch
cute now I'm gonna take this Chanel
eyeshadow blender see how it's like
really domi I'm gonna take some pink
eyeshadow from this palette we're gonna
do shade savage which is this pink guy
right here I'm just going to
the entire brush like so high by fallout
we're actually gonna take this brush and
go over that line that I created and
this is where you're gonna buff it out
and blend so of course that line was
definitely not perfect it was just more
so to be a guide just guide me through
this girl and I like to take this make
it go all the way down the nose a little
very airbrushed
hello 80s makeup how are you and I'm
just gonna start buffing up so notice
how I'm just doing little back and forth
motions to give it that really nice air
brushed look that I have been known for
forever we're just gonna go up and up so
just soft little brush Motech motions
and we're blending and blending and
blending I'm gonna take the shadow brush
and dab it on my lid so it kind of
creates that like halo half sea type of
moment and we're just gonna go back and
forth so this is like the foundation of
the neon pink like she's getting there
we're gonna add in some more depth but
this is just like the outline okay so
but I'm gonna take that first blending
brush and without any extra product I'm
just gonna kind of buff over the pink at
the top edges just so it gives it a
really nice blend II look before we go
in with even more color all right now
we're gonna go in with this orange color
it's called slow burn hi and I love this
one it really complements this one so
I'm just gonna dip it in and I'm gonna
be using a little blending brush from
Gucci I'm obsessed with these bristles
they're so soft it feels like I don't
know I don't even know what it feels
like it just makes my eyelids come now
these do have a little bit of fallout so
hi then we're just gonna go in the
middle now you don't have to necessarily
do this perfect there's no like way to
put on the orange I'm just kind of
blending it in with the pink and
dragging up on like the outside so
notice how the orange will not go in
it's just going to go on the outsides I
want to give it some dimension and give
my eye some depth so I'm just going to
put that orange almost over the pink and
it kind of creates a custom color and
then drag it out even
more since hi we have no brows we can do
whatever we want and just bring it all
the way out love it so it's kind of have
like a little sunset ombre moment and
then if you want you can go back in with
your first blending brush open up that
Kat Von D and take that light color one
more time I just put a little bit on the
brush and then we're gonna go over that
one more time and make sure it looks
like hi everything is airbrush now
before I do all that smokey drama
underneath my eyes I'm gonna do a little
wing and I'm gonna be using the Kat Von
D a liquid liner in trooper now I love
this you just give it a little shake and
the applicator is genius it's really
fine and thin it's like mmm so I'm
literally just gonna take this and start
painting and all that wing now I like to
go from the middle and kind of create my
shape and then I'll go down and start
mapping it out but I love this pencil
because it's really quick so if you are
like on the go I have to go to a
business meeting and then you know to an
orgy this one is definitely something
you want to invest in now a lot of the
times with liner I will take a mirror
and get really close in there and just
kind of go over it because sometimes the
vanity mirrors are not good enough now
what I'm doing this you guys I hold my
breath so excuse the silence
yes eyeliner let's get to smoking at the
bottom and I don't mean crack cocaine I
grab my trusty Mac smolder pencil and
I'm just gonna slowly drag it in the
waterline now this liner is perfect for
smudging if you want a 24 hour stay
liner this is not it this is for
purposes of smudging out the bottom and
making them look like heaven so we're
just gonna put a little bit on the
waterline you don't to drag it down too
much because they
it might smear now for the bottom I'm
gonna take my Mac to one nine pencil
brush hi pencil and I'm gonna take this
shadow called urban it's this one it's
this hot purple like oh my god I love
this purple color so usually when you
find a purple from any brand it's not
good like it doesn't show up good enough
but this one oh my god
so I coat the entire brush like she's
pigmented and I'm just going to take
this and start to drag it so I take the
pencil brush and I start putting the
shadow over that black and I'm really
careful it's almost like we're doing
surgery and I just start dragging it
across now we're going to use another
brush in a second but this stick really
gets it defined and it depends on how
dramatic you want it you can really
bring it down like I am or you can share
it down a little more it's up to you I'm
always like go bold or go home and then
I'll take a little bit out with that
wing and kind of mix in with the orange
so we're like we're taking it there and
then we're gonna take the morphe 5 1/4
it's like a little detail brush and I'm
gonna dip it into that purple but I'm
also gonna take the next one called
jilted right here and I'm just gonna dab
that on top of it so when I buff this
out it kind of gives it a little more
depth a little more like whoo hi and I'm
just gonna take it right over the purple
and just slowly drag it across so this
will soften all those harsh edges and
just kind of give it a more defined look
just a little high-fashion Couture if
you will now I'm just going back in one
more time with a Kat Von D trooper liner
and I'm just kind of merging my corners
of my eyes together so they look
cohesive and like they're all one unit
just tiny little details that I like to
do and then I'm going to take that Urban
Decay jilted shade one more time with
this morphe brush and just really smoke
it out so it's like whoa lowered now
what what is left with this eye besides
lashes I think we are good I wasn't add
some silver but I like the way that
light shade is still on my lid
didn't really put another color there
and I like that so I'm actually going to
go back in with that light shade right
here and I'm just gonna add a little bit
of it in here so it's like extra whoa hi
good morning I'm gonna go in with my
benefit roller lash I still can't get
over this I like I just I love it if you
have tried this mascara let me know in
the comments below if you love it I love
this applicator it is perfect for top
and bottom all right come through bottom
mascara I think it's really important
it's like to me hi such a big difference
and this mascara really let's the
bottoms like have a feather a moment so
we're just gonna take it finessed it in
and go out and under no but I don't like
how my bottom mascara looks I will brush
a little comb through this is a little
morphe 22 mascara home and i'll just
gonna comb it down because when you get
ready every single day your lashes take
like extreme advice so I'm like oh I am
happy with how this is looking so let's
put on our lashes now I want real real
big drama before these lashes today so
I'm gonna be using that new bound some
Russian black these are oh these are so
dramatic they're like double stacked on
one strip it's like it's it's special so
I'm just going to take my glue that
smells like lobster and we're just
gonna coat the entire lash band now
whenever I'm in a hurry my lashes never
want to stay on but today they're
actually behaving which is shocking so
right after I film today you guys I'm
going to my makeup lab to finalize a new
eyeshadow palette you guys know I have
an eyeshadow palette coming out in May
and I'm working on another one for fall
and since production takes so long in
the makeup world
we are gonna finalize it today so whoo
come on latches dry so mama can go
create all right the eyes are officially
done I'm like whoo high drama now to
finish off this look you guys know I
need a little bit of highlight and today
I'm going to be trying out this new Tom
Ford Soleil contour compact I love how
big as packaging is it reminds me of my
highlighter this one's almost bigger I
think and I love this it comes with a
highlight a blush and a browser and
they're up raised which is cool so it's
easy to get the product you know in and
out and I'm gonna use a little NARS
kabuki brush and try a little bit of
blush today I love how quarrel and
pretty this looks so I'm just going to
add a little bit a little bit of color
to my cheeks I know I normally stay away
from blush but I feel like with this
look a little bit will look really
pretty so nothing too crazy just a
little bit of color and then a little
bit on this side all right now this does
have a highlighter in it we can take my
favorite morphe 510 brush and try this
highlight wow it's a little powdery and
I'm just gonna put above a blush and
contour kind of merge them okay this is
soft and pretty you guys can see it it's
definitely not as intense as I would
normally go but it's pretty so let's try
a little subtlety today the eyes are
already like stealing the show so let's
uh see what happens here what I
recommend this palette if you are like a
makeup collector and you think you have
to have it I would get it but there's
definitely a lot of dupes for this so
it's not like a must-have I'm just like
a makeup collector and a hoarder
definitely need a rehab so alright that
is done now last but not least the lips
now I'm going to be using a new honest
offset Beverly Hills a liquid lip today
this is shade Ashton oof I love this
already haven't tried it but just from
looking it in the bottle I'm like
mmm-hmm bitch and now you guys know I'm
a liquid lipstick whore now just because
I make my own does not mean I don't use
other people's I am a collector I have a
drawer of just lipsticks of a filing
cabinet just liquid lips too
so you guys know whenever I see a new
shade from a brand I love I have to wear
so let's try this huh oh okay hmm
I'm already obsessed with a really nice
on I I think uh brown nude is like
perfect
all right the liquid lip is dry I love
this color it's really like it's a warm
tone nude it works really well with this
look you can definitely do a lighter
dude there was so many options like they
have so many new colors out I'm like
hello like you could I could have done a
like a lighter one I love this it's very
nice I'm like I'm living so I think the
only thing I need to do to finish this
damn look is some setting spray and I'm
going to use my little makeup forever
mist and fix and just have a little just
a little moment all right let me throw
this hair down and this look is complete
alright so this is my version of a smoky
neon dramatic winged liner look that's a
mouthful I hope you guys enjoyed this
