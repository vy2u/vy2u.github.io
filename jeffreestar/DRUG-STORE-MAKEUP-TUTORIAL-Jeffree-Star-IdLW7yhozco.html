channel now when I asked you guys what
kind of videos you wanted to see next
I got an overwhelming amount of response
to do a full drugstore makeup tutorial
now I know you shady bitches thought I
would never do it but come on if you're
a makeup artist you can make anything
work not that drugstore makeup is bad it
just has a lot of tendencies to be more
misses than hits from my previous
experiences um and now that I make
makeup I know
formula so this was a really interesting
experiment and I just want to make a
disclaimer that some of the makeup
brushes are from my personal collection
from other brands that are not drugstore
but every makeup product used in this
video is drugstore bought so if you want
to see how I created all this keep
watching and see what happens
alright so the first thing I'm gonna do
is take this lip smackers dr. pepper
flavor lip balm and prime my lips now
for face primer I was looking through
all the aisles and I liked elf I've used
some other stuff before I have never
used this hydrating face primer before
so we're gonna try it out I'm not really
sure how much you're supposed to use but
I'm just gonna use a nice little full
it's very mattifying okay we'll let that
dry down for a second now you guys know
the first thing I always do is put on a
lot of foundation so I Instagram that I
was going to be doing this video and you
guys gave me so many options and advice
on what to buy and the product that kept
standing out was the L'Oreal infallible
Pro matte foundation everyone is like
this is amazing everyone's raving about
it so I'm gonna get going with shade one
zero two shell beige let's pray to Jesus
it matches I'm just going to take this
with a real techniques brush this is
number three hundred you guys know I
love to
. it all around my face before i blend
it out now i've never used any of these
products before so let's see how they
work okay I think that's enough let me
start buffing this in now using new
foundations can break you out it doesn't
matter if they are high-end or not
changing your routine just freaks your
skin out in general so any of you guys -
all pause this video and say a silent
prayer for my face then as always we're
gonna blend to the neck avoiding all the
tattoos and you guys know I have to dab
that ear think that's good enough
coverage for me we'll see what happens
before I do a lot of powder I'm
definitely going to conceal now if
you've watched my previous videos you
guys know I'm really not a fan of
concealer but this foundation is just
not as heavy as I normally would wear it
I'm definitely gonna conceal and I got
this Maybelline better skin camouflage
concealer let's try this out this is
shade ivory
alright the sponge is damp let's start
blending now this sponge is really hard
like it's actually taking off my
foundation so you see that my foundation
is like missing right there um okay
we're not going to use that let's go
back to the brush I'm just going to use
the same foundation brush and try to
buff out some of this concealer before
it's too late
okay much better I'm like Lord Jesus now
the cool thing about this concealer is
it's not making any fine lines like more
noticeable it's actually concealing and
doing an amazing job
concealer now sometimes I do cream
contour sometimes I don't we're gonna
we're gonna just do powders today now I
want a full mask of coverage so I got
the Loreal infallible Pro matte powder
foundation and I'm gonna dust this over
my entire face come through Matt I'm at
powder earth now this doesn't have much
color to it which is what I wanted but
it does leave a really nice matte finish
and this shade was 104 Celyn you know I
am a fair bitch
now the relief was a lot of highlight
and contour kits at the drugstore I did
find this really dope one from
Maybelline it's called the master
contour palette just three shades it's
contour blush highlight I think that
contour color is perfect for my skin
tone so we're gonna try that today and I
also found this big bronzing powder it's
from prestige cosmetics so I am going to
contour first I'm going to be using this
mist cosmetics brush my fave you contour
brush I'm gonna dip into the contour and
OS is painted okay okay let's try it out
now we're gonna go down here and we're
gonna carve our face out of stone now
for the forehead I'm gonna be going in
with this Estee Lauder bronzing brush
and we're gonna dip into that prestige
cosmetics let's see how this is gonna do
oh my god this has shimmer to it mother
fucker okay so my dumb ass didn't
realize that that gold dinging up there
as a shimmer let's wipe off the gold
bronzing Stardust powder off my forehead
okay think we're getting there I might
have a small halo but uh it's okay it's
preparing me to go to heaven now to
soften that we're just gonna use the
same brush and dip back into that powder
okay
we're we're pretty gone toward I'm
feeling it all right now contouring the
nose a little scary so I'm going to be
using the oval three brush from artiste
how I dip in this once you do
a ton of product unless you want that
alright and I'm going to cap the end of
it now for highlight there is a
highlight in here which I'm gonna swatch
it with my finger cuz I have no idea
it's going to work or not I'm just
really pretty now I'm just going to grab
a morph e310 fan brush I love this thing
dab some on there and let's see if I'm
gonna be going it's subtle it's cute I'm
noticing that this actually has a little
bit of color with it to add some little
shimmer above the brows I'm about to
draw a line okay this is actually pretty
cute more layering the more shine I'm
seeing on my cheekbones alright for
brows today I tried to find something
comparable to the anastacio shade taupe
and I found two things this Maybelline
brow define and fill duo I think will
match of course it's hard to tell when
you look at a unit carton and you can't
swatch it so I got this and then also
L'Oreal has a brow stylist which had a
brow powder in it Wow powder was hard to
find at the drugstore so maybe using
this guy obviously I don't need this wax
because I have no bow hairs so we're
just gonna dip it in this powder and try
to draw on with this okay now that I got
the shape down I'm going to go in with
this Mac eyebrow angled brush and dip
into this L'Oreal alright I decided on a
topi gold glitter soft neutral eye and I
am going to be using the l'oreal la
palette nude one a lighter shade is
probably my color right there so I'm
gonna be using this and I'm going to use
my go-to Mac - five - brush and just
apply this over the entire eye area
definitely messy a lot of fallout you
guys know I hear you fallout now this
Physicians Formula these are all like
shimmer shades and this top one is like
it's really pretty as like a glitter to
it so I'm going to dip into this guy
right here and I'm just gonna put this
right under the brow bone
oh let's go in with this elf contour
brush now I'm assuming this is for the
eyes and not the cheeks and I'm gonna go
into this wet and wild palette this is
that I'm getting sunburned eyeshadow
palette and I'm gonna hit this crease
color see okay I'm just gonna put this
in my crease what is dark I'm like good
and I'm gonna leave some space below and
put gold where there is no color yet so
bear with me okay now I'm gonna buff
this out and I'm actually gonna do this
taupe shade right here and go over that
and stop in on line with my Mac 2 to 4
brush just gonna drag the shadow down a
little bit take this brush again and go
back in with the light color and right
below the shimmer I'm just going to
blend this out a little bit there we go
now I'm going to go in with this one
it's like a topi shimmery color and just
added a little bit more dimension to my
lid before I do anything with the under
eye I'm going to add some shimmer and I
found this pressed glitter pigment from
Wet n Wild just going to use my finger I
know that sounds very strange coming
from me but sometimes the fingers are
the best
good morning goal thank you for joining
my lid really pretty now this sounds
like a sticky consistency to it which is
making it stick to my lid really good
alright now I'm going to take a morphe
5-1-1 brush and really get in the inner
corner which I could not do with my
fingers and then I'm going to go back
over with this and really press it in
now I'm going to take some of this and
just put it in my inner corner below now
for under the eye I'm gonna take this
Smith cosmetics to-20 brush and I'm just
gonna take this color here you know just
buff it under my now I wanted to try
some sort of eyeliner so I got this
Revlon eye pencil and I'm gonna put it
in my waterline and see what happens
alright now with the morphe 514 brush
I'm gonna go back in with that same
brown shade that we just did under the
eye and I'm just going to buff it out
starting the center of my eye and go
outwards and smoke it out a little bit
more alright now I'm going to go back in
with this shade a little bit on the
outside and blend it with my Mac
blending brush and kind of merge these
two together now to me these eye shadows
blend a little patchy it's a it's kind
of frustrating having to go back and
forth so many times which is not normal
for me but I think I got the eyes where
I want them
I was talking to my grandma about doing
this video and she goes if you don't use
the famous pink Maybelline mascara I'm
gonna slap you upside your head
if you've never heard of this mascara
you must be under an igloo in Antarctica
because this has been around before any
of us were born all right for lashes I
know this is a drugstore makeup tutorial
but I got these at the costume store and
there were 89 cents so I definitely
think this will qualify now these are
really big and dramatic not that you're
shocked at all I'm just gonna blow and
wing say a quick prayer to Jesus now I'm
going with the tweezers and I'm pressing
my real lashes with the false ones all
right second latch is on last but not
least is the
lips now that was a hard one for me I
just wanted something really bright
corley and fun so I found this Revlon
brand it is a liquid to matte but it's
not long-lasting like mine so this shade
is called temptation of course it is oh
wow smells like a cake candle now it's
still wet looking this looks like a lip
gloss but it says it is ultra HD matte
lip color so let's give this a second
and see if it is going to dry down
alright so it's been about five minutes
off camera and this still hasn't dried
down I don't know if it's supposed to
dry all the way matte it says matte and
Matt's matte and as you can see it looks
like a lip gloss to me it's like slowly
getting there but it's still really
shiny I love the lip color I don't mind
a gloss it's just not doing what it says
so hey now last but not least I was like
oh my god if I can't use my Urban Decay
all nighter what stop fuck am I gonna do
and I found this Maybelline it's
basically like a fixed plus but it's
called master fix so let's see what
happened okay let that settle alright
guys that was the full drugstore look as
you can see some of the products were
really amazing I kind of want to scrape
off this gold glitter and eat it
register as the video progressed the
foundation did not sit on my skin how I
wanted it to and maybe it was the primer
maybe I don't know no one knows but um I
love the look I think it's really fun it
was a little challenging for me in the
sense that I had never used these
products before not that I was afraid to
use drugstore makeup but I just prefer
higher-end products because the formulas
tend to be top-notch where some of this
stuff I was really hard to do so I hope
you enjoy watching this and I will see
you next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
