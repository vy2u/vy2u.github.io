channel
now something a little different today
we're not in the studio now me and
Nathan are about to go on a little movie
and dinner date and I figured why not
get ready before the date so I can
already be in full glam and then we can
go enjoy a little night on the town and
I always have a little couples romantic
moment with four dogs and just people
being around us all the time and just
always doing business we never really
have a lot of time for ourselves
so I figured I would show you guys a
little soft easy glam now when I did
this look a week ago on my channel for
something else everyone was like where's
that tutorial so here is that little
soft extremely highlighted glam look
that I did and I just want to have fun
have a little flirtatious little soft
beat so if you want to see how I created
this soft little glam then keep on
watching and by the time this video is
over hopefully I'll be pregnant
alright guys it's time to get glam now
first off I have been doing so many lip
swatch videos on my channel I need a
little bit of moisture so I'm going to
start off with my Joey lip balm this is
a lip conditioning treatment let's go
and give it a little whirl and I like it
cuz it gives your lips a little bit of
shine now let's get this skin snatch I'm
going to start out by using my all-time
favorite Bobbi Brown vitamin enriched
face base now when I'm not getting glam
on camera I've been using this a lot as
usual but um there's been so many
products out lately my skin is just like
can we go back to like what you know and
love so I bought a fresh jar because
well mine was MD so I love to use a damp
Beauty Blender and just go to town on my
face so I put a lot on there and you
just want this to seok and seok and seok
you get that fierce mannequin skin that
I am all about we are going to be using
two foundations today I'm gonna go in
with my trusty Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation I have been using this
now for I think about two years and I
know I try a lot of foundations and I
like to mix and match but I always go
back to this one so we're going to be
using this one today asides that I'm
going to be mixing in a little bit of my
Tom Ford traceless perfecting foundation
and I am shade zero one cream in this
guy so I'm just going to put a little
bit on a steel mixing plate down here
and um let's buff and blend just seeing
how the color matches and okay I'm down
okay alright so I'm going to be using a
damp Beauty Blender and I'm just going
to buff and blend this full coverage
mask foundation is Slade now of course
I'm going to have a really extreme
highlighted under-eye area today so how
do we achieve that of course we need our
tart shape tape concealer and we are
going to start by just putting a little
bit on under our skin and we're just
gonna basically do like a upside down
triangle and almost take it all the way
not almost we're gonna take it all the
way to the hairline let's keep it really
gangster today and because I would get
slapped in the face if I didn't
highlight my chin as well and just a
little bit on the nose if you will and
of course that forehead though now of
course with that same damp Beauty
Blender we're gonna fuckin bounce
now I'd love to take the pointed end of
the Beautyblender and just kind of go in
on my lids so that's gonna cancel out
any redness that the foundation didn't
cancel out and just really blend the
under eye so it's really soft and
magical all right
concealer is done now it's definitely
time to brighten under eyes even more so
I'm gonna go in with my tried-and-true
trusty Mac's
Shivering white this is my favorite for
under-eye highlighting and I'm going to
take my little Lexi JD weighty brush
what number is this guy this is the one
eight one it's yummy so we're just going
to dip into the pan and highlight
under eyes are done now something I've
been doing lately is I've been taking my
damp Beauty Blender again and I've been
dipping into loose powder like one of my
favorites is the Chanel right under the
eyes it gives you this like I don't even
know so it takes them on the powder puff
like that and I'll literally just dunk
it in and this is going to set the under
eyes so they really don't crease at all
but the good thing about that Tarte
concealer it really doesn't crease but
just when you're looking down a lot and
you know moving your eyes should happen
so let's make sure they don't now
sometimes I do things in weird steps
because we're about to put powder
foundation on the rest of my face so if
you want to do that first and set your
entire face go for it but I'm just weird
and I don't know why I don't do that
so I'm gonna be going in with my Giorgio
Armani luminous silk compact and I'm
going to be taking a little artiste
brush I know you guys are used to seeing
everyone use these and put on foundation
I like to take it hammer it in there so
it is on that brush and then I like to
basically punch my face with it and by
patting this in really harshly that's
nice that work now by patting this in
really nicely you are going to just have
a face that is set all day and it
doesn't move alrighty so I think it's
time to contour all right now for this
look it is gonna be heavily contoured a
little more heavy than I normally do it
so because the focus is really very
minimal in the eyes we're gonna go full
coverage on the mask so I'm going to be
dipping into my morphe brushes that 9si
highlight and contour palette it looks a
little something like this and now I'm
gonna be going in with the morphe 5 to 7
brush I love this for contouring
especially if you want to carve out your
face and be really dramatic which that's
everyday so I usually mix two shades and
I'll start off with this guy and all dip
into that one as well for a little added
like ahh
and yeah let's start sculpting all right
so now that our cheeks are sculpted
we're gonna start going into the
forehead now this is where we're gonna
get a little heavy so I know for me the
other day when I did this makeup people
were like oh you're going in bitch I'm
always going in so this brush is really
good for the hairline because it just
really makes it blend quick and easy
just how I like it
sometimes sometimes I like it long and
for five hours but today I like it
really snatched and quick all right
I did the jaw the nose we are contour
alright now since my hair is a little
more darker shade of pink for the fall a
little magenta a little hot hot pink if
you will I am going to be using a
different brown color now I'm gonna be
drawing them on with the same brow is
that from Anasazi at Beverly Hills in
shade taupe but then I'm gonna go over
in shade Auburn which is for redheads
but it looks gorgeous with pink hair so
let's get these on
Brow's are done now let's move on to the
eyes now this part is super simple is
only going to be a few products used so
basically my lids are kind of already
primed I know sometimes I put on primer
I feel like look we've done concealer
foundation powder I feel like it is good
enough so what I normally do is I'm
going to take a little Mac - if I've to
synthetic brush and then what are we
going to do today we're gonna use a
really stark white eyeshadow as a base
and I'm gonna be going in with my busy
art palette I love this guy
so this top a right one mmm one of my
favorite and I'm just going to take this
and pack it all over the lid we want our
eyes to really stand out today and I'm
gonna take this and bring it all the way
up to the brow bone and let's coat
aren't I right
we are just going to pop a little
transition color right in here and
that's almost like the entire eye look I
kept it very simple the highlighting
that we're about to do after the eye is
kind of the star of the show if you will
but I'm going to pull out my jeffree
star cosmetics beauty killer palette and
I am going to use the top right shade
which is called Courtney this is a
perfect transition shader for doing a
crazy dark smoky eye but for today's
look it's really just gonna be like
super easy so we're just going to dip
into there and I'm just gonna blend and
pop this right in the crease and I'm not
gonna go all the way in like I normally
do I'm gonna stop it right where the
brow is and we're gonna just flick up
and blend that into the white shadow
that is already there now if you're a
very OCD about blending you're going to
go back in with that little synthetic
brush and you're just going to go right
in there now there's no product on this
brush just from what we did earlier so
I'm just going to go over the lines and
just kind of soften and merge them
together and let them blend like butter
there we go now with a little detailer
brush we're going to be going in with
shade confession now I'm just going to
add this into my crease for a little
added definition so we're just gonna
take this and tuck it in right there and
it really going to be light Handa
there's no need to be or really heavy
because we want this to stay soft and
pretty but I want a little bit of color
in there now I'm gonna go back in with
that shader brush and just gently go
over that line and there we have it
alright we are done with eyeshadow that
was really easy I know it's I'm shocked
myself now for the look I am recreating
from last week's video
I had no liner so there was no white
liner no nude no black it was kind of
like that's it and everyone is like wow
he looks so different and like soft
which is crazy so you know I know I
really don't do Halloween makeup so this
is my Halloween makeup it's soft and
gentle which is the opposite of me
alright so now for the main event we are
going to highlight for the high plans of
the cheeks we're gonna be going in with
my own ice cold skin Frost highlighting
powder and I'm gonna be using two morphe
brushes today I'm going to be using the
new rose gold 36 which is so good for
highlighting and then of course the M
510 which is very similar but this one
has a more of a little tip and this one
is more domi uh what's your favorite so
we're just gonna be dipping into this
guy and not all the way in that's where
the other highlighter will be yes
there's two highlighters today I am just
going to take this one and put it on the
high plains of my cheekbones now this
one is a really really white so if you
are pale and you can never find the
right highlighting powder for yourself
try ice cold BAM alright step one done
now for step two I'm gonna be using my
sleek makeup solstice highlighting
palette oh my oh oh oh if you are
someone that wants to blind everybody in
the motherfucking room you're gonna want
to use this next now there is a lavender
shade in here right there and oh my god
girl when I tell you that she's about to
kill everyone hmm now I am putting a lot
on the brush so if you don't want to use
this much so we're gonna take this and
we are just going to start all the way
where the contour meets oh yes time to
blind and we're gonna go all the way up
to face and layer that over ice cold
all right now we're gonna go really
heavy with the Cupid's bow hmm
now we're going to do the tip of a note
I was going to just kind of massage the
powder into the tip of my nose ooh
all right now I know I normally don't do
this but I'm gonna take a little bit on
my chin just very lightly dust it so
there is some extra shiny dimension and
the same thing for the forehead I'm just
gonna lightly kind of go in there like
uh-huh is this the full face using only
highlighters challenge now we are going
to take a little more fee of four one
one brush why is that funny for one one
in America means like you need help on
the phone like what's up the operator is
here all right so we're going to take a
little mac fix+ and this is the coconut
one and I'm going to just spray my brush
we're now going to dip into this
lavender shade again and coat the brush
now you're gonna go right in here and
coat your fucking eyes and I'm gonna
bring this all the way in and if you
feel like you went a little too severe
you can take your Beauty Blender and
kind of blend it out and now I'm gonna
take that and start putting it right
there on the lash line all right so we
are blinded and a high lighted now for
lashes we're just gonna do simple
mascara today because everyone loves
when I don't wear lashes so thank you
guys for telling me that um definitely
you can't do it all the time because I'm
scary but I'm down to do it for you um
when you guys ask nicely so I am going
to be going in with my benefit roller mm
guerra now I have an exciting little why
I'm excited I don't know but you guys
are but I'm excited benefit recently put
out a brown roller lash hi thank you
Jesus
so if you like that intense black look
of course use this but I think for the
bottoms I might use this and just try
something else
so let's of course coat our top lashes
with the black shade and then we'll
we'll try the brown
all right now we're going to go in with
the brown mascara now I have actually
never used this before so a little first
time on camera and let's see if it looks
cool
all right I am really happy with the
brow mascara I think I'm gonna start
doing this a little bit more um I love
it it's really I mean it's not that
different but I just like the kind of
more softer look at gave me all right
now last but not least is the lips now
of course I used a very soft nude lip
the first time I created this look and I
believe it was the Tom Ford blush nude
and I think I am going to I mean that
one is a great one I love that one
but I always keep going back to the
Charlotte Tilbury Kim kW lip this is
just like Oh mmm that creme brulee like
scent is everything I'm just gonna go in
with this guy and see what happens
all right the lips are done I am loving
this little schoolteacher fantasy the
last thing that this tutorial needs is
of course some setting spray and I'm
gonna be using the new Armani Prima it's
like a basically like a fixed plus but
makeup setting spray in one refreshing
makeup fix I'm like okay girl first of
all this bottle is huge which I love so
I definitely will not be needing a new
one for a long time or well nevermind
it's me what are we talking about
all right let's at this face oh my god
this one feels really good
wait also one quick thing that I love to
do because I'm really twisted in the
head as soon as you set your face I'll
take some more highlighter even with the
fan brush and I look like this
oh my is it more mmm I need fucking or
highlighting rehab oh my god okay I'm
showered and I am set this makeup look
is complete all right guys thank you so
