channel now today I'm going to be
showing you guys how to use my beauty
killer eyeshadow palette this beauty
launches May 25th and today I'm going to
be using five shadows from the palette
and I'm going to show you how to you
know create this whole crazy look now
listen I can't believe the swatch video
has gotten so much love I just can't
believe that I have the opportunity to
create a palette it's like a year and
five months ago I launched three liquid
lips and now it's like 30 colors later a
palettes coming out highlighters it's
just it's overwhelming so today let's
dive into this boy and let's have some
fun so if you want to see how I created
this keep on watching if you don't click
off and I don't know I don't know just
kidding keep on watching guys love you I
haven't done a really like a full face
glam in a second so today we're gonna be
utilizing the beauty killer palette for
the eyes but I'm gonna do a little
fast-forward and show you guys the face
routine just in case you don't we need a
little refresher so today I'm actually
gonna go back in with my law pray
foundation now I reviewed this a few
weeks ago to know a lot of you're like
thanks you probably Antoinette
again it's actually really really dope
so I'm going to apply a lot of this on
and I'm gonna be using my artiste oval-8
brush I'm obsessed with these brushes
like mmm I'm just gonna take this out of
the thing hi spatula and just like last
time I was gonna paint some on you know
me I like to go really overboard me
overboard never now I did build this up
last time I used it and off-camera I've
been wearing it a lot and it's just
really pretty it has this like
luminosity to it that most foundations
do not have come on forehead and bam all
of you do is you're gonna take this
brush and you're just gonna brush it
around your skin and it literally covers
it quick like oh hi hi left side of my
face you're already done and you're just
gonna massage it into your skin and
brush it on
we just have a moment of silence for how
good the smells I'm just like all
right now the concealer that was in this
guy-- it's a little too heavy for me
under my eyes I don't like to cake on
all that makeup I don't really need it
myself so I'm just going to go back to
my old school Jeffrey's our method of
coating my entire face with Studio Fix
so we find a big ol brush my favorite
powder brush is this Tom Ford 0/5 brush
it's just like it's perfect so we're
just going to dip into this guy and
cover my entire mug so we're just
creating a really mannequin like mask
today if you don't need this much
foundation just fast forward but if you
do pause and apply it with me and notice
how I'm kind of like smashing the brush
into my face I am packing it on I'm not
just kind of like oh girl you can't do
that you got to pack it into the skin
because we are not gonna be touching up
later we are too busy for that we got
too much weed to smoke too many dicks to
suck and we got too many shopping trips
to do so we're just gonna hack it and
pack it on and of course we're not going
to forget our neck we're gonna avoid
Grandma where's that girl and we're
gonna just our ears ever so slightly all
right now let's highlight and contour an
old-school trick that I've been doing
since the myspace days is I found this
Mac Studio Fix it is literally ghost
white so instead of packing on all that
concealer under the eyes which I don't
really need it all the time I'm just
gonna take this little NARS kabuki brush
and I just like to buff this under my
eyes almost like a little upside down
like triangle motion we're gonna bring
it all the way to my hairline because I
do like that extreme glamour and we're
just gonna buff it under and blend it in
just really get that in there and that
will ensure it does not move throughout
the day
now other areas that I do love to
highlight because I like to look very
plastic I love doing a little bit on the
chin hello Chin's been a minute how you
doing girl how's your morning all right
now we're highlighted to the gods it's
time to contour this face a little bit
now I'm gonna try something today where
don't go is severe huh
I know I
I couldn't leave a came out of my mouth
either but I'm just trying a new look
today so I'm gonna be using my little
Chanel foundation bronzer brush
I love the sky it's like airbrush on a
stick and hi Kat Von D how are you I'm
just gonna dip into that middle one and
just dot lightly on the darker one and
I'm just gonna just chisel these cheeks
a little bit mmm
now I'm just gonna do a little circular
buffing motions and I'm only gonna do my
contour to here today usually you guys
know I love to go all the way down but
I'm just gonna softly do it this way
today I just see how I like it if I hate
it great cool thing about makeup is it
washes off and you can have new
cheekbones tomorrow
so let's buff out this face forehead
nose and chin and pray that we look cute
she's going dark on that for today girl
you know what them wigs we've got to
really create that dimension we are
bronze buffed and beautiful now I guess
it's a time for some eyebrows just
kidding I forgot my nose mother-effer
and now we're gonna breeze through these
eyebrows using honest offset beverly
hills dipbrow and brow wiz
all right browser on now let's get to
these eyes now today I'm gonna create a
little go-to easy look that I am gonna
show you to Ma oh my oh my
today I'm going to show you a little
quick go-to look using that beauty
killer palette oh now you can tell them
really obsessed with China white here
because the J in the pan is like extinct
this is like my go-to I talked about
this in the swatch video I have been
putting a light color shadow under my
brow bone since the dawn of time so I'm
just going to take China white and just
bring it all the way down and I'm just
going to coat my entire lid from lash to
brow bone a whole damn thing now I get
asked a lot why I use a really light
shadow of course you can use your
favorite primer which I do do that
sometimes but when you're using any
other brights or dark colors this easily
blends it out if you didn't have
anything already down there so this is
kind of like my primer I guess you could
call it and we're just going to take
China white and just buff her to the
gods now I'm going to take this Macklowe
two to four blending brush and we're
going to dip it right into Courtney and
this is going to be our transition color
this is really easy everyone should be
able to use this color and we're just
going to pop this right in my crease
it's an easy transition color I think
anyone can pull this off it's going to
help you blend out your other shadows or
you can literally just wear this in your
crease and pop a lash on and get ready
for the day since I have no eyebrows I
like to be a little bit more dramatic
with my shadow so of course if this is
too much for you you can tailor it and
tone it down to fit your knees but I
just love Courtney it's such an easy
color it's like if you want to soften
those edges you can dip back into trying
to wipe just a little dot on your little
blending brush and you can just kind of
go over the edges and just soften them
out so they look really soft and pretty
I'm really loving vanity so I want to
dip that in and create kind of a little
deep socket in there and I have a
special surprise for you alright guys
ready for the surprise because this
isn't even in the description this isn't
even the title
I'm gonna debut it here for you guys so
I have a collab coming out with morphe
brushes yes I am obsessed with them you
guys know I use them in all my videos
I'm gonna show you a little sneak peek
of a few of them should we do it should
we do it okay we're doing it
BAM oh this is the first time I'm like
really ever showing these I did a little
sneak peek on Instagram and these are
just four of 10 brushes coming out they
are pink chrome they have the logo on it
and the morphe brush logo sorry my
lighting is so it's too pretty it's like
not showing my logos they are vegan
cruelty-free and they are so soft now I
know a lot of people vegan brushes can
be a little rough bitch this is Geoffrey
star you know this feels like uh it
feels good so I'm going to be using the
new wet more P jeffree star cosmetics
pink chrome brush and we're just gonna
dip into vanity I created brushes that
only I would use obviously I'm not going
to create something that I would not use
on myself so we're just gonna dip into
this and of course we'll do a full
reveal with all the brushes soon for a
video but I had to give you guys a
little sneak peek sneak peek sleepy so
I'm gonna talk vanity right in my crease
and just very um just put her right in
there
now I am gonna keep my eye makeup really
minimal today so this defined crease is
detrimental and I'm not gonna bring it
all the way down to my nose do you see
how if I look this way and I look down I
just kind of stopped it where the socket
meets and I'm just gonna drag and blend
it out a little more yes blending brush
feels so soft I just want to like just
gonna crest my eyelids alright now for
this lid color notice how I did leave
some room right here I want to pop in
some gold now you can put the gold in
the middle you can put it on the corners
I don't know what I want to do yet but
I'm gonna be dipping into rich bitch
with a little synthetic flat brush and
I'm gonna coat the entire back in front
of this I don't know where I want to
place it yet let's just give it a whirl
and see what happens that brush is a
little too small so I swapped it out for
one of my blending brushes and I'm just
going to pack this on the lid oh it is
so pretty and I'm gonna put it right
below vanity and mm just give it a
little just goes well
now a little cute trick if you want to
wet the brush with your fix+ it will
make that pigment really stand out so if
you want extreme pigment I would
definitely wet the brush a little bit
now notice how I'm going to tuck this
into here but not bring it all the way
up so I'm just going to kind of bring it
down right there and that's it now for
under the eyes you can do really
anything you want a lot of times I like
to leave it minimal and not really do
much but today I'm gonna kind of smoke
it out because I keep putting in like
white or nude eyeliners my waterline so
I want to give it a little bit of depth
today I am just going to pop in this Mac
smolder in my waterline
and there we go really thinly and
they're not too crazy and I'm using my
Beauty Blender to pull down my lid so
I'm not tugging and making myself look a
hundred years old over time I'm not
trying to age and if you want then girl
go for Iggy Pop but I am NOT trying to
look old black liner is done now I'm
gonna smoke this out just a little bit
so I'm just going to dip in a confession
and the black liner is going to help
buff that out and I'm just gonna take
that color and I'm going to start
dragging it across my entire under eye
really delicately and we're just gonna
blend out that lashline for mascara I'm
gonna go in with my trusty benefit
roller lash
hi I'm still obsessed with this and
can't get over it so if you've never
tried this yet get off your ass and go
get some of this especially because my
lashes are so abused lately like this
mascara is really really good now I know
a lot of you're like what about all that
glue on the underside I'm putting a lash
on so I'm not worrying about that today
if you want you can paint that with
liquid liner but my lashes have been so
just mmm not today
alright now let's get to them bottoms
like every time I don't know why I'm
shocked but bottom mascara just really
completes the look special of confession
under the eye I'm just like ooh who has
ever had the issue where you're doing me
your mascara everything's great life's
beautiful and then all of a sudden the
wand just punch your eye and your whole
day is ruined that happened to me all
last week because I was rushing too much
so that trick is take a deep deep breath
before you do this
we hit the bong and just mascara is done
now let's put on some lashes I'm gonna
be using the hood of Beauty Farah faux
mink I am obsessed with these I think
I've used these in like 20 videos but
guess what we're using them again so
let's get to it now I use my other pair
to death so I'm using a fresh pair today
so I'm just gonna cut these real quick
and slap them on and I'll see you guys
in a second the lashes are on I'm
obsessed with these as usual I'm like hi
can I be buried in these thank you for
today we're gonna be using bed jeffree
star cosmetics skin frost and shade
peach goddess and as always come on
morphe 5:10 it you can't go wrong with
this one so we're just gonna dip into
this guy and as usual we're just gonna
place this highlighter right above our
contour just blend and blend and blend
 just stop it right now with this
highlight mmm got me yummy yummy
all right peach goddess oh I'm just like
stop it right now high extreme glow let
me do a little bit on this Cupid's bow I
mean that's obviously a given if you
miss the Cupid's bow unfollow me do I
need to highlight this nose a little bit
today maybe just a tiny bit I don't want
to go overboard because the eyes are the
star of the show today now when I was in
New York with Manny he actually used two
of my highlighters on his cheeks and I
was like damn bitch why are you glowing
but why are you glowing so hard so I'm
just gonna dip into ice-cold exactly
like he did and I'm just gonna put it
right on top now I think the only thing
that is left on this look is the lips
now when I'm looking in the mirror I'm
like I could literally do any lip color
so I was looking to all my videos and
I'm like I haven't done like a nude in a
minute and I don't know I'm looking for
a nude right now I have a wonderful nude
oh hi what lip are you wearing I'm
wearing mannequin right now I'm obsessed
okay but I kind of want to wear Ares can
you uh pop it out of your vagina for me
oh hi Oh give me this right this would
be a great color on you right now listen
not just on that QVC but if you have not
read the many mu way over collab you got
the wrong bitch I know Monica this
is so good and not just because he's
standing here I actually really love
this cuz if it wasn't good I'm tell you
guys off camera so I'm gonna i'm wearing
airing today I'm wearing Ares I'm sorry
mmm-hmm come on girl
uh-huh uh-huh oh wow this got my top lip
easy like it's nice right uh-huh
uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh and I'm just
gonna be really naughty and say
something that I'm not supposed to say
but um the manic lab with Oprah is now
permanent so if you're watching this
video it's probably announced ten
minutes ago and they're permanent so if
you do not get them the first time bitch
now you have your chance and the whole
world can have them and probably buying
four of these once many ways my house
secretly now as always if you guys want
to know what I put on my entire face and
you forgot everything will be in the
description box link below and I think
the only thing really to finish this
look is some mother effing Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray listen Wendy

 truck load of this scent of my
house thank you and we're just gonna get
to spraying just all day every day
