channel hi are we waiting to learn today
because today I am testing out the brand
new color pop no filter foundation bitch
this is $12 I'm just gonna show off the
PR package right now it says you asked
we listened now we all know that there
is a color pop no filter concealer I
wasn't the biggest fan of that it's not
awful it's just not amazing but for six
dollars I was like cute
now this $12 foundation BAM look at the
amazing shade range I'm like color pop
thank you Jesus we are inclusive and
there is a shade here for everybody if
not you can mix and match but this is an
array so there is 42 foundations here
that is unreal now color pop of course
did send me this package I don't review
a lot of their stuff all the time on my
channel but this was so highly requested
on Twitter I was like let me just do
this right now let's dive into this
review now besides the no filter
foundation which let's pull this out
besides being $12 it is 0.85 ounces it
is a lightweight formula to medium to
full coverage it's allegedly matte and
if you thought colour-pop was slowing
down girl I open this box and there was
more there was more they have a no
filter setting powder + sheer pressed
powders I'm like this is a lot of makeup
so when we open up this PR package we
see that there is three different
setting powders translucent banana and
medium deep and then there are sheer
pressed powders which are these guys I'm
like jesus take the wheel
so of course today we're gonna pop out
miss translucent over here and we will
try her after we do the foundation so in
today's video I am also going to be
doing a wear test for about 10 hours yes
we will see if this foundation can
sustain the calabasas heat me running my
mouth all day I'm gonna get my nails
done I'm gonna go to dinner and we're
just gonna see how the foundation lays
so you guys know the drill one side of
my face will be with a Beauty Blender
and the other side will be with the
brush today we're gonna go in with you
more if you why 5 so we're gonna do a
little half face and see what the hell
happened so if you want to see the magic
go down then keep on watching alright
we're about to try this foundation I do
want to apply my skin so I am gonna go
in with a little bit of my iconic
favorite Bobbi Brown a vitamin enriched
face base of course you guys know the
drill we're just gonna dunk in and coat
my entire face until we are hydrate all
right we are hydrated and primed now I
have been turning my face this way a
little bit but the good news is today
for everyone out there watching is bitch
I have a pet ball let me turn you see
that guy right there I don't feel like
myself today so basically the other day
I was in the lab and I was trying on
about 50 lipsticks over drawing and just
going crazy and then mean lipstick Nick
film to videos so I broke out crazy
right good for everyone out there
because we can really see how this
foundation is gonna last because that's
always the realty is can't really hide I
know a lot of you out there like Jeff we
got perfect skin tell me more I know a
lot of you out there like girl every
foundation looks good on you but we all
know by now that is not the case so let
me shut the fuck up and let's get this
review started like I said we're gonna
do a Beauty Blender on the right side of
my face and then we're gonna use a brush
on this side so first of all I think I
was gonna mix and match these um so are
we supposed to shake this let me open up
the box and look full coverage long
wearing natural matte finish no filter
needed the same skin perfecting formula
you love now in a foundation all right
well I like to shake things anyway cuz
I'm just a little worried cute this
little PR baby little moment is back at
the hand one two three okay it's kind of
like a little liquidy foundation but I
do like to talk about every aspect of
the product all right now like 60 I am
gonna use a little bit of this to mix
because I just think it will be a
perfect match so let me just get some of
that off of here all right now we will
just mix this around with my Beauty
Blender and just go like that
bam bam bam now let's see how full
coverage this hoe really is
oh okay
whoa
definitely I'm good coverage right like
are we all seeing what I'm seeing like
honey and then that was only a few pumps
and like with the Beautyblender
obviously it's gonna absorb a little bit
of product it's not absorbing that much
all right let's try to avoid grandma we
already got someone her hair I'm so
sorry baby and then what we'll just put
it over here a little bit sorry girl
you're gonna look blurred today now
there is a big difference I'm like oh my
god coral of course the foundation is a
little darker I don't mind it it's a
little warm but I live for it and I
think once it's on my entire face and
neck it's going to blend amazing it is
kind of matte but it's more like a satin
formula to me it definitely is medium my
areas I'm not really in love with on my
face are definitely covered you probably
could add another layer I don't think I
need to but if you were to like you know
what how does this look built up I mean
we can always do that so maybe we take a
little bit more in her hand and instead
of mixing I'm just gonna take this I'm
just press more into my skin all right
so we're just gonna let that sit on my
face for a little bit and let's do this
side so once again well that was
probably way too much because a brush
honey synthetic brushes do not absorb
product so we will definitely have to
see what happens in a moment all right
this little guy is tricky now we're
gonna take this morphe brush and we're
just gonna swish it around my hand oh
wow that's a lot of product come on full
coverage let's cover this pimple
now this holds a lot of product
holy shit let me take some off my hand
look at that oh come on
tattoo cover Jesus okay you guys I put
on so much product I'm literally gonna
take some of this look at this come on
mess God this brush has hold a lot of
product Jesus look at this hi I'm
covering my tattoos with color pop
foundation for five minutes straight
let's go back to my face girl what
pimple huh what ball
with the brush honey she is really full
like I mean if you don't use a beauty
blender honey this is like really
full-coverage so the brush it applied a
lot I shared it down a little bit and it
blended actually really pretty so the
only thing I'm noticing first of all
let's do a little half and half so we
have brush over here Beauty Blender over
here and the only I don't know if I
notice a difference look at that
luminosity it's very pretty
now the Tara package I swear I'm not
blind here it says natural matte finish
right there on the box so I am getting a
little bit of naturalness but I'm also
getting like full moment so I'm not
really sure here what's going on but I
will say this I like it so far so one
thing I am noticing is that when I was
applying it for the first five minutes
it was like very kind of like dewy but
as it's drying it's setting itself and a
little more of a natural I guess yeah
satin matte finish which I live for cuz
I'm not into looking too shiny but you
guys look at that from my hand like girl
the difference is that I'm noticing from
the Beauty Blender versus the brush
obviously the brush applied a lot more I
didn't need to layer like I did with
that um Beauty Blender side but overall
I am like already like huh not bad of
course we'll see how it really wears I
will say this it is a medium to full you
can see my pimple a little bit right
there so what I would do is how it's
probably in a little more of course
we're gonna do powders and stuff but
when you have enough raised pimple it is
kind of more of course hard to cover I
could have done a green color corrector
but mine is no yet let's grab a
concealer and let's finish the space I'm
gonna go in with you makeup revolution
conceal and define I am obsessed with
this concealer for nine dollars you
really can't go wrong with that so the
color pop concealer it's in my Beauty
room somewhere I'm just gonna use this
cuz I live for it and then we're gonna
dive into the no filter setting powder
I'm gonna pull out the translucent one
right now and then we will bake the
concealer in a second so makeup
revolution recently put out new colors
thank God because I needed a lighter
shade and this is C 0.5 let's put on a
lot of concealer and let's do
happens oh wow that is light remember
when the foundation was darker than my
normal skin tone I'm like well maybe I
should what with my original concealer
but hey let's bounce what in the hell
I'm trying to blend here who is texting
me
oh oh hi Nate okay this concealer is
gonna drive 12 dollar foundation nine
dollar concealer and I'm living Who am I
here's an arrow pointing up my nose
alright the concealer is blended out it
looks amazing like makeup revolution
work I don't really see a difference
between the sides maybe this side with
the brush number the foundation was the
part with a brush but I did concealer
with both it looks pretty good actually
like wow great I feel brightened and
lifted and I'm ready for a facelift I'm
just kidding
okay so we are about to Jake the
nofilter setting powder and set our
concealer everywhere where of course we
just laid it down now the T with this
let's see the price point one more time
everybody so this is retailing for nine
dollars it comes in three shades of
course this is Miss translucent now
application tips just set foundation use
large powder brush or a full fan brush
and lightly apply powder all over the
face to set the under eye area use a
small fluff brush
blahblahblah I love using a sponge oh it
says this or a blending sponge to
lightly tap and press powder for a
crease proof long-lasting wear it's
vegan its cruelty free and I love it
well we don't love it yet but maybe we
will let's give her a whirl oh wow
that's a lot in there so let's take our
Beauty Blender let's dip in here coat
look at that that's a lot of powder
Jesus love that and there's dog hair oh
my Beauty Blender work let's give it a
whirl I'm just gonna press this into the
skin I did one more dip you dip I did he
imagined me dipping while I'm doing
tutorials just dipping into fucking
whatever it's called tabacky someone at
home is chewing right now like and I'm
gonna do a little bit more that Beauty
Blender absorb
honey oh wow that looks pretty sickening
already let's have the set for five
minutes and see what happens all right
honey we are baked huh I wish where I'm
actually sober today all right someone's
gonna take this brush we're gonna brush
off all that powder oh wow honey she
looks lift dude and I really like that
we all wiped oh my god twelve okay so my
hair is drying I'm on my period I got a
pimple
let's pray I like this sitting powder
we're zooming in everybody let's take a
peek and see what the hell is going on
here all right I'm gonna put my mirror
down and I'll let you guys see this is
what's happening with my face how do we
feel now overall this looks really nice
my under eyes are not creasing right now
it's been five minutes I know everyone
they're like Geoffrey let's see what
happens in an hour but right now she's
not creasing she looks really good and
um wow this is a really good combo I'm
kind of shocked now only thing is they
also have a no filter sheer pressed
powder that you can press all over your
face if you don't want to set it with
the powder now let's open up shade fair
and light and let's see if one of them
Oh match me oh girl I might be too light
for Miss Jane right here maybe oh wow
maybe we mix I mean come on let's it
we're good at right we're gonna take a
little Chanel brush because this is a
luxury reveal and let's see what happens
okay now I wouldn't put this over the
concealer area just around where we
didn't highlight with that Wow like I
know everyone out there might be like
what are you so shocked about girl I've
got to be honest these three combined my
skin looks really good now I've reviewed
a lot of stuff on this channel and I
kind of can gauge where the review might
be going I've been shocked a lot so let
me just take that back but sometimes you
know when a review is going really south
or if it's really good and I gotta say
my face looks like it looks really good
am i shocked right now a hundred percent
now of course this is a wear test so I
am going to finish applying this all
over and then I am gonna do a little bit
of contour and highlight I'm not going
to my full face today because I'm really
just running errands and I don't need a
full face of makeup on so let's just be
honest why would we need to if we don't
want to so we did the foundation we did
the loose setting powder and we did this
sheer pressed powder all three combined
it's good so far so good
of course we will be doing check-ins and
seeing what the hell is actually going
on so let me go throw on some bronzer
and some highlight and we'll see you
guys in a little bit let's go alright
wow dude
alright tell me everything here's my
foundation is good keep it really real
with me how does my setting powder look
excuse me cheers all the neighbors how
does my foundation like be honest you
were so cool

let's look at this skin now I gotta keep
it really real with you guys it's been
about an hour since I finished my makeup
and actually applied the foundation it's
good it is really good now of course I
do have a little bit of smile lines
right here which always crack a tiny bit
doesn't matter what I use but besides
that pimple is really snatched face to
looks airbrushed like what is going on
I'm like $12 I look this good
like I'm dumbfounded right now alright
look at the staff Dave didn't last after
a rounds a pin ball any iron maybe fans

so pinball is my literal obsession and
I've been a collector for years now I
have a whole warehouse full of pinball
machines and I keep the ones that I play

like airbrushed and like dull like it's
a ghoul skin I'm like shocked
and it's $12 and the setting powder at
nine dollars I'm like oh way like I like
I almost want to say I like this more
than the maybelline superstay that i
tried a few months ago I I'm scared to
say it because I haven't done a full ten
hour wear test yeah on if you were only

really good okay

look ugly does it look cracking does it
look fresh does it look fucking
sickening do you just want to fucking
glaze over and keep it moving
what's the energy I mean I can see a
little cracks and some pores but not not
Maddy call the doctor but overall it's
pretty fucking good right no I like it
it's very matte let me go into the sign

I'm filming the foundation review right
so the Foundation's been on for hours
you start on my face a long time you've
seen the greatest and the worst what do
you think of this foundation looks good
I mean I don't I feel a little bit of
pretty thing like right here like I have
a good life that's just old age but a
little creasing there - right opening
yeah yeah right there that's it but
overall it's good right you know what
this is
ladies it's the new color pop $12 a
foundation that's right I know I'm
shocked like looks like it's Kim oh we
heard that skin was supposed to be
medium to full and I think I just no
it's not it's really good just that
little tip of them everyone
it has creasing all right cool well
we're gonna switch out these nails
before I fly off to Michigan and we'll
see how the selection if you're ours all

oh my got me a cute little sweater a
little a little a Boy Scout cardigan
moment yeah yeah the wolf baby okay you
guys let me finish these nails and then
dinner and let's see how this foundation
is doing are you guys it is really late
I'm doing a little lip scrub right now
my lips are so dry I have some amazing
news for everyone out there other likes
a fucking really nice drugstore
foundation and you like someone things
pulled dollars honey I am so shook and
how good this citation looks like I have
no words it's one of those moments where
you never know what to expect
colour-pop is consistently great but
overall i'm not in love with their brand
i don't reach for it they do have some
staple moments I live for so we're just
want to say
shout out to colour-pop you guys are
killing the game right now this
foundation is everything it is not be
fullest so I feel like a lot of you out
there will love that now I have no
normal skin it's really not oily it's
really not dry it's just kind of like
Romaric but like I'm gonna come into the
light a little more it looks really good
I'm staring my mayor over there and I'm
like wow really no cracking except where
I already have a little
creasing in my own face but the
foundation states smooth now the setting
powder I it's like barely creased which
is very shocking I don't really have
severe bags or wrinkles under my eyes
it didn't really crease at all and I'm
like okay we're like ten hours and I'm
confused but I'm ready for bed so I do
want to say this the colour-pop no
filter foundation and setting powder are
jeffree star a prude BAM I'm happy like
because there's a lot of my friends out
there they're not into bougie-ass shit
should I get rid of them so they love a
good just like drugstore foundation and
I think that this for the price you are
getting like better quality than some of
the luxury brands and that's saying a
lot so thank you guys for watching this
review let me know in the comments
section down below what you thought of
how the products looked on my face and
I'll see you on the next one goodnight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
