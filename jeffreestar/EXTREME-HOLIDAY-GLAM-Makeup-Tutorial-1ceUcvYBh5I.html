channel now I can't believe December is
almost over it's like Christmas is
creeping up on us than the New Year I
mean I'm ready to get to 2016 so I can
put out a lot more products but in the
meantime yeah you're ready for the
holidays you guys um this is the first
Christmas I'm spending the coin
boyfriend
we are coming on 11 months holy I
haven't dated anyone in a really long
time so I am excited for the holidays
with him now usually for the holidays I
do some Christmas stuff in Orange County
California where I'm from but this year
I'm gonna do Christmas I'm gonna put a
huge dinner for all my friends and
family so besides that I wanted to do a
little fun holiday glam look now I
normally don't wear gloss but we changed
it up today and I'm giving you the drama
so I hope you enjoy this holiday look
and if you want to recreate it um send
me the pictures girl like I want to see
what you guys be doing go outside your
comfort zone do something new
enjoy watching this mwah I'm gonna start
this look by using my busy art basic
matte shadow palette and I'm gonna be
picking the lightest shade and I'm just
going to be placing that right under my
brow and bringing it all the way down to
the lash line now I have been using this
Mac 2 v 2 brush for like 10 years so I
just stick to this one I love it really
easy to blend now I'm gonna do a black
winged liner today but before I do that
I'm gonna add some soft camel eyeshadow
below just to give it that really
dramatic look I'm gonna be using this
bobbi brown eye shadow and the shade is
called camel this is the more feet 5 1 4
I have about 16 of these on my makeup
station since my eyes are deep set I'm
gonna be taking the shadow and almost
bringing it down to where the contour my
nose is and over my lid
slightly out so it will match the black
winged liner I'm about to do I'm just
going to drag it out where the brow ends
and we would deepen that later all right
now that the other side matches
perfectly I'm gonna go in with mac treat
you for blending brush and I'm gonna
take the same
bobbi brown eye shadow and just start
buffing it up and outwards now I'm gonna
be really delicate so this looks really
soft all right now to soften those edges
on the top I'm gonna go back in with
that light shade and just start blending
and blending just so they look really
nice and smooth and not cheap harsh
I'm gonna take some shadow and put it
more on my lid and carve out that Brown
alright let's add our wing alright now
for the black wing I'm going to be using
the Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper
and I'm going to be using that Tarte
black clay liner I love the stuff it
does not come off so I'm going to do the
base with this and then fill in with the
chart now when I do liner I like to hold
my breath so the line is precise so
let's have a moment of silence for the
liner
now that I got my shape down I'm going
to be using this Mac 2 6-3 brush to fill
in the rest of my liner now if you want
to do your whole eye with the liner you
can I love to use gel liners because it
really makes sure the wing does not rub
off or come off later who knows what
you're doing if you're at the mall at
the grocery store doing a bukkake you
definitely do not want your wing to come
up okay
alright now that our liner is on fleek
and can cut a bitch we are going to add
some glitter on top of the liner now my
favorite glitter brand which I have used
before is lit cosmetics
I love these you guys this shade is
called soul sister it is like a
chameleon is crawling on my lighter it's
like green yellow it looks like an oil
slick when you put it over black so I'm
gonna be using the lit liquid glitter
base and I'm just gonna dunk it in here
and I'm going to paint it over flat now
let's add some glitter
oh hello liner and alls I'm doing is
patting it on very carefully all right
both sides are done let me just sweep
away some fallout and we are good to go
where do lashes I'm gonna really smoke
out my under eye with a metallic green
and I'm gonna add in some liner so as
always I'm gonna go back to my max
smolder eye pencil and I'm gonna put
that in the waterline and then we're
gonna smoke it out with some crazy
greens and as always you guys this does
not have to be perfect because we are
going to use it to smudge how I am gonna
take the black all the way and connect
it with the wing cool if shift is
smoking all right so I'm gonna be using
this Kat Von D metal crush eyeshadow and
shade Iggy
if you guys have never tried this before
you're missing out because the pigment
on these is out of this world now you
can use this wet or dry I'm gonna use it
dry first to smoke out and then we can
see what's gonna happen
girl brushes this i'm sulfated this is
the 210th and I'm gonna start smudging
it over the black liner and just
bringing it down really light
pcome follow up we're gonna go back and
just brush off real quickly all right
now I'm going to go in with a another
morphe five one four brush and we're
going to dip it into the same green
eyeshadow and we are just going to go
over what we just did and make it even
more smoky and dramatic this green is
everything though now I like to do a
little more black so I'm going to take a
black eyeshadow and smudge out a little
bit more I know I just a black I lied
it's gonna be a dark gray color and I'm
gonna use the same brush that had the
green on it and we're just going to
lightly get them there and I'm just
going to take that fullness in the lash
line and just start smoking it out a
little more it may seem subtle to you
guys but it actually makes a big
difference now before I do my lashes I'm
going to use some mascara now I'm gonna
try this benefit roller lash today this
packaging is so cute so let's see how it
is now this one is very different for me
you guys know I like them really big
thick fat ones wait a minute I've never
used this before
oh hello oh wow okay this one the bottom
mascara I'm like obsessed now before I
do my lashes I probably don't have
enough calories to make through that so
I have some pizza please what's the
Domino's shoutout to you I'm using free
breeze though for lashes today I'm going
to be using flutter lashes in style Lela
these are big and dramatic so clearly I
need to be using them as always I'm
gonna be using my duo vegan lash glue
these lashes are very dramatic so I'm
just going to try to get them as close
to my lash line as possible so that
glitter is not hidden I like to take my
real lashes in the false one and kind of
mesh them together lashes are done let's
get to highlighting for highlighting
today I'm going to be using two products
the first one is this Mac
mineralize skinfinish this shade is
called perfect topping I love this one
iridescent without looking too crazy I'm
going to use this first now as usual
where the highlight and the contour
meets we are just going to put in some
product now this is subtle we are going
to be doing another highlight on top of
it I just love how this looks okay we're
going a little bit above our Cupid's bow
in a day on the nose now for my second
highlight on top of this I'm gonna be
using this honest Rasta highlighting
brush it makes any pigment come out
really nice so I'm gonna be using this
color pop a highlighter in shades Boone
I love this one I've been wearing this
all the time lately oh my god I love all
those looks looks like silver surfer
from a Marvel Comics just came on my
cheek I'm gonna spring it up a little
bit here so my brows don't feel so left
out
alright and to make sure my powder
highlight everything stays nice I'm
gonna be using setting spray today I'm
gonna be using the makeup forever mist
and fix spray I'm smells really good
just let that settle in and now it is
time the lipstick alright now this look
and have several type of lip so for the
first one I'm gonna do a nude lip now
Bobbi Brown just released new lipsticks
oh my god I'm obsessed with these this
shade is called mod M OD and it's a nice
peachy type nude I'm just going to this
right on here is the new lipstick if
this is not Christmas enough for you
which to be honest I love the shade but
it's not Christmas enough for me so I'm
gonna switch it out real quick and do a
full red glossy lip with just one
product that I'm gonna wow you with with
this red look I wanted a really big
bright red but with a gloss and I found
this product at Sephora it's called the
C on teh London that's the brand shade
is called bombshell and I might buy 12
more oh my god and it smells exactly
like sweet tart candies you guys one
swipe I'm like hello I'm hooked sure
