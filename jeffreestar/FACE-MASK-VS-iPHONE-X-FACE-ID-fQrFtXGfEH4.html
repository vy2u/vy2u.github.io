channel today oh my god today what the
hell are we gonna do today you guys ok
so the other day I got the new iPhone X
are we calling it the X the iPhone 10 I
gotta say one thing it is so weird not
having a button like I am so used to the
fingerprint my brain is just like not
having it basically when you live your
life online and you take pictures all
day you want the best camera so of
course I had to get it when I saw the
camera quality I was like girl you
better swipe right on snapchat once and
get that beautiful filter because my
pores are gonna be even more accentuated
okay there's been a lot of stuff going
around about the face ID now I know a
lot of you are probably wondering
Jeffery where the hell have you been
it's been a week without uploading I had
another root canal I've been under the
weather I have been really working hard
on next year's collections for my brand
I'm wrapping up holiday there's been so
much going on but basically you guys I
had a root canal the other day it was
deadly I have been in so much pain I'm
good now your girl's back but when
you're on codeine you can't help with
video but we are here so I was gonna
film a video as soon as I got this in
the mail to see if if I put on a full
face of makeup will the phone
recognizing me but sister James Charles
already proved that it will work so I
said you know what let me try a face
mask some wigs some contacts and see if
it will let me into my own phone so I'm
seeing a lot of videos of the face ID
right a lot of people aren't showing you
how to set it up so if you do not have
this phone or you've never seen it I do
want to walk you through how the iPhone
records your face it's very easy it's
very quick so we're gonna show that
process and then I'm going to put on a
new pink mask a wig some contacts some
lipstick and let's see if I can break
into my own iPhone so we are going to
log in here now it says face ID and pass
code we're going to click that it wants
me to of course enter my passcode which
I will be doing right now so now that we
are in I'm going to actually turn around
this is the first time I'm turning
around on my channel this feels really
weird so as you see it says where's the
face ID setup face ID BAM it's just that
easy let's click it and now
is how to set up face ID first position
your face in the camera frame then move
your head in a circle to show all angles
of your face so it's kind of like the
fingerprint we all most of us know you
put your fingerprint on the iPhone you
move it around ever kind of like records
your fingerprint and then voila you want
in BAM
alright so let's get started oh-ho there
I am oh my god that lighting is this
shit's you guys position your face
within the frame move iPhone a little
lower
I think the lighting because of my
beauty lights is not letting me you guys
let me try oh my god I think it's too
backlit pulling you guys I'm moving over
here moving over here oh wait here we go
here we go here we go move your head
slowly to complete the circle first face
ID skin complete holy
okay so continue move your head slowly
to complete the circle looking about the
 chiropractor there we go face ID
is now set up done okay so now we are an
you guys so basically when you want to
first of all go out of an app you just
swipe up there right so I want to click
the side of my phone we are now of
course dark so let's click the phone BAM
okay
oh hi Nate now you're gonna swipe up so
it's basically waiting to do face ID
okay so of course there was no face in
front of it it went dark let's click it
again face ID we're in the phone BAM
okay so now we know it has my face
recorded first of all when it's backlit
don't try that at home because that was
difficult okay so now that Apple knows
who I am so now we are going to do a
little God my hair is up you guys
when you wear a wig every day or you
just have your hair in a bun
this is what happens okay so we are
going to take the new Boscia pink
aluminized mask and we're gonna put it
all over our entire face now this is a
math that you peel off I know a lot of
you have seen the ones that are for I
think it's actually the same one the one
that is like pure black that one is the
same thing this is just a new shade so
this is the pink version this has pine
bark extract in it vitamin C we're
supposed to promote skin elasticity
we're supposed to brighten and we're
supposed to reduce the look of fine
I'm always going to do that who isn't
okay so we're gonna put this on and then
we're going to put in some contacts and
then we're gonna try a wig and then
we're gonna see if she recognizes me all
right let's get started
so with this mask we're gonna apply a
thick opaque even layer to clean dry
skin avoid eye area eyebrows hairline
and lips well thank God I don't have any
brows and then we're gonna wait 30
minutes and then peel off all right now
I have never used this one before I know
this just came out and I've been dying
to try this now quick tea I was actually
gonna put out a pink face mask but a lot
of brands have beat me to it doesn't
mean I won't in the future you never
know
oh is bubble gum shade I'm living mmm
same fresh smell as the black one now
let's apply this baby
all right now that it looks like my face
is melted plastic this is such a cool
shade of pink it literally matches this
mirror looks like I like melted this
down and then drizzled it all over my
face or it looks like strawberry come
yeah
strawberry come all right first of all
these mirrors early December there's the
tea okay anyway back to the video all
right so we're going to let this dry
this does take a minute to dry I love
this look all right now we are also
going to take some contact lenses from
des Co the ones that make my eyes look
very ice white and we're gonna pop those
bitches in right now right there baby
les roll BAM I did get a little bit of
mask on my finger sorry about that
look at me trying to blow in the damn
mask oh so there is a difference between
one eye and the other let's get the
other one in alright
the contexts are in my hair is getting
masked ow oh my god okay so this mask
does take 30 minutes to dry so I'm going
to let it dry off-camera I'm gonna throw
in a wig and then let's see what the
 happens all right you guys I threw
on a wig with bangs look at this little
fantasy hi okay this mask is fully dry
it's hard to talk see it's getting
wrinkled around my mouth and low alright
