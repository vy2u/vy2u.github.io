channel today I'm not at home I am at
the four seasons in New York City and
last night was the Fenty Beauty launch
with Rihanna of course you all know by
now that she just released her makeup
line it is making headlines all over the
internet and today we are going to dive
into all the products now the launch
party was lit it was an amazing
experience to just see the beauty
community come together for such a
monumental moment so in today's video I
have all the products here that Rihanna
launched from foundations to brushes to
highlighters to cream contour sticks to
everything we got lip gloss we got
sponges we got invisible blotting powder
there's a lot here so if you want to see
some swatches I'm gonna apply it to my
face we're just gonna have a little
playdate in bed today now if you saw my
snapchat you know you got a little
spoiler the highlighters I'm just gonna
say it now fucking bomb now I have not
tried anything else
so the highlighters are pretty good of
course we're gonna apply them to my skin
we have sticks and powders so also I
just want to give you guys a quick
little tea that I am in a hotel room so
the lighting and sound is gonna be a
little different then if I am at home in
my studio so if the light fluctuates we
are literally using daylight behind us
and there's like 10 skyscrapers and the
Sun keeps going in out of the clouds
so if it looks a little off I apologize
bear with me alright you guys let's jump
right into the video all right you guys
let's dive into the products I'm sure a
lot of you have been dying to see them
in action as well as me I went to bed
last night and I woke up just thinking
about makeup and I couldn't wait to play
by now most of you know that rihanna
launched Fenty beauty it is a Sephora
exclusive and they did a huge launch
where they think they launched in like
17 countries last night it's on their
own website it's on Sephora it is
everywhere and if you're in Europe it is
available at Harvey Nichols I believe
now there's a lot of products here so I
was like damn girl I love that she
didn't just come out with like one thing
she's like BAM and I think something
that was really cool and important to
note is that her brand is very inclusive
and she spent a lot of time working on
this and the foundations you guys there
are 40 shades with I think even more
come
and I think that is so epic because a
lot of the times y'all know brands
release foundations and there's like ten
shades and you're like girl so the fact
that she spent a lot of time perfecting
the formulas and creating a really cool
shade range I think is really awesome so
today we're gonna start and do every
park that I have laid out in front of me
I do want to note that I do have all the
prices here so I'm gonna go over
everything with you guys and we're just
gonna have a little playdate right now
all right so let's get started so the
first item is which is great a face
primer so this right here you guys is
the pro filter instant retouch primer
now this is supposed to let's read it
smooth pour diffusing finish with
extended makeup wear girl you know I'm
about that life that comes in this
beautiful glass component with the nude
on top and it also matches the
foundation so here's what the foundation
looks like now this does feel very nice
and luxurious y'all know I am NOT about
no lightweight packaging this feels
heavy now in this bottle there is one
point eight fluid ounces and that's a
lot for a primer love it but let's see
if it works that's the rotate here so
here's what the primer looks like it is
like a lotion like consistency and oh
yeah it kind of feels like so we are
going to just take some and apply it to
the skin
all right so the primer is on it feels
nice it doesn't feel too tacky it feels
kind of smooth and it does feel a little
hydrating it's not like I didn't suck in
my moisture which is nice all right now
this primer does retail for $37 looks a
little up there for a primer but if it
works it works of course the foundation
is kind of what I have been highly
anticipating of putting on this is the
soft matte long wear foundation it's
called the pro filter as well and the
box says medium to full coverage for all
long wear light as air it did match my
shade at the event there was a lot of
crazy lights so hopefully I got a good
match I have no idea what's about to
happen here so besides the foundation
which by the way retails for $34 there
is also a beauty sponge and that is the
precision makeup sponge it looks a like
this it's flat on one side and around on
the other with a flat tip now this is
retailing for $16 and so for it says
that this is a three sided makeup sponge
designed without latex perfect for
applying and blending all formulas use
damp for buildable coverage or dry for
full coverage of course we know that
beauty blenders and other sponges do
soak up a little bit of product I'm
gonna use it damp because that's how I
normally do it I want to feel
comfortable so let's just take the
foundation and let's put some on our
hands well just do two little dollops
and we'll see how it goes I don't know
how quick it dries yet I don't know the
coverage so let's give it a whirl
all right so I'm just gonna blend out
half of my face and let's see how it
looks
all right you guys the foundation is
blending out beautifully I'm only gonna
do one side of my face so you guys can
see what is happening but I just put a
little bit more under my eyes the sponge
is blending it out pretty nice now this
foundation does dry quick so I'm glad
that I only did half of my face because
sometimes all this dot all over and then
it dries a little bit more over here so
here's my face with half of the
foundation and half without so for a
little first impressions we're gonna
zoom in a little bit and let's take a
look at the skin now the foundation
looks looks beautiful honestly like I'm
looking at my skin like it is very
smoothing I'm looking back like damn
girls a little jacked up so far so good
now I also forgot in this crazy goody
bag so we got the products of course at
the party and I was just looking to the
bag and there's actually a brush that is
also for applying so we got the sponges
we got the brushes and this one is a
full-bodied foundation brush which is
full firm airbrushed full coverage so I
thought why not try the brush for the
other side of my face so here it looks
like this it has a little guard of
course with the logos on it it is a
synthetic of course that's how we apply
creams all right so let's just take the
foundational width of the brush and
let's see how it applies is it better
than a sponge do we live oh wow
alright now I'm going in on the neck to
blend down of course and I will say this
I live for this brush and how it applied
it the sponge I thought worked great and
then I tried this and I'm a little bit
more in love I don't even know why I
mean obviously it's the tool it just
looks even more airbrushed on the side
from the brush and it actually applied
quicker and definitely gave me that full
coverage moment maybe the damp sponge
wasn't the best idea also when I put it
on it did oxidize very slightly and I
loved how it looks so that's not really
a negative for me so just be mindful if
you are buying your shade you might want
to go a shape down if you are worried
about you know shopping online because
you can't touch or see it but of course
these products are in store so if you
are a little weird about a girl and go
at the mall the foundation is dry and
they were telling me at the event last
night that the foundation kind of like
sets itself so I'm feeling it and it
doesn't feel tacky it feels really nice
now you know you've been watching my
channel for a while you know I love a
full mask of powders after the
foundation but I will say this I'm not
mad at how my skin looks it looks the
lawless and it looks very nice now they
do have a belonging powder so maybe in a
minute I'll put blotting powder under my
eyes no I love the component for this
one it's like this weird shaped little
compact that opens up the back of this
of course that has a little sponge with
it and then of course the protector now
this is a universal blotting powder this
is $32 for the in division at blotting
powder this says that it absorbs shine
and diffuses the look of pores for an
instant filtered look on the fly I'm
gonna do that right now because my pores
are annoying so I cleaned off the
foundation brush and I'm just going to
dip in here really quickly and I'm just
gonna press it under my eyes and see how
I feel about it
all right you guys so it is giving a
little bit of a blaring effect which you
know I am all about I want to look as
plastic and fake as possible okay cool
well this will be interesting to see
later if I have shine and I go in if it
really does take it away but for now
it's doing a little blurring effect and
so far so good now we are going to dive
into the matchsticks I know a lot of the
online have been like what the hell are
those I tweeted some pictures of them
last night and here is what they look
like so they are magnetized I love this
packaging because it looks like a
honeycomb and if you didn't know I got
honeycomb and bees tattooed on me now
there are two formulas there is a mat
which is kind of like contour and
highlighting sticks and then there's
also the matchstick shimmers which are
crazy highlighter colors we have golden
and orange and purple and and the shade
names were pretty cool so let's just try
it as contour one and this one is called
mocha
now these matchstick matte skin sticks
retail for $25
and let's see a magnetized makeup stick
in a long wear light as air matte
formula to conceal correct contour or
touch-up in 20 shades so I guess we're
just gonna give it a whirl I'm gonna
contour with this a little bit now only
thing is I don't have any powder contour
from her brand to put over it so if it
doesn't set itself and its tacky I will
put a little bit of powder on top now
this product also has 0.25 ounces in it
I know a lot of you read me to filth
when I reviewed a other contour stick
every months ago and I did not show how
much product was in there so let me put
this all the way up here is what you get
in this product I think that is a lot of
product because it is more fat I'm just
gonna say it because all of you are
gonna read me I know they k'kaw contour
sticks were a lot smaller with a lot
less product and a lot of you had
problems with them breaking off this one
is more sturdy it feels more expensive
and there is a lot more parked in here
so I have no idea how this covered is
gonna look I'm just gonna start here and
do a little line in case it's intense
BAM I'm just gonna go on this jaw line
and go
after looking in the bag I forgot
there's actually a little brush that
says contour and concealer brush which
looks like this so I guess if it works
it works now then first the bristles
here feel a little bit hard they just
don't feel as nice as the this brush or
the highlighting brush so let's see if
it wants to blend out
all right I feel like the brush took a
little extra work to really get it in
there I would probably just go in with a
sponge or a different tool that I
already had just to make it quicker with
the brush it's not I mean it worked
right y'all see you on camera I'm just
gonna buff it out with the sponge and
give it a little bit more of like a
airbrushed finish this brush actually
worked a lot better than this little guy
wasn't too big of a fan of this little
brush but this way quicker so this is
great for a little foundation the
blotting powder I'm like using this for
everything I must blend it out a lot
easier I know I'm really liking it we
are blended to filth and I apologize you
guys for the lighting in today's video
the litter like the Sun just disappeared
behind some skyscrapers okay cool so
before we dive into the powder
highlights I know a lot of you are dying
to see those in action there are of
course the matchstick shimmer sticks now
they're kind of funky and fun some of
them of course are more neutral this one
which I know Briana this wore for the
cover of her Elle magazine shoot was
this purple guy called a unicorn this
shade called confetti lord help me it's
so pretty
I swatch this at the party and I was
like girl now normally you guys when you
take a cream product and you just drag
it over your foundation it can lift a
little bit so I am just going to put
some on my hand and let it warm up a
little bit and then if you guys are
afraid of ruining your foundation or
anything you can take your fingers and
let's just let it warm up a little bit
and we're just gonna literally take this
and Pat it on your cheeks and this is a
really cool tip that lipstick Nick
taught me so we're just gonna go right
in over that contour and it's okay if
it's a little subtle at first you don't
want to you know ruin your beautiful
foundation
so here is confetti on the cheeks I
think it looks beautiful it's serving me
that alien like sex goddess realness
that I'm living for and I love how it
has like a little bit of glitter like in
it as well as like a high volume shine
so I'm gonna do what I always do is take
the light on my phone and let's see how
this looks I know the Lighting's gonna
be a little crazy but hear me out guys
oh that is pretty stunning so of course
we can layer them with powder but we'll
try that in a minute I do want to do the
I've been dying to try the unicorn one
here we go this is full-on purple darker
than confetti so there is a unicorn on
my hand it is definitely a way brighter
lilac purple and I'm just gonna take
this stick and see how it looks if I
just paint on let's just give it a try
and then I'm gonna take the sponge that
with the no product on the end and I'm
just gonna kind of buff around it and
let's see if it likes that or not
now I love this one because it is
definitely like more subdued and it's
definitely ethereal giving you that
little more subtlety vibe so if this is
a little too crazy for you this song
isn't definitely right up your alley
alright so one of the colors that I
think is so stunning is chili mango I
was just testing on my hand and blending
it out I think for any woman of color
this is going to be a stunning cream
blush with a little bit of shimmer in it
I love this I would definitely even use
this sounds like an eyeshadow base they
were also talking about at the event how
you can put them on your lips and do
everything so these are very versatile
which I love now there is a face
highlighting brush this is the cheek
hugging highlight brush for $32 now I
use this at the event and I fell in love
with it because it really placed the
powder right on the cheeks let me show
you if I can get this damn thing open
now this is a weird shape for I brush I
love it it's kind of giving me that 3d
look and it has this thing almost like
cut into it where it's gonna like
definitely go right on the cheek and I
tried this last night I live for I can't
wait to try it again now let's move on
to the powder highlights these are the
kilowatt freestyle highlighters girl
know you all know I'm obsessed with
highlighting and these definitely do it
justice I think the star of the show is
trophy wife Rihanna wore this to the
party last night I wore it all over my
cheeks on snapchat it is beautiful so
let's go in with trophy wife now these
retail for $34
come on highlight of course this is
high-end and this says it is a
weightless long-wear cream to powder
hybrid highlighter that comes solo or
paired so they also do come in duo's
with other shades and they look like
this now let me demonstrate this for you
guys and tell me what you think let's
get this blank cheek ready alright so
we're just gonna take the brush barely
go in a lot of pigment goes on there so
these are definitely
all right let's give it a whirl once
white people Rihanna ain't playing
alright you guys so that was literally
one two dips in the pan now I'm gonna go
in a little bit more on the brow so we
can really show off this color now it is
packed with glitter and amazing pigment
like when I tried B's I was like oh my
god bitch now of course I gotta do the
flashlight test but look how it looks on
the actual face and cheeks it is unreal
like whoa I'm obsessed okay I think I'm
gonna need this the formula and every
shade please and just because we're
sitting here we got to do some of the
chest and body open have this robe a
little bit now if you are someone who
likes to wear dresses or low-slung tops
just look at my chest you guys Jesus it
is so stunning I'm like definitely
obsessed with this even the light what
that cream is stunning but then you go
over here and you're like holy shit
alright also for fun we're gonna take
the shade a metal moon it is a more icy
straight up white kind of like duochrome
highlighter and I'm gonna put that over
this side just so you guys can see
little versatility so let's just put
this over it and see what happens
now of course this is not show up as
blinding as this one with the glitter in
it this one does not really have that
glitter payoff but it still has a
beautiful icy duochrome moment and I
live for it let's get the flashlights
out one more damn time because you know
I just got to see this in action yes now
you do see the flakes of glitter when
the light hits your cheeks it is a
little more subtle than the other side
but still beautiful so also I mentioned
of course that these come in a duo type
of formula so there are four other ones
that have the split Pan's and they're
just as blinding so if you really want
your shade they got all the shades for
you and they're all really pretty I'm
like hi there look at my hand it's like
a glittering mist
alright you guys we are down to the
final product I don't want to end
alright so this is the Fanta beauty
gloss balm Universal lip Luminizer
alright so what is this supposed to do
this is a gotta have it lip gloss with
explosive shine that feels as good as it
looks in one Universal Rose nude shade I
love it so literally this shade is
supposed to look good on any skin tone
and anyone the stop everything give it
to me gloss that delivers explosive
shine in one perfect shade handpicked by
Rihanna herself the Fanta glow we're
talking the unicorn of nudes that looks
good on everyone girl
we're just gonna try it out right now so
this one is it comes in this cool of
course honeycomb type of moment and I
like the wand on this because it is
jumbo I love a product that has a big
wand because it gets my big old mouth
done quickly so let's give it a whirl
there is the universal gloss with an O
this is just daylight on my face right
now and now here it is with of course
the light with its gloss is really
pretty definitely kind of like an
everyday gloss is it imperative to own
this gloss I don't think so there's
definitely a lot of drugstore dupes for
this one everything else I'm not sure
about that but this one it's you know
there's nothing special about it I think
it's pretty but it's not necessary um
all right you guys I think it's time to
give my final thoughts so let's go down
the line I gotta say Rihanna
you fucking killed this makeup line the
formulas are on point now that I
expected anything less but you never
know because there has been a lot of
people lately that have been launching
products and they're kind of subpar and
it's just like oh I'm a celebrity let me
slap my name on something and call it a
day I see the vision of this brand the
formula is great and I'm really happy
how everything turned out so let's just
go down the line the primer is the
primer necessary I y'all know I have
some of my favorite primers already that
I film with all the time I probably
won't be grabbing this a lot just
because it says it's gonna blur my pores
and do a bunch of stuff and I still kind
of see my pores it wasn't the best
primer on earth but the foundation girl
if you want a good new foundation I
swear to God I am obsessed with this one
also Laura Lee has filmed with this
today and her skin
drop the mic bitch her skin looked
flawless so we're both huge fans of this
and I think that the formula is on point
of course we are going to see how this
wears throughout the day but we've been
filming for about an hour now and my
skin has not moved and here's the crazy
thing I didn't set it really I did the
blotting powder under but I didn't do a
powder foundation over it and it like
set itself and it still feels good it
doesn't feel weird
so bitch this is everything moving on
contour sticks y'all know the half of
the world is not even into cream contour
or maybe most of the world we all love
powders so I definitely think that I
would just normally just do powder
contour personally I'm sure Rihanna will
be coming out with powder contours so I
don't think those were really necessary
but they did blend out great once I used
this brush
the brush that came with I did not like
it all I felt like it was a little too
rough and it didn't blend it out nicely
it was like kind of too patchy and the
brush is a little too bulky I almost
wish that it was longer to give it a
little bit more of a flare but this
brush saved the day it killed it with
the foundation the blotting powder and
the contour so this brush is definitely
gonna be staying in my kit now moving on
to the match stick sugar sticks you know
I love them I mean look at this cheek it
looks like an alien sat on my face and
then stood up and left it's lime and I
love it all right besides that I'm
holding trophy wife I can't let it go I
feel like it's the only one on earth I
just have to have it this was a star of
the show for me the glitter the pigment
it was unreal I think I'm gonna douse my
entire body with this and just wear high
heels later so besides that I'm a huge
fan of these now of course we all saw
the lighter one I think this one is a
little bit better this one was still
pretty but I like intense makeup I'm
gonna tend to a bitch so this one was
cute trophy wife is a little better
the duo ones of course I have not tried
on my skin yet we will try those in
later videos but just from watching them
on my hands on point you guys I'm
looking around now besides that what
else do we have of course we have the
lip gloss which I don't think the lip
gloss is that's the only thing that was
kind of like and for me it's a gloss it
didn't do anything mind-blowing but it
still is pretty so if you want to grab
it grab it
alright you guys add so much fun playing
with all the offending beauty products
I'm just gonna say it right now the
Fenty Beauty collection by Rihanna is
Jeffrey star approved I am a little
shook at how consistently great it is
overall I was expecting a few products
to be bangers and maybe a few misses cuz
you never know you guys it's makeup
not everyone can execute everything
flawlessly but somehow Rihanna managed
to really slay so congrats girl your
makeup line is everything I cannot wait
to see what you put out next
alright you guys thank you so much for
watching this review here from New York
City I will see you guys back home and
on the next video mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
