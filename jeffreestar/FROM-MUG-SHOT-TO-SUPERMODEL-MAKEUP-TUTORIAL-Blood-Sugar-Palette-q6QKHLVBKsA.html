looks on set it was just so vibrant
stunning beautiful full pink fuchsia
purple orange like oh it was just
everything I needed so we recently flew
to Texas for this shoot now when you saw
the palette what got this going I think
that print color that like a bright
reddish orange it's so pretty and I just
wanted to use it with pinks and just
super vibrant pop I oh yeah I would
definitely have a lot of pop and color
in here I just love I think it's very
like Jeffrey but also very just like I'm
the lips different and normally don't
wear a lot of light colors I know I make
a lot of them cuz you guys love them so
when she did the lip at the end I was a
holy but in today's video we're
gonna watch Nicole transform and create
this amazing eye look
now of course she is the I mean you're
kind of like the head makeup artist now
okay yes title and she created all the
looks for me on set you guys will see a
few more videos later so we're just on a

you guys if you want to see how to get
this snatch globe look then
keep on watching hi everyone alright so
Nicole did my foundation contour
highlight powder concealer off-camera I
think you guys know my routine thus far
so we're going to dive into the crazy
blood sugar look so what are we gonna do
first baby we're gonna do your crease
first so we're gonna start to the bangs
up we're gonna pull out of the purples
and we're gonna use that bright orange
color prick
yes and then we're gonna use in humble
these dark tones too so we're gonna kind
of use okay not Purple's Pink's and or
get low on today yeah just a little
simple look so you're gonna go in with
glucose and sugar cane and kind of
mixing them together for your brow bone
okay and then a lot of people may ask
what you use on my brows today to draw
them on so Nicole always free hands them
like it ain't nothing did the Anasazi a
dip brow brow yep and that's the color
taupe yeah yeah on set we actually for
this photoshoot we use the palette we
did cuz I had like a dusty rose awake
today we're gonna serve you some
platinum blonde but we did custom create
the brow
brow bone is highlighted what's our next
step
cake mix okay so we're gonna dive in
into a little cake mix there's placing
that in the crease come on crease so if
someone has more like a hooded eye or a
folded eye what do you suggest because I
get that all the time and a lot of
people are like what would Nichole do
I'm like well let's ask her keep Matt
use mostly matte colors which is great
because there's a bunch of them in a lot
of Matt's in this palette you're gonna
pull the colors up higher so that you
can open your eye you can actually see
them right you'll just have to bring
everything up slightly doesn't matter
what your eye shape is girl you can make
it work do it right a lot of practice
and what okay we're gonna add some pink
to this eye shake a little bit cavity a
the bright pink and the palette I love
this it's like a purpley pink it's
different I wanted to be a really
different than star power from the
beauty killer palette which is like so
neon I mean this is still bright as
but it's just a different tone yeah
definitely a different tone it's so
pretty
what we gonna do next root down canal
yeah all right you need one I know eight
root canals which I'm sure if you watch
the pilot reveal you know that yeah
they're fun aren't they yeah do you
really need like yeah yeah I'll go with
you and okay well we're gonna to have
been to Rio right so where you gonna put
that one we're gonna put that deep in
your crease right underneath
okay cavity I'm gonna hold this like
your hand model yeah hand model like
your um dress this dance talk more that
game from next we're gonna make this a
little bit darker okay and I'm gonna
take a little bit of coma BAM the shade
on the far bottom right right here we're
gonna put that right here on the outer
crease okay
also in case anyone is gonna ask Nicole
to scrap a lot of my brushes that are
just sitting here so it's literally all
types of brushes you guys from morphe to
gucci to spectrum to Chanel there's a
variety a variety there's a lot of so
they're just all random just what is
Murphy though yeah also a quick story
Nicole actually introduced me to the
owners of Murphy years ago and she was
the person that walked me into their
first ever Burbank location in
California and she was like hey these
are my friends Linda and Chris and it's
just crazy that like years later we're
like doing retail and all these cool
things so thank you yeah our first ever
class that we taught makeup classes
together when we were hustling trying to
make that money together and we did at
the morphe store which which was our
first one ever nautical is just off on
her own teaching the world is slaying
the kids all right now Nicole is gonna
dive into shade prick right here that
has the needle imprint in it yay one of
my favorite shades love this color this
is like the third or second shade I
created for the palette but this all
over lid okay
all right with it next we're gonna take
a little fresh meat okay and we're gonna
put this right underneath your lower
lashline smoke me up
all right now to coal is gonna dip into
shade cavity the pink one again and
we're gonna do both of that we're gonna
blend out fresh meat with it
Oh boom all right now we're gonna dip
into pop punk pop tickle but it's just
to blend it out and kind of melt it into
with your skin color okay
all right you guys I'm quickly gonna do
some aligner and lashes off camera if
you watched our previous tutorial you
know I like to do it myself because my
eyes do get a little sensitive with all
this trauma okay so we are going to do
the what is this shape this is the color
pop nude liner the shade name wore off
so it's the nude liner and then of
course the roller lash mascara from
benefit so be right back just do a
little tiny baby winged liner Oh what
are we using
we're using the Tom for our favorite Tom
Ford liner okay it's not using that
can't stop won't stop okay we're gonna
do some lashes we're using the new
bounce some new bounce in style
Serengeti very giddy they are so
stunning richer they're on they're gonna
like take that Iliff to the next level
oh wow
all right Nicole actually wanted to add
a little bit more detail we forgot
something so she's into going with
candyfloss right on your inner corners
was like a little highlight okay
highlight my baby
cool so we're gonna use self-control one
of the new colors okay love it different
you can always do a nude lip if you do a
bright eye it's easy but let's take it
there
all right you guys here is the final
look like I just did my roots the magic
of wigs so for this shoot we had this
long dusty rose wig David has it in his
