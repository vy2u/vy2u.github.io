a lot of new makeup no I buy so much
makeup I think you guys know that by now
but I just want to sit down here hangout

what are the rules you guys you know I
like to keep it simple on this channel
nothing crazy all you gotta do is be
subscribed to my channel and leave a
comment down below and just say hi how
are you fuck off suck a dick I love
makeup I don't care what you say just
sound off below
alright let's dive into the video how
are you guys first of all how are you
it's been a crazy day it's been a crazy
week it's been a crazy January is
January over yet thank God it is okay
let's just plan some makeup now here's
the kicker you guys I got a lot of shit
on my desk here I have three primers I
wish you all were in front of me to pick
and do a poll but we can't do that today
we have this new primer I found on
Sephora called the beauty filter creme
glow I mean the name itself makes me
want to try it and then we have a pore
perfecting primer from Lancer we have a
guerrilla blurring active base soothing
and blurring effect you guys know I love
the soothing but this one caught my eye
because it says that it also provides
coverage and brightening to the skin
tone I don't know what the fuck that's
supposed to mean but I kind of want to
find out so this is from brand called
Sun and
I've actually never heard of this brand
before so this is kind of cool and
interesting so the packaging looks like
this it comes in a little jar it
actually feels heavy it appears to be
glass it feels expensive which is nice
and when you open it it comes with this
little guy which I'm sure is the spatula
of course to remove the product now I
don't really care about these I'm just
gonna use my finger cuz girl my hands
are clean mm-hmm this reminds me of like
an ocean vacation let's try the skin and
see what the hell happens this feels a
little tacky which is great because we
all know the foundation is gonna stick
um nice now I'm a little confused by the
box you all know this is about to be a
real first impressions it says that is
once it's absorbed into the skin
providing coverage and brightening I
mean I guess it's a little glowy
it also says caution if skin develops
abnormal symptoms and side effects such
as red spots swelling and itching while
using this product please discontinue
use I hope that doesn't happen to me
so let's dive into some foundation now
there's a lot of foundations that just
draw and drop recently first of all
we're gonna use the new Beauty Blender
teal color of course I mean if there's
even a new Beauty sponge it's going in
today's video oh my god you guys I
forgot there's so much thick this is so
many products hitting here I'm kind of
shook so hourglass recently put out the
V vanish flash highlighting sticks okay
girl the packaging is so cute
you guys know I love the foundation so
I've seen people put this on before
their foundation and I'm always kind of
like does that really work I mean you're
literally covering it but it may give us
a little glow and you never know so you
can use this of course as a highlighter
we're gonna put on our face buff for the
foundation and let's see what happens
I'm gonna take this actually let's just
blend it in a little bit I've seen
people do this with the foundation I'm
just gonna do this for fun I know a lot
of your guy girl what the hell are you
even thinking today moving on what shade
is I because I don't want you guys to
hurt me okay this is gold flash like
that name foundation there's a new
formula from Dior of course and it is
called the Dior skin forever under cover
24-hour wear full coverage fresh
weightless foundation high pigment and
water-based okay let's do this so I
bought four shades and I am going to be
mixing ten and fourteen today I'm not
sure how full coverage this is it says
it is but you know I'm a full coverage
bitch so let's just mix and match let's
see how this goes on oh is it a lot I
don't know we'll see in a minute
I'm a little shocked this foundation
looks really nice
it's like kind of luminous maybe it's
the primer maybe it's the highlighting
stick but whatever this combo is I'm
definitely liking it this foundation is
really pretty for concealer I literally
have nothing new I know there's the new
makeup revolution concealers everyone's
been talking about definitely have to
order those
but for now I'm like what do I have
that's like the latest will go in with
the all nighter or waterproof
full coverage concealer BAM it looks
like this and I've used this in a few
videos really loving it it is a very
full coverage very brightening and you
don't need a lot of product this is one
of those formulas where you can like dot
it on like this you're all good you
don't need to put on like 50 layers now
this is a little bit of a quick drying
foundation so sometimes I like to take a
little artiste brush and just really go
in quickly before it dries or you could
do Beauty Blender it doesn't matter but
this really lays it down quick
I am doing a Beautyblender on this side
because see it was already like
quick-dry so literally you can do like
one side blend one side blend because
this formula likes to set very quickly
which I don't mind because once it sets
bitch it ain't moving and now we're
gonna finish brightening this face girl
so now we are blended to perfection
we definitely gotta set this damn full
coverage concealer I don't have any new
setting powders either I really have
been sticking to like what I stick to so
for the hundredth time on this channel
I'm gonna go in with my lemare the
powder one of the best setting powders
on the planet and it's just my go-to I
can't stop you guys know the drill we're
gonna take our damp Beauty Blender and
go right in and just press this in to
the skin
so I'm gonna dust this off I'm also
gonna even set it again for the tenth
time with this lemare soft powder I love
this it's a literally like probably that
in a compact form but its sheer and it
just feels so nice all right now I am so
excited to dive into the next few items
so we are going to use the new natasha
de Nona diamond and blush palette look
at the packaging so cute now when you
open this up you see that there are
three creams up top and then three
powders so the creams up top are covered
by a window so debris and stuff won't
really get in there and then the powders
are here so instead of doing severe
contour I'm gonna do what I used to do
in the myspace days and do blush for
contour and just really take it there
and see how good this formula is now
this blush cream I think we should try
it with the Beauty Blender of course I
love doing cream products with sponges
so we're just gonna go in there is
pigment on that sponge let's see what
happens we're just gonna oh oh oh I'm
like excited no I'm not really into
cream blushes you guys know I barely use
these on my channel now this will
probably help the highlighter stick more
as well because you know powders and
shimmers glimmers glitters love a base
like this so I am down know what we're
gonna go into the glow cream base I'm
literally gonna take the same sponge and
let's put this on this is more on the
sheer side but I think when the powder
goes over this it's gonna be like
amazing I'm hoping okay so we actually
just got the Anastacio Beverly Hills
amber easy brand-new highlighter that
drops soon so I think we got to do one
side highlighter with Natasha and one
side with this one look how pretty this
is the packaging is so cute you open it
up and look at that glowy wave this
packaging is so pretty now I guess this
is allegedly a new gel like powder
formula that has zero fallout this shade
is called highlighter no I think there's
really only one shade for their collab
it says an illuminating powder with an
ultra smooth formula and radiant finish
PS
amra this is so sickening and we're
gonna try it on this side of my face so
let's do with this palette first and
then we'll dip into that real quickly I
want to go into this diamond powder here
there's powder blush so maybe we can do
that as well okay we got to do it so
let's go in here and let's just press a
little bit of blush into the skin oh
girl I'm going heavy on that fucking
blush
fuck it so let's dive in on this side
let's push the hair back and let's see
how the glow is going to look
now it says diamond powder and then glow
extreme so I'm like okay let's dip into
all of them let's do the diamond powder
here let's see what this is going to
look like okay okay okay Natasha I see
you girl
and then we're gonna dip into the glow
extreme okay she is really cute very
almost wet like and I am living let's
move on to the amber easy on a stop see
a Beverly Hills collaboration
highlighter this is so pretty I'm
looking at like oh I gotta touch this
with my finger that's what I've been
dying to do since I just got this like
hi oh okay literally no ball out let's
go on at the brush and yeah there's like
no fall out weird okay let's see how
this looks
Wow girl the light is just like
capturing that moment like I feel like
I'm in the desert with armor right now I
was smoking a blunt and bitch this shit
is everything Natasha I love you girl
this is sickening and then it's like I
don't know this is just like smoother or
the texture is just like very wet but
like let's keep it moving and the next
item that I want to do is oh my god okay
I am so excited for this let's go
directly to eyes girl
we're highlighted we have a moment we're
not contouring but we're gonna survive
it now Oh first of all let's just take a
look at this packaging we are going to
dive in and play with the brand new Pat
McGrath labs mothership for eyeshadow
palette the packaging alone was like
stunning this eyeshadow palette is very
heavy it's luxurious it feels amazing
even before opening it I'm like oh the
packaging is a very innovative so I
already ended it you guys obviously a
lot of you so let me swatch this on
snapchat and everyone was like where's
the video play with it I'm sorry I'm
here so when you open it you get this
and it just looks like a piece of art
it's like unreal now the shade names are
in here with all the ingredients which
is cool so there's that so here is the
mother ship for palette the packaging is
so heavy it's full-on like you feel like
you bought like a little art piece I
love this it's very minimalistic and
stunning not when you open it up you do
get ten eyes shadows and the pan sizes
are very nice so we're just gonna go
full on alien and create a really cool
look with this palette I love the colors
by the way that blue over here that gold
right here I'm like don't play me right
now of course I prime my lids with the
Mac painterly paint-pot in every video
so let's just slather this on my lid
we're just gonna go ham here and try out
some looks so let's go into that beast
luxury this shade and if I'm saying this
wrong I am so sorry you guys we're gonna
gonna dive in with this little brush and
we're just gonna go right in here now oh
hi I'm just gonna pack this on my lid
and see what happens cuz I'm feeling
this blue fantasy so I'm just gonna pack
this on the lid oh wow
he's like smell good it's almost like
I've been now Lauer like creme brulee
hmm
now we're going to dive into this shade
up here called underworld and we're just
going to take a little blending brush
right here I'm just going to flick up
and out a little bit and we're just
gonna go like this I love this look I'm
like mmm yummy now I think I'm going to
dip and I don't know yet you guys are
nervous Devine mink is speaking to me
like this one is everything you guys I'm
just gonna take this brush just a little
bit oh yeah girl give me the pigment and
I'm gonna just blend it in here and just
give it kind of a little I'm literally
just taking this and like smudging it up
like oh girl alright now I just got to
get the inner corner out of the way I've
been dying to play with this gold
standard shade so let's just hit this a
few times because don't need any fix
plus these literally need a brush which
is shocking so I'm gonna just tuck this
right in here and layer it over the blue
and then drag it in the inner corner oh
my god girl the gold is looking full of
this now I'm gonna take my little Mac
smolder eye pencil and quickly do some
black liner in the waterline
and now I'm gonna go in with a little
pencil brush and dip into blue blood and
we're just going to dab this along the
lash line and then add a little bit of
more drama to complete this eye look
just to be really extra we're gonna dip
into this beautiful shade or right here
I mean look at that color I'm like hi
and I'm literally just gonna barely
touch it we're just gonna kind of use
this to smoke out and cause some drama
right under here and we're just gonna go
like this I'm feeling a little
avant-garde right now I'm feeling like I
need to be on the runway oh I love the
undertone I actually want to put this
all over my whole lid and let's blend it
together
so what pretty don't you love me like
get a palette and you're actually just
like re-inspired to like play in your
makeup like that's how I'm feeling right
now now I think it's time for a little
bit of lashes and some love now I do
have this new Burberry mascara what is
this called you all this is the
jet-black number one Burberry Kat lashes
now it looks like this of course and the
wand when you pull it out it is looking
like this let me show ya interesting now
is this gonna work
who the fuck knows what we're about to
see let's coat our lashes first it feels
a little weird but like it worked good I
actually like easy peasy
this mascara I'm like damn this shit is
cute my bottom lashes look really nice
and full I know we're about to cover the
top with lashes but I'm actually really
impressed I new Burberry is a little on
the pricey side as well but bitch you
know I'm a luxury ho and this was great
now we need some lashes now I don't
really have any new lashes that just hit
the market but girl I got this House of
lashes Pro Edition a last story book
this is probably been sitting in my
makeup room for months and when you open
it up you get the glue which ones do we
want to do today oh girl look at them
Cecile's though like ooh what siren all
right I'm just gonna pull out a random
pair this siren looks really pretty
right here and let's just see how they
look actually that pair was not dramatic
enough so we're gonna go in with this
lash in its to seal and I think this
will be a little more like uh I'm gonna
go in with the House of lash glue which
I really could use it a few times but
it's been a minute so we're just gonna
coat the entire lash band all right
let's see how these ones look
the lashes are on there pretty they're
dramatic and I think they fit perfect
with this look we're almost to the
finish line now there's some things
actually forgot to use which I'm kind of
mad at myself
I had this eye cream to use this is
literally a banana bright eye cream with
vitamin C with collagen hotha try this
tomorrow morning um I'm looking at what
else I had had a new moisturizer oh no
man Nicole use a saw me Bobbi Brown okay
sorry this is not an ad oh this new
setting spray I have seen this
everywhere Ulta this is the facial spray
with aloe chamomile and lavender baby oh
just like wakes you up all right now lip
oh I'm excited about lip now if you guys
thought Pat McGrath was gonna slay with
the eye I know I ever viewed her
lipsticks on my channel where she just
released a whole new spring collection
so I'm like we're gonna do more Pat no I
do have some lip glosses from girl on
maybe we'll throw on top but girl Pat
McGrath made a lip balm and I first saw
my girl
okay like you better slow it down but
the packaging wins me over every time so
this lip balm looks like this and I kind
of love the bullet form instead of a
second or much chapstick this one is
like ultra hydrating let's try it I'm
like it smells so yummy okay now I
thought it was gonna be kind of like
waxy it's so smooth it's like oh it's so
hydrating okay I'm like this is going to
my purse immediately anyway so lipsticks
roll I got every color first of all just
like the eyeshadow it comes in this
really cool packaging so you literally
unravel it it's so bougie and amazing

show all right let's give a little whirl
with this color and like yes for all

I love it like this color what is
stunning nude and with the look I mean I
think the eyes are so out of this world
you definitely need a nude lipstick
alright you guys we are ready for some
setting spray I know I already used this
on me which is very new but what else do
I have that's new ooh I don't really
have like a setting spray I mean I'm
sure you guys have all seen this I love

this palette

what you come out with next PS what are
you gonna do my makeup girl moving on I
can still smell this in the air I'm
obsessed with it I actually really like
the mascara I was shocked you see

I'm like you have tried them all but
this one is really pretty especially for
under the I lived for it also hi the
