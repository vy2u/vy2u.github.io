channel today we are doing part two of
the full face first impressions using
all new makeup I guess is it can be a
series on my channel you guys don't have
to let me know if you want me to
continue doing these but the first one
that I did last month you guys loved and
I think I buy way too much makeup so
it's fun to like accumulate it all or
all the new stuff that I've gotten in
the last few weeks and just try it all
at once I mean hi it saves a lot of your
guys a time because I know a lot of you
love to watch and see if things work or
if they do not work now today's video is
going to be really fun because I went a
little hem at Sephora so I got a lot of
new products and I also got some new
stuff from Ulta and the drugstore stuff
that I've never used before that you
guys have actually recommended so today
we are going to dive into all of that
and try it all on my bare skin so if you
guys want to see me play with new makeup
then keep on watching
alright now sometimes it's kind of hard
to find a full face of like every single
product so there are a few things that I
am missing but I think I got most
everything so I was browsing on Sephora
calm and dr. Brandt who is of course
amazing skincare line they have
something a brand new out called the
illuminizer primer now this is allegedly
something that is going to give me a
natural backlit glow revive my dull
complexion and help refine the look of
pores I'm like okay girl if anyone says
that they can minimize pores and give a
nice flawless look I'm down for all
right so this says to a plan clean
moisturized skin put this over on
desired areas for a natural radiant look
okay guys so let's just use one hand
over here so what smells really fresh
what feels a little tacky which is great
because you know foundation is going to
stick to the skin let's do a little bit
more for the forehead alright this is
dry on my skin it feels feel good okay
so for foundation I am going to be
trying out the new Tarte clay stick
foundation and now this just hit the
market and I bought three shades of
course you guys all know what a stick
foundation looks like by now but this
color I mean I'm just going to go like
this I mean that is a looks like a
really good match so this one was a
light beige
this one is a fair beige all right
definitely this one is too light I
probably could work with that but I like
how this one is looking so I'm going to
stick to a light beige let me go wipe
this off and I'll be right back all
right now I'm not sure what kind of
finish or coverage this is supposed to
give me and I could stop and google it
but you know what let's just see what
happens I don't to put too much on
because God knows it could be really
full-coverage and I'm going to be like
oh now Beautyblender
just put out a new little trio for the
summer I bought 2 packs I'm going to be
doing another giveaway with a bunch of
brand new makeup soon so this will be
going in there but I unboxed it
yesterday and I used it for the first
time of course it's the same beauty
blender just different colors that hot
green one is speaking to my soul right
now ok so before this driver gets weird
let's buff it out and see what kind of
coverage we're going to get on the
realest level up close I have a mirror
right in front of me you guys this looks
really pretty like it's full coverage
but my skin looks like really nice on
the real so good to y'all I did not
expect this thick foundation to be this
snatched I'm like looking close up like
girl it leaves a beautiful finish on the
skin it does not look too heavy but it
is a full I think it's a medium I
probably could add a little bit more but
I love how this is looking
I don't see the reason to add any more
Wow ok let's move on to concealer
alright you guys so we were about to try
a new drugstore concealer but I opened
it up and the lightest shade was darker
than my normal skin tone so I found
another concealer that I have not used
yet by one of my favorite brands
lemare it looks like this - all my
fingerprints on it but I haven't tried
this yet and this is 75 dollars I'm like
it's better conceal my life in
my attitude after I'm done using it so
this is the lightest shade and this
brand is well still I don't think it's
light enough for me but we will see in a
second so I'm just going to take a
little bit and go under the thigh
like that I'm going to take my Beauty
Blender and bounce this away okay so far
so good it looks really like a light
weight on here it's not like really
crazy it's not cakey um but did it do a
lot though not really
all right so now that this is all
blended out am i living for it I mean I
don't think it really did that much I
mean I'm going to be the one that says
probably right off the bat that for $75
I should be wowed and right now I'm kind
of looking at myself like I'm bored
next product for setting the under eyes
and the concealer I'm going to be using
the new dermablend what is this the
loose setting powder now I've seen a lot
of people use this lately and they are
ranting and raving about it so I had to
get it myself now there are a few colors
I just got original I think that it's
supposed to be translucent comes in a
standard little package like this and
let's see if she works oh wow
okay girl what the hell oh it's like a
big old like almost like when you open
up a pill bottle and you have to take
out the the cotton I think this is what
this is okay I'm just going to put a
little bit of this right here
let's see what happens
and let's let that sit for a second and
I'm about to brush it away I'm going to
be using this new little cute tart
unicorn brush and I'm just going to
brush away my problems
all right the setting powder let me go
only zoom in here for a minute
I mean it's set everything really really
nice okay now I know a lot of people
have been ranting and raving about the
what is this this is from the brand
Charlotte Tilbury and this is the
airbrush fillol list finished skin
perfecting micro powder paint some water
now notice I'm going to avoid all the
areas that I have the concealer under I
really don't like to dip in and put
powder over powder over powder where it
doesn't need it so I'm just going to set
the rest of the face we're gonna have
any concealer it looks amazing like up
close you guys right in front of me I'm
like okay so now we're going to move on
to what let's try some bronzer with you
guys let's do a little highlighting now
I do have some exciting new products
that I've been dying to use the new Coco
collection from Khloe and Kylie
cosmetics is here and if you open it up
you get a blush two highlighters and a
bronzer slash contour color we're going
to call it I'm going to try them out
today I want to see what the tea is now
this bronzer close-up has shimmer in it
when I'm looking at it and what does the
bronzer called this is the Hollywood
Boulevard bronzer I thought it took me
like five minutes to figure that out
wow that it's a very pigmented
all right the face is warmed up I love
this bronzer I was a little scared that
I was going to be like - like orangie on
me and there's no like shimmer once it's
on the skin in the pan it looks a little
glittery but on the skin is matte it's
soft it's really nice
doesn't look harsh definitely not what I
expected and I'm really living for it
hmm now I love this brush because you
literally just go BAM no this is
contoured alright now I think because
there is a blush in this palette we
might as well try it and the blush is
called Rodeo Drive one of my favorite
places in LA and I am going to one - now
I do love the formula of the Kylie
blushes now these just from looking at
it they look to be like the same formula
okay I went a little too crazy there so
I'm just going to press it into the skin
oh there is definitely pigment I've just
been really into like peachy warm tone
blushes lately and I really like this
color BAM
all right let's get to my favorite part
of the day highlighting all right now
today we are going to be trying out the
new hoodie beauty 3d highlighter palette
now there are two highlighter palettes
this one is the golden sands edition
there is also a pink sand but this one
it looks more up my alley now the cool
thing about this is that one is a cream
highlighter and I think the rest are
powders now I did swatch this earlier
because I didn't know it was a cream and
I touched it I was like oh it's a cream
okay so it says to apply this as a base
to smooth skin and then you can add
things on top of it to make it really
intense and I think this one might be
more of like a blush II highlighter so
I'm down to try these - Sophie G is the
this is a cream you guys so you touch it
and it's like whoa
I mean and then seychelles is this
gorgeous highlighter I'm just going to
swatch it with a clean finger and that
is a powder but they still really
buttery and that's what these two look
like so hopefully they look good on my
skin alright so I'm going to use a
little Mac's synthetic fiber brush and
we're going to dip into shade CG here
and I'm
going to put this right on top of the
contour definitely not good I mean
obviously if you like a subtle glow you
could wear this on your skin even
without foundation it will probably look
stunning
but for me you guys know I am a
highlighter freak and this is not
blinding enough I'm going to do one side
of the face first with what if I don't
like it I want to do both sides so let's
dip into shade stay shells and okay see
what happens I mean that is really
really pretty
like these the blush the contour and
this together I'm like huh it is glowing
like look at the way when I shift my
face okay and I'm just gonna put that
all on the brow bone all right now I'm
also going to take that same cream and
powder combo and do my Cupid's bow of
course I think ahead of Beauty has
another hit on her hand because this
palette is so pretty and I am doing some
of the highlighter on my brow and above
the brow bone for some crazy alien
dimension I've been really loving the no
brow look lately and there was actually
no new brow products from really any
brand that I could find this month so
we're just going to add on highlight
until my face falls off so now let's get
started on the eyes now I'm going to be
using the new color pop I love sarahi
collaboration which oh my god you guys I
was really excited about this because
the packaging is stunning and I just
loved all the lip swatches I was seeing
online but the eyeshadows were speaking
to me so this one Shiki is girl it's
stunning let me show y'all let me show
what sitting here oh my god this was my
favorite one but this is obviously
really pretty as well now the color pop
eyeshadow formula I haven't really used
it on my channel I have definitely tried
it off camera and it's pretty good I
will say that now this palette there are
two saucy that's the one where the
colors like the color store was speaking
to me not going to lie look at this
y'all look at that yummy this needs to
go right here and these three need to go
right here it definitely might dip into
this one as well but this one I think
saucy is it for me like it looks really
pretty
alright so I love this light shade here
it looks like
Vennela Matt and I'm just going to be
dipping into there and putting it all
over the lid and right under the brow
bone now these have a lot of pigment I
barely tapped in there and it's like
good morning
alright so I'm going to be dipping into
this one oh the names on the back by the
way so this one is called freckles that
is so cute and I'm gonna use the same
brush and I'm just going to barely tap
in there because these are extremely
pigmented and I'm just gonna just kind
of tuck that into the crease a little
bit alright now we're going to move over
to the other palette and there is a
shade called chic happens and it's like
a beautiful light toned
mob right here and same brush again you
guys and I'm just going to take that and
place it right over that crease so where
normal people's brows would be I'm going
to bring that shadow up now we're going
to take the shade lit with a little
synthetic brush and let's see
oh okay big man come on now now I'm
going to coat the entire brush I'm going
to Pat this on my lid and see how this
looks I love love how this color like
looks in the pan
all right now I think the metallics have
a little bit more fallout than the mass
on my girl but they are really pigmented
so it's definitely forgivable all right
you guys I think this color is so pretty
on the lid all right now we're going to
go in with this shade called a Razzie
it's like a dark plum purple and I am
living for it and we're just going to
tuck it right in there Sam and bring it
to the lashline so it gives us some
drama if you will then I'll go back and
forth with that other light mob shade
and I'll just really blend it out two
spills
this is looking really pretty these
shadows are blending amazing now I'm
going to go in with that stunning lights
like I almost orangie frosty duochrome
type of moment and that shade is called
a heavy glam and now I might wet the
brush for added intensity but for now
I'm going to be using a little pencil
brush and we're going to go in here or
we have the brushes coated really
quickly so I definitely don't want any
crazy fallout and I just want to put it
really in my inner corner almost over
that purple oh yes
Wow okay I already see where this color
is going and it looks a really pretty so
I'm just going to take some a coconut
six-plus from Mac and I'm just going to
wet the brush if you will all right now
I'm going to take that and just place it
a little bit more oh as like a pinky
shift to it - that is so pretty this is
such a unique shadow color like you
better work bitch okay now I'm just
going to smoke out the under eyes with
that same dark color I put right in here
so let's get debuffing
these shadows are so pigmented it's like
you got to really be careful and that's
a good thing so I'm going to take a
little bit of that light shade and kind
of go under the eye blend her down to
fill okay I'm like mm mm all right so
I'm just applying a little bit of this
chic happen shade underneath the purple
I think it's a really cool way to blend
it out and give you a really extreme
type of a smoky eye I think the only
thing missing is some color in the
waterline which could be a bright color
or we could just do black we could do
why I think black would be really cool
just cuz it'll kind of make it tie in so
I don't have any new eyeliners I know
you guys are like alien bitch I really
don't I mean who's put out new eyeliners
lately I don't know but if you guys know
a brand or anything new I should try of
course always sound off below and let me
know some good stuff to buy but for now
we're going back to my trusty Mac
smolder I've been using this since high
school and it works now I think it's
time to move on to some mascara and
today I have two different types one of
them I'm scared to use with this ELO's
but I think it's going to work we're
going to try it we're going to try on
this video so the first one is one that
Tati recommended of course you guys know
her as a glam life guru aka taught to
Westbrook here on YouTube I live for her
and she recommended this mascara now the
price point you all don't want to know
the price point but it allegedly makes
your lashes grow longer and it has
ingredients in this that will actually
make your lashes well here let me just
read it it says with continuous use your
natural lashes will appear longer and
fuller has additional peptides that help
build stronger longer lashes super
volume and extreme black so I'm like oh
my god alright so this is from a brand
called ash antic eye now this is called
the slow still is longest lash black
mascara
oh so of course for the hefty price tag
of $70 it comes in this little purple
thing and then you come
comes out like this and voila oh my god
it feels light it feels like I'm sure it
works we're about to see now obviously
doesn't mean the formula doesn't works
just because it feels a little cheap but
hey let's get happen all right so you
guys can see the difference between one
side so of course this one has all the
mascara this is blank it does give you a
nice length I mean for the price point
I'm sure I'm gonna obviously try this
for like a few weeks and see if it
actually makes my lashes grow anymore
but for 7d just online and you'll know
me I don't give a about spending
money on makeup I'm all down to invest
and play around but if it's not doing
anything like I have the ordinary right
away I don't know bitch I don't know oh
my god you guys I already forgot I was
about to try another mascara like we're
talking double brands today so okay
we've tried this one hopefully it works
long lasting at the end of the day is
pretty but for the price point yeah max
recently put out a bunch of new colored
mascaras and they are bright this one is
cold energized it is a literally hot
yellow and I thought what better look to
try this on with dark shadow underneath
but I know that when you pull this out
oh I mean that is straight-up neon
yellow
so for bottom mascara is it going to
work I guess we will find out right now
we'll see what happens
are you guys for bottom mascara just
brew it like the bristles and the wand
is so huge so it was a little difficult
to get under there
but I mean it has full coverage like
opaque pigment so okay cool this is
definitely different for me and I
haven't done colored mascara in a long
time I love pink mascara and I love blue
yellow though I don't know I almost want
to try this again with like no makeup on
really just soft pretty and then just do
yellow on the top and bottom but that's
for later alright so today for fake
lashes for falsies we're going to be
using the brand cake based Beauty now
they are the same brand that collab with
Kim Thai and I was like you know what I
want to try more of their lashes because
those were alright these lashes are
glued down and I'm really living for
them they're really they're really
pretty I'm like looking at them up close
like oh come on volume alright you guys
we are almost down to the finish line of
course you have to do a liquid lipstick
I mean were this is a this is by Stila
this is the be legendary
liquid metal lipstick and this is in
shade petal metal so this shade is a
stunning like a rose gold metallic okay
let's see how she works
all right you guys we have one last step
of course setting spray that not a day
goes by that I don't set to space so me
Brand Milk makeup they put out a brand
new setting spray is called the blur
spray and it is supposed to instantly
minimize the appearance of pores and
provides a soft focus blur effect on all
skin tone invisible mist sets make up
all day it is infused with some good old
organic ingredients so it's supposed to
be leaving your skin soft and hydrated
shake well before use all right baby
let's see what she looks like
oh it says cue okay guru let's do what
happens let's get her going
there we go oh my god like pumps out
like a lot whoops
all right I am feeling doused let me
just buff that really good into the skin
now did it do anything oh let me look
for now I mean it feels good my makeup
does it feel set which I love so you
guys I think this is the final look the
final mug I'm living for I think it's a
really fun it's definitely different I'm
still not sure how I feel about the
yellow mascara it's definitely like
taking it to another realm and I'm not
mad at I mean it worked
I think I'm looking at my desk the
things that really stuck out the most
for me today has to be the tart clay
stick foundation I mean that was unreal
concealer and not so much didn't really
care about it the Charlotte Tilbury face
Todd Rizzo
left me feeling like I looked 12 again
and my pores were vanished
so that combo together I'm kind of
hooked and the primer I'm not mad at the
primer but I don't know if it worked or
not because obviously you guys know I do
have pretty normal skin so it's kind of
hard for me to try primers to see if
they like actually really really work
but I don't know what kind of recipe I
did today but these two combined left me
looking flawless and I think another
thing to really rave about is the
highlighter palette oh my god my cheeks
are like glowing from outer space and
I'm obsessed with it I think the
eyeshadows works really
amazing the bronzer from Kylie was great
we get a lot of really cool things today
I think the only thing I would really I
don't think I would pass on the mascara
obviously we know that my lashes might
be growing right now who knows but I
will give this a whirl in a few more
videos and of course off camera and
we'll save anything happen but besides
that I think I liked most everything I'm
shocked I was like I'm waiting for me to
try out a bunch of products that just
don't work for me which does happen
sometimes but today thank you I got
lucky all right you guys let me know if
you guys want me to continue to do this
series if you want part 3 4 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 but
I always have a lot of fun trying to
make up so as always thank you for
watching in I'll see you on the next one
mwah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
