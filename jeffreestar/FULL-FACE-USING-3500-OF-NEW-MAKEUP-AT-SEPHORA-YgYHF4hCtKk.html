play some fortnight and just relax and
hang out with the dogs love that right
buddy love you baby bitch these bags are
so heavy and bulky girl okay my skin
feels amazing so let's start with some
moisturizer there's a lot in here I've
pulled out a bunch of stuff on my tea
bowl we're just gonna keep diving in so
first of all
Beautyblender has a brand new color BAM
I said if I'm gonna do a full face for
impressions we got to really do the
whole thing so I tried to find as many
products as I could that were brand new
so the sapphire egg just hit the market
so besides that let's dive into some
moisturizer and have girl lemare the
moisturizing cream if you have dry or
normal skin this is everything for over
three hundred plus dollars you get this
beautiful unicorn and when you open it
up girl you get instructions let me sum
it up for you you open it and slop it on
your face BAM
and then you also get a spatula because
rich people don't dip there are nasty
fingers into their cream do they
bitch I do know this cream is thick okay
let me warn you it is thick but it's so
good look at that sick frosting grunts a
lot by the way it's night we're gonna
take a little bit like this and rub it
all over here I also got this new grill
on B glow Youth moisturizer for dewy
skin I'm not gonna put this on today
because the lemare is so hydrating I
don't want to overdo it this was fun
let's just open it we got to see what it
looks like this is what we're here for I
never do unboxings or anything like that
sound like oh they're packaging that was
so stunning look at that I took a little
honeycomb a moment
well my fingerprints are already on it
 me sorry oh wow I think almost like
a pearl effect in there alright we would
definitely use this in another video but
I just got a guard know what it smells
like ooh oh it feels very like wet hmm
smells like an old lady's taint
all right foundation time now I got a
lot of tweets about this I said what new
products should I use
I got tweeted this little happy face a
lot this is the brand new benefit hello
happy soft blur that's what really
rolled me and let's be honest the
blurring soft blur foundation it's a
light to medium coverage okay and it
does have sunscreen in it this has one
fluid ounce which is very standard for
foundations I got shade one and two only
thing that I was a little like huh about
was the shade range there is 12 shades
and they say that they're like flexible
so several people can use like one tone
I'm not really sure about that I got
these two so let's see what happens
ooh I see something pink in there oh
very few okay love the little face on
there we all hear that you've got to mix
it up I am gonna try this but there is
something that was sitting in Sephora
that I had never tried yet I know a lot
of people did reviews on this and this
is the Urban Decay Velvet Iser
translucent mix in medium so I know a
lot of girl like well girl this is the
white light coverage you may want to add
in a little something else so I'm gonna
pour a little bit of this in there what
this does is you mix in a dime size into
any liquid makeup and it would give an
extra velvety feel with a beautiful
matte finish and added coverage there we
go
and it also has a soft focus effect for
a perfected complexion oh my god it
literally feels like a little bit whoa
look at that so let's see if these
shades are even gonna match girl this
looks so yellow I'm just a little scared
oh oh it's like already coming out honey
alright oh wow that might be my colored
way I can need shade too let's take just
a tiny bit oh wow huh either that's a
perfect match or it just evaporated into
my skin I'm just sure let's do a dab of
number two BAM oh yeah that's yellow and
no no ma'am and then we're also gonna
take this kind as this oh boy
mom Chris I really can't get that haha
alright thank you so much oh look at the
UD in there okay so the dime sized
amount woah this is so crazy what about
that is so weird
oh my god look I'm in the kitchen
literally this is so weird oh is this
gonna do anything magical I'm scared you
guys oh honey that's thick alright I'm
gonna take this egg and I'm gonna get to
bouncing and let's see what the hell is
about to happen
not mad at this at all it's looking
really pretty now I'm gonna show you
guys half of my face let me just do a
little bit more of my forehead
okay BAM product will just match that up
with the part in my hair and we'll just
do this side now when I'm first applying
it it does look like there's not much
there and then with the second layer
right now I'm like okay there she is
let's just show one half of my face whoa
discoloration over here look at that
alright so of course this is the side
with the benefit foundation is itself
blurring kinda look at that little peak
of light right there and then here is
reality
alright foundation is lady this is
really pretty like are we all seen what
I'm seeing I'm like wow I like how this
looks let's add some more products on
top and see what the hell happens now
this isn't brand new but they repackage
the entire thing the creaseless
concealer from Tarte I'm a little scared
now that I see this foundation this
foundation is very my exact skin tone do
you guys know I'd like to go a little
darker so this might be the wrong shade
I'm a little scared the lightest shade
was sold out so let's see what happens
girl mmm I don't know let's do a tiny
little test oh wow cute looks thick okay
I'm scared this isn't not the right
color let me just do like a dot oh this
could work okay hold on hold on
oh wow okay I don't know how much to put
on yeah so let's just do that moment and
just see what happens cuz I'm a little
scared it's a little bit lighter than my
normal way cuz ii can tell but not
really my normal my actual there we go
okay blend it out usually I can see more
coverage or like a more lifted
appearance you can kind of see the
difference but I'm like a little
confused here
one second so this concealer is $26 and
it says completely covers dark circles
hyper pigmentation redness pimples and
tattoos waterproof girl that did not
look that thick right like it looked
thick for a minute and then it blend it
out and I was like what happened like do
we need a little more is that too much
but you guys saw as I blended it in it
wasn't like
I'm blowin next we are about to set this
concealer now girl I've seen a lot of
people I'm going to use this and I'm
like let me see what the real T is this
is the new hourglass veil setting powder
it looks something like this
of course as a beautiful metallic brown
component accents like all our glass
products and it also has this crazy
brush I'm like oh my god honey watch now
the bristles feel very soft for a
synthetic so this retails for $46 oh my
god all it should we find powder with
light reflecting particles to blur
imperfections everything just Buller
happy lately and I'm living for it
the formula is infused with diamond
powder there's no flashback it sets make
up for longer wear ok great let's open
her up and let's see what everyone's
talking about whoa look at that that is
like some high-end moment whoa I think
as you push it powder is coming out what
in the okay look see what happens here
everyone okay I'm just gonna be the one
that does this be there we go honey
and normally you guys know I apply
powder with the damp Beauty sponge but
we're just gonna do one side with this
brush and see how we like it
woah so looking up close it definitely
set my under eye do I like this brush
the brush feels very soft but you know
me I'm curious taking out more powder
and I'm gonna apply this with a wet
sponge my favorite method ever and let's
see what happens now that really said it
honey
alright now let's try to sculpt this
face so we have the new Becca the be a
light face palette love the unit carton
but what does the inside look like let's
see girl blush contour brightening
powder and a blur powder blur blur blur
oh wow look at this component very cute
very luxurious looking it feels
expensive okay look at the pans
beautiful looks like gems or jewels the
blurring powder is I'm missing this
one this is brightening so this retails
for $46 you guys it's kind of brighten I
guess we'll see in a second didn't
really do anything but my eyes are
already very bright so maybe it's like
honey your god stop now the contour
shade in here that is so warm toned I'm
a little shook by it
oh no no no no no that is so orange I
cannot put it on my skin I would look
crazy good news is I bought another
actually the Smashbox calli contour
little kit well let's see what happens
here and you open it up and that's what
the what it looks like okay this this is
what's gonna happen today thank you
Jesus let's just start contouring this
face okay this is very soft I like this
I like this cuz a lot of the times
bronzers can be so harsh or contour
powders where you're just like honey
what happened I do love to take this and
we'll take maybe this husband okay let's
try this we're here for and I was gonna
go over that bronze contour moment and
just soften it we're gonna veil her as
lipstick nick says and Ike I've said
that in the last 20 videos but bitch
were veiling where's the good contour
brush oh this one I love is more if you
want this is a classic so I'm just gonna
go into here maybe right over there as
well and we're just gonna clock for the
face and we'll be right back alright I
will say this first of all I'm not
living for this packaging kind of boring
you know I am this is a very first
impressions video I'm gonna keep it real
on the T like how stunning was this but
the formula obviously is what really
matters if it's cute it doesn't work
great it's just a single vanity but
anyway the formula on this powder is
actually beautiful let's just say that
right now I'm just gonna take a little
bit of the bronzer right there and I was
gonna lend this into my nose a tiny
bitch yes knows what's good cool I think
it is time for a little bit of blush you
know this actually is not from Sephora I
already had it here but I've been dying
to try it because this is a sixty dollar
blush yes you heard that correctly what
in the hell this is from the brand just
Charlotte Tilbury no I do have two
shades here I guess it's like a split
thing a duo blush cream and illuminator
this is the pretty youth glow filter and
cheek hug brush with soft focused cream
blush hi
ingenious contour curved duo Wow my god
girl I've got mouth let's open this bad
boy up now this is shade seduced so you
get the little blush moment here and
then you dip the brush right here okay
all right so this is the brush Oh cute
okay let me put up my hand my backdrop
it's dark today cute yes
oh wow this does not feel expensive at
all girl oh wow it's a blush like cream
and then there's an illuminizer right
here okay oh my god let's just try it
right here I don't see anything but I
have perfect vision huh the cream blush
ooh I just picture my foundation like oh
maybe you're supposed to use the brush
okay let's try that let's dig in here so
this let me suppose like a hug my cheek
like a hood I'm scared okay what
happened I barely see something compared
to the other side okay yes I do have
another blush so I just want the same
brand okay the irony of it all this came
out a long time ago but I've actually
never tried it and it's a little weird
this is the cheek to chic swish and pop
blusher in shade love is the drug Kesha
starts doing I'm just kidding let's take
a little Mac brush let's swirl it around
oh wow maybe I was not supposed to swirl
that hard
alright so these retail for $40 and I
think this is gonna have a lot more
pigment so let's just push us into our
skin oh my god girl and this is the $40
version honey I used to wear my blush so
much more severe and a why I'm acting
surprised at all
let's redeem this side because honey oh
that was a lot but the good news is it
does blend like it blends out really
nicely so remember guys if you're adding
too much product or it's too severe take
some loose powder and oh my god wear
that cream was it pulled my foundation
look at that oh girl
once it's veiled I actually don't mind
it alright jesus take the wheel
I need some eye light on all right so I
just picked up this new NARS highlighter
it looks like this this is in shade
Capri is this blinding I have no idea
we're gonna try it
what in the is going on around here
now this retails for $38 I have
saturated the brush let's give it a
whirl
oh okay up close it's not really
luminous I'm not really getting a
highlighting vibe it's just kind of like
I mean it's there this is very natural
so if you're someone that doesn't love a
blinding highlight this might be for you
for $38 bitch I need some magic okay
okay what else do we got here oh okay
Vera Mona has a guilty glow highlighter
look at this cute packaging it looks
like this they also make that the color
switch to clean your brushes love that
product all right so I'm just gonna open
this up now this is shade exposed let's
do a little finger moment oh okay this
looks a little more promising let's do
it right here ah that's what we needed
how much is this one $15.99 girl
that ain't too bad whoa okay there we go
okay four eyes today we are going to use
the BAM
brand-new urban decay born to run eyes
shadow palette I know this is about to
hit or maybe it's already out when this
video goes live oh I love it there's a
lot of mattes in here there's neutrals
as metallics there is 21 shades and a
collage of our own personal travel
photos we created Born to Run to inspire
you to take a rain check on reality you
know grab his palette and run oh yes
packaging new Urban Decay always desert
right feels heavy love that bitch feels
like a brick oh okay love that
definitely love a big mirror all right
so let's just dive into this palette and
see if we like the formula all right I
always prime my lids with the same thing
the Mac painterly paint-pot so we of
course are going to do that I do this
for every review to give it a fair shot
so we're gonna coat our lids and get to
playing first shade we're gonna dip into
is is breakaway metallic
let me see here okay it's a little bit
shiny so we're not gonna do that
since our lives are already primed I
want to go right in here to steel shot
just beautiful little peachy coral
moment we're just gonna take this little
blending brush and hit it right here so
let's apply this right into the crease
so let's see what happens
I'm gonna take this and take it all the
way right here so it follows the line of
my nose and then I like to flick up and
blend out because who needs brows honey
I love all the space to be able to paint
all right this color blends like a dream
yes honey so now we're actually gonna
take that shade break away which is
right here and I'm just gonna take a
little actually the highlighting brush I
have like 20 mb/s on my station so we're
just gonna take this and dip into here
and I'm just gonna soften this coral
color and just give my bro my bro oh my
god give my brow bone give my bro give
my brow bone some highlight oh wow yes
it's definitely a metallic shade not a
matte all right now we're gonna go in to
shade Baja this more dark orange and I'm
gonna tuck this right into this crease
and just kind of deepen and darken that
moment and just dry it up so lightly
this isn't gonna be like really like
that different but just enough where
it's like oh wow look at that never mind
I lied look at that lid
ah Urban Decay always kills a matte
formula like honey all right we are
blended out now we're gonna go in with
shade stranded right here now normally I
wet the brush with metallics just
because I have a full intensity let's
just touch this and see what it looks
like oh look at that oh my god I just
press this on my lid for fun let me just
see what happens
oh wow look at that honey oh I want a
little more of my inner corner and my
fingers will not let me do that so I'm
gonna go in with this little synthetic
brush from Mac and let's just pack that
right in there oh wow
yeah you don't even need to wet this
this is literally a dry brush oh wow
okay I'm so sorry this is stunning
already all right now that this shade is
laid down I'm gonna go back into
stranded again and we're gonna do the
little infamous Jeffrey moment of shadow
right there we're gonna connect it with
the inner corner and we're just gonna
drag it literally right here and stop
we're gonna add a little shadow in the
middle in a second but I just wanted to
lay this down first
all right now we're gonna go in with
this more dark topaz bronze shade ignite
and we're just gonna pop a little bit of
that right here in the middle let's do
what happens here oh wow
okay amazing and they'll go back with
the blending brush we'll take a little
bit of Baja a little bit of still shot
just mix them around and then just kind
of blend it all together now we are
going to dive into shade Punk is a
gorgeous chocolate brown and it's gonna
saturate my brush this is a little Mac
two to one brush and we're just gonna
take this and put it right here and just
deepen the crease a little bit the eye
is looking like a fire right now and I'm
livin for it okay Wow loving this so far
alright now just for fun I picked these
up this is from the brand
Sarat Beauty this is called lid lacquer
okay this is $36 for this little guy
right here and basically I looked this
up online it's a I glossed which creates
a lustrous glow for eyelids and beyond I
grabbed a few shades I don't even know
what I grabbed so let's open this up it
opens like this Oh
or just opens up like a little oh it's a
little compact in here and let's see
what you get for $36 Wow here it is
oh it's like literal glossy lids okay
now my only problem with that is that
once you put it on the lid it gets like
sticky and it's hot kind of hard to move
your eyes um so we're just gonna go
right here for a minute oh yeah that
would look pretty but I don't think it's
really gonna go with this look I got one
more shade let's just open it real quick
oh my god I forgot about this this is a
hot red okay let's just touch it this is
for the lid oh my god okay I have to
touch my lid with this okay never seen a
red eye glass before something new on
this channel I'm just gonna put it on
 it this is the first impressions
video of us what we're here for
oh oh my god I'm putting a lip gloss
literally on my eye whoa would you a
little more
whoa all right we're taking a little
synthetic brush just for fun and I know
I'm gonna cover some of the shadow don't
kill me but I just want to get this eye
gloss more in here and kind of blend it
in with that gold oh wow this looks very
runway okay Wow the red is down okay you
just took us look to the hold of it like
a next level for me with the eye look
I'm done it looks amazing
let me just tell you this because this
isn't in the end of the video this
palette is sick the formula is really
good so urban decay you better work all
right guys I think it's time for some
mascara there are so many new mascaras
like there's this pink one from New Yor
we can't do pink mascara with this look
oh okay
here's a new one super fanned out
12-hour volume length and lift the super
fan mascara from Smashbox let's give
this one a whirl
oh oh this matches my eyes hi what are
the odds
umm how much was this material $19 that
is not that bad okay Smashbox and watch
a thick red whoa it bends crazy let's
just go straight in guys and see what
happens all right I'm not the biggest
fan of this mascara I know insert pine
super fan
I wouldn't grab it again you probably
it's like it's lackluster so next
product we're getting down to the wire
dimes we're getting down to the wire
all the blood products are in here Oh
new liquid lips from Smashbox love this
oh it's like very rose gold not for this
look but that is a very pretty lipstick
we have new Pat McGrath the lust glosses
oh my god look at the gold also I threw

whoo okay very like chic all right let's
give her a little test oh it's like a
fine mist okay not mad at that whoa like
a lots coming out of my face but like
you don't really hear it all right let's
give ourselves a little wave and I think
this look is complete all right we got
through this video together first of all
how you don't feel about this final look
I think it's a little fun tip French and
I feel like I'm on the Chanel runway so
we're gonna quickly speed through things
that I lived for if I don't mention a
product that means that was not filling
it in this review and you will
definitely probably already know why
because I've been running my mouth for a
long time let's start with first of all
you know I love lemare BAM Jeffrey Stehr
Boog we know that the foundation now
it's been about an hour plus since I've
been filming on and off and I took a
break and I'm gonna say this the
foundation looks really pretty now of
course remember I said I don't know if
it's because of this was in there but
the combination was really nice my skin
looks pretty I love it and I would
definitely wear it again concealer not a
big fan of this at all
literally I know abuses in a million
videos but this $9 moment it outshine
this any day this was like too thick for
me and it just set kind of bizarre and
then I was really disappointed because
this looking at my face now now that
it's like fully been an hour plus it
left kind of like a soft yellow overcast
on my skin which you really can't tell
on camera because of all the Beauty
lights but I really don't like it I wish
it was translucent I think the formula
is pretty but overall not into it now of
course as we said this was stunning love
the eyeshadow palette Urban Decay it
knocked it out of the park with that one
now yes
beautiful packaging formula what's not
that bad but girl we dipped into that to
this and it really wasn't much there the
bronzer of course I said was way too
orange for me to try and the blush we
never even gave her a fair shot oh it's
like metallic what oh wow okay girl too
bad overall though not the best Smashbox
evil lived for her formula is beautiful
lips I love all the lips k'kaw kills it
I think this formula is amazing I think
the packaging could be a little better
it feels very kind of Claire's but
overall the formula stuck being the lip
gloss would love a Pat McGrath on this
channel honey she was consistently great
I think to me a lip gloss is a lip gloss
it's not mind-blowing but it is very
pretty and the setting spray how do you
really judge a setting spray unless you
go out and live your life for a while I
don't know I think it feels cool doesn't
feel tacky is until sticky doesn't feel
weird but overall I think it's good I
don't want to say anything on the
setting spray cuz I really don't know
I'm obviously gonna have to test it out
further but don't forget before you
