channel today I'm really excited because
you guys all requested this video so I'm
like oh my god I gotta film this really
quickly so after I did my $4 highlighter
versus a $95 highlighter I got so many
requests to do a full face tutorial
using no not glitter not highlighters
and not kids makeup but elf products
only which I thought was really fun I
really don't use a lot of drugstore
products on my channel you guys know
that but I am starting to try a lot more
because guess what a lot of this new
shit that's coming out I'm like damn I
mean I mean what you see today is full
face using all elf products from the
primer to the eyeshadows to the brushes
oh my god y'all I gotta put your brush
to don't play me I even got some of the
nuclear brushes I got eyes shadow
palettes
we got lipsticks we got highlighters we
got everything so this is also like a
full-face first impression because
everything is brand new fresh out of the
box I've never even tried any of it
before I didn't even use the same
highlighter from the previous video so
everything is fresh off the grill baby
before we dive into the tutorial I also
have one quick thing to say tomorrow I
have brand new jeffree star cosmetics
fashion custom tie-dye hoodies if that
wasn't a mouthful now they come in four
colors I'm just going to show you guys a
few this is the unicorn blood color
these are pull over
hoodies yes gold foil and I just love
this one this is a tie-dye unicorn blood
inspired hoodie with of course pockets
and they are so cozy these are hand dyed
and washed so they already feel fucking
bomb and besides the tie-dye I also have
a kind of like a pink denim pattern one
I just love I mean do I even have to say
I like the color pink you guys already
know what it is so here is another one
and they will be on my website tomorrow
at 10 a.m. and of course if you're
watching this in the future
they're already available so head over
to jeffree star cosmetics comm and get
yours and I also have more vinyl records
coming out you guys really love that and
I can't put this soul out in a week
like oh I'm sorry it should order more
besides all of that if you want to see
how I got all of this going on with the
help pull face product tutorial then
keep on watching alright so I just
unboxed everything on my makeup table so
nothing has ever been used before I also
got the elf brush belt let's have a lot
of brushes in it and it was really
affordable the brushes feel really nice
so I'm gonna be utilizing all of these
today and I also found these amazing
clear brushes well they look amazing who
knows if they really work we're about to
find out but there's a lot of crazy ones
for you know powder foundation and then
look at this crazy massage foundation
brush I'm like look at that you see the
rivets in that girl I'm like this is a
back massager a sex toy but um so I'm
just gonna try out everything today now
Nathan just helped me unbox all of this
stuff so it's a lot of makeup on this
table right now girl and yeah I think we
should just dive right into it right now
so we're just gonna go from start to
finish I try to find as much stuff as
possible to do my entire face so
hopefully I didn't forget anything which
I may have and we'll see what happens I
am going to start off by priming the
skin this is the aqua primer mist so
this is a spray primer usually um you
know I massage something into my skin
but I have seen a few brands create
these it's kind of like I guess you're
just gonna water down your face and get
ready for that foundation so let's get
to spraying oh my god she works honey
I'm like hi help what's a geyser oh my
god I feel like that really sprayed like
crazy
reminds me of everybody in high school
okay so let's do the neck and a little
more my face cuz bitch I like to be
hydrated on skin she's feeling it
already of course the first thing we're
gonna do after the primer is apply
foundation so on the elf website I found
these new oil free with sunscreen
foundations now
you guys know I always talk shit about
like how the hell are you supposed to
find your skin color on the internet I
know there was a few websites where if
you type in something similar that
you've already bought it will kind of
show you other colors that are similar
so I gave it a whirl and I took your
guys advice and I got two shades one is
called porcelain and the other is called
sand so I don't even know if these are
going to work I guess we're going to
give him a little shake a little one two
if you will and I'm just gonna you know
put a little dot on my skin and see if
we can get a match Oh huh I can't decide
I think we're gonna go with a lot well
okay I think I'm gonna go with the
lighter one porcelain it looks actually
it's a really good match so before I do
that I'm going to wipe off my hand and
my face and my finger and what do you
know elf has hydrating water cleansing
cloths
I also snagged these guys now here's
something that you should be mindful of
if you're using a makeup wipe on your
skin obviously there is a residue so I
like to go in with a paper towel
I know it's harsh and wipe off that
residue so your foundation is still
going to be amazing and then you got to
go back in with your primer let your
skin have a moment and respray and
reprime that there we go she's feeling
glistening all right since this is kind
of like a first impressions that never
used any of this stuff before there were
two options to apply the foundation
there was this massage brush which I
just mentioned the massage foundation
brush as these really cool like rivets
in it it looks kind of a cloud and then
there is the elf beauty sponge which
you're not supposed to wet this I looked
on the instructions thinking it's like a
Beauty Blender but it's not it's a
little more tough and hard than a Beauty
Blender so I don't really know which one
to use I might try this out if I don't
love it I might try this one so let's
try this brush first because it looks
fucking cool now the instructions say to
apply foundation on
and so we're going back in with the hand
what's that too much never too much so
it says to swirl that around on your
hand
oh it like sits on top of the brush
alright and let's go to town on my face
and see what happens I think last year
2016 people put on away too much
concealer and way too much foundation
where it's just like unnecessary now who
the fuck am I to say how much makeup to
wear but I'm like girls tone it down I'm
all good with five layers but ten layers
girl okay well I mean unless you're
gonna have extreme sex or go swimming um
let's get to blending I think that
backings betting bad y'all betting bad
all it's making them oh no something in
the brochure is bad really I mean you
know and that's what happens you have a
foundation on something that all right
let's go a little more in and see if we
can get in there and you know you can't
forget the neck or the ears there I'm
gonna come back and haunt you at night
alright the foundation is a bowl ended
now not that I'm surprised because if we
all can rewind and go back to my
highlighter versus highlighter video L
fuckin slayed and not um shockingly cuz
I'm not surprised anymore
this foundation blended amazing so first
of all for a drugstore foundation to
impress me I'm like oh okay elf I'm
sorry
so the foundation and his brush are
amazing now I haven't used this I will
definitely have to try this out in a
later video but um this brush though you
guys I'm like oh okay I'm sorry it
blended out amazing which is kind of
shocking to me um I was hoping to be
shocked but I'm shocked in an even
better way but um alright let's get to
some consealer now I'm gonna go in with
the HD lifting concealer and this is
shade fair this was the lightest one
which kind of scares me because it
almost looks like my skin tone a lot of
brands they don't have like really
really light concealers it's really hard
to find so this concealer you just apply
it under the areas that you want to
cover and your fine lines will go away
um okay this is oh it's formulated with
vitamin C green tea and mulberry for
skin firming and soothing and benefit
bitch tied me up right now so I am going
to use this little synthetic foundation
concealer brush that was in the brush
felt and let's see what this even looks
like by the way I love a virgin wand
anyone else when you pull something out
and you're like oh my god nothing's been
touched okay so oh whoa what oh my god
it smells it okay
it smells very good I'm like all right
let's conceal where we normally conceal
and see what happens I'm like this is
not light enough for my pale ass but
we're gonna make it work
all right now usually I say let's bounce
but let's blend
all right she is a bull ended out I
forgot one would like to blend concealer
without a beauty blender I'm like oh my
god honey it's a little more work okay
so once again I am sitting here like
doom concealer now here's the only
problem is it is not light enough for me
personally so if anyone from elf is
watching bitch I want to see it almost
white concealer that would be sickening
so definitely not my shade it matches my
skin though which is a good thing it's
really luminous like it's pretty it
blended out really nice it looks like
very airbrush which is exactly what I
look for in a concealer now did really
brighten no we can always say that with
highlighter later but I think it
definitely did the job of what it was
supposed to Zhul now here's something
cool that elf has um I haven't like seen
anyone from another brand label it like
this but this is an under eye setting
powder it is in the shade sheer and it
comes in this little guy um really cute
very tiny packaging but maybe a little
goes a long way but we'll see in a
second and this is just supposed to you
know set your under eyes and your
concealer so let's give her a whirl okay
so we got a lot of powder in there all
right now we're gonna take this brush
and just dunk it in and shake it off
shake it off and oh wow
come through powder okay and let's just
set the under-eye
I'm also gonna set my lid this is kind
of like an extra primer I like to do I
like it a lot okay cool I'm excited
actually I'm like Spanky - all right now
what do we do after we do concealer
we're gonna do a little contour and
highlighting now I have so many damn
palettes from ELF here oh my god okay I
just lied um I found something else
called the prime and stay finishing
powder this is for all over your face so
before we do contour we're going to set
this damn foundation and see what
happens and I have to use this huge
brush it is stunning
now I'm gonna go in with the elf
complexion brush and I'm gonna go in
with the bronzer palette which looks
like these and there are four shades
three of them look like they're shimmer
or maybe through are they oh I don't
know that looks pretty matte but I think
I'm gonna go in with this guy and just
see what happens you know I don't want
to go overboard what's gonna lightly go
in there in case it's like crazy
I like this cuz it's buildable and it's
not like too intense sometimes I'll like
do one swipe and it's like holy shit
now let's carve out this jawbone a
little bit let everyone have it okay
cool I'm living for the cheeks now let's
snatch this forehead to filth
all right now we're going to take the
crease brush and this is what we're
going to snatch the nose I'm just going
to follow my natural bone structure and
then start bringing that in so if you
want your nose pinched this is what's
going down right now
alright and I'm gonna take that powder
brush from earlier and just go over the
lines and kind of diffuse them a little
bit I do want to kind of harsh though
all right I think you know usually like
the weight tool I highlight towards the
end but I kind of can't wait so let's
get to highlighting all right so there
are L has a lot of highlighters I was a
little shocked
they have this illuminating palette okay
BAM which looks like that those are all
shimmer shades and then they have the HD
highlighting powder which looks like
that and then we have a different color
highlighter from the highlighter versus
highlighter battle now this one is what
I mentioned last time that I didn't get
to use the shade is called pink diamonds
look how gorgeous that looks
I also got a lot of feedback to scrape
off the top layer of this highlighter
which I'm just going to do right now
with my nails because I'm a ghetto-ass
ho like and what and everyone said that
once the top layer is removed it is
really blinding so you guys say I just
kind of scrape that off
I have a trash can right here that you
can't see now I'm going to take a little
bit of that primer from earlier
I'm just got my mac fix+ I'm like no
bitch oh oh and we're just going to
spray this let me get the excess off oh
my god you guys I like a wet that brush
yes ma'am
okay now let's go back into miss pink
diamonds over here should we do it
should we do it okay let's fucking let's
fuckin highlight
now did that key below a little bit and
then we'll do a little bit of the nose
I'm just going to use my finger actually
just gotta go back and forth
alright guys highlighting is complete
alright now for brows I always get
scared with this line
I found the brow pencil from ELF of
course these are cool now I picked I
think this was the lightest shade I may
be lying about that and I also found
this elf little eyebrow kit it has like
a pomade type of thing this is like
cream this is not going on my skin I do
not have any hair and then this is a
more lighter little powder so I don't
know if I'm going to need it I guess we
will find out in a second let's sketch
up these brows
no shade to this it's just too thick for
me I mean obviously I think this is for
someone I already has a little bit of
here to go in there but like the more
use it it kind of got a little like
chubbier so like when I went over on
this side the bitch was like what arch
honey we're gonna do like a little wave
so um let's just tailor this look
accordingly and go in alright today
these eyebrows are definitely sisters
and not twins so I'm gonna do a little
bit more work on them with this eyebrow
duo brush and we're just gonna go in
with this powder right here and see if
it's gonna blend and work to my
advantage so this is going real quick
here alright the brows are as good as
humanly possible today I don't really
mind them the pencil was a little too
chubby or like fat around the point oh
my god this sounds like a fucking porno
it was just a little too thick at the
end for me never thought I'd said it
before and then the powder of course
it's really more for natural hairs so
the powder was not like the best thing
on earth but it did look cute
so these caterpillars are gonna have
their moment today alright so for eyes
we're just gonna jump right into these
little eyes here I'm gonna go in with
the pearl eye primer this I don't know
let's pray it works because sometimes if
you like put a barrier between your
shadow it doesn't always work for your
skin type but okay so I'm just gonna dot
this on my lids I don't know really what
I'm doing here with this product I think
I'm just gonna do like I would do my
Urban Decay and we'll just buff that
primer on our lives
okay this is a very quick drying I
should have definitely blended this I
first it's like already drying down
which is good to know but also a problem
when you're doing a full face of first
impressions you learn quickly how all
right so when I mentioned I was going to
do this video a lot of you were tweeting
me about the new elf matte eyeshadow
palette what is this on call this is a
matte format - let's see what the color
story is begum oh okay that's that's a
nice little color story here so I'm
gonna take a little Packer brush and I'm
just gonna go in with the lightest shade
is it light enough for me and that's
fine
now this light shade doesn't have a
whole lot of pigment it is very sheer
all right the light shade is laid down
it is very soft I don't really see it
that well but hey is there hope because
it is shirt I'm going to go in with this
color for fun it's like a violet color
now purples are really hard to pull off
formula wise for a lot of brands for
some reason it never works out so let's
see what happens here
oh right this is a blended and now we're
just going to take that first Packer
brush and go back in with the light
shade hmm and then we're gonna go right
below our brow bone and we're just going
to soften the smokiness of our blending
right here
just make sure it looks seamless and
slutty I mean simple we can't just stop
here people I'm gonna go back in with
this eye shadow brush and I'm just going
to take this color right here and kind
of smoke out my lower lash line with it
so it'll bring me a little warmth to my
face okay
all right so I also have this Elle baked
highlighter and blush duo this is the
rose gold one it looks something like
this and that looks so pretty I kind of
just want to take this Packer brush and
just hit that once and see what happens
okay give it I gave it a little bit of a
little a little shine there is so much
elf stuff on my table I kind of forgot
half the stuff that was here so I just
found this underneath my mirror I'm like
I know I have more eye shadow stuff this
is a molten liquid eye shadow in shade
liquid gold so as soon as you put this
on the lid you gotta like tap it in or
blend it quickly it says so that's good
to know
okay I'm gonna put the pipe down because
this is the rose gold shade this is the
liquid gold one I packed I have like a
unit cartons all over here so I'm just
gonna take this out oh there's the
little doe foot brush and let's just
apply I'll pop a pop apply let's just
apply this to the lid and see what
happens right now Oh work okay
okay so I think the only thing I want to
do real quickly is to go back in with a
pallet with that little brush and just
kind of make sure everything's really
blended I think that's dry right it says
it's quick dry which I that I do first
you guys I was going to go in so the
lines are really blended and nice and
they just kind of go together there we
go
let's finish off this look with some
mascara now there's two types here we
have the what is this one the volumizing
mascara and then I throw away this box
so I don't even know what kind of
mascara this is smart I know thank you I
guess let's see that wand okay so we got
this one
oh it's like flexible it's like when I
do the splits at night and the cameras
rock and then we have this guy oh okay I
think I would have going with this one
because these are more type of wand I'm
used to I'm not really into this type of
wand
I'm a wand type of gal alright let's
coat these lashes and see what happens
all right mascara is done I'm really
shocked and surprised of how great this
was like okay girl now I don't have any
false lashes from elf if they make them
I should probably pause this in google
it but hey I don't have any lashes your
mouth so if they make them I'm going to
order them when this video is over sorry
that it's the only thing I fucked up I
missed out so really the only thing left
besides setting the face is the lips we
have highlight mean we can always add
another highlight why do I kind of want
to do that as I'm weird I kind of want
to go in with this little compact
shimmer and see if it can make anything
else
blinding on my face and I'm just going
to go in with a fan brush
oh hello pigment I'm sorry work and
let's just tap the excess off but I'm
gonna put this a little bit over the
pink just see if it does anything it's
really subtle and faint but you know
maybe add a little extra hmm to moisture
my skin now for the lips oh here we go
guys I'm nervous I don't know which one
to pick
so I have a few liquid lipsticks I think
these might be like a gloss because it
says high shine alright I think I'm
leaning towards this one it's called
naked nude and we're in the winter
season fall just happened to me fall
still here is fallen which are the same
thing and kind of is to me I'm gonna go
in with this I've never used this
formula before I'm excited Oh
mmm that's yummy I'm like okay
all right this'll it is very cute like
come on gloves
I don't wear a little gloss on my
channel but mmm are you guys
this look is almost complete I guess
we're gonna go back in with that primer
mist and it says you can set your makeup
with it so let's give it a whirl mmm oh
that spray comes out harsh look at that
forehead she's glistening so let's let
this settle into the skin
i'ma slap myself in the eye all right
I'm gonna let down my hair and take a
few hits and I'll be right back all
right guys this is the final final final
look I really love it tell me why that
like shimmer shadow on the end kind of
like changed my path of life right now
cuz I lived for it and I just quickly
want to say thank you guys for you know
just first of all requesting this idea
which I love and then I was like really
pleasantly shocked at how bomb this line
is I really never gave nobody didn't
give up a chance it's just it was never
really on my radar until recently um and
I'm pleasantly surprised at how
sickening the line is like even the
brushes I was like cuz a lot of
drugstore brushes you guys already know
it's like but these were like really
really great so thank you guys for the
idea I had so much fun filming it and if
you guys have any more ideas which I
know you do leave some comments below
and also what was your favorite product
I used on my face I loved about like 80%
of everything that I use so thank you
guys so much for watching this video and
of course I'll see you in a few days
because you know this bitch ain't
slowing down its 2017 I have so many
more videos coming so stay tuned
