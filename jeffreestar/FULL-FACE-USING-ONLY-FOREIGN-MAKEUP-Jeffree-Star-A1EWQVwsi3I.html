channel hi how are ya today I am finally
doing my full face using only foreign
makeup now what the hell does that mean
well a few months ago I took a trip to
Europe where I was in the country of
Finland I was expanding jeffree star
cosmetics and I am now in a retail store
out there called Sol coast and we are in
a bunch of stores we are about to be in
over 300 so if you were out in Finland
hi how are ya
so basically we went to a makeup
convention out there I had a huge booth
I met a lot of fans subscribers and
makeup lovers we're about to show some
vlog footage from that trip in a minute
but I thought I want to try makeup that
you can't buy in America so know a lot
of you at home are like foreign what do
you mean by that now of course there's
brands like YSL and your and Sicily this
may be a little bit foreign but we're
gonna go off the deep end
so there's brands you guys that I'm
about to show you that I have never
heard about in my entire life until I
went to that country so part of my trip
was also to scout this place called so
coast and see if I wanted my brand in
there so I had no idea what I was gonna
walk into so basically it is like a
foreign Sephora they have everything
from Maybelline to Urban Decay all the
way to like natural makeup like they
have everything there so I thought okay
this place is legit and then one of the
people they were like try out some of
these brands that you can't buy in
California or anywhere in America and I
thought okay so I grabbed the big bag
and I bought as much stuff as possible
to do a full face so there may be a few
items missing here besides that I do
want to quickly thank everyone who
entered my Gucci giveaway last week oh
my god over half a million of you
entered which is so crazy but shout out
to the winners of course they were
announced on my snapchat my twitter and
they're also linked in the description
of that Gucci video which is right
before this one so shout out to the one
arrows and of course I will be doing a
lot more giveaways shortly maybe even in
my next video so stay tuned besides that
I'm gonna show you some footage from my
trip it was so fun and thank you to
everyone that came out to support their
brand I really appreciate it it was like
such a magical moment I love Finland and
I would definitely be back in the spring
for I mean great so here is
the blog footage
we can change anything and make it
better together now we're strong don't
question it
the truth will break your cheese we have
the key open your eyes and see
inside one
they can show
anything will make it
open your eyes
everything you fighting for
inside we'll find a place a we call home
they can sure
anything will make it
so it was such a magical trip like the
turnout when I walked into that
convention me and Nathan like our jaws
dropped I was like wow so there is a
brand in Finland called Lumina and I'm
just gonna show you some of their
packaging it looks like this so I tried
to grab as much stuff as I could from
the brand we have vase mist we have
powder foundation we have normal
foundation we have brushes we have CC
cream we have lip balm ice shadow
palettes mascara blush lipstick lip
gloss lip liner we got it all so we're
gonna try everything out today we're
just gonna see what works what doesn't
I'm so nervous
alright so the first item that we're
going to try is the lumen a Arctic
spring water enriched facial mist ooh
alright so this says that it is
a pure hydration and a flash this
refreshing mist made of ingredients such
as Arctic Springs water and potent
Nordic birch sap provoke Jesus provides
skin with a hit of replenishment
throughout the day okay so you can use
this before moisturizer or over your
makeup to freshen up
oh it's like a fine mist okay mmm smells
very skin carry all right so now this is
kind of you know this is gonna make a
little first impressions as well you
guys obviously know I've never used any
of this stuff before so as I go I'm just
gonna give a little feedback and we'll
see how I look at the end now
other that I grabbed was the Nordic
chic mattifying and pore smoothing
primer this is more of my alley
let's keep it real here so I guess we
will try her out and then also I got CC
color correcting primer which I mean I
can't use all three so we're just gonna
have to pick a few let's try this first
woah it's like a silicone II almost
reminds me of like benefit Porefessional
let's just rub this all over and see how
my pores look now looking in the mirror
I will say this I notice a slight
difference so from here to here I can
tell I can see my pores a little bit
more here seems a little bit more
blurred but not like severely now we are
going to dive in to foundation here's
where it gets tricky
I have like four formulas sitting here
in front of me I could do a half face or
I could just pick one I'm not sure what
to do here but we have the sentence a
flawless satin foundation now I will say
there's this bottle I love the packaging
it's stunning I love the ombre fade I
love this weird shape I love a satin
foundation and it's called flawless so
let's pray it works great and it has SPF
so you know what bitch hates the Sun you
also want to show you guys that we got
the where to go the sensei anti-aging
foundation now this is more of a sure
one so that's why I'm sure a lot of you
were like its anti-aging put it on it's
not the fullest coverage so I definitely
probably gonna go with this one but I
want to show you guys the weird
packaging maybe not so weird but it's
interesting it's cool it's definitely
unique and sticks out and
we also have the lumen a matte
foundation it's looks like a Maybelline
I kind of like component oh they're all
sealed which we love so I guess let's
just put you both on my hand
this and this and see which one we like
the best Oh
bitch she is full coverage okay okay so
that was this one now let me use a
little bit of this one on my hand here
oh wow that's darker than that one is
that the shade girl okay well we're
about to see okay you guys you know
we're gonna do we're gonna take my
finger we're gonna go like this okay
that color match ain't you far off so
there we have that one right here got
that shear and then this one this is
gonna be I'm scared of this color oh
well let's just buff it into my skin
this one is really yellow now I do have
another shade though shade too let's
shake her up now that looks like this
shade whoa look at the it's getting like
weird and sheer oh I like it cuz it's a
little darker and it like matches my
neck enough running my gums we're gonna
try actually this one the aluminum matte
foundation it's oil free this is shade 2
in soft honey alright I just cleaned out
my hand and wipe that all off I actually
had to uh remiss now I'm gonna reprime
slightly because they did have to start
over so where's gonna hit this spot one
more time and we are going to put this
on I'm just gonna do a little bit and
see how full coverage this really goes
well that's bounce alright so here is
the foundation blend it out with just a
few drops it actually covered a lot I
like the coverage so far I would
probably add a little more I think the
color is good let's just pray it doesn't
oxidize cuz then I might look a little
crazy so far I think it looks really
nice and let's just show you guys this
side of the face which is fully done now
and then the other side what you see
online reverse is what you're getting
real a
right now I'm just going to finish up
this foundation and see how it looks
all right the foundation is on I like to
just buff and buff until my wrists hurt
but it actually looks really pretty whoa
okay so I'm kind of shocked that I like
the sound ation this much is settling
nice it's not crazy or being weird it
hasn't really oxidized yet praying next
step if I were to do my makeup would be
concealer here's the problem everyone
let me show you this is the Nordic chic
cover stick this is in zero one so this
was the lightest shade which is kind of
shocking I want to show you guys this is
a literally darker than my actual skin
tone so I don't know how I would conceal
with this I think it's gonna look very
weird I'm just gonna try this right here
I was like a kind of a joke because look
at that how am I supposed to brighten
and conceal with this girl I'm gonna
buff this out concealer the only thing I
don't have so we're just gonna take a
random concealer here because I'm over
it random meaning one of my favorites
the shape tape by Tarte mom we just need
some concealer so I will be blending
this out and I will be right back
alright so moving on I definitely have
to try there setting powder is Laura
Mercier gonna be shook or what so what
is this supposed to do is this
translucent I guess we should probably
read the box people okay directions
apply all over face or in the t-zone for
external use only thank God
let's set the concealer of course it
comes with this crazy little moment
where we have to peel it back and let
the powder shine we're gonna take our
damp Beauty sponge and we're just going
to dip once and let's see what happens
all right we're just gonna let this bake
for a second and let's see well what
happens
so luminate actually has a powder brush
I am just going to sweep away this
powder and let's see what it looks like
okay I mean that definitely set my
concealer didn't leave any crazy like
lines to me or anything weird it blended
in really nicely into the skin well I
missed a spot also with this brush since
we have it in my hand I want to try the
long-wear blur powder so you guys know I
love packing on the powder and this is a
long way or powder foundation fast and
easy makeup alright so we will see what
this shade looks like this is shade
number one again here we are okay let's
put that on mmm okay and then we have
shade two which I can't seem to open
with this damn sticker so shade two
looks like this and shade one looks like
this so okay
che - looks a little more pinky and I am
definitely a cool tone so let's just dab
this in here and see what happens
now I'm gonna avoid my under eyes
because I do not want them really cakey
and I love them bright so we are just
going to go around alright now I'm going
to might as well just use this mirror
let's see what this looks like
okay she's definitely blurred she looks
cute now that powder foundation was nice
I will say that so of course next I
would bronze or contour but guess what
I somehow my dumbass did not get a
contour or a bronzer shade I did grab of
course a highlighting palette I have a
cream blush palette but no contour I'm
like mad at myself so I guess I'll just
bronze up my cheeks really quickly and
not do much of contour because I don't
really need to today so I'm just gonna
take my favorite Marc Jacobs coconut
moment and we're just gonna take this
huge brush and just kind of buff this
into my skin very lightly its first dive
into this little blush palette so this
is the Lumina invisible illumination
which is kind of a weird word because if
it's invisible how are we supposed to
illuminate girl but anywho this one has
like a cream shimmer which looks
something like that let's just do a
little swatch on the hand it's alright
it's kind of it's very doing glowy
very sheer and then we have two blushes
I would probably go with this one today
and oh my god that's sheer let's put
that right there okay wow this is for
someone that probably doesn't want to
wear a lot of makeup so we're to try it
anyway
let me take my damp Beauty Blender and
just hit the apples of my cheeks girl
what it's on the Beauty Blender I can
see a little bit of peach but bitch
where's the pigment hi the pigment can't
come to the phone right now
I do have more blush hi we got a powder
blush here this is the lumen a Nordic
nude light reflecting blush in shade -
okay let's try this now I love the
little design on the compact so we have
to show that off very cute now let's
pray that this one actually has pigment
so I'm just gonna take a little NARS
kabuki brush I'm just gonna dip in there
a few times
okay let's give it a whirl y'all let's
give it a whirl
whoo we have a little bit of pig man
okay we were building on top of that
cream that was already laid down so it
definitely has something to stick to
okay I'm not mad at it it's cute it's
buildable I don't hate it but I grabbed
for this every day
probably not moving on we are going to
try the aluminum Nordic nude the
illuminating palette all right so this
comes in the same type of component as
the blushes but these are actually all
powder and let's pray to God they work
now I'm gonna take this little morphe
rose gold highlighting brush let's try
this one now what shade is this oh we
usually I'm used to like okay no no okay
so is this powder should we touch it
first let's try she's full powder ooh
let's just put okay enough running our
gums let's try this out here whew okay
we're getting somewhere
is it the most blinding thing on earth
no but on camera I'm looking into my
monitor and girl this looks bright okay
so you guys know what I like to do like
take the highlight and kind of go all
the way back I want to be so bright
people look at us like alright now you
know the drill we're gonna do our
Cupid's bow BAM
and if you're feeling it just a little
tip of the nose if you will hmmm oh
right my cheeks are looking glossy and
pretty so high I actually do really like
that palette just gives you a little
moment of like mmm everything's on
what's next feet ball so I'm looking
down here and of course the next is eyes
now a lot of you were gonna say Jeffrey
where's the eyebrow pencil I didn't find
anything new in the eyebrow realm that
was acceptable to use this brand had
like a pencil but no pomade
no powder nothing so today we are gonna
just serve a little extraterrestrial
realness let's move on to eyes I do have
the Nordic eyeshadow primer from Lumina
now this is a smoothing eyeshadow primer
for creased free vibrant and lasting
color dab a small amount of eyeshadow
primer onto your lids before applying
eyeshadow the directions you guys I
swear
alright woah this is tiny okay let's
just see what happens here
now since I have no nails for the first
time ever you guys are gonna see me
apply this with my finger
I know that is very shocking on this
channel I'm sitting here shocked myself
it feels a very like waitlist that
should be enough I'm gonna dab a little
bit under my eye now I shut up palette
these brands did not really have a lot
of like what you would call palettes
like we're used palettes you open it up
you're like holy these brands have
more of like the drugstore realm of this
type of palette so I got the Nordic in
noir eyeshadow palette in style smokey
it looks something like this the
packaging is very cheap it feels a very
like right ad where it's like okay yeah
the qualities mm-hmm
you know hey terminus you never know
what you're gonna get right so we're
gonna create a little look with just
this palette you know mean we're gonna
dive into here and just do a little base
no I'm just gonna use brushes of course
that I already owned there was not a lot
of makeup brushes out there I'm like
hitting this and it doesn't seem to be
that much pigment on here but I could be
full of let's try it oh and I'm
full of yeah I'm just gonna pack
that in there now this one definitely
has pigment I'm gonna bring it up like
it's a brow highlight and we're just
gonna kind of buff up and out and keep
it I see of course
repeat on the other side all right we
are alien out and we are feeling the
fantasy so now we're going to take what
are we gonna take here let's try I'm
just gonna go bold and dip into this one
and see what happens so this is like a
smoky grey black it does have some
fallout but hi it's an eye shadow it's
supposed to not extreme though we're
gonna dust that off I guess let's see if
this one works Oh bitch and does she
work look at that oh wow okay so
luminaid playing with their shadows no I
don't know what the hell I was gonna do
I was just gonna do a little smoky
moment so I'm just gonna drag this up
into the shimmer and just to let it have
a fade
all right baby I have literally only
used two shades and I've just flicked
the brush up to create like a little a
smoky moment and girl now only the only
thing I have to say about this is that
this shadow is so like it's very
pigmented okay
so it's kind of going into the white
because the pans are so close
so that's my only pet peeve but besides
that I love how this is looking
now we're going to go into this slate
kind of what would you call this a
bluish gray if you will and we're just
going to lightly dab into that and now
I'm going to place that right here and I
tucked the brush off and I don't seem to
be seeing any color on that shade one
second there we go oh it is lighter okay
well the other two shades look bomb I
could honestly do a look with two
eyeshadows and call it a day but
maybe we'll try this one
let's go back in with this brush and
we'll just hit this guy what's the
difference here I got a C that is so
sheer why are these two bomb and these
two not I'm just gonna take a little bit
here and try to press this here
not into it okay we tried so basically
two of the shadows are great I love
these two the other ones are kind of
like yeah they're not the best but hey
we tried didn't we to finish this up I'm
actually gonna take this same brush and
see if this color has any pigment right
below my eye so let's just kind of brush
that along my lash line and maybe smoke
her out it's something it's very sheer
actually don't mind it for this little
kind of like under-eye thing but yeah
that is just not that pigmented it's
kind of bizarre how this shimmer shade
is not as pigmented as the other ones
but that happens with people sometimes
or brands their is not consistent
and now we know all right so I'm just
gonna drag this out
turn up the drama so lightly I'm like
it's Jim no it's not dramatic I'm lying
to myself okay so we're just gonna try
to bump that up as much as we can and
then I'm gonna actually take the same
brush did all the shadow off go back
into this very icy one here and just
press that shadow right in the inner
corner it's cute now it's time for some
mascara now here's the problem with that
they had a lot of mascaras we have the
sensei mascara
38 degrees Celsius volumizing that's
what that one is called very bizarre
name okay the bottle is unique looks a
little Lancome ewwww whoa that is a long
on the end very bizarre hmm okay
and then we have the illuminate or does
this one deep impact mascara mmm
okay oh I love these big ones okay and
then we have the lumen a full on volume
so we have full on volume and then this
one let's see that what the brush looks
like bitch
okay okay and then this one has a seal
on it it looks like the batch okay well
I'm gonna go with the big boy you guys
know I love big bulky things and let's
see if this even works
I like it a lot I'm like whoa I'm kind
of scared a big one sometimes because he
either makes your mascara look shitty or
really bomb and look at the difference
you guys I am not mad at this at all I
didn't even curl the lashes just
straight raw and they're Keela alright
that mascara did the trick
definitely love that one I'm shook about
it okay so moving on now we have ellipse
now here we go you guys we have
lipsticks
we have matte lips we have glosses we
have liners but I think I'm just gonna
pick a nude ish lip this one is called
endless light and it is a matte lipstick
let's see if it's really matte all right
the packaging looks awake oh this is
kind of basic nothing too exciting but
hey it's a silver bullet right okay so
we're just going to let's put it on
directly and see what happens all right
first impressions it's going on nice
it's not like full matte it almost feels
like a satin in a matte hybrid so far
and let's keep applying I'll write the
lipstick ooh this shade and look I'm
kind of feeling this fantasy right now
okay so this was good I'll give you my
final thoughts in the outro in a second
but I do want to put some gloss on it
now sensei has this lip gloss no this is
the silky oh it's all it's called silky
lip gloss
okay now this one just looks really
pretty in the bottle it's like very
shimmery and glittery let's see if it
actually works
I'm just gonna put directly on let's see
if it works ooh y'all see that glitter
okay
oh it feels very slippery it's not
sticky it feels very wet but in a good
way I mean there's wet ever a bad thing
Wow I am really liking this gloss
already okay hmm all right you guys so
I'm sitting here like wow my desk looks
like a tornado
we've tried out everything we possibly
can here there's a few things I didn't
get to try like lip balm do we need to
try to lift balm on camera maybe in the
future and some other lip glosses that
we really didn't get to try from the
brand that we can definitely implement
implement implement we'll implement
these in later videos if you guys want
but that is the full face using only
foreign makeup so I think it's time to
give my final thoughts
so first thought was there was no
setting spray maybe I didn't see it in
the store or get around to it but I
didn't see one but when we go back to
the very first product we use this one
says that you can actually freshen up
your makeup throughout the day well it's
I've been filming for over an hour and
let's just spray this on anyway maybe
it'll give me a little extra something I
like to spray in the beginning now that
it's kind of like I've used it again
it's very floral so it almost feels like
you're spraying perfume on yourself if
you don't mind that or weird fragrances
then you don't you might like this one
okay let's go through it primer and i
beez better it was alright it was like a
knockoff of benefit and i think benefits
is kind of better so this was yeah it
was alright foundation I love it I'm
sitting here like I love the foundation
this was very beautiful the powder
foundation loved it as well the setting
powder very much like RCM a colorless
powder I really like this one so I think
these are gonna be not staples but we're
definitely gonna be keeping them any
pile of stuff to use in the future now
things that are popping out to me I love
the mascara it was so pretty I'm loving
this gloss even though I just applied it
it's sexy it's stunning I love it the
only thing I wasn't obsessed with was
this guy now we all saw that these
shadows did work I don't know what
happened to these three the formula was
not consistent and they just kind of
flopped for me so maybe they're not the
best with eyeshadow moving on I shadow
primer and I
mean it's on but my eyes always look
like this so this didn't blow my mind
and what else am I missing I think the
highlight was cute
definitely the blush though this
invisible blush like I can't we're not
using that again okay but the highlight
was cute I did like it we talked about
the mascara I'm kind of surprised so
when I go back to this country
definitely gonna have to grab some more
stuff and also if you do want me to
continue this series leave some feedback
down below I have a lot of trips planned
I will be in Italy in March I am going
to Brazil and bonus Aires in Argentina
in the spring where else am I going I'm
going back to Finland of course and
there is so many trips this year plan so
if you want me to find other make up in
other countries hit your girl up but
thank you so much for watching today's
video
