channel did you come after saying that
intro or puke I hope you did something
that for that buy the fucking thing but
of course if you haven't already guessed
yet today I'm doing the full face using
only glitter challenge now let's do a
quick little recap this summer me and
nikkietutorials both uploaded our full
face using only highlighters challenge
together
shout out to Mario girl a lot has
happened since we all did that and that
was like six months ago in June and
since then every month there is a full
face using something type of product
which we've all done it now but I think
it's only fitting before this year is up
to cover my entire existence in glitter
and see what happens now I've already
been trying to match a like my skin tone
and that's a hard one I mean nothing's
natural about this challenge
um and today I'm mainly going to be
using glitter injections look at that
hollow horn though okay let's just we
had to open this up real quick oh this
is like heaven so these are all glitters
from glitter injections which is a
really cool brand that makes crazy
glitters and besides this one I got even
more glitters you guys thought I was
gonna play around with this challenge we
got some crazy shit today look at these
big ones though oh fuck man besides that
and before we dive into this challenge I
have one quick thing to say if you guys
have been following me for a long time
you know that I used to do music for
about 910 years a big chunk of my life I
spent touring the entire world and
performing music so a long time ago I
put out a vinyl record in 2012 that was
in the shape of a heart and it looks
like this and it sold out literally in
like a few days and I never put out a
vinyl record after that I quit music and
I of course started my makeup company
and sort of teaching classes around the
world so this means a lot to me
shoutout to anyone that has is out there
you are one of only 5,000 I am actually
going to bring it back next year for the
spring and I'm going to press a few
other colors for fun on another
I recently made a brand new vinyl in the
shape of a star and it looks like this
and it is for my single prom night that
I put out in 2012 oh my god where's the
time gone and it looks like this and
these are almost sold out but if you go
to my website Jeffrey's or cosmetics
calm there are a few more available and
we are making a purple version of this
but there was only a few thousand of
these made and they are lying so how did
it talk about that for a second now if
you want to see me cover my entire world
and glitter thank you for watching
alright so I already litter my hair and
somehow on my forehead and I haven't
even put anything on it like glitter
gets everywhere but I cut into it okay
so because glitter is so drying I'm
gonna just prime my face with the trusty
tried-and-true Bobbi Brown a vitamin
enriched face base if you've been here
for a while you know I've been using on
my channel on and off throughout the
entire year one of my favorites and
we're just gonna put this all over our
skin alright now I guess the first thing
you do is you try to find a foundation
glitter color that matches you and I put
like three on I don't even know like how
do you shake match yourself with glitter
I'm scared this one maybe that one is
too dark that's more like a bronze and
this is pure gold do I want a pure gold
face kind of honestly let's be really
really err so glitter injections has
these products called glitter
highlighters which I thought was really
cool and I found a shade called
margarita which looks like this and I
don't know you guys I guess we all we
can do is try it now I just put a little
bit on my cheek and I'm like okay this
might work so I'm just gonna go in with
my oval-8 artiste brush and pray for the
best so I'm just gonna take this brush
and kind of go oh oh I mean let's let's
let's give it a whirl y'all let's give
it a whirl
all right so I quickly took a
five-second break and I add if you
weren't light on the side because
glitter for some reason when I'm looking
directly at the camera you kind of see
it now when I turn you're like oh look
so I just wanted a little more uh but
I'm alright I'm not even done my
forehead is blank and my other my face
is like alright we're ready for more so
I'm just going to Pat this into the skin
I'm getting glitter everywhere which is
obviously the point of this challenge
now I'm going to go in with the shade
pina colada
from glitter injections and I'm going to
take my finger and just press this under
my eye for like a little concealer
effect and the whole point of concealer
is to of course conceal our flaws and
discoloration so this is the perfect
product and of course we're going to
highlight our chin a little bit can't
forget about that and now I want to say
highlight I mean conceal and highlight
with the hot with a you know concealer
well it's going to go down our nose and
tiny bit and of course hit that forehead
alright next step we are going to take
another artiste brush and we're going to
do a little bit of contour now who've
lord help me now letter injections also
has something called a glitter bronzer
and these are darker litter shades I'm
not really sure what color to use for
contour there are two options there is a
mint let us see minty mocha and a more
de verano okay girl now these are it oh
my god I'm like do I do this one or do I
do this one I guess we can just try both
and see what happened I'm gonna go in
with this one first minty mocha and oh
come on yes and we're just gonna see
what happens
Wow if you want to get your cheekbones
snatched for life and you better use
this one I'm just going to lightly
contour this job hello jawline how's
your day and of course I'm just going to
use the side of the brush and
barely go like that and we're gonna
snatch this nose honey yes all right
contour is looking saw lady yes come
through muddiness
okay I mean for glitter you guys I'm not
mad at this at all I'm like bitch all
right now putting glitter on top of
glitter on top of glitter help me laughs
help me now next step is we can either
do eyes or we can highlight I mean I
want to highlight let's keep it really
hood right now okay so for highlighting
I'm actually gonna go in with this
Martha Stewart star-shaped glitter this
is in shade sugar cube and shout out to
adore Delano
I haven't never heard of these glitters
before until she was on my channel and
now I am I'm hooked whoo-hoo I've never
used these before and you might need a
little bit of a glitter adhesive I don't
know maybe you spit or Lube or something
when I got in here fuck man I'm just
gonna do with my finger and see what
happens so I'm just gonna take a little
bit out
oh my god are like iridescent ooh
unicorn stars like look pretty little
arm mm-hmm and I'm just going to put
these just where I would highlight
normally on the high plains of my cheeks
uh-huh whoo I like not leaving my finger
it's like no bitch I'm just gonna
sprinkle them on my face like that let
them all fall down on my private area
huh oh my god so pretty
hmm oh all right now I'm just
highlighting the Cupid's bow and I guess
half of my mouth looks cute look at that
star right on my lip oh and we're gonna
take a little bit of the star glitter
and just go down my nose like hi there
look at the little star on my nose all
right I think it's now time to move on
to the eyes so I'm gonna be going in
with this little transition shade of
course from litter injections as well
and I'm just gonna use a synthetic
morphe brush this is the g17 never the
gone started on the lid like this so I
guess we can pretend this is a crease
color uh-oh
oh shit all right we're just gonna pop
that right in the crease yes
all right now that that transition shade
is in there we definitely need a lead
color so I'm like ah what do we have for
the lids I think I'm gonna go in with
just gorgeous
like silvery pewter type of shade and
I'm just gonna put this on my lid and
what am I gonna need to use for the book
all right I'm gonna go with this little
artiste brush and we're just gonna dip
right in there huh oh shit you guys okay
and let's just apply this directly on
the lid oh hi oh my God look at those
blending together you better fucking
work eyes just give me my everyday look
you guys all right now I'm gonna take
this same shade and I'm just gonna put
it right under my eyes that's just you a
little bit all right now I'm going to go
in with a darker color now let's see
what we've got going on around here
now I'm gonna actually go back into the
eye add more of that color I think it
looks really pretty now since I have
zero eyebrows um luckily I don't need to
draw any on because I think this lets us
in matched without it but to finish off
the eyes I am gonna be going in with
some glitter mascara yes it does exist
and it's about one of my favorite brands
YSL oh my god now I was looking up like
okay what do you use for mascara for
this you can't just use into normal
fucking like like what am I gonna use I
don't even know so I found this oh my
god that is so hard to read vinyl
Couture mascara I've never used this
before I got it on on Sephora and I
think it's the perfect time to use it so
if you see it is like a graphite black
like charcoal beautiful look at this
that's silver in there though oh my god
alright now we're just gonna go in with
this I have no idea if it works so let's
give it a whirl
all right now we're gonna do the bottoms
now I'm not really seeing that crazy of
a difference it's definitely making my
lashes a little darker there's barely
any glitter on them but hey the idea was
cute it's a little underwhelming so
sorry
next okay so I told myself if the
mascara was bomb I was not gonna do
lashes but since it kind of flopped I am
gonna put on some lashes definitely
think that's needed and necessary so I'm
gonna be going in with the new bounce
some Serengeti lashes these are so
stunning and shout out to Manning for
putting me onto the style because it's
sickening
so I'm going to quickly pop these on and
let's see how they look
all right the lashes are on I'm feeling
this fantasy I think we do need a little
bit of blush and of course a lip so for
blush I'm gonna be going in with a rose
gold glitter let's see what we got going
on here okay so the blush looks a little
bit like this on the brush it is really
soft kind of rose gold II I'm just gonna
turn it Pat it in here I have so much
going on it might look fucking crazy ah
that's alright I mean honestly what
glitter on top of glitter on top of
glitter my face is like what the hell
are we doing I think there could be a
little bit more highlight so I found
this new Burberry gold glitter oh look
how chunky that is I love a good chunky
glitter now this is called oh my god
gold glitter number one - shimmer just
alright Burberry oh girl I'm actually
gonna maybe press that up my lid as well
this shit is bomb let's just press a
little bit in there for fun huh oh oh
okay yes and a little there come on gold
cute I'm living for it alright now last
but not least the lips alright now we're
gonna go in with the glitter injections
hot pink glitter in shade a cherry pie
woo I'm excited for this one I'm like
fuck okay and I'm gonna go back in with
another artiste brush and we're just
gonna see what happens
alright guys the lip is on this look is
complete I definitely think I need some
hair maybe the same here I used in my
full face highlighter video for just a
little throwback so I will be right back
alright guys this is the final final
look
I feel like Barbie on acid right now I
don't even know what that one star on
the tip of my nose is giving me anxiety
there we go oh look and that's on my
nail whatever alright guys I had so much
fun with this challenge I don't know how
the hell I'm going to take it off I feel
like maybe the blooper should be me
trying to get all this shit off in my
bathroom I don't fucking know but stick
until the end which I guess we're at the
end so in a second I'm gonna attempt to
take all this off I'm scared
honestly I am scared for my life do I
know why cuz I don't want to take it off
I really could look like this forever I
think this is an easy everyday you know
just quick summer bronze look and um I'm
feeling the fantasy
know but um I don't know you guys I'm
attracted to anything sparkly so I'm
just staring in the camera like that
under our high light might be my new
thing now for my own brand I am working
on a concealer that will be out later
next year and I might just fill up the
whole thing with star glitter and fuck
the concealer because this shit looks
good alright you guys thank you so much
for watching
ah another challenge I think we've done
so many full faces this year I just want
to get a shout out to everybody that did
one after me and Nikki did our videos
there has been just a million all over
the internet and it is so fun to watch
so continuing on the legacy I had a lot
of fun with this and um mwah as always
I'll see you on the next one bye guys
who
step one is we're going to take off this
damn wig Mike
this is like I almost want to sleep in
this but then I thought my bed would be
ruined so we're just going to go ahead
and attempt to take this all off also
these lashes have got to come off first
I don't want to go blind and then these
contact lenses oh my god
and now normally when I took out my
makeup I used it clean neat take the day
off
balm and some Mac white so I guess so
I'm just going to take this clinic take
the day off a bomb a lot of it I might
even need more now this kind of melts
off your makeup instantly with the
glitter though oh my and here's where
you would get some hot fucking water and
break it comes off so let's hate when
you grab the wipes and ten come out I'm
like bitch I only 101 but today I
probably will need 100 all right here's
the scary part now if I go blind
everybody it was really nice seeing you
all and uh around the eyes that was
tricky because the chunk falls in there
and you rub it it's over okay I think
I'm gonna go see if Nathan can get some
of this off um insert porn joke here and
um alright guys what I'm feeling when XO
do I might still have glitter on me but
uh fuck it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
