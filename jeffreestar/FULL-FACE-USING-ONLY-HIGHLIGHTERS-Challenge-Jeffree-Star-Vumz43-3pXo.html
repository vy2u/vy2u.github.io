if you have an iPhone or Instagram or
any type of social media you have
probably seen this meme this week this
was everywhere now this is a girl named
aria and she's from Dubai and she is a
makeup artist and loved it that she's
self-taught hi self-taught right here
now she did a video where she does her
whole entire face with highlighters and
I was sitting there like damn why the
hell did I not think of that first so
I'm my girl you are genius highlighting
is seriously what I literally wake up
every morning thinking about and I'm
like when can I glow or the dog's bed
does Nathan have breakfast it's time to
glow so when I saw her video I was so
inspired if you have not seen it it's a
link down below in the description box
and I also linked her Instagram and
everything about her so please check her
out she is so talented and after
watching this I was like girl I got to
do my own recreation so this is the
jeffree star version of using
highlighters only to do a full face of
makeup all right now parental advisory
before you watch any further you better
wear your sunglasses you better have
your SPF 100 on and you just better be
careful so if you want to see how all
this happens keep on watching if not I
mean I don't blame you cause it's gonna
burn all right for foundation today
we're going to be using a NARS
illuminator this is just a really soft
subtle you know natural little glow and
I'm going to be using my favorite morphe
foundation brush
now this is definitely light coverage so
you know of course we're gonna add
powder and everything else to this look
but you know I just wanted a little
light tinted moisturizer to start my
morning and of course we got the ears we
can never forget the neck now I'm just
gonna take a little Beauty Blender and
just really go over some of these edges
and make sure that I am a hundred
percent happy and I am blended out all
right now for powder we're gonna be
using this full coverage macdaddy artist
couture gold digger powder now this is
amazing these are called diamond glow
powder and I'm just gonna mmm well sneak
peek we're just going to take a little
powder brush and I think this matches my
skin tone mmm yeah pretty close
alright powder is done now let's get to
highlighting and contouring that for
contour we're going to use Mac gold
deposit it is perfect to sculpt those
cheekbones just ever so slightly
you know I got to hide that strong
jawline of mine so I'm just gonna just
create a little bit of an illusion down
here
come on jawline yes now the cheeks you
know depends on how hard you want to cut
a bitch but I'm definitely gonna blend
these cheekbones out just a hair and now
I'm going to use this little drugstore
buffer brush and we're just gonna go
right and blend right into those cheeks
now obviously this was hand done
zorroski crystals so this is actually
not at Walgreens I'm such a shady bitch
I know I'm actually made this for me and
I think it is so cute so I pulled it out
of the archives and I thought it was
very fitting for this little soft
wedding look all right and then of
course we are going to go back in with
the school deposit and just you know hit
that forehead a little bit now as you
guys can see there's like this kind of
new hairline shape here a lot of is
under this hair so if I pull this hair
back I had like a widow's peak so my
hairline was kind of up right so
I know everyone's like bitch where's
that video I promise it's coming in the
next week or two and then I'll never
have these roots again because the
doctor finally okayed me to bleach my
hair thank you Lord so she will be back
to full pink soon all right now let's
get back to this forehead come on now
now it's definitely time to do a little
bit of highlighting so we're just going
to take my skin Frost and shade ice-cold
and we're just gonna highlight the
cheekbones just a hair yes now for added
intensity you can use a setting spray
like the tatcha luminous dewy skin mist
and you can just hit those cheekbones
yes girl mmm and now that the cheekbones
are wetter than in Jacuzzi you can go
right in with that ice cold and there we
go it just gives it a little extra
intensity we're going for that frosty
summer look today then of course you
guys know I gotta hit the end of my nose
as girl yes mmm I feel like Robert De
Niro in casino right now yeah gotta get
that keep his bow and of course the chin
girl
oh come on chin always accentuate your
features and then we'll hit that
forehead right there okay now the under
eyes look I kind of have you know a
little bit of some dark circles so I'm
going to be taking this lit cosmetics
glitter and champagne wishes and we're
just gonna hope and pray it can solve
some of my issues today okay I'm just
gonna take a little bit on my finger and
just hope this works as good as my it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye concealer oh
well look at that darkness just fade
this is so pretty okay come on skin tone
all the way to that
hairline hunting yes alright I am
obsessed with this now let's get to the
eyes now for eyes today I'm just gonna
do a little soft spring moment I'm going
to be using my skin Frost and shade mint
condition and this morphe brush just a
little m4 for one I'm going to take some
mac fix+ and I'm gonna wet the brush and
then we're just gonna one two that's
really all you need I mean good morning
pigment and we're just gonna coat our
entire lids in mint condition huh this
is so pretty if you guys have never
wetted the brush is that the proper trim
wet the brush wedded weather if you've
never wet your brush and dipped into my
highlighters you haven't experienced
that religious moment yet so get up that
bling and spray your brush one two and
you're good mmm
alright now for the inner corner I'm
just going to dip into this a little bit
and just kind of drag a little bit right
in there yes subtlety the mint is
everything this might be my new favorite
look for this coming summer alright now
for my crease I'm gonna be using this
little Mac highlighter this is double
dimension oh come we just talked about
that that glow hmm so I'm just gonna dip
in here and this is a really dark color
highlighter and I'm just gonna place
this in my crease just a little bit just
to get my eye sockets its own little
moment alright now we're going to take
that same brush we use the mint and
we're
just gonna kind of go under our eyes on
the lash line and just kind of smoke it
out all right now just to make the eyes
really pop I'm gonna add in a little bit
of this matte black smolder liner what
what well I think we're getting there I
think we're getting there now I think
before we do some more highlighting lips
we definitely need some lashes sort of
using that flutter lashes style Natalia
these are just you know a little soft
glam and we'll pop these bitches on I'm
gonna quickly coat my lashes in mascara
and this is the Chanel black noir and
let's just do a little slow soft coat
I think lashes are detrimental for this
look so we're gonna go heavy on the
mascara yes come on bottom lashes
 serving serving right now you
know an old trick I used to do back in
the day when I was like really gothic I
would I would take the mascara wand and
I would press it against my under eye so
it kind of gave me the appearance that I
was crying or upset so I'm gonna just
try that right now just kind of stamp it
into my skin yes I saw this in an old
cabinet kuan book and I thought it was
 genius so it's just kind of like
oh I've just had a really long day I'm
feeling like Britney Spears and lucky
and I'm just having a moment all right
you're gonna dip into this ho one more
time oh that noise though we just really
listened to that first again
whoa girl I'm like my own say on a
hustler shoot okay so back to mascara
we're just gonna take this one more time
we're gonna coat the lashes first and
then we're just gonna do lightly little
little press down you can definitely
make this time effects with it or be a
little bitch and knots but I think it's
just you know make it makes you really
feel and get in the mood yes all right
now let's put these lashes on
bubala okay alright lashes are on yes
god oh my god
FaceTime for Manny let's see what it
let's see what he doing girl oh hi I
just you know just doing a little soft
summer look everyone say hi to Manny all
right now we're gonna dip into the Becca
Jacqueline Hill little collab and I'm
just gonna still whole champagne pop and
mix it with pearl and we're gonna hit
them cheekbones one more time honey
because I'm like you know what this is
not enough there we go you see you see
that bitch whoa okay okay okay again
just a little hit the champagne pop and
hit the pearl honey yes and then we'll
just do that one more time and we'll hit
that nose pink ice cold and champagne
pop mixed together I'm like yes all
right
now I think it's only right that we do
the tatcha luminous dewy skin mixed one
more time so let's get our engines ready
and
okay so I don't know what I want to do
for lipstick today I think I want to do
like a pink because this look is so
subtle and soft I really want the lips
to stand out so oh sorry I couldn't
breathe so I think for lips today I'm
just gonna do a little prom night and a
little queen supreme from little jeffree
star cosmetics and let's get to it we're
gonna take the queen supreme and put it
right in the center oh yes come on now
and then you can take your finger you
can take a brash I'm definitely going to
take a little like an eyeshadow brush
I'm just going to blend this out make it
look a little more ombre and you just
want to press up and down until it looks
really blended and pretty and then we're
just going to go in with prom night one
more time just do a little and then
we're just going to do that brush one
more time and just blend out now the
lips are definitely you know just
slightly overdrawn for this look but I
feel like it's important to look like a
boss bitch right now
last but not least I think we definitely
need a little setting spray so let's use
a little makeup forever mist and fix
now while the setting spray is finishing
your you know I just want to take a
little extra highlight like this color
pop one you know you can always do your
cheekbones with one more time because
you know what your highlight could have
faded by the time you get to the setting
spray so let's make sure your makeup is
really really fresh but besides that I
think that this look is complete let's
go to the mall alright you guys this is
the final slay now honestly this might
be my everyday go-to look from now on
I'm just sitting here like yes so I'm
about to go to Walgreens and a bison
makeup for an upcoming video and I'm
gonna leave the house like this and
let's see what happens hopefully no one
you know it gets blinded or hits my car
again was that your soon to make fun of
myself whatever all right guys thank you

fun this is like mmm I don't know I just
