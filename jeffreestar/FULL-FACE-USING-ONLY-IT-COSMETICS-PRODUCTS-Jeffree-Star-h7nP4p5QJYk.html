channel hi today we're gonna try
something new and no I don't mean your
father alright but for real we are about
to dive into something that I didn't
know I was gonna be trying on my channel
but today I'm finally gonna be trying
for the very first time I know when a
brand's been out for 10 years and you're
a little late to the game it but
today we are trying out the brand it
cosmetics for the very first time on my
channel and off-camera I've never used
it before either it's just kind of one
of those brands where it never really
caught my eye it's not something I have
been like dying to try or gravitating to
but I think as time goes on when so many
of you requests like hey can we see you
review the foundation or this infamous
CC cream that everyone's talking about
so I tweeted earlier today asking if you
guys wanted me to do a review I bought a
bunch of stuff on their website and from
Sephora and it all just came in so I
have literally this whole box full of

so we're gonna dive into it all today
but before we even put on any makeup I
have to address the elephant in the room
because when I tweeted about the brand
so many of you are like girl they don't
have any shades so tone it down so when
I went on their website to buy
everything the CC cream had seven shades
and I'm like girl this brand has been
out since 2008 and golf still have only
seven shades unacceptable and then I was
buying it be by bylines foundation and
there was ten eleven shades and I'm like
girl so they definitely need to expand
their shade range I mean they're owned
by L'Oreal now girl L'Oreal you got that
money expand so yeah we're gonna try
everything from the moisturizers to the
brushes to the primers we got the sponge
already wet we have the foundations we
have brushes we have translucent powders
we have blushes illuminizer 's we might
even take a plan B when we're done if
you want to see me try at a brand that
I've never tried before and see the real
unfiltered T then keep on watching my
ignorant really know anything about this
brand I see it online all the time so
I'm doing some research and I was like
is this a drug
to our brand I bet I log in to start
buying everything I go to skincare first
I want to see some moisturizer and I see
the secret sauce there's $68 and I was
like oh no we're not drugstore I like
the little holographic rainbow moment I
think it's very clean it does a pure
kind of doctor and sterile this is heavy
now before I even open it it feels heavy
which I like when you're getting
something for $60 bitch better feel good
all right well let's open this up here
so what is in the secret sauce it is
supposed to keep my skin beautiful its
ultra hydrating it's anti-aging and has
vitamin C hyaluronic acid even licorice
root also is perfect for all skin types
reduces the look of discoloration lines
and wrinkles look up see about that
right now I'm just gonna take this
honestly that's what I would do with if
I had a Beauty Blender this is the it
cosmetics sponge it told me to dampen it
so I did it feels a little more hard and
texture than a Beauty Blender more
almost like I don't know I'm a soft
rubbery type of thing someone's gonna
rub this all over my skin and let it
penetrate all right now just to finish
it I'm gonna take my fingers just so I
can actually feel the product I love
feeling it oh let's just pass them on my
forehead
Pat and rub this feels very hydrating
like you never know what you're gonna
get this almost feels like not greasy
but it feels good like a little tacky
very very like so what are we gonna do
next we're gonna try a primer this is
the bye-bye pores primer love the sound
of that what is it supposed to do you
guys apply over moisturizer underneath
make up for complexion perfection you'll
see powerful results instantly
and over time all right what does the
packaging look like oh okay you get a
lot of product for it your money I guess
let's just take a little bit out oh we
got a pump maybe we got a pump let's
just pump some out right here girl
hi there we go bitch girl math to do its
reporting yo so here's the primer it
looks like lotion honestly oh the more
we start to rabbit it really feels like
primer it feels a little bit like maybe
benefit Porefessional maybe hourglass
veil hmm the texture is definitely
interesting let's put it everywhere girl
 bye bye my entire existence with
this please you can see a little bit of
what they were talking about but um
nothing too crazy yet now here's the
thing you guys we have the CC cream to
try next which I know the whole world
has probably tried this that I haven't
and then we have the bye bye lines
Foundation which is anti-aging skin
smoothing an invisible coverage so I'm
on the fence here of what to try I want
to try a dab of this on maybe the right
side of my face and then fill in the
rest of my face with this just to try
and see it you know this is a try own
video we can mix and match do whatever
we want now this I think I up you
guys because on the website there's
literally seven shades which I didn't
get fair I got light and medium now I
thought light was gonna be light so like
look at that and then you open it uh
whoever designed the packaging it kind
of flopped because these literally look
nothing alike
so I up this looks way too dark
for me you guys look at that you guys
know how it is you can always do a
little bit of something darker and then
once you do concealer or powder or
foundation it can kind of all balance
out so I'm not afraid to try this we
will give it a go but with the by by
lines I bought fair light and medium now
this is supposed to be something where
you apply one to two pumps and it's
supposed to be like hot BAM well we'll
see about that in a second alright so
the CC cream and the foundation are both
$38 that's not that bad you know what
 it we're taking shade light may be
too dark for me but let's give it a go
oh we're gonna go in with this for a
second and see what happens
oh my god so as we're buffing and
blending okay this is I mean this is a
CC cream
like luminosity to it okay yeah CC cream
is definitely not up my alley but let's
let this dry for a second and just see
how it looks I get why a lot of you love
this it's very cute and lightweight you
know I'm a full coverage bitch so I'm
just like okay uh-huh
foundation so I'm gonna go by shade fair
cuz this is a little uh I could make it
work but I want to get the right real
shade for me so we're gonna jump right
in into the by bylines foundation all
this isn't done yet so I'm gonna go for
it guy is ready for it oh oh oh let's
just take this and oh okay
this sponge you guys it's a little hard
like I'm not living for it oh wow okay
this is cute
I'm liking how this is looking not
loving the sponge at all so I'm going to
gonna put this everywhere oh wow bitch
this is full coverage like
all right you guys so this is such a
different feel for me like it doesn't
feel really heavy but you can definitely
kind of like I don't know it's different
that's all that's all I could say right
now oh it's still tacky Gooch of course
we have a lot more makeup to put on I'm
not hating on this yet it's it's here
it's living definitely covered up a lot
of my imperfections it's just a little
dewy for my taste I'm gonna grab my
brush you guys because you wanna know
why I didn't really go down my neck I
was so shook
now we're gonna dive into concealer this
is the famous bye-bye under-eye
concealer this is full coverage
anti-aging and waterproof I'm have to go
swimming and get later okay this
is in shade light ultra fair this better
be light enough bitch I swear to God see
what this wants us to do warm a tiny
amount with fingers tap onto skin and
blend using your favorite cosmetics
brush okay you guys so is this gonna be
a full full mask we'll find out in a
second I mean let's do what they ask
right all right you guys it says warming
up on our finger is this like empty look
you guys I'm like pushing nothing's
coming out yet it says 0.28 fluid ounces
bitch where oh my god so we're gonna
warm this up on our fingers like they
asked oh wow I mean I want more already
mm-hmm
all right you guys let's do the site
first okay okay now is that too much
we'll see in a second let's just kind of
blend in and see how it looks
oh wow this is full bitch now this is
very creamy oh wow looking in the
monitor definitely is brightening all
right I'm gonna put the concealer
directly I swear to god this tube tap
empty y'all look it I'm like squeezing
like this ready for it all the way down
still no product we're halfway down
still no product right there so
literally there's like no product in
here except two right here Katie I'm
just gonna put a little bit on the
actual sponge let's just go right here
and see what happens the sponge actually
blends that out really nicely and it
didn't really pick up anything which is
nice god this site is like hello good
morning all right you guys we are
concealed definitely love
so far the concealer is really pretty
but the foundation I keep going back to
it maybe just because it still looks
like do we and that's just not me I know
a lot of you out there love that finish
but to me I'm not living for it yet but
let's set these under eyes and get the
face snatch so we have two products
today we have the bye-bye pores poreless
finish airbrush powder in translucent
and the component looks like this in
there almost looks like baby yellow but
I think it's definitely translucent so
we're gonna set the concealer with this
alright so we'll just pour some of that
powder in here and then you guys know I
like to take the damp sponge and we will
just press that right where all that
concealer was was or is not was it
didn't go anywhere where it is oh wow
this is like melting I thought we're
gonna be able to see it like a bait but
it literally like evaporated
okay the powder is mad girl look
at my under eye now okay I feel like the
doing acai was not living for is
completely gone when I press this into
the skin is anyone else seeing what I'm
seeing I'm like whoa now we're gonna
take this a little brush right here what
is this this is the heavenly luxe wand
ball powder number eight brush now we're
gonna use the bye bye pores pressed
powder and this is also translucent I
just wanted to see if there was a
difference now it looks like this oh wow
yep it looks like the exact same thing
that is put on my face it opens up and
has a little compact very reminiscent of
Mac Studio Fix so let's just take this
and are we gonna put more powder on our
face I mean I think we should right
everywhere where the concealer wasn't
I'm just gonna kind of press this in
what else did I get you I got the
poreless airbrush illumination I'm just
gonna open all this on camera you guys
this is all new to me does this have
like a pearl to it okay hmm
I'm like we're sticking to this one I
got the your skin but better see see
airbrush perfecting powder here we go oh
wow looks a little dark bitch what the
hell now this is in shade fair I bought
a brush that it says you should use it
with this heavenly skin brush well this
actually looks really pretty and it
feels heavy definitely goes better than
this one but let's just take some how
pigmented are these powders oh okay
let's see this is even gonna match me
all right you guys I look matte like
girl there is no way around it my skin
is like so we are really airbrushed to
perfection I think right now look at me
just putting on more now the next step
what could we do here oh we have
anti-aging radiance cream Luminizer do
we need to try this and of course we
have the ombre radiance blush a lot of
you raved about this so I got a bunch of
colors and also what the hell is all
this you guys confidence in your glow
blush blushing bronzer and we have a
sculpting palette so let's contour and
highlight what does this look like oh
okay so it's literally six powder is
very reminiscent of anastacio Beverly
Hills let's go into soft contour it
looks the one that is the lightest with
cool tone this one looks a little too
warm for me and let's just see how we're
feeling about these powders I'm gonna
take that right into my hairline I'm
gonna stop it there sometimes I go
really far in when I'm just like feeling
myself that baby we're gonna relax today
and I'm gonna actually go in with this
bigger brush here I just kind of sculpt
around my face it's going on really
smooth like usually I would look a
little more streaky but like look at
this alright now I'm gonna take this big
old brush we're gonna go into the same
shade and we're just gonna kind of
sculpt along the jaw I think we need to
take this brush and go into the soft one
again let's take that and kind of go
where brow bone meets into our nose all
right here and just cut that out and
give it a little chisel all right you
guys contour is looking cute now it has
been about 15 minutes and I gotta say
I'm not living for the foundation for
some reason like I know you know like
when you're used to looking a certain
way so you can definitely notice a
difference it just feels like it's like
really gonna dry and that moisturized
there the super what was it called again
y'all the secret not super the secret
sauce was so hydrating I don't know if
it was a primer or what but I'm looking
at a very dry now let's move on to the
blush this is the ombre radiance blush
looks so pretty in the pan I almost
don't want to touch it and I'm just
gonna use a little kabuki brush and this
is in shade coral flesh we're just gonna
go in there
I don't know how pigmented these are and
I don't want to look psycho so let's
just kind of brush that right in there
oh okay I mean I gave off pigment very
quickly all right now we're gonna do a
little highlight this is the hello light
cream you guys know I'm not really into
cream highlighters but let's give it a
whirl
let's just touch this here it has that
kind of balmy creamy texture as you guys
can see right there I'm just gonna use
my finger and just kind of place it
right into my skin for just a little
cream highlighter this is actually
really pretty it looks natural it's not
looking clumpy or weird a lot of times
these cream highlighters just kind of
don't mix with the foundation ick and
kind of pull and just look kind of
draggy but um not drag queen like drag
streaky draggy on the face but Wow
using the finger was sickening and I
going back to the you sculpted palette
this does have a shade that says
radiance highlight how blinding we're
about to find out so I'm gonna use a
little more feet 510 brush right here
and we're just gonna hit that pan a few
times and let's see what happens okay
it's pretty but I feel like it didn't
accelerate that much from having the
cream down like usually I'm like okay
it's getting a little more blinding
let's pack her on a little bit I mean
that's actually pretty cute like that's
actually pretty blinding now what can we
do next
I have this little confidence in your
glow thing another hombre moment and it
does have a kind of a peachy glow right
here which looks pretty right there are
so I could put it I don't want to mess
it up so we're just gonna let's pack
some weight you and how about that oh
yeah now let's go on to brows yes all
right so I have three products here I
have brow powder okay
sorry brow power powder excuse me now
this is an instant Universal brow
perfecting powder for all hair colors it
we gotta have a talk
I have cocaine blonde hair I've had pink
hair for 12 years and I don't know about
it being for all hair colors
I mean Universal so if you have jet
black hair this is gonna work for you is
that their philosophy next we have the
universal brow pencil in Universal taupe
okay then we have the heavenly luxe brow
powder
a brush okay you guys know I had to get
the brush I'm confused one color here is
what this looks like okay let's do a
little swatch right here in my hand
mmm girl that is barely taupe that's
like going on a medium brown I'm sitting
here looking at this color I gotta pull
this out so literally this is supposed
to be for everybody girl so if a brand
is gonna have literally one brow color I
don't want to be dramatic you guys I'm
not into it we're going you guys we have
some eyes and lips to do so I found this
new superhero eye transforming
anti-aging super palette okay now a lot
of you were like girl that eyeshadow
what's the TL knows I have no idea oh
wow okay I actually lived for this
little component it's different than a
normal square palette and you open it up
and okay it looks like this okay these
are gonna be like what we're gonna lay
down the solution I think my lids are
definitely already primed from all that
concealer powder and everything else on
myself so first we're gonna go in with
shade confidence it is this kind of pale
bone color right here we're just gonna
take a brush and go in do we have a lot
of fallout come on let's see she will
just use the mirror right here looks
cute let's press this down I mean okay
not mad at it and we're just gonna take
this up into the brow bone alright so
I'm actually gonna take this brush I'm
gonna dab that color just so it really
blends up and we're just gonna go like
that BAM okay so literally that shade
minus a few over here are the only matte
shades in the palette mmm shimmers girl
shimmers are not gonna really blend into
this crease nicely well we'll see in a
minute and I'm gonna do aura right here
alright we're just gonna take this and
put it right into the crease and let's
see if we're liking this
okay now for a shimmer shade it is going
on it's very soft girl I put on a few
layers it's like kind of I mean it's
there but it's so soft like when I say
pigmented not today honey I mean
honestly this could be a grab on the go
and now I'm gonna take shade powerful
and let's just kind of go right in there
and I literally don't see anything I do
not see much payoff there honey
what the just like tripping me out
now there is this shade unstopable it's
like a gold shade I'm just gonna touch
with my finger and see how it looks okay
it kind of looks like that is it gonna
have any pigment and let's just press it
on where the hell is it
I'm like you got hit some where's the
 big man it's like not even
really transferring from my finger this
is so bizarre I mean it kind of works
there and see me barely move it in gone
okay let's try to proceed let's go in
with daring it appears to be a matte
kind of chocolate brown shade and we'll
just go in there oh wow okay now this
pig man now let's just kind of go right
in here okay you guys can see this one
the match is not too bad oh wow yeah
that works God the other color though
that I apply the first one where the
hell is it okay well at least the matte
one definitely worked and it's in my
crease but the other ones jesus take the
wheel okay
this palette we're gonna have to just
keep it moving it's not working for me
personally so let's move on now a lot of
you really highly recommended this it
super hero elastic stretch volumizing
mascara now when I said that I was gonna
review this brand you all said not you
all most of you guys said that this was
a really good one so let's see a hundred
percent soft fuller lash line we're
gonna see about that
so lash changing power brush wraps every
lash from base to tip oh okay little
genie bottle alrighty now let's see what
the brush looks like that's I'm most
interested on
okay nothing too crazy we've seen a wand
like this before on this channel it
looks something like that
let's just go right in and I'm not even
gonna curl my lashes I want to see what
this does all by itself Wow okay now I'm
gonna do the bottom and then we will
show you guys a real like before and
after I mean when you guys said this
mascara was this I was like okay
well when a lot of people tell me
something works you never know right
it's makeup some things are just not
gonna work for you but bitch y'all did
that alright so let's just show off of
this eye of course this has the full
superhero lash mascara on it and here's
the left side basic pitiful and brittle
Wow
the before-and-after is crazy definitely
I'm a fan of this already let me go
finish the other side and go spill some
more tea alright you guys what else do
we have left we got to do some lips so
we have the hydrating color awakening
lip treatment and then we have a
vitality lip blush hydrating lip gloss
soft satin cool honey my inhaler so what
the hell is this all about you all let's
see I don't even know let's open it it's
like a lip balm my lip treatment feels a
little fresh she feels fresh okay it
leaves a little almost like a little
pink glow just fade on see what happens
now my mouth is dry has foundation all
in it girl I mean this was like lip balm
really and so this is supposed to be
applied directly to lips for a youthful
looking natural flesh of color that
lasts okay so it is giving me a little
flush of color okay I don't mind it
I'm like I'm not disregarding this you
guys are just not for me it's like so
basic okay so this is a hydrating
anti-aging collagen hyaluronic acid lip
gloss with shea butter I'll cut it well
argan oil jojoba antioxidants jesus take
the wheel
alright so it looks like this okay let's
see how it looks on the mouth
oh she's glossy honey oh wow it does
have a little bit of color to it I'm not
mad
the seconds go by it's getting like
warmer like it's definitely what does
this say yeah lip blush I'm like as I'm
talking it's getting Pinker that is so
pretty I'm not mad at it I think it's
really pretty it's very Barbie and doll
like mmm smells got me it's making me
want to like go eat a macaroon or
something all right you guys I can't
believe it but we are basically down to
the finish line and off camera I was
actually trying out this it's your brush
love instant brush cleaner and it really
worked I was cleaning all my brushes I'm
about to hop on a plane and go to Italy
so I had to clean everything and this
actually really worked it's like half
empty because I really went in but I do
recommend this if you just need it quick
brush cleaner this is great but besides
that you guys I don't have a setting
spray which is kind of shocking so if
they do make one I'm so sorry I did not
see it on the website but besides that I
think I still want to set my face so
we're cheating and we're gonna go in
with a little urban decay all nighter
pollution protection all right now it's
time to give my final thoughts all right
so let's go down the line but even
before we do that I'm gonna take this
mirror and I'm gonna look really hard
and close at my skin and see what we're
feeling now right off the bat I do got
to say overall I'm just not living
throughout my skin is looking like I
feel like right here
it's just kind of dry and more cracky
than normal but then in other places
like right here it's so smooth and
airbrush so it's a little bizarre to me
so I'm not like obsessed with my skin
like I wouldn't go oh my god you guys go
out and get this that's like the best
thing on earth I'm not obsessed with it
so besides that the concealer actually
worked really great it was very
hydrating definitely covered up
everything it's not really cracking it's
not creasing at all which is shocking
because I've been filming for a minute
so the concealer I'm like okay I see why
people rave about this it is very full
coverage and it gets the job done now
moving on CC cream obviously I only
tried a little bit like down here and
you know what's crazy no it's the same
I'm just like where the CC cream wasn't
I put foundation over it it kind of
looks better maybe that's why I'm like
living for this right here but going
over here does look the same but still
kind of cracking around their nose it's
just a little not I don't know not
obsessed
alright things that are sticking out
right away mascara like girl that before
and after I was shook when this touched
my lashes so this is gonna go on my trip
with me moving forward what else you
guys the sculpted palette was cute if
you already own something like this you
don't need to have it I mean there's so
many contour pallets out but this
definitely did work the highlight not
really obsessed with it but the cream
highlight was shockingly really good and
I liked it
imagine putting like a blinding powder
highlight on top of this so this could
be a good base if you just want to blame
the world the blush was very pretty a
blush is a blush to me I think that it
was very pretty in the pan I liked
aesthetically looking at it but it
wasn't like wow but it does look very
nice now I know we just put on the gloss
but I love how it looks it's so pretty
it's succulent I like it I don't know
about this you guys I don't know what
this was for me no I know I shaded the
brow products and some of you may be
like girl you should just try it on
anyway it wasn't for me maybe when they
make a lighter shade or a pink one all
hop back on that trend but for now I'm
sticking with Anastacio the moisturizer
cream highlighter concealer gloss and
mascara were it for me
not everything Wow me I think it's kind
of like 50/50 these products are really
good I'm gonna take them in my makeup
bag on my trip and we will play around
with them again some of the stuff that
just was not working for me and remember
I have a complete just normal skin so
some of this could be really good for
oily some of it could be big amazing for
dry but if I have normal skin and I look
a little dry I don't recommend so in the
future I'm gonna go get shade fair and
I'm gonna try a full face of CC this
foundation no baby it also didn't fully
address the superhero Paula
there was nothing super about it
super lackluster come on if you're gonna
really like do a pallet you really need
to like perfect that formula this is
this just not it so the mattes were cute
everything else was a shimmer and it
kind of fluffed for me and I had to
layer and layer and layer and it still
to me doesn't look as a blended as
normal it's a little patchy right you
guys you saw my final thoughts who saw
me apply everything now it's your time
sound off down below let me know what
you think what did you hate what did you
love today was fine if there's other
brands that you guys want to recommend
