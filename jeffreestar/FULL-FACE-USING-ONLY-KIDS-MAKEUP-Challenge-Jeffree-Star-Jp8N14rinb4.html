channel now I've been on the road for a
few weeks on tour and it's really hard
to get Wi-Fi but when I logged in the
other day I saw my girl in
nikkietutorials
Soleil with a new makeup challenge now I
read the title and I'm like both face
using only kids makeup I'm like girl
jesus take the wheel
so of course you guys know that we've
all done that full face highlighters
that went viral and then we did the full
face liquid lip or gold but now I'm
going to be doing the full face using
only kids makeup now I googled kids
makeup on Amazon and all these crazy
things that I have not seen since I was
an infant were popping up on my screen I
mean hi look at the cell phone I'm like
hit me up on the hotline bling' girl
what's the T so I went to Claire's to
find some face makeup eyeliner and
lashes and I actually found a really
good amount of stuff so before we dive
into this you guys I just want to give
everyone an extra big hug through the
screen right now and say thank you for
all the love and support through the
last few weeks as all this crazy shit
has been going down and I also hit two
million subscribers while I was on the
road and it's just been a really crazy
month so thank you guys for being so
supportive and let's dive into this
challenge and have some fun face makeup
oh my god you all know I wear a mask of
foundation concealer and powder so when
I was looking for face makeup I was like
crickets over here but I did find some
cool stuff so at Claire's they had some
BB cream and then they also had a brand
called icing which is kind of like
Claire's and then I also found this
icing BB cream and two way wet and dry
foundation so I have never tried this
before I did not try this prior to
filming this so we're gonna experience
this all together
now this BB cream who knows if it's
gonna be my skin color but we're gonna
just pray and see what happens okay it
looks light so I'm let's just see what
happens
this one though I'm like am I supposed
to shake this I'm scared I can refresh
and conceal sounds like my entire life
okay that wood is definitely darker so
that is this one right here I'm just
going to try the first one first and I'm
gonna use
this foundation brush this says expert
buffer brush okay girl I see you hmm
okay okay doesn't smell as crazy as I
thought it would okay this is a little
pale I'm like come on Casper okay I'm
gonna mix it with this other guy because
this is gonna look crazy so I'm Lily's
gonna take this brush and swirl it
around on my hand and there we go
and this covers away a bigger area so I
think this will definitely work best oh
my god this brush is making this really
blotchy but hey we gonna make this work
okay the more you kind of blend it in it
does does work definitely need a lot
more now I've been traveling so much my
skin doesn't even know what to do
anymore it's like I'm in eighty percent
humidity one day then the desert the
next day I've been in like ten states in
the last two weeks so I'm surprised my
skin is letting all this happen right
now now I gotta say one thing I bought
all the stuff with my own money and I'm
like girl why is this stuff so damn
expensive like this brush alone was 950
I'm like alright girl now on to
concealer there was no concealer sticks
there was no pens there was nothing like
that at Claire's and a lot of stuff is
actually sold out so this one is from
icing it says it's a moisturizing
concealer now the color I'm scared now
this this is a big concealer okay now
I'm scared oh wow okay this is very
yellow toned very warm and I am the
opposite but you know what it's all they
had you guys and sometimes you just got
to make it work
voila we are concealed and I saw this
powder Foundation which I have to cover
my entire face with powder foundation
after I do all this and this one looks
way too dark for me so I'm just going to
put this away
but I found this on the kids section and
I'm like okay girl I've never seen or
heard of this before but let's give it a
whirl so you open it up and it has pep
sticks in a pan blushes face powder
thank God I'm like yes this is exactly
what I was looking for and then you open
it up and it's like voila it has
everything in it I'm like okay but for
now I'm gonna dip into this lightest
shade right here with a bigger powder
brush and let's just pray it works
all right the face is powdered and set
now let's get to contouring nefra
contour I'm gonna be using this big
crazy little palette from icing this has
everything I think you ever need in it
now there was really no contour palette
for kids obviously so I found some
eyeshadows in here and these are contour
colors so I'm just going to give them a
whirl and I'm going to be using this one
of the brushes from Claire's it's the
only one I could find that would
probably really go with these cheekbones
so let's give this all the world
all right we are contoured now for
highlight you know I wish I had a skin
Frost handy but I was looking through
and there was a lot of eye shadows that
are sparkly that I think could
definitely be a highlighter
oh okay glitters now these have blushes
in them so I'm just gonna try some blush
right now while we're here oh this has
go later in the blush you better work oh
well they don't have any color to them
but hey oh no I've seen tiny bit of
coming through now this is very very
soft this is for like the girl next door
alright my blush is a natural
highlighter everybody now in this crazy
beauty book there are eyes shadows and
look at this one this one is like oh
hello that's a highlighter to me there
we go
that's like a ball winding you better
okay alright let's do these brows all
right now for brows I'm gonna be using
this little Claire's angled brush with
this icing palette again now these have
so many eyeshadows I'm sure we're gonna
find is something for my brow color this
little taupe one looks cool let's pray
these have some pigment and let's get to
it
you
all right now for eyes I'm gonna do a
little blue smokey moment in my crease
now these ones let's just see if they
have any pigment these have a lot of
really cute colors so I'm gonna put down
a lighter base and I'm gonna be going in
between that palette and this guy and
let's say if they want to work it
definitely did not get enough brushes so
I am going to be using a few more few
brushes that are very affordable if
you've never used them before and a
let's get started
okay these eyeshadows smell really
strong like oh Lord
alright now I'm gonna be using this
klaris brush and dipping into this
purple now Purple's are really hard to
make so let's see if this one looks like
it on the brush now I'm gonna try one of
these other blue ones and I think if
you're into this challenge you better
show the damn makeup from a brush to I
because I've seen a lot of people do it
this week after Nikki and I'm like hey
this is an interesting color I love it
all right now I'm gonna be using this
guy it's like a dark kind of like
grayish teal and then this black color
and just deepen and darken this crease
out
give me the drama all right now for this
little inner corner part I found these
liquid glitter liners and I want to put
them you know right in here so let's try
them out okay little wand now I'm just
gonna put the glitter right in here the
brush is a really hard I feel like I'm
about to catch my eye out
but the glitter looks cute all right
Claire is I see you definitely have to
dip in like a hundred times to get a
full coat but the glitter is really
really cute now I'm gonna do a little
eyeliner now there was a few pencils I
saw this one is called the extreme black
cream liner with a smudger on the end
okay cool so I'm just gonna use this and
pop this in my waterline oh this is
really pigmented you guys I'm like wow
all right now we're just gonna smudge
out this aligner with this brush that
feels like it's scratching my eyes out
but hey it work is working I'm gonna you
know just do that little effect where it
looks like I've been suckin dick for 20
minutes and my makeup is kind of smeared
this like feels like the felt on a pool
table my eyeball is like before I do my
lashes I'm gonna curl them with this
Claire's little bow Sirah ski yes I just
said faux and see if this will curl my
lashes oh wow that's not bad
now for mascara today I'm going to be
using that icing instinct of volumizing
mascara
now four lashes today I was like are we
gonna find any lashes Clare's has their
own brand and these are called the faux
lash she's a really thick actually I was
surprised so let's think they're gonna
have been on my eyes all right lashes
are done now normally I wear way bigger
pairs but these are actually really cute
let's get on to lips now there was a lot
of lip glosses now I found these guys I
know we have all seen these and I'm like
do these even work I guess we can try
them out together and I also found some
more Claire's glosses and then this one
which I love the pink this is like a lip
duo a lipstick and a lip gloss in one so
I might try this guy first actually but
first of all yellow I had to see what
was up with this one oh my god smells
like bananas like actual like banana
candy that is so crazy does it say that
on here oh my god that is so weird Evan
it's like that old banana candy from
like the 90s I'm gonna use this icing
lip duo cran and gloss and love to the
works okay pink or really streaky and
clumpy but hey I'm all make it work my
god this was like play-doh all right now
let's try the gloss part of this which I
hope works a lot better we always all
have the weirdest smells you guys I'm
like my nose is like oh oh that is
intense okay it shines out how the
texture you guys is like foil that feels
so weird but I gotta say it is a really
shiny all right now for setting spray
there ain't no setting spray for kids so
this look is complete you guys now this
challenge I was like okay I was kind of
scared diving into this but I this is
I'm like kind of speechless I think this
look is very wearable for me it looks
cool now of course my only little notes
are some of the shit has no pigment but
hey what I expect a lot of it actually
did so it was kind of like a 50/50 thing
for me I think you guys should all try
this challenge go to Claire's
grab a few pallets and really try to
create a look out of this I had a lot of
fun creating this look and I want you
