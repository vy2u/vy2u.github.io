goes every channel again listen again if
you didn't read the title already we did
our entire face using only liquid lips
that's it
no no primer no lip gloss no foundation
everything that we do on a daily basis
so we used a lot of people stuff we have
every brand here we just I was loud
obviously this is like definitely a joke
this is not meant to be taken seriously
it's not fun
look at our faces like we knew is not to
be taken seriously what she pulled
inspiration from Amy Masetto here on
YouTube she created this challenge early
full face all liquid lipsticks challenge
so check her out will leave a link down
below yes and she did the look and it
was like I'm like oh my god a week we
didn't totally try to do this we're
gonna kill that I'm gonna kill it
look on her damn face did you see this
right here you see what she did so well
I'm really good you killed it you killed
it but Amy like you know good honestly
this was so hard to do hasn't really tie
was crazy cuz I go so many people
commenting on her video saying like oh
well you didn't do good enough and it's
like it's a challenge it's a challenge
and it's actually a challenge it really
is not like that that's a child like
highlighters was fun highlighters like
we could do that
highlighters is actually way more where
H this is hard I mean obviously liquid
lips are not supposed to be all I do and
quick disclaimer my liquid lips are I
safe I don't know about every other
brand because no one's ever really
claimed it except me so we just did
mainly my stuff around the eye we
dabbled we dabbled so you know hopefully
we don't go by I just got LASIK looks
pretty ways so you guys want to see us
doing the full face of this fucking
liquid lipstick let's just keep
it we're back and we're terrified
terrified I'm so nervous to do this damn
challenge like oh we're so before we've
even started this we've been sitting
here for 15 minutes sweating bullets
thinking how we get it we've been mixing
colors nobody's lying
we're like what are we gonna do but hey
we're here we're gonna try it we're
gonna give this a whirl we're looking
down at about 33 thousand liquid lips
from all all we got everybody ready
there's a lot there's a lot of shit here
what and somehow we are supposed to do
our full face so I guess instead of
crying we're gonna jump right on it
sugar right all right so for primer
we're gonna use an invisible liquid lip
because I'm not right not happening it's
not happening we're just gonna go
barefaced in their face yeah let's do it
what's the first step so we're gonna
obviously foundation honestly like
founding so this is think foundation
colors have like beige a yellow and
sometimes pink undertones a lot of
liquid lipsticks
though oh okay let's dive into this yes
I'm gonna try on a saucy a milkshake I'm
gonna do Jeffy sorry I'm nude and then
are we gonna mix are we just gonna try
it I mean this is not my skin tone no
it's probably obviously it's not so what
are we got somes like white to it that's
one of the order oh thank god I'm the
only American brand to ever make a white
liquid lip and I'm Adam to today so
there's work for you thank you yesterday
I might we just go on our face you
dollar hand hand hands more sanitary way
more sanitary okay so let's just I'm
gonna go right in and then just start
fucking going in ah okay what am i doing
oh I'm I just going in what color is it
oh my I can't use this I'm going okay
you are ready eat sugar lucky oh oh wait
a minute this is my way this is way too
peach for them oh wait you have to blend
out really quickly remember yes there's
something like you can't like you can't
just sit it around on your face like if
we're gonna do this we got to blend
quickly oh my god help me I definitely
picked the wrong color oh we was about
good it's play everybody when I was in
eighth grade I first um got foundation I
was hot orange and my mom was like oh
it's not obvious he had a more slippery
oh you're not
look at me look at me look at my neck
ratio to my to my face
no mine's a Shaughnessy mine's worse
truly my nose actually possible to get
worse than that but I'm not so I think
even more pink that they started with
for those who bordering out there I'm
not like a NW 18 I'm like an NC 25 okay
so what time highlight are we
highlighting for real no we have to we
have to sort of I don't want to go right
in with this bucketing on wanna come in
with the while you ate it great yeah I'm
taking home you can have that oh oh I've
never seen my wrinkles be so bad before
at age 20 years in this fucking the
other boroughs Merril age now we have
the buff before this gets dry oh my god
you're writing out we're using the same
Beauty Blender hmm oh my god
quickly my I forgot that we had a
fucking but first I know okay so if you
can buff quickly but quickly but these
liquid lips do dry obviously most about
what world does use a liquid lip by now
fuck I'm sweating on with the air and I
won't be I may ever look so beautiful
psychotic a my whole line oh my entire
fucking life see what the web with a wet
Beauty blenders not actually Jen's I was
like Oh where's that I don't talk about
until you're contoured no I just thought
it was gonna be a nice color oh you're
just gonna try to blend out some of the
caught in the highlight yeah oh we're
contouring we're contouring up I do only
have one so we're just gonna share okay
this is so freaking dark won't even use
this another up and I can't shot back up
at me look at my shirt my shirts ruined
fake Glock so hard huh that's my face
I'm like Rick getting red for lapis it
wasn't ready
right you know what you got just keep it
buggin guy no fuck this bucket all right
I'm ready to go you guys if you ever
have a mistake just laugh at yourself
before everyone else does that's a
motherfucking secret of life that's true
okay so here's what we're doing
oh you're mixing I'm gonna mix your posh
spice with it just to make it a little
bit lighter ahead of that yeah no I'll
go first I just dumped on your face
basically this bitches
okay so Oh I'm buffing out before it's
too late which but first if you can do
the challenge you better buff first and
then you go on to the next move oh hi
where's the collide look good why does
your the you know why cuz I took mine
and drew it within a line like an idiot
why is my parking cheap look so fucking
car it looks carved mine looks like a
pigeon shit on my face cute
come on dominatrix in posh spice this
side I'm not really sure what happened I
shouldn't have used the end of the
Beautyblender that's probably the
patches thing I've ever seen yeah this
is horrifying
okay so I blend it out a little better
yeah we're getting there oh my god
honestly this could easily be the
hardest challenge I've ever done ever
I would rather fucking eat a jar
horseradish right now well maybe not
let's get flashbacks I know that's like
your five things I've ever experienced
yeah you're right I'm like whoa do you
go a little far on that one
damn I should have just done this and so
it had hair surgery mm-hmm
I have never been this patchy before I'm
not even gonna contour my nose because I
will ruin myself
okay so what's after highlighting
contour death at this point um obviously
went to the butcher Pilate I'll finish
the things you do a little bit of blush
okay let me try it is there's a little
bit of shimmer though so this is the
Sephora what is this
there's no name number 8 great this is a
liquid lipstick and these are really
dope actually look where's I'm gonna
taking this is where one Jim number site
a fam I have another Beauty Blender but
doesn't have brown on it I think I'm
gonna use just a plain one we have like
four beauty blenders I am I usually
using the same one that's why I would
look in the report fine maybe the what
the fuck are you doing okay ready oh
listen smell like vanilla I wish to make
my face more pink than it already this
is cute look let's look you just slap me
my fucking face the blush look she looks
really pretty on you I'm adding more
blush on mine yeah I don't mind me I'm
think is hell at this point but more
Justin hmmm okay I'll be highlighting
yes yes we are
this was a challenge this lashline
really really worth applying because
Jeffrey doesn't have a lot of I don't
have metallic metallic like we pulled
out the Milani when I used before and
we're like it's too dark too dark for
the cheeks yeah and then the Oprah ones
I don't have that he doesn't have any
like the shimmery one so private
hey she don't she doesn't how about a
Greenwood but we do have a look lip I'm
coming out with like yes end of summer
maybe August September I don't fucking
know that you talked about critical time
we chose it and then I you know might
happen so this is like a metallic peach
let's try it let's try that one let me
at this point we don't really have a lot
of options here I almost kept on the
background same just gonna take this on
the video Beauty women yeah and then I'm
just gonna put it on Oh how's it look
it's Q see that there it's the thing is
I think everything's gonna be too dark
and let's and silver for me a little
dark but when I skewed you're working is
cute this kids cute okay okay it's not
that bad don't let on it's really nice
what if when you blend in you're like
she's almost like the NARS orgasm times
two it is it really is a put on center
my nose too yeah I think adding the
extra little highlight on top made a
difference dude look at that
okay well I'm trying I thought we're
gonna be so much better at this honestly
I really thought about this we're gonna
say that
this is so hard this is so hard I'm hard
we had more over lipsticks I think would
have been easier good really creamy I
mean let any liquid lip is not meant it
just not submit every but that's why
this is why this is called Chama
challenge okay challenge I'm seven um
now where do the brows oh but you don't
have it I would rather walk on glass
rocking blast with flames mmm
oh that's sick I just like it okay I'm
gonna be was a little Jeffrey Stehr more
for you wanna collab coming soon I want
look at that case will you guys it's so
cute really okay let's just go in okay
I'm gonna you slippery skin I'm so
scared
we're just gonna go straight to brush oh
I wish I obviously just comb this
through oh my god oh my age is the most
blocky Brown I've ever seen
oh my god Mike's not turning out bad
it's not it's actually really cute
honestly oh my okay brows

I'm assuming I could work with a very
are you really yeah that oh I see where
you're going with that
like you know I'm just gonna blend it
and create like a little cut crease
intense cut moment though realness the
realness oh I don't have anything to

Beauty Blender and pray for the best
huh it's like a drag queen at this point
I love it bring it on we're drag queens
right now fully blue is like electric no
everybody are we freaking out I might a
country so this is androgyny and that's
something I'm gonna put a little bit of
belt parts in the beginning of it to

off I know a lot of people on IG always
say they use my black one weirdo for
liner and I've done it a few times
actually stays in the waterline really
good too so I'm just gonna do a little
bit of liner and see what happens
just see what means so crazy this is
this liner is a little interesting it's
uh what I would call hideous but you
know what it's okay you know what this
challenge is a work of art and it's fun

matters we really we were really trying
I'm just honestly just trying to make
this work but I'm just trying to get
through the night right now this is just
what are you putting on your leg I'm
gonna add some of you a yes praline on
the beginning part of my eye just give
me more of a shine and dimension

I was buying my Lamborghini asked the
guy if I could use Manny's code and it
worked
there's a fucking she how do you have
that many down but the best part about
whoo I'm shopping is that um like Prada
doesn't accept Maggie's code but Chanel

setting spray do you Jews Hennings
Brenda's John I mean we can do what we
should do it just grab all your liquid
lipsticks okay take them off and just
are looking any closed spaces sounds
great

and pour into a bottle of this record

I ever tried makeup in eighth grade
don't mean to a hundred percent this is
worse than the makeup I've ever this is
one thing I've ever done but hold on you
honestly Julie huh
when I started to make up when I was in
my room just locking the doors nothing
but myself just giving an oral worse
worse than that worse um okay we are
done with this challenge I can't believe

the commenter bashing her it were so
rude they were they were really rude and
they're so rude a lot of people were
just going in it is really hard liquid

blended anywhere like this it was way
more challenging that I thought was wait

gonna be you guys need to try it
