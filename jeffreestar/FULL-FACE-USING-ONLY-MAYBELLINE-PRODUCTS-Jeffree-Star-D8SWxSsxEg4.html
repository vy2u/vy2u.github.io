channel today we are going to do a full
face using only Maybelline drugstore
makeup now of course you guys all saw my
crazy asshole from Ulta from earlier
this week so of course you guys voted
you guys request it and here it is and
this is kind of first impression too
because literally actually zero products
oh no one sorry I've used one product
from this entire crazy haul the rest I
have never even tried before so this is
definitely going to be a first
impressions and a full face of a
Maybelline I have always kind of like
shied away from drugstore makeup on my
channel you guys know the luxury
bougie-ass bitch and that's my lane and
I like to stay in it but the drugstore
brands are coming so hard for the luxury
brands and they keep on upping their
formulas and just really proving me
wrong I've been very impressed with a
lot of stuff lately so we are going to
do a makeup tutorial a little soft
I love glam the right word maybe a
little soft summer little moment I don't
know what we're going to call this look
but I guess we'll find out in a minute
so if you want to see me play around
with new makeup and keep on watching all
right you guys if you didn't see my haul
I will link it down below but I got so
many products now there's nemeth
drugstore and Maybelline who has been
around for a long time there's so many
formulas so it's like okay when I went
to go look for foundations you guys I'm
gonna be really real with you it was
overwhelming I'm not gonna forget my bag
there is so there was just so many
different formulas I really didn't know
what to try I'll be honest I got the
dream velvet I got the dream liquid
mousse of course you guys all told me to
get the matte poreless fit me foundation
so I don't know even what to do here I
looked at all the formulas and even
though so many people requested for me
to use this one I think the dream mousse
is calling my name the liquid because it
says airbrush finish right here and I'm
like oh I mean that's my goal in life of
course we got a primer skin first so
let's put that down now Maybelline does
have a few primers we have the baby skin
and a lot
said that one is alright but the master
prime which was a blur and smoothing was
better so I'm going to leave it up to
you guys to not steer me in the wrong
direction we're gonna have a problem so
let's see what she looks like
doesn't really you have that much of a
fragrance which you know I just smell
everything about ok we're down all right
let's let that dry for a second and see
what happens
I don't think maybe makes brushes if
they do end so sorry I did not see any
of them at Ulta but I'm just going to
use everything that I normally use brush
wise I don't really think it affects the
application of makeup honestly I'm going
to just take classic ivory right over
here I don't know what this is supposed
to do obviously we're just going to go
in and see what the hell happened
alright now I'm going to go in with
shade 10 which would be porcelain and
I'm going to take this and dot it all
over my forehead and under the eye area
and then we're just going to blend it
out all right I'm like shocked at how
much I like the foundation let's see how
it lasts and how other products go on
top of it
so before concealer of you guys all said
please get the instant age rewind so of
course I got it now I don't know if this
is going to be light enough for me I got
a few shades this one is the lightest
shade okay so a little dome thing comes
off it looks like a little oh wow okay I
guess you of course wind her up oh wait
I think I see some products finally
coming out there we go mom concealer I
swear to lower all right let's see if
this is even light enough for me oh wow
okay I don't know how you're supposed to
do this I'm looking like dot it on like
I normally would do oh my god work or
just exit right on our chin this is what
the tip is really soft I'm not used to
soft tips but hey all right now normally
I would take a Beauty Blender and buff
out my concealer so let's see if this
wants to work with this
Oh
Wow okay guys I am once again
shocked at how like amazing this is
blending out now laura-leigh did mention
this was kind of like shape shape and
then Manny was like girl that's not my
favorite I like one other other
concealers better so I had like both
opinions for my friends but I'm like
okay well they have such different skin
types I want to help I'm going to love
it and I'm like its blending out to
perfection it's drying amazing it's not
Creasy it's not weird it didn't make the
foundation weird which sometimes that
does happen things don't always like to
go together well but it's just like all
right come on Maybelline all right I
know they have a setting powder so let
me find that we have the master fix
setting and perfecting loose powder so
I'm going to of course take my damn
Beauty Blender and just dip in there
like I normally would and here we go
Oh me
all right concealer is set and I will
say this that setting powder okay I see
you all right now that that is done I
want to set my entire face with a coarse
powder foundation which I have been
doing since the dawn of time now I don't
know what to use because there is a fit
knee set and smooth powder which looks
something like this or we have the
better skin skin transforming powder and
it says it's a super stay so that speaks
to me a little bit more so this is a
cool flat dome brush and it's going to
go in here oh come on now and let's see
what happens here
all right the entire face is set it is
looking really airbrush and really
pretty so now let's move on to contour
and now ie this is the only product that
I used before if you go all the way back
to my channel one of my first few videos
ever it's just called drugstore makeup
tutorial I think and I used this master
contour face contouring kit now this one
is the Accord light to medium and I am
just going to use that contour shade I
already got a different blush so I'm
going to stay away from that but I think
the contour one is going to be pretty
nice so let me grab a brush and let's go
oh wow okay come on pigment
are you alright and now we are going to
do some blush now I'm kind of feeling
this one is called a medium quarrel it's
from the fitnah collection and a lot of
savory stuff I'm going to assume this
one is just a normal blush and it opens
up black this one's going to take a
little Mac blush brush and let's see if
this is going to look it on me okay
love the color of this really pretty all
right now if they didn't have any crazy
metallic bonding highlighters like
powder that I saw if I missed it oh my
god I'm going to be so pissed off but I
did find the master strobing liquid
illuminating highlighter and they have
the same thing in a stick so it's a
strobing stick probably the same formula
but this isn't more of a bomb type of
formula excuse my hands I've been
watching things all morning in a lab
let's just put this there and see what
oh wow
I mean it's pretty blinding it looks
like a Memphian mirror let me try this
first this reminded me of like a coverfx
drop I'm just going to put some on my
hand here just saw those dulles if you
will and then we're going to take this
Beauty Blender and we're just going to
we're just going to buff them on our
cheeks and it works
alright now this shit dries quickly on
the skin it's a little streaky but hey I
didn't know it dry that quickly so it
doesn't look awful it's really pretty so
we're using liquid highlighters you guys
normally and not my style taking a
little bit longer to finesse into the
skin obviously I have layers and layers
of foundation and powder on top so cute
alright now for brows listen now for
people that have hair there's a brow gel
there is a lot of other products to use
but for people that have zero hair it's
a little more tricky so I found the
definer brow in shade medium brown looks
like this as a tiny little comb which I
won't be needing it is very thin it
reminds me of like a Mac eyeliner pencil
as well now usually I put powder or
dipbrow types of products like pomade
over this didn't really have any so I
might use powders but we'll see in a
second so and we hold my breath and
stammers work
I'll lower these brows have been trying
me you guys now I don't know what it is
is all these crazy lights but sometimes
the Browns do not want to play when I am
by myself I swear to god they're fucking
twins today I don't know
now this pencil has a lot of pigment
it's really tiny so how do I go back and
forth a lot obviously this is for people
that have real hair and you can really
go in and define a brow when you start
from nothing it is a little more tricky
alright now I'm going to take some of
this contour powder and just kind of run
it through the brows and it is a little
lighter which I don't really mind but
we're just gonna kind of custom crater
on little shade all right these brows
are as good as they're gonna get I'm not
in love with them but it's all good okay
time for the eyes and now for eyeshadow
maybe they have a lid primer and I
definitely did not see that but I
grabbed a lot of eye stuff something
that I tried on the haul was these eye
Chrome's
and they stayed on my hand for a minute
it was kind of hard to rub off so we're
going to try this guy today what is this
shade called beige luster okay we're
gonna try this one and then we got some
of the tattoo color 24-hour eye creams I
think their eyes shadows their thing so
maybe we'll incorporate that in there if
you can't and I grab some palette Laura
Lee recommended the 24k nudes and then I
grabbed one called the graffiti nude and
this looks like something like this now
I don't have a lid primer which is scary
not that I really need one back in the
day before they had 20,000 primers in
Sephora i used a shadow or foundation so
my lids are already primed with the
foundation from earlier so i ain't too
worried about it
alright i'm going to take this kind of
like banana pale ivory color right here
let's see what happens expand our small
but pay the brush fits in there so
what's going to dust this all over from
brow bone to lid and give myself a
little highlight under the brow i really
want to use this one all over the lid
this is just called eye chrome now this
did not come off my hand so let's see
how it looks
on Milan
okay I'm not mad at this it's a little
harsh right here I do want to blend it
out
I'm just going to brush with literally
no product so it doesn't get crazy and
let's see if it wants to blend oh yes it
definitely does come on here all right
now I'm going to go into this frosty
dark brown inch color I'm going to take
this and just kind of put it right over
that and just kind of define it more all
right
I'm kind of liking this so far hmm now I
do want to play with one of these color
tattoos hmm
so let me find where that pale one go
here we go so this one is called too
cool and it looks something like this
I'm just going to grab a little
synthetic brush see what happens in here
all right I mean it has pigment on the
brush so I'm going to take this right in
my tear duct to my inner corner not tear
duct sorry in a corner near the tear
duct and I just kind of illuminate that
in a corner how many times am I going to
say in recorder then kick it out a
little more a little more drama all
right that inner corner is a look-in I
see I'm living for it now I'm gonna take
a little shader brush and what are we
gonna do here mmm I don't know what I
want to do for under I'm just wanting to
do this little greenish like dark color
right here let's just do a little bit of
that on the brush let's see what it
looks like
I was hoping that would look more green
it literally looks like my lid color no
kinda I don't mind monochromatic but I
really thought it was going to be like
gir raining I mean look at my color it's
like a greenish hue but it's showing up
literally like that one
all right the eyes are looking smoky um
I like how this is turning out the
eyeshadows were not like the best thing
on earth you guys honestly palettes for
me I like something that is so easy to
blend full fucking pigment this one not
loving it the liquids though in the
cream like these guys were amazing now
we are going to do eyeliner now I got
this little one called at the paradise
skinny it's like a gel I guess cran
liner very thin like the brow and then
also there's this big one called color
tattoo 24-hour I'm going to try this I
know it looks a little big but hey I've
never been into my science before okay
that is not bad now this shade is called
audacious asphalt and I guess I mean it
looks like pure black to me it doesn't
look gray really and I mean it's this
eyeliner at work alright now for mascara
we are going to go in with the colossal
bigshot volume express mascara I love
this gold components now the wand looks
something like this and let's see how it
looks on these lashes
all right mascara is done I love the
bottom lashes obviously I don't really
wear bottom falsies a lot and the bottom
ones are like banging so okay big shot I
see you alright you guys we are almost
to the finish line now I don't want to
do any false lashes I don't know if
maybe we have lashes I saw none on the
display and the main drugstore looks for
me are always mascara friendly now I do
want to do of course a lip so let's do a
lip liner this is in shade totally
toffee and then we're going to compare
up with a nude lip oh my god I got
literally every nude on the back and I
think I'm going to do 535 purely nude
we'll try that out and see if I can look
like a porn star alright you guys my
wrist hurts this lip liner I don't like
how the limit is at the tip it's a
little hard to like really do it fast
like a Mac lip liner is like way easier
and thicker it's what I'm used to so I'm
lines over here like girl I'm gonna get
carpal tunnel the shade though is really
pretty I'm just like hot Samantha look a
lot of work for a liner all right now
let's take P early media lipstick it's
going to be too light we'll see in a
second oh my god yes like my 90s nude
lips fantasy and then of course to blend
it all out we're going to go back and
with the lip liner so we'd almost like a
crazy person you don't want to do this
new SS you definitely don't have to I
love this looks very ombre but this line
of a girl alright the last step you guys
is of course setting spray and I found
the master fix we're boosting spray is
supposed to lock in makeup and have a
long-lasting finish so are we supposed
to shake this
helps prevent makeup melting and color
fading application shake well that's all
I needed to hear
avoid spraying directly into eyes and
lips don't they need mouth I mean let's
see what happens
oh it comes out you guys look at my
mirror it's like raining on it
okay come on face oh my face I don't
look wet though which I'm kind of
shocked like usually like with a mac six
plus you can see it let's go back I
might want some more all right
this look is complete alright you guys
this is of course what we created with
all of the Maybelline products and now I
will say this I'm shocked in the best
way possible because I'm going to give
these products now obviously I have not
tried the full entire line but from what
I tried today most of it was actually
amazing so we've been sitting here on
camera now what you guys been watching
this for what 10 to 15 minutes but um
you know on the other end I've been here
for about an hour you know I could take
a smoke break I took a drink break
Code Red Mountain Dew I swear to God and
let me just go from start to finish let
me just say this the primer I think was
actually amazing bitch what pours that
might be one of my favorite things from
this look because my skin I love how it
looks I'm looking the mirror I love it I
think the contour powder was great
highlight was patchy I'm not living for
I think the more they look like came
together it's looking nice definitely
does not come off the eyeshadow I think
was really cute only thing I did not
love was the brow pencil I wish I would
have gotten a lighter shade it was a
little harsh for me I don't mind it now
that everything's done in the eyes are
smoky but I wish I would have gotten a
lighter shade or maybe a pink lipliner
for fun now I will say this the mascara
was good the lipliner
I really didn't like that that might I
don't know why that's like my least
favorite thing I just don't like how
small it was and I got kind of weird
down here like dark and not blending the
actual lipsticks themselves i swatched
more off camera on my hand they are
creamy and amazing and I love how this
look I think it turned out really cool
so is jeffree star approving maybelline
i am so this tutorial was really fun to
do also the blush was really key to me
my eye stuff was great so the only thing
that was a flop for me really was the
shadow palette i think they could
definitely work on those but most of the
stuff was banging and I'm a little shook
by it I will say that I'm always shocked
when when drugstore stuff comes through
cuz I've had a lot of bad experiences in
the past but Maybelline I see you girl
now I will say this the lip liner didn't
love it and maybe they have another
formula I will try that later but um it
was not for me but everything else came
together amazing I like so can't get
over the foundation I'm like what the
fuck is in this I'm gonna go google the
ingredients later because I'm like
really surprised and I can't wait to
wear it again so thank you guys so much
